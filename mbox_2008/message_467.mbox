Namaste Sir
what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous
but i h=
ave some small doubts


Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a=
 guru
how can they chooose a particular form of GOD
bcoz in second part of =
AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity
is very important, as the anal=
ogy he gave of a person 
who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase =
his greed

One thing more
we have so many deities  that on diwali i would l=
ike to worship 
Lakshmi and Kali
in navaratri (nowadays) we would worship D=
urga
on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA
an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIV=
A
like this
with hte change in festival the deity changes

though everybody=
 knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get 
out of this
mould and if=
 i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become 
angry

I Know,this=
 is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind

One thing more

=
Suppose if i choose a deity and something wrong happens
(materiallistically=
)

what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my 
DEBTS/W=
RONG DEEDS
or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I  am not fi=
t 
for that DEITY



and sometimes you feel 
o what am i doing does this re=
ally works


and one thing more

what if we go on doing our pooja and somed=
ay 
something like what happened to Pt. GOPI KRISHNA JI
happens to us also
=
though he says in his book that he read a lot about yoga
and stuff like thi=
s

At any stage i do not want you people to get offended 
but these are my =
doubts which are there in my mind

i will not say much now bcoz in 
Swami S=
ivananda's KUNDALINI YOGA on the last page he says

"the shastras are endle=
ss and there is so much to be known 
turn the gaze. draw the indriyas.still=
 the mind.then
dive deep into the divine source and realise the infinite bl=
iss"




******************************************************************=
***
*
i ll give one small personal example here

around 26 or 27 dec.2007 i=
 started chanting 2 mantras (one kar mala 
each) 
in morning and evening
an=
d on 9 january 2008 my parents met an accident
though my father suffered sm=
all injuries my mother suffred fracture 
in shoulder and Leg

and she is st=
ill undergoing treatment and will have to 
undergo one more operation in th=
is month

and in February and March i got placement in 
2 companies (i m do=
ing MCA in india) where most of my friends have 
not 
even got one and let =
me tell you i m not very intelligent

so sometimes even now i consider whet=
her my choosen deity is correct 
or not

so everyday in the end of my pooja=
 what i ask GOD is 
to help me find the right path
