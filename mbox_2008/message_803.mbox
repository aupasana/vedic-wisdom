On 26 November 1935, Swami Vijnanananda said to the devotees in 
Barisal (=
which is now in Bangladesh): "This time the Master came 
secretly. He will =
come again after one hundred years in the 
northwest direction."
A Devotee:=
 "Did the Master say that he would be born in the Punjab?"
Vijnanananda: "N=
o, the Master did not say that he would be born in 
the Punjab." 
Swami Abh=
edananda recalled: "One evening Sri Ramakrishna was 
attended by his faithf=
ul attendants Shashi [Ramakrishnananda] and 
Kali [Abhedananda], who were w=
aiting upon him at Cossipore. The 
Master inspired them by saying: 'My Divi=
ne Mother has shown me that 
the photograph of this body will be kept upon =
altars and be 
worshipped in different houses as the pictures of other avat=
ars are 
worshipped. My Divine Mother has also shown me that I shall have t=
o 
come back again and that my next incarnation will be in the West.'" 

!.=
...!....!
On different occasions the Holy Mother made various statements ab=
out 
the Master's return. Once she recalled: "The Master said he would 
com=
e again after a hundred years. Meanwhile, for those hundred years 
he would=
 live in the hearts of those who love him. Standing on the 
semicircular ve=
randa of Dakshineswar, the Master said this, pointing 
towards the northwes=
t. I told him I could not come again. Lakshmi 
also said she would not come=
 again, even if she were chopped into 
shreds like tobacco leaves! The Mast=
er laughed and said: 'How can 
you avoid coming? Our roots are twined toget=
her like the kalmi 
plant. Pull one stem and the whole clump comes forward.=
'"  
The Holy Mother also stated: "The Master said that he would dwell in 
=
the hearts of his devotees for a hundred years in his subtle body. 
He furt=
her said that he would have many devotees among the white 
people." 
Swami =
Saradananda wrote on this subject in Sri Ramakrishna and His 
Divine Play: =
"The Master not only knew this about himself through 
his yogic insight, bu=
t he also told us many times, pointing to the 
northwest, that the next tim=
e he would reincarnate there. Some of us 
(Girish Chandra Ghosh and others)=
 said that the Master even told 
them the time of his advent, stating: 'I s=
hall have to be born in 
that direction after two hundred years. Then many =
will be liberated, 
and those who fail at that time will have to wait a lon=
g time for 
liberation.'" 
!....!....!
Ramakrishna's niece Lakshmi said: "T=
he Master said, 'I shall come 
back after 100 years.' I can't definitely sa=
y whether that year 
should be counted from his birth, or death, or on the =
day when he 
said it."
