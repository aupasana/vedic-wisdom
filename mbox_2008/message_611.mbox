Namaste Nalini ji,
 
Most people do not experience a mantra. They just mech=
anically chant it and nothing happens. What you described tells me that you=
 were able to experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign.
 
T=
hough I have never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, I would im=
agine that this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.
 
Different mantr=
as, when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle channel of ene=
rgy flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of a different "ex=
perience" to "self". Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe) are extremely=
 cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some mantras (e.g. Sav=
itri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.
 
When merely some vaay=
u (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some experience. When the =
entire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters a nadi, it is a very=
 powerful experience and one's perception of self alters drastically.
 
The=
re are thousands of nadis in the body and thousands of possible experiences=
. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experience. Mystical experiences a=
re signs of spiritual progress, but they are also traps where we can get st=
uck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much about the experience. In=
 a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive various objects of the ex=
ternal world. We know that all that is just superficial and the reality wit=
hin all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to senses. Similarly, whate=
ver our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. vision of a being, sound of a=
 mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one etc) in an intense meditat=
ion session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less superficial than the o=
bjects we see in the external world usually) and the reality within those e=
xperiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when you transcend the superf=
icial sense experiences.
 
While it is difficult, the right thing to do whe=
n you feel like you described is to ignore it and keep the intense mental f=
ocus on the mantra or on the deity. The good thing is that your experience =
is a sign of spiritual progress and the bad thing is that it can distract y=
ou from the final goal.
 
Feeling hot while and *after* meditation and figh=
ting are signs of some diturbation in the pingala nadi. When the correspond=
ing karmas are flushed out of the system, things may be fine.
 
I am not re=
ally knowledgeable. With my guru's blessings, I have experienced some thing=
s and realized some things. Then he told me to not hold back and boldly dec=
lare answers to questions on spirituality and religion as if I just know. I=
 just follow his word and do as he said. It is upto my guru and the Mother =
to impregnate my words with meaning as they are received by people. From my=
 end, I just type out whatever comes to my mind...
 
Best regards,
Narasimh=

        Dear Nalini

        Sorry for =
interrupting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a simil=
ar incident. I have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had =
recieved in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, na=
ked, come and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl)=
 was, the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even under=
stand Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then =
after some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a ma=
ntra in her ears.

        From next day morning my friend started chanting=
 that mantra, after about one and half years of chanting recently she did a=
 sankalpa for chanting and had experinces similar to the kind u described. =
She felt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. =
Her relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..=


        Later after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way =
the karmas are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tel=
l you better. He much more knowledgeable in  these things.

          Dear All,
          Namaskar.

          Yes, indeed.
    =
      I had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasimha garu. I recited Sree Han=
umathbadabanala stotram some time back. I had an unusual experience of 'bei=
ng on fire', during the initial stages. It was as if I was engulfed in a ba=
ll of fire, which slowly receded over time. I had a similar experience duri=
ng the Navaratri puja when reciting
          Devi kavacham. I still have t=
hat feeling of an aura of fire around me and feel extremely hot and sweat e=
ven in the cold weather. This stays on for a time. I also had to face extre=
me circumstances in 'relationships' that matter to me and there is a steady=
 deterioration, almost as if a heavy veil has been torn asunder. 
         =
 I vaguely remember Narasimha ji telling us in some forum that there might =
be some ramifications relating to karma that could manifest when/ after sad=
hana/worship.
          Could you please clarify, Narasimha garu?

        =
  Regards
          Nalini

Guys,

                  I am glad everything is sorted out. But, in genera=
l, let us be less 
                  defensive and instead focus on subject=
. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
                  exactly what he meant. H=
owever, even if Ajit or someone actually said 
                  something =
negative about me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and 
           =
       words, good or bad, do not change that, for better or worse. Why be =

                  sensitive to words then?

                  Ajit, you ar=
e certainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that you have 
         =
         tremendous scholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far l=
ess 
                  qualified than you talk/write so much in today's wor=
ld. Please do write 
                  more.

                  The imagery=
 thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!

         =
         Friends,

                  Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcame=
 lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
                  self-control.

  =
                Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hris=
hika + isha =3D 
                  lord of senses). He can be worshipped fo=
r control over senses.

                  Mother Kaali gives dispassion and=
 kills the root of desires. She can be 
                  worshipped for ge=
tting rid of desires.

                  Several things are possible. But, =
for most people in today's times, it is 
                  not going to be =
one magic bullet that does it, but a combination of various 
              =
    practices. Patience is needed.

                  Try to increase the u=
nderstanding of what is permanent and what is 
                  transient.=

        <DIV>Sorry for interrupting in your question to Narasimha.You=
r mail 
        reminded me of a similar incident. I have a friend who=
 does very 
        severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. It=
 was a strange 
        dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and =
sit on her lap and 
        when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was,=
 the reply came in 
        sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even u=
nderstand Sanskrit, so 
        she could not understand what the girl was =
saying. Then after some time 
        the girl in the dream kept repeating =
what sounded like a mantra in her 
        ears.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT f=
ace=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>From next day morning=
 my friend started chanting that mantra, after 
        about one and half =
years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for 
        chanting and had=
 experinces similar to the kind u described. She felt 
        her whole bo=
dy was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her 
        relation=
 with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights 
        etc..</D=

        <DIV> </DIV>
        <DIV>Later after some days it reduced=
 again. I think this maybe a way
