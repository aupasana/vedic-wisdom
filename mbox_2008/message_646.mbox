Dear Kumar

If you liked this book then I recommend you please read some
bo=
oks by Shivom Tirth Maharaj too.

His book "Churning of Heart", there are 3=
 volumes and they are very
good books that decribe the biography of the lin=
eage and Kundalini
Shakti. Very well written and very simple. If you are lo=
cated in US
than you can get it from Amazon.com.

If you need information a=
bout India than I can try to get the address
and phone number etc.

Best Re=
gards
Mitesh
