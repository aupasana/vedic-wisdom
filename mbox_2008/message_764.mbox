Namaste............

I had been reciting Chandi Path not every day but on a=
shtami or
navami and while reciting a brilliant blue light would appear in =
the
text. During the chapter where Kalika comes out of the third eye a
gold=
en light with red aura would appear. I was not reciting every
day, however =
these lights would appear during my daily routines,
work, interactions with=
 others, etc, as if Mother was reminding me of
her presence in all my daily=
 affairs.

How could I be such a dunce so as to get involved with so many o=
ther
mantras and dilute the pure shakti that comes as a result of reciting
=
Chandi?

I have been following these mails and I feel grateful to you
gentl=
emen for your faith and wisdom.

Warm Regards.................Ajaya
