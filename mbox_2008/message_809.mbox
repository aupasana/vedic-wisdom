When time comes, those early works need to be discredited thoroughly and H=
indu consciousness needs to be awakened.

Yes Sir, very well said. I =
and a lot of people like me feel pained when we see our religion and cultur=
e being disrespected, discredited and trivialized by others for unscrupulou=
s reasons. Specially the left leaning pseudo-secular "intellectuals".

The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste=
,

I am in North Carolina right now, with limited internet connectivity. I =
will write more later. But the funny thing is that this is exactly the topi=
c of a project on which Manish and I worked during our India trip in last s=
ummer. Manish is busy working on wrapping this project up.

But the problem is that modern Indologists do not acc=
epe that Vyasa lived 5000 years back and he wrote Mahabharata. They think t=
hat Mahabharata was put together in 500 BC - 500 AD timeframe! If astronomy=
 proves that the positions given MB really happened 5000 years back and if =
that strongly suggests that a person having the ability to observe planets =
actually wrote MB 5000 years back, it is a very big jolt to the standard vi=
ews of Indologists.

Defensive and diffident attitude of Hindu historians a=
nd their reluctance to view Hindu historical texts as history stems from co=
ncerted efforts by biased European Indologists from old times. When time co=
mes, those early works need to be discredited thoroughly and Hindu consciou=
sness needs to be awakened.

I will write more later.

Best regards,
