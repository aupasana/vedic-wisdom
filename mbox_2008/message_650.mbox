Rajarshi Ji,
=C2=A0
Thank you for sharing this. Because of the number 16, I=
 assumed it is related to moon phases and totally forgot that kala also mea=
ns art.
=C2=A0
I'm not sure if the 64 arts that you mentioned are the norma=
l 64 arts mentioned in our books like singing etc or some special spiritual=
 arts. It is quite surpising to know that even a God can't be a master of t=
hese arts when he is in the physical plane.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
>> While talking =
about this, he was also trying to explain to me how these kalas interact >>=
 with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree should each tattwa interact=
 with a person >> in his system for him to be able to gain mastery of any p=
articular of these 64 kalas.
=C2=A0
This is interesting. If you have some m=
ore details on this, can you please let us know. ?
=C2=A0
Thanks and Regard=
s,
Ramakrishna

Dear Ramakrishnaji
=C2=A0
I had once met a very genuine sadhak fo=
r whom I have a huge amount of respect. This person was telling me about th=
e 64 kalas. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, =
but let me try and reproduce whatever I could understand.
=C2=A0
He showed =
me an old diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a cen=
tre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of =
the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" placed at various pla=
ces on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. 
He said these 64 represent=
 64 different kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born i=
n this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of the=
se Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this phy=
sical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purn=
a avatar.
=C2=A0
Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain ma=
stery of one more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going in=
to other subtle realms. 
=C2=A0
For an ordianry person, even mastery (by ma=
stery I mean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an e=
xceptional feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.
=
=C2=A0
Now this 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all as=
pects of=C2=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Whic=
h is roughly 1/4th. 
=C2=A0
While talking about this, he was also trying to=
 explain to me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in =
what degree should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him=
 to be able to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he wa=
s talking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which =
a=C2=A0 really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whet=
her he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross "asudha tattwas" of=
 this physical plane of existence. 
=C2=A0
Anyway I know this may all sound=
 very jumbled up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limit=
ation of understanding.

Namaste Dinesh,

Your=
 skepticism is justified.

The duality is infinite and impossible to master=
. Even great jnaanis are 
occasionally deluded by Her power. One can unders=
tand unmanifested non-dual 
Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the =
dual world fully ever. She is 
capable of deluding even the greatest sadhak=
a with a wrong idea as soon as 
one ventures into duality. She can mislead =
*anyone* on *anything*. What She 
does and why She does that is so difficul=
t to fathom. The only way to deal 
with Her is to surrender to Her power *f=
ully*.

> on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity

BTW, though we a=
re all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. 
In the non-dual=
 field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
have differe=
nces due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what 
and how mu=
ch we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is 
born with=
 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. 
When a=
 being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of 
things =
in the dual world that are impossible for others.

Realizing the non-dual S=
elf is something that is possible for anyone, but 
there are limits imposed=
 on what things one can do in the dual world, based 
on the force of previo=
us conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one 
(non-dual) level and all ar=
e different at another (dual) level.

But it is tough to know for sure what=
 one's caliber is. Thus, your basic 
point holds. But I just wanted to poin=
t that all are not indeed the same. We 
should be disinterested in knowing =
who is what, not because all are the 
same, but because we have no surefire=
 way to know who is what.

Best regards,
Narasimha

 Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today

Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation? And anyway,=
 how will
you distinguish when *those* very folks have gone beyond the mean=
ing
of "I"? What you can only do (well, at least, IMHO) is consider
yoursel=
f blessed to read about or be part of their lives...
One part of me is skep=
tical whenever someone claims to be a
reincarnation of someone else, on the=
 other hand we are all a part of
Divinity, so why bother arguing over trivi=
al things.

What the Learned say is to pick one, and surrender yourself tot=
ally.
Me, I cant figure out who to pick to surrender to... :-) Just my
opin=
ion, I could be wrong, and I say it with all due respect...

<DIV>Dear Ramakrishnaji</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>I had once met a very genuine sadhak for whom I have a huge amount of resp=
ect. This person was telling me about the 64 kalas. Not that I could unders=
tand everything that he was telling me, but let me try and reproduce whatev=
er I could understand.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>He showed me an old dia=
gram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like a wh=
irlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 kalas.=
 Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" placed at various places on the ci=
rcle. At the centre was atmavidya. </DIV>
<DIV>He said these 64 represent 6=
4 different kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in =
this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these=
 Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physi=
cal body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why he is purna =
avatar.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna=
 purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16 would mean leaving the physic=
al body and going into other subtle realms. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>F=
or an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I mean perfected knowledge)=
 of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptional feat. Such a man is re=
garded as unique, genius, beyond words.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Now th=
is 16/64 is theoritically the maximum knowledge of all aspects of =
;the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughly =
1/4th. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While talking about this, he was also =
trying to explain to me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather ho=
w and in what degree should each tattwa interact with a person in his syste=
m for him to be able to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. T=
hen he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age =
at which a  really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascerta=
ined whether he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross "asudha ta=
ttwas" of this physical plane of existence. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A=
nyway I know this may all sound very jumbled up and incoherent, but thats e=
ntirely because of my own limitation of understanding. </DIV>
