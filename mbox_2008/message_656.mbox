Dear Mitesh ji,
http://www.saimastersevatrust.org/livingsaints.html
Please =
check about these 2 saints. If you know telugu language there 
are books on=
 them. They both shuuned the publicity. Krishanaih Swamy 
stays at proddutu=
r. It appears to me that he doesn't care even 
slightly about his body.

                Kumar Ghanta
