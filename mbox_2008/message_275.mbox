Namaste,

The word tantra has a negative connotation due to so many people abusing 
tantra. Tantra basically means a procedure. Different rituals have different 
procedures. Some are more elaborate and some are simple. But there is a 
tantra in every ritual.

Whether a ritual is saattwik or raajasik or taamasik is decided by the 
attitude and thinking involved and not based on the deity or the procedure 
alone.

Choice of deity based on horoscope is for bhakti yoga. However, our 
understanding of Jyotisha is imperfect. Sometimes, we give a wrong advice. 
But, in this case, wrong advice is not catastrophic. If a seeker is sincere, 
he will eventually find the right direction.

A sadguru is far more useful than astrology to show the correct direction in 
which one makes quick progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
