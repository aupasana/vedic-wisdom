rt of me is skeptical whenever someone claims to be a<BR>> > reincarn=
ation of someone else,<BR>> <BR>> Your skepticism is justified.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> The duality is infinite and impossible to master. Even great jn=
aanis are <BR>> occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand un=
manifested non-dual <BR>> Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the=
 dual world fully ever. She is <BR>> capable of deluding even the greate=
st sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as <BR>> one ventures into duality.=
 She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She <BR>> does and why She=
 does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal <BR>> with He=
r is to surrender to Her power *fully*.<BR>> <BR>> > on the other =
hand we are all a part of Divinity<BR>> <BR>> BTW, though we are all =
part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. <BR>> In the non-dua=
l field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we <BR>> hav=
e differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide what <BR=
>> and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krish=
na is <BR>> born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of=
 the dual world. <BR>> When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 ka=
las, He can do a lot of <BR>> things in the dual world that are impossib=
le for others.<BR>> <BR>> Realizing the non-dual Self is something th=
at is possible for anyone, but <BR>> there are limits imposed on what th=
ings one can do in the dual world, based <BR>> on the force of previous =
conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one <BR>> (non-dual) level and a=
ll are different at another (dual) level.<BR>> <BR>> But it is tough =
to know for sure what one's caliber is. Thus, your basic <BR>> point hol=
ds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We <BR>>=
; should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the <=
BR>> same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what.<BR>&=
