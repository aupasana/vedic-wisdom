Respected Sirs,


                        "Vedic astrology" - the greatest fraud on the Vedas


Namaskar!


The following speech was delivered in September 2006 at Rotary Club, West
Delhi. The same talk appeared later as an article in the souvenir of the
seminar on "Vedic astronomy & Cosmology"-December 2006. I am sure you will
find it interesting.


Regards,


A K Kaul

"Vedic Astrology" - the greatest fraud on the Vedas!


Dear friends. Good evening to everybody!

I feel highly honoured to have been invited by Shri Ajay Bhasin for sharing
my views about astrology and related topics with respected personalities
assembled here.  As most of us already know, we call these predictive
gimmicks as "Vedic astrology" these days.   

 

When I was asked by Shri Bhasin about the heading of my talk, I had thought
of making it as "Vedic Astrology - the greatest fraud on the Vedas".  On
second thoughts, fearing that it would be too explosive a heading, I made it
a sugar coated bitter pill by changing it to "Do we celebrate our festivals
on correct days?".

 

Well, actually, both i.e., the fraud known as "Vedic astrology" and "our
celebrating all our festivals on wrong days" are inter-related. 

Let me start with "Vedic astrology"  -  as to why I call it a fraud!

There is hardly anyone in India, who does not want to know as to when his
"sade-sati" will start or end or as to which Dasha-antardasha he is running
and when that will end etc. etc. even if he does not know ABC of jyotisha.
I have gone through all those pangs myself and made a thorough study of all
the astrological works besides a lot of astronomical books!  I studied
Western system of astrology also and had become a sort of famous astrologer,
though my predictions were as correct as anybody else's i.e. hardly 50%.
However, this is a secret that no "jyotishi" shares with anybody -- that
his/her predictions are hardly more correct than fifty per cent, whatever
logic or Ayanamsha he/she may use!  When I analyzed the reasons for such a
dismal rate of success, the conclusions were startling!  And I am keeping
those very conclusions before you!

 

Before proceeding further, I must, however, say something about myself since
you are well within your rights to ask me as to what "qualifications" I have
to demolish  astrology that is being practised over the last several
centuries, nay even millennia!

 

My credentials Though I am not laying any claims to being a scholar,
however, I have actually studied all the four Vedas in original "archaic"
Sanskrit with their different "Bhashyas", besides the various Brahmanas
like Shatapatha, Aitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc. I have studied, (in original
Sanskrit!) about two hundred all the important Upanishads as well! I have
also gone through both the epics viz. the Valmiki Ramayana and the
Mahabharata --- in  Sanskrit and from cover to cover, besides Adhyatma
Ramayana, Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc.! There is hardly any Purana whether
the Bhagavata, Shivapurana, Vishnu, Narada, Devi, Varaha, Matsya and
Vishnudharmotara etc. etc. that I have not gone through in original
Sanskrit. I have also studied exhaustively all the ancient astronomical
works like the Vedanga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, Surya Sidhanta, Arya
Bhati, Sidhanta Shiromani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was not a born
renegade against the established traditions.  On the other hand, I was
initially "hypnotized" by "Vedic astrology" and "panchangas" myself and
there is hardly any "text-book" of astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or
English or Hindi that I have not studied with due reverence, as if I was
studying the Vedas! 

 

Having established my credentials thus, I CAN DECLARE IT WITHOUT ANY
HESITATION AND WITH ALL THE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND,  THAT THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPANISHADAS OR
BRAHMANAS. There are, however, some references to some odd types of
predictions in some of the Puranas and the epics and therefore calling it as
really a post-Vedic astrology is more correct.  There is a rider there also,
and that is that according to these scriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal
is nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana (the shortest day of the year) i.e.
Winter Solstice and as everybody knows, it can take place these days only on
or around December 21 every year.  Thus the Uttarayana-cum-Makar Sankranti
that we are celebrating now-a-days on January 14 is absolutely wrong and
does not have any authority from any shastra or even modern astronomy.
Similarly, the Vaishakhi that is being celebrated on April 14 or so also is
wrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) or
Vasant Sampat and it cannot take place on any  day other than March 21/22,
when the day and night are equal. Actually these Makara etc. sankrantis were
known as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic period as there are no rashis in
the Vedas but just six seasons and Madhu, Madhava etc. twelve months.  As
such, we are celebrating all our fasts, fairs and muhurtas on wrong days  --
thanks to "Vedic astrologers"  and their "Vedic astrology". 

 

 The first and foremost thing I learnt from our shastras is that no system
of predictions has any sanction  either from the Vedas  or even Puranas
least of all our dharmashastras etc. since all our shastras admonish us from
consulting "nakshatra jeevis" so much so that the Manusmriti calls these
nakshatrasoochis as outcastes and not fit to sit in any sabha of learned
people.

Those who can foresee our future do not reveal it to us beforehand:

All the Ramayanas, whether Valmiki or Adhyatma or Ramacharitamanasa etc.
etc. say that before deciding about the coronation of Bhagwan Rama,
Dashratha wanted his guru Vasishtha to confirm the suitable muhurta for that
function.  It was on the advice of  Vasishtha Muni that Dasharatha decided
to anoint Rama as the Yuvraja the very next day, as it was "Tishya"  i.e.
Pushya nakshata then.  From this anecdote, it is clear that either Vasishtha
Muni did not know as to what was going to happen to Dasharatha by declaring
Bhagwan Rama as a crown-prince or Vasishtha kept quiet deliberately since he
did not want to interfere in the divine dispensation!

 

Obviously, being the son of Brahmaji and a highly exalted yogi as well as a
jnyani, Vasishtha-muni could peep into past as well as future.  It means
that even if some exalted souls can foresee as to what is going to happen,
they do not reveal our "bhavishya" before hand, unlike some of the
astrologers of today, who masquerade as "Parasharas" and "Vamadevas" to tell
us even our past and future janmas just by glancing at our birth-charts,
even if those charts are wrong!

 

The Gita is said to be the gist of all our shastras.  When Arjuna expressed
his doubt by saying naitadvidmah katarnno gareeyo, yadva jayema yadi va no
jayeyuh "I do not know what is good for me nor do I know whether we will win
or the Kauravas will win the war", Bhagwan Krishna neither asked him to
consult some soothsayer nor did He tell him to wear some ruby!  He just
advised Arjuna "hato va prapsyasi swargam jitva va bokshyase maheem"  i.e.
"You must fight.  If you get killed in the war, you will go to the heavens
and if you win it you will be the lord of the whole world".

Thus all it boils down to is the fact that those who know (including Lord
Krishna Himself!) as to what is going to happen and when do not divulge such
"secrets" before hand to us.

 

Remedial measures are a farce: Almost all the jyotishis suggest one or the
other remedial measure to their clients, and mostly these are gems like
diamond or ruby or sapphire etc. etc.  What is surprising is that we have
become so obsessed with Jyotish that we forget the entire itihasa of our
past!

(i)     If these gems are that efficacious, why was then Dasharatha not
suggested some "ruby" or "coral" to ward off the evil Dasha that was going
to kill him when Rama would leave for the forests?  Well, because our Rishis
did not believe in such gimmicks at all!

(ii) Bhagwan Krishna was born in a prison  ---   I wonder why He could not
use some    "sapphire" to be born in a palace!

 (iii) Vasudeva and Devaki---the parents of Bhagwan Krishna--- were in
chains when He was born! It is said that Lord Krishna was a complete - 16
kala sampoorna  --- divine incarnation of Vishnu and was thus really
Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient!  But in spite of His Omniscience,
Omnipotence and Omnipresence, Lord Krishna could not relieve the miseries of
his parents, Vasudeva and Devaki, who had to remain in chains till Krishna
killed Kansa!

What does it demonstrate?  Just the fact that if the Omniscient, Omnipresent
and Omnipotent Krishna could not relieve the miseries of His own father or
mother before the appointed time, how can a ruby or a sapphire---or some
Mangala or Shani yagya--- remove all our miseries or fulfil all our
ambitions?  Obviously, we are being taken for a ride by such Jyotishis!

iv) Then not in the distant past, Smti Indira Gandhi would run after
astrologers for knowing her future.  She wore a rare and original ekamukhi
rudraksha, which only either the Maharaja of Nepal had or she was wearing!
It is said that some top-notch jyotishis had suggested that rudraksha to
her!  Ironically, both the King of Nepal as well Mrs. Indira Gandhi were
assassinated "by the people" they "had trusted"----ekamukhi rudraksha not
withstanding! What does it prove?  That we should not be hoodwinked by
soothsayers!

v) Then again a well known Tantrik of yore---highly respected by the then
PM--- is out on bail, not by dint of his "Tantra-Kriya" but because of some
legal loopholes in FERA!
Similarly, Dhirendra Brahmachari, another high profile "Tantrik", met with
an accident in the plane he was flying himself!  If he could not see his own
death looming large how could he forewarn others!


What does that prove?  Obviously, it warns us against relying on any
soothsayers, especially if they call themselves "Vedic Jyotishis" since they
are taking us for a ride literally. 

Kalasarpa Dosha  -- a non-existent fear psychosis: These days we hear a lot
about Kalasarpa Dosha!  It is said to be present in any horoscope if all the
planets are between Rahu and Ketu!  My God!  What a humbug!  Rahu and Ketu
are actually nodes of the Moon!  That means they are just mathematical
points without any dimensions ---therefore without any physical existence
whatsoever!  So according to "Vedic astrologers" even such "non-existent"
phenomena can make our lives miserable for which we must do some upay!  Do
you need any other proofs for the jugglery that these cheats are indulging
in?

THE ONLY EFFECTIVE REMEDY, or UPAY, THEREFORE, IS THAT WE MUST REMEMBER HIM,
THE ALMIGHTY, EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES AND LEAVE EVERY THING TO HIS DIVINE
WILL!.  

 

Fake Brighu Samhitas and Parasharis:

We find a Brighu Samhita or a nadi Jyotishi or Aruna Samhita etc. in every
Muhalla these days!  However, there is no mention in any of the Puranas or
shastras that any Rishi like Vasishtha or Garga or Brighu etc. have ever
written any books on predictive astrology.  The Vishnu Purana by Parashara
is  full of astronomical references ---and that also sayana i.e. the
seasonal year when Mesha sankranti is another name of Spring Equinox and so
on, but we do not find any mention of any Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra
there!  Obviously, it is the worst concoction that can ever be had, and may
be that is why such a Parashari is the bible of "Vedic astrologers"


India has gone downhill because of astrology and astrologers: In India, we
have started going downhill ever since our rulers started running after
Jyotishis.  In ancient days, during the time of the Mahabharata, it was a
dharma yudha that we had to fight against our own Duryodhanas but ever since
the advent of astrology almost simultaneously with the invasion of Alexander
the Great, and then the "Yavana Jatakam" of Sphujidwaja and the Surya
Sidhanta of Maya the Yavana (mlechha!),  we had to fight outsiders!  The
more the foreigners invaded us the more our rulers, instead of making a
united effort against the invaders, started consulting soothsayers whom they
called Rajajyotishis! 

 

Varahamihira the worst culprit:

The maximum credit for creating such a fear psychosis of omens and ghosts
and ghouls and storms   and even clouds goes to Varahamihira of 5th century
AD through his Brihat Samita and Brihat Jatakam and Panchasidhantika!
Before venturing into the battlefield, our monarchs would ask their
soothsayers to prepare "narpati jaya charya" and consult Brihat Samhita etc.
to see whether the "ketuchara" was favourable at that time or not!  No
wonder with such a preliminary and hopeless knowledge of astronomical facts,
we were being pushed back into dark ages by Varahamihira and his followers!

 

Our historical records are witness to the fact that we were   vanquished in
every battle, whether it was with Alexander the Great or Muhamud of Gazni or
Chengiz Khan or Nadir Shah or the Moguls  or finally the East India Company,
thanks to the dependence of our monarchs on soothsayers (Rajajyotishis,
huh!) instead of the principles of war strategy and statecraft as adumbrated
by the Vedas, the Manu and even Chanakya, who chided kings for consulting
soothsayers!


BJP the latest example:

The fate of the BJP has not been any better than that of our earlier
monarchs by depending more on their "Vedic Jyotishis" who were responsible
for getting "Vedic Jyotisha (sic!)" prescribed in Indian Universities!  It
is that very move that boomeranged on the party and even the "Minister of
astrology" did not win his own parliamentary seat from Allahabad, let alone
being the Union Minister again. Do you need any other proofs of the fact
that these "Vedic Jyotishis"  will make you lose your seat of power well
before the appointed day just by making you advance your elections?

 

 If we continue to follow the trend of our "monarchs" of having blind faith
in our soothsayers, then  sooner than later we will become Babylon of
yesteryears, which is known as Iraq today!

 

Kashmiri Pandits were the worst affected by their blind faith in Jyotishis:

 Another reason for my revolt against the so called "Vedic astrology" is
that as a Kashmiri Pandit, I have more to  blame panchanga makers and
soothsayers and their predictive gimmicks than anything or anybody else
since they never forewarned us about any calamities that were going to
befall us!  On the other hand, just to prove their astrological gimmicks,
they just made ---and are still making --- us celebrate all our festivals,
including Mahashivaratri, Vasanti Navratras, Ramanavami, Janmashtami and
Sharadiya navratras etc. on wrong days. It is these very jyotishis, whom we
had treated as our friends, philosophers and guides, who are responsible for
our downfall as Kahsmiri Pandits, since they proved neither our friends, nor
philosophers least of all our guides!  These Panchanga makers/jyotishis were
the first to flee from Kashmir  in 1990--- like the king Hari Singh at the
time of Pakistani raid in 1948--- since they had already made their
alternate homes in safer places like  Jammu and Delhi.   Those Jyotishis
just proved to be Shylocks, who were only interested in their Pound of flesh
by way of Dakshinas for janmapatris and matching of horoscopes  -- all
cheating and nothing else!

 

These soothsayers have such a hypnotic grip on us that initially even I was
brain washed to believe that the Vedas had nothing else to do excepting
teaching us predictive astrology!  I was so convinced that it appeared that
even the principle of Secondary Progressions must have been exported from
India to Western countries as the principle of "A day equals a year" was
mentioned in our Vedas!  But thank God, I woke up to the situation and could
see through their tricks.

There are no Mesha, Vrisha  etc. Rashis in the Vedas:  

 Leave alone predictive gimmicks, actually there are neither rashis like
Mesha, Vrisha etc. nor planets like Mangal, Shani etc. in the  Vedas,
Upanishads, Brahmanas etc. Similarly, the Vedanga Jyotisha, the first
indigenous astronomical work of 14th century BCE, just tells us only as to
how to calculate tithi, nakshatra and Uttarayana-cum-Tapah-cum Magha etc.
months.  It does not list any Mesha etc. rashis nor any planets like Mangal,
Budha etc.  Same is the case with Yajur Jyotisha of about 11th century BCE
and later Atharva Jyotisha of about 5th century BCE, which does not have any
Rashis though it talks of planets.  As such, it is really a fraud on the
Vedas being played by some charlatans to call any predictive gimmicks as
Vedic astrology and hail themselves as "Vedic Jyotishis". It is a crime
under "The Consumer Protection Act" as it is a misrepresentation of facts to
a client and is thus a deficiency in service.  

 

Our predictions in the past also could never have been correct:

 It is said that over the past about 2000 years, our ancestors like
Varahamihira or his son Prithuyashas etc., could make marvellously correct
predictions. THAT IS NOTHING BUT HOGWASH! Let us see how: prior to the
advent of scientific astronomy into India, i.e. about a couple of centuries
back, panchangas were based on astronomical works like the Surya Sidhanta or
Aryabhati or Sidhanta Shirmoani etc. etc.  I have prepared a software called
"Mahesh".  It calculates, apart from the actual tithi, nakshatra, yoga,
karna etc., the mean longitudes of all the planets from 10000 BCE to 12030
AD i.e. for more than 22,000 years as per the Surya Sidhanta, Aryabhati or
Sidhanta Shiromani etc. besides comparing them with the longitudes as per
modern astronomy. Anybody can download it freely from my discussion forum

 http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HinduCalendar

Unfortunately for these jyotishis, we find that the very fundamental
arguments of these sidahntas like the Surya Sidhanta, the Aryabhati, the
Sidhanta Shiromani etc. etc. are absolutely wrong!  .  

That naturally means that any panchanga based on them would also be wrong,
with the result that any horoscope prepared on the basis of those panchangas
could never be correct. Thus it is impossible for any astrological
predictions to have been correct in the past!  As such, it is all like the
famous couplet of Ghalib  "yoon to hai  hamko janat ki haqeeqat maloom
lekin; dil ke bahlane ko Ghalib yeh khayal achha hai"

 

Astrology cannot be a science Predictive astrology is supposed to be a
"science"!  What a preposterous statement! When the data on which
predictions were based or are based these days are not correct, how can the
results be correct and how can we call it a science at all? 

 

Stars do not affect us:

 It is said that stars affect us!  It appears either these astrologers have
gone honkers themselves or they suppose that the whole world has really gone
mad!  Let us see how:
I am a puny human being on this small planet called earth.  The sun is
hundreds of thousands of times larger than the earth! And there are other
stars of our nakshatra/rashichakra that are supposed to affect me
individually as per the Dasha-Bhukti that is running in my horoscope!
However, this fantastic statement has no leg to stand upon since the nearest
star of that Rashichakra is Shravana! And do you know its distance from me?
It is seventeen light years!  And it is several times larger than our sun!
In other words, if that star wants i.e. Shravana wants to "affect" me
individually, it will take it at least seventeen years to do so even if that
"effect" travels at the speed of light!  And by then, my Rahu or Shani or
whatever Dasha it may be must have been over! Then how can such a star which
is trillions of times larger than me send its rays in a concentrated form
just to haunt me at a particular point of time!  Can you imagine what type
of laughing stocks we are making of ourselves  by believing in such hocus
pocus!
Similarly, the next nearest star of our Rashichakra is Swati !  It is away
by 26 light years from me 

and is again several times larger than our sun!!

It thus defies imagination as to how we can call astrology a science or how
it can be said that the "Stars affect us".

 

Patri Melapak (Horoscope Matching) is not warranted by shastras nor
astrology books:

 Now coming to the fad called Patri Melapak  i.e. horoscope matching!  This
fad is the rage of the day! You will be surprised to know that none of our
shastras, whether the Manusmriti or the Ramayana or the Mahabharata, leave
alone the Vedas, have anything to do with Patri Melapak even by mistake!  We
do not find any instances that any Vedic Rishi was addicted to such a fad,
since may be then most of them would still have been looking for a "suitable
Patri" for melapak! Not to speak of Dharma shastras, there is no mention of
this type of a malady in any of the astrology books like the so called
Parashari, or Mansagari or Phala Deepika or Jataka Parijata or any other
work!  It appears to be a creation of the jyotishis of over the last  one
hundred years or so. Aleberuni, who visited India in 1030 AD and  recorded
quite faithfully all his experiences about Jyotisha and other things in
India also has not mentioned anything of any "Melapak" in his work!

"All India Calendar Reform Committee":

Summing up, as we have just seen, not only are we subjected to non-existent
fear psychosis like Kalasarpa Dosha and Patri Melapak etc. but we are
compelled to celebrate all our festivals on worng days.      There are quite
a few people who agree with my point of view that these days we are
celebrating Pitra Amavasya on the day of Dipavali and marriages during
Pitra-Paksha!  Similarly, we never celebrate Makar Sankranti on correct days
i.e. December 21/22 but we celebrate it on January 14.  We also celebrate
Vaishakhi on April 14 instead of the day of Spring Equinox i.e., March 21 or
so.  This has been all because of the so called "Vedic astrology"

To put our festivals back on the right track, I made quite a few
representations to the Hon'ble President of India, the Prime Minister of
India, various ministries besides the Positional Astronomy Centre at
Calcutta, who publish our Rashtriya Panchanga.  I also made similar
representations to all the reverred Shankaracharyas of all the six peethas,
besides other saints and Mahatmas, but sorry to say, there has been
absolutely no response from any quarter!

We  have now formed an "All India Calendar Reform Committee" and are
enrolling members for the same.  Those interested can log on to
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HinduCalendar  for entering into discussions
regarding the same.  You can also get a list of correct dates of festivals
for 2006 and 2007 from that forum. As an alternative, you can get in touch
with me whenever you want to for any further clarifications.

Thank you very much for listening to this "exhortation" against "Vedic
astrology" and the efforts I am making to streamline our calendars.

scriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal is nothing but a synonym of U=
ttarayana
(the shortest day of the year) i.e. Winter Solstice and as everyb=

can take place these days only on or around December 21 every=
 year.  Thus
the Uttarayana-cum-Makar Sankranti that we are celebratin=
g now-a-days on
January 14 is absolutely wrong and does not have any author=
ity from any shastra
or even modern astronomy.  Similarly, the Vaishak=
hi that is being
celebrated on April 14 or so also is wrong since Mesha San=
kranti is nothing but
Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) or Vasant Sampat and it cann=
ot take place on any
 day other than March 21/22, when the day and nig=
ht are equal. Actually
these Makara etc. sankrantis were known as Tapah etc=
. months during the Vedic
period as there are no rashis in the Vedas but ju=
st six seasons and Madhu,
Madhava etc. twelve months.  As such, we are=
 celebrating all our fasts,
