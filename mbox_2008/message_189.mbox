Dear Narasimhaji,

Using Drigdasa for spiritual progress should happen only=
 when it is
indicated in the natal chart. Using divisional charts independe=
nt of
natal chart is not correct.

Spirituality is 9H in horoscope. First w=
e need to see if 9H Lord is in
sustana, then if benefics are in 9H or aspec=
ting 9H - if all these are
good then spiritual progress is indicated. Then =
we can use Drigdasa to
tell person's spiritual progress

If natal chart ind=
icates no spiritual progress then using Drigdasa
independent of natal chart=
 may not be right.

I use your JHora software and it is best in world - I a=
lso have a copy
of your Vedic astrology book - I respect and admire you - I=
 have just
stated my understanding based on my discussions. 

Please don't =
take personally

Thanks
kiran
