Dear Sir,
We are really enjoying this discussion. To exchange our ideas and=
 experiences is really exciting sometime. There was a time when I was doing=
 Gayatri Mantra constantly. Now I am doing only Thakur's Dixa mantra and af=
ter reading your articles I have again started Chandi Path daily. We really=
 experience some sort of energy within us. 
I will narrate one of my experi=
ences. In 1976/77 I was=C2=A0reciting Chandi Path daily before Shri Thakur'=
s Photo kept in the Pooja (worship)cupboard. I was closing that cupboard af=
ter worshipping. At that time I was living in=C2=A0a single=C2=A0room only =
as I was newly transferred from Dwarka to Ahmedabad. One day one lady of 35=
 came to me to show her horoscope. She was Gujarati but was living in USA. =
After some discussion on astrology she suddenly went to trance and started =
saying me that "I hear Mantras of Chandi Path from that corner. I see some =
white blue rays are coming from that cupboard." I was surprised to hear the=
se words as my Pooja Cupboard was closed and she was not knowing that I was=
 doing daily Chandi Path=C2=A0in that corner. She was also reading Auras an=
d said to me that=C2=A0'I am seeing Purple and Blue coloured Aura coming fr=
om your body.'
I asked her how you got this knowledge? She said that she wa=
s chanting '=C2=A0Om Gam Ganapataye Namah'=C2=A0 Mantra constantly from her=
=C2=A0childhood. 
This experience made my faith towards Chandi Path more st=
rong.

Well, if you read it loud, others can hear you! That is not a bad th=
ing after all.
=C2=A0
In general, chanting in the mind without sound is bet=
ter.
=C2=A0
When doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended. Even if =
there is some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that is enoug=
h. That is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration of air). =
When you rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (sound) fo=
rms a connection between you and fire. You use that fire then to create pow=
erful subtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can generate.
=C2=
=A0

When doing japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal cords having=
 any movement is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better that way. When=
 relying on the internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound is not nee=
ded and avoiding it can help focus the energy and generate stronger subtle =
vibrations.

You were earlier asking about sk=
ipping some things vs doing everything fully, in Chandipath. An interesting=
 experience happened in my daily Chandi homam in the very morning after I r=
eplied to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi morning. I finished the homam an=
d was about to offer poornaahuti. There are a few Vedic mantras that I norm=
ally read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning very bright. I closed my=
 eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to chant the mantras. Bu=
t suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mother was standing in fron=
t of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It felt very strongly like s=
he was saying "enough with those mantras. They do not matter now. Just give=
 me the poornaahuti, NOW." I did not think much. I surrendered fully to Her=
 as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, but I =
surrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that time. I left the stand=
ard mantras and just said "om aim
 hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vausha=
t" and offered the dry coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With eyes cl=
osed still, I went into meditation immediately. I had a really nice meditat=
ion session.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
1. The instruction was to spread homam an=
d create a community of sadhakas across the world who worship various deiti=
es in fire. It can be any deities.
=C2=A0
2. The beauty of Chandi Path is t=
hat it instills a great sense of discipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a=
 long time, without anyting before or after.
=C2=A0
Kavacha, argala, keelak=
a, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moola mantra are recommended before, while ny=
asas, moola mantra and devi sooktam are recommended after.
=C2=A0
However, =
in my humble opinion, nothing is really compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapt=
ers everyday can be very powerful after a while. I see nothing wrong in it.=

=C2=A0
3. Both are correct and work differently. However, those who try wh=
o pronounce the beeja mantras as "aing hreeng" invariably misponounce them.=
 The "g" becomes explicit. Ideally, you should start pronouncing as though =
you are going to say "aing" and abruptly stop just when you are about to sa=
y "g", without saying it. It is not easy to pronounce this correctly.
=C2=
=A0
Instead of trying "aing hreeng" and messing it up, it is better to just=
 say "aim hreem".
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Internal purity and lack (=
or minimization) of individualized ego is the key in any sadhana. Thousands=
 of hours of sadhana without them is fruitless. One who is pure and has a v=
ery limited ego achieves results quickly.
=C2=A0
There is a lot of misinfor=
mation and unfounded fears that are spread regarding Chandi path. Do not wo=
rry about them.
=C2=A0
Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desserts b=
efore and after a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion from=
 it too. If the meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy it witho=
ut appetizers or dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and positively t=
o get the most energy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read with a sen=
se of surrender and limited ego.
=C2=A0
Instead of doing everything with a =
lower focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focus.

Namaste friends,

Excellent and inspirational writeup Narayan=
!

* * *

Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She =
appeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam=
, to spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish=
 did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at tha=
t time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I shoul=
d teach a simple procedure to him.

I experimented with homam, started doin=
g occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. Af=
ter doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original tas=
k - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. =
In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Nara=
yan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have=
 benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all th=
is started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, =
many people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..

* *=
 *

It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset i=
tself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would'v=
e been different while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic=
 and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Nara=
yan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it=
 down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattw=
ik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story,=
 it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not ha=
ve had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam=
 to Narayan.

Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared=
 to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the=
 manual as asked by him then.

* * *

A good guru protects a sishya from un=
necessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another=
 incident.

One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a wh=
ole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspi=
ration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told =
Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before sunrise a=
nd went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at =
noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath a=
t dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayat=
ri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=
 end of the day.

I noticed on the next day that the previous day was Aksha=
ya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious d=
ay and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more=
 powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked =
a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Mani=
sh with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itse=
lf. But I did not tell you because knowing it would've distracted you. You =
would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that e=
xcitement would've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the=
 sadhana."

He was absolutely right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a=
 sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on t=
he mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, =
it would've increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduce=
d the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Eve=
n after one makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one d=
own! After hearing Manish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was=
 still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more deli=
cious food!

Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them wh=
at is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru =
(or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out=
, so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it =
through conscious effort.

* * *

I remember one more similar incident. Bef=
ore the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me=
 to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentione=
d the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and t=
hat I would do some important work in this birth.

When I saw Manish later =
that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said "=
Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with t=
he identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologe=
r', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. It wi=
ll take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if=
 that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new ident=
ity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. B=
ut it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identitie=
s."

How true and wise!

* * *

Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a=
 lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego =
or the sense of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets =
all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and fe=
ed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and =
increase detachment.

Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some=
 simple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up m=
y spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra=
 to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my he=
art. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped=
 the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru=
 does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on =
the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Som=
etimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..

* * *

Hom=
am and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also =
try to introspect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is =
no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or =
day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one sh=
ould start walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the dis=
tance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.=


The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) a=
nd the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. =
After a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to wo=
rk together very effectively.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>You were earlier asking about skipping some things vs doing everyt=

aturdasi morning. I finished the homam and was about to offer poornaahuti. =
There are a few Vedic mantras that I normally read before poornaahuti. The =
fire was burning very bright. I closed my eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my =
head and started to chant the mantras. But suddenly I got this palpable fee=
ling that the Mother was standing in front of me in the fire and asking me =
to hurry up. It felt very strongly like she was saying "enough with those m=
antras. They do not matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti, NOW." I did n=
ot think much. I surrendered fully to Her as manifested in my mind. It may =
just be the imagination of a fool, but I surrendered to Her as She existed =
in my mind at that time. I left the standard mantras and just said "om
 aim=
 hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vaushat" and offered the dry coconut in =
fire with eyes closed still. With eyes closed still, I went into meditation=
 immediately. I had a really nice meditation session.</DIV>

<DIV>Dear Narsimhaji</DIV>
<DIV>1.Since I have joine=
d this group before some couple of months, some previous mails I have not r=
ead. You have mentioned somewhere that Manishji was inspired from Mother to=
 start Homam daily. I would like to know whether it was for Maha Ganapati H=
omam too or only Chandi Homam?,</DIV>
<DIV>2.Please also guide me whether <=
U>really</U> we should read Chandi Path or Sapta Sati Stotra <STRONG>with D=
evi Kavacha, Argala, Kilak and Ratri Suktam</STRONG> before 13 Adhyaya=
s <STRONG>and Devi Sukta, etc in the end </STRONG>? Suppose we recite only =
13 Adhyayas only after Sankalpam-will it not be sufficient in daily routine=
 worship? Or it is compulsory?</DIV>
<DIV>3. Can you guide me the proper ut=
tering of Beej Mantras in Navarna Mantra? some say it is Aing, Hring, Kling=
.... and some say it is Aim, Hrim, Klim......</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks with respec=
t.</DIV>

<DIV>Namaste=
 friends,<BR><BR>Excellent and inspirational writeup Narayan!<BR><BR>* * *<=
BR><BR>Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She app=
eared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, t=
o spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish di=
d not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that t=
ime was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should t=
each a simple procedure to him.<BR><BR>I experimented with homam, started d=
oing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday.=
 After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original =
task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpos=
e. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to N=
arayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people h=
ave benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my
 mind concerned, al=
l this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing hom=
am, many people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..<=
BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell m=
e at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and ment=
al state would've been different while working on the manual. I would've be=
en more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told w=
as to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance a=
nd also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up b=
eing more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known=
 the full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then an=
d I would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing mysel=
f to teach homam to Narayan.<BR><BR>Manish told me the full story only when=
 I was better prepared to handle the information
 and, of course, I added i=
t to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>A =
good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak hav=
oc with the ego. I remember another incident.<BR><BR>One day in the spring =
of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri ma=
ntra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I i=
mmediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahe=
ad and do it". I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except fo=
r 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch an=
d another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in=
 the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good expe=
rience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.<BR><BR>I noticed =
on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla =
Triteeya). It is considered a very
 auspicious day and it is believed that =
spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other day=
s. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadha=
na. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few da=
ys later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you =
because knowing it would've distracted you. You would have been excited at =
doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would've changed =
the mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana."<BR><BR>He was ab=
solutely right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and=
 pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was a=
ware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased=
 the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus =
on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes exc=
ellent progress, it can
 suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing M=
anish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kic=
king and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!<BR><BR>L=
ucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful r=
ather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone el=
se) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they=
 can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through consci=
ous effort.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I remember one more similar incident. Befor=
e the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me t=
o a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned =
the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and tha=
t I would do some important work in this birth.<BR><BR>When I saw Manish la=
ter that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and sa=
id "Narasimha, do
 you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong w=
ith the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astr=
ologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. =
It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. =
As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new =
identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be corre=
ct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all iden=
tities."<BR><BR>How true and wise!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Just as a fat and mi=
ghty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the=
 master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over the spirit =
of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may c=
hain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously t=
ry to restrain ego and increase detachment.<BR><BR>Manish has a unique way =
of looking
 at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarit=
y to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even with=
out giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit =
the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were alr=
eady there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the l=
ight. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of di=
rt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self)=
 that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice tha=
t dirt ourselves..<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Homam and other spiritual sadhana to=
ols are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one'=
s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, t=
his does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take=
 a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path an=
d
 not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walkin=
g without distractions will reach the goal.<BR><BR>The point I want to emph=
asize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspect=
ion (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will =
be synergy between them and they will start to work together very effective=
ly.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ --------- --------- -=
