Namaste,
 
Regarding 1:
 
In general, if anybody pastes Gayatri mantra stic=
kers on a fan and runs the fan in front of a photo or even the person direc=
tly, you can be sure that it does nothing whatsoever. This is too literal a=
 way to create "vibrations" of the mantra. Vibrations of a mantra are subtl=
e and created by the subtle body as one repeats a mantra.
 
However, the pe=
rson in question may indeed have cured some people like this! As somebody d=
oes spiritual sadhana, Nature may give one some abilities. Curing people wi=
th a specific procedure - however illogical - CAN be one such ability confe=
rred by Nature after one does sadhana. The shakti generated by his previous=
 sadhana may be slowly being put to use with each patient. Fan with Gayatri=
 mantra stickers is only an instrument and the result comes because of the =
person's previous sadhana and not the procedure.
 
There may be people with=
 very minor siddhis and abilities like this, who use weird and illogical pr=
ocedures to achieve tangible results. There is nothing wrong with it. Howev=
er, most of them fall intro the trap of thinking "I did it", "that procedur=
e did it" etc and feel a sense of ownership, entitlement or superiority. Th=
ey may take pride in what they do. This whole thing promotes ego. In the pr=
ocess, they get stuck. They accumulate some people who admire them, but the=
y do not free themselves. This may happen to people with more advanced sidd=
his also.
 
However, all kinds of people are needed by Nature. People like =
this are also needed. Not everyone is going to be liberated in the current =
life. Every soul passes through various stages.
 
Regarding 2:
 
Vibrations=
 are not generated by the *vaikhari* sound of a mantra repeated by a machin=
e or even a person. They are generated by the subtle body of a person whose=
 consciousness is focused on a mantra. If one plays a mantra in a CD, liste=
ns to it actively and focuses the mind on what one is listening, then the p=
erson's thoughts while listening can produce good vibrations and generate p=
urity. But, in general, playing CDs and tapes in a room with nobody listeni=
ng to them does not do much.
 
However, suppose a person of sufficiently hi=
gh level of purity recorded it and he intended some good results for these =
people. His strong intention may be sufficient to transfer some of his ener=
gy to them and help them. Then playing of the CD can work as a nimitta or a=
n instrument (like the fan in case 1 above) and slowly release the shakti o=
f the person.
 
*        *        *
 
We can appreciate the work of all peo=
ple. If one listens to us, we can try to impress upon one some spiritual te=
achings of rishis and great saints and try to help one see things in proper=
 light and not get stuck. If other people foolishly try to imitate someone'=
s illogical procedure, because it seems to work, we can try to educate them=
 and remove their misconceptions.
 
*        *        *
 
We can advise oth=
ers and try to help others, but we cannot really change anybody. But each o=
f us can definitely change ONE person and correct the attitude of that pers=
on. And, that person is oneself.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

laying


  Dear Sir, 

  1. I had visited one Gentleman in 1980 who was cur=
ing the patients by simply their photographs. He was demamding photo of the=
 patient. He had pasted Gayatri Mantra sticker on all the three wings of a =
table fan and he was keeping the photograph of the patient just opposit the=
 fan. He was switching his fan on for 1 or 2 hours daily for couple of days=
 and as per his say, he was throwing the vibrations of Gayatri Mantra direc=
tly to the photograph. He was claiming that he has cured so many patients b=
y Gayatri Mantra vibrations. 

  2. Some people are arranging some Mantra c=
assette or CD in their worship room and playing them for couple of hours da=
ily and believing that the room is charged due to Mantra vibrations. Some a=
re playing these type of  CDs in their Car to get protection from accidents=
 and like. All are doing these as per their believes.

     What I want to =
know from you Sir is whether this is really working? Can anybody be cured b=
y  Gayatri Mantra-written Fan?

    Can a CD or Cassette create vibrations?=
 If someone is sleeping in the room where whole night one CD of a cerain Ma=
ntra is played. The person is unaware of it. Whether Mantra will crerate an=
y positive effect on him?

  Dr. Ashwin Rawal
