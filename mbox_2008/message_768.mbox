Namaste,

Compared to the cracks in our determination, sincerity and surrender, cracks
in a maalaa are far less problematic. Do not worry. It is not uncommon in
Tulasi maalas to have cracks.

Yes. Keeping the current meditating bead of the maalaa close to the anaahata
chakra is a good idea.

Mooladhara, svadhishthana and manipoora chakras are the bhur, bhuvar and
suvar lokas, which exist physically. Above navel are the lokas that do not
exist physically and exist only spiritually. The goal of sadhana is, if not
to get moksha, to go to a higher spiritual loka. Keeping the bead above
navel is a good idea.

Possible. Certain prior vasanas and karamas need to be washed away or burned
in sadhana in order to progress. When a room is being swept by a broom, some
dirt may spill over at its door. Have patience and surrender to the Lord.

Best regards,
Narasimha
