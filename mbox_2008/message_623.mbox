Namaste,

one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma=
 
Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.

Another as intre=
sting as well as equally confusing thing is that 
Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A =
Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about 
his past life and he also indirec=
tly indicated in his biography that 
he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previo=
us birth.

Yours,

Utpal 

I know
