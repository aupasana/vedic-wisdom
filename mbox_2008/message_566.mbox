Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A group on Vedic history


The gr=
oup of "Vedichistory" endeavors to be a professional forum on
indology and =
Vedic history on one hand and a meeting place of like
minds, exchanging the=
ir views here,on the other.

groups.yahoo. com/group/ vedichistory/ join 

=
The supreme spiritual antenna of Indian thought, Vedas have a place
unparal=
leled not only in Hinduism, but also in the world wide
scriptural literatur=
e. They are the oldest of the world scriptures.

Vedas, literally meaning t=
he (true) knowledge, are not only the
epitomes of philosophical, spiritual =
and religious vision, dogmas and
aptitudes, but also are a storehouse of so=
ciological
processes, historical events and verily, the
cultural thread of =
the Indian subcontinent. However, most of us,
whether Indians or foreigners=
, have failed to read correctly into
these great literature.

In an attempt=
 to understand these super scriptures, I have not only
created web pages ht=
tp://www.geocitie s.com/siva_ sai19/vedas, which
have had a wide acclamatio=
n from the netizens, but also recently
started a group on Vedic history.

h=
ttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedichisto ry

This group endeavors to read =
into the currently available Vedas and
make the reading a commentary on the=
 historical, cultural and
spiritual saga of ancient India

However, in Vedi=
c history, instead of projecting my views, I like
more learned and the comm=
oners alike to join and exchange views.

I cordially invite every one of yo=
u, especially the spiritually
elevated, to join my group to make it a succe=
ss and useful to others.

groups.yahoo. com/group/ vedichistory/ join 

I h=
ope you will join and actively participate in this
humble, yet noble and ho=
ly, endeavor.
