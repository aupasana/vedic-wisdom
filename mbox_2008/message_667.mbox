Please define dual and non-dual. Non-dual is relat=
ively easy to fathom.
Not so with the dual. Examples will help tremendously=
. For instance,
take a certain experience and please explain how to perceiv=
e it in dual
mode vis-a-vis non-dual mode. Please overlook my ignorance and=
 guide me.

With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Reema.
