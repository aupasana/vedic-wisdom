"The Very Face of Truth"
A Talk by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

http://ww=
w.youtube.com/watch?v=3DrpnZthbnXOY


The search for Truth is a universal p=
henomenon. Many of us make the
claim that we are searching for Truth or for=
 God. However, what
would we actually do if we were to come face-to-face wi=
th that very
Truth? In this uniquely bold and revolutionary talk, Sri Dharm=
a
Pravartaka Acharya answers this very question!

With a Ph.D. in Religious=
 Studies from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and a 33 year career of =
study and practice of
Sanatana Dharma, Sri Acharyaji is considered by many =
in the Hindu
community to be the most qualified Hindu spiritual master in t=
he
United States...and for very good reason!
