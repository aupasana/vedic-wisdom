Namaste,
=A0
If you su=
cceed in making your mind relatively silent, the sound of the mantra and en=
ergy of the deity will fill that vacuum. When your mind reverberates with t=
he energy of the mantra and deity, those gunas will drive your mind and cre=
ate some changes internally. Internal changes facilitate some external chan=
ges.
=A0
The whole world is connected. God's divine energy is present in ev=
ery atom or even sub-atomic particle. When you have a desire for a specific=
 result and create mental energy (through repetition of a mantra) that is s=
ufficient to break the barriers created by the previous karmas as represent=
ed by planetary combinations=A0in your horoscope, nature will remove the ka=
rmik barrier and make your desire fructify. What kind of mantras and deitie=
s have what kind of energy, what kind of karmas represented by horoscopic c=
ombinations create what kind of barriers and what kind of energy is needed =
to break them was well-understood by rishis and captured in a variety of wo=
rks. Unfortunately, our own understanding of their teachings is corrupted b=
y the nature and quality of the times we live in.
=A0
Bottomline is: Withou=
t calming the mind down and creating some positive vibration, no mantra wil=
l work. If you routinely read a mantra without any devotion and with busine=
ss-like spirit, hardly anything will happen. In order to get something from=
 a mantra, be calm, surrender, have devotion, feel the mantra, imagine the =
form of the=A0deity=A0and let the mantra and its deity fill your mind event=
ually.
=A0
Those who think that they can chant a mantra hastily for 10 min =
everyday and solve all their problems are kidding themselves.
=A0
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha

Namaste Ajit,
=A0
A =
really learned and elevated soul like you is asking a fool like me for my v=
iew - how weird is the play of the Mother! You read shastras far more thoro=
ughly than me. I read only a little and mostly go by my instincts, words of=
 gurus=A0and insights from practical experience. Anyway, as you asked, here=
 are my 2 cents.
=A0
The purpose of sadhana is to instill discipline and co=
ntrol the mind. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday there is a possibi=
lity of mind stopping completely for a little time. When that happens, you =
perceive the underlying reality that an overactive mind normally stops you =
from perceiving. As this happens more frequently, you are able to control y=
our mind far better.
=A0
If you do things in a business-like attitude, in h=
aste, IMHO, it is not really conducive to slowing the mind down and creatin=
g a useful complete/partial silence of the mind. It is very counter-product=
ive. Before any ritual, we are expected to do praanaayaama.=A0The idea is t=
hat you get as much control over breathing and hence on mind, and then rely=
 on the meditation/japam/ homam to take the mind further into calmness.
=A0=

If you are somebody who can maintain calmness of your mind even as you rus=
h through some hymns in haste, then I see no problem. But, normally, rushin=
g through something under time pressure destroys the calmness of the mind.
=
=A0
On the other hand, if you do not have artificial pressures to meet a co=
unt and go calmly as long as you can, it is more conducive to the calming d=
own of the mind.
=A0
Thus, I strongly recommend doing japam at the pace tha=
t is comfortable and not detrimental to the calmness and focus of mind. If =
necessary, I recommend dumping restrictions like meeting a count. In fact, =
in this age and time, it is probably better to not have a target count at a=
ll and have a target time only. In other words, don't say "I will do this m=
antra for 1008 times" and instead say "I will do this mantra for 40 minutes=
". Then, for those 40 minutes, you can focus on the mantra calmly.
=A0
Of c=
ourse, quantity also matters. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definitel=
y better than half hour. But quantity without quality is useless. Very focu=
ssed meditation for half hour is better than distracted meditation for 4 ho=
urs. If you can maintain the quality, then quantity starts to matter.
=A0

Narasimha
