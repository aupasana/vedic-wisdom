Om Gurave Namah

Namaste Narasimha,

I have tried a few times to download t=
he Chandi Homa manual, but the file is corrupted and won't open. I see that=
 someone on the Sohamsa list had the same problem, hopefully you could uplo=
ad it again.

Thank you so much. I attended a wonderful Sudarshana abihishe=
kam and homa yesterday at a temple in San Jose, and look forward to startin=
g to do homas for myself.

Blessings,
Willa
