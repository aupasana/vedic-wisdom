Dear Dinesh

I had forseen a response and may be more too, but I felt like=
 sharing 
the information that I believe is correct, it is for others to ju=
dge, 
investigate, validate and come to any conclusion and I agree to 
disa=
gree with them with love. But by sharing this information there 
may be oth=
ers that upon investigation may agree too.

I am only talking about babaji =
that is mentioned in Paramhans
yogananda's book and lahiri mahashaya's guru=
. I am not claiming all 
these babajis are same and one.

As you have indic=
ated babaji is a very common name and you are very 
correct about both the =
instances that you have mentioned, I am 
familair with both. There is one g=
entlemen I believe in Canada
having blessings of babaji that you have menti=
oned in the south india 
and he has also tried to articulate the lineage, H=
e also does Kriya 
yoga classes. But Introductory Kriya Yoga like Babaji is=
 very common 
form of yoga that many teachers are today teaching everywhere=
.

The other very popular form that everybody talks about but have very 
li=
ttle knowledge is the Kundalini Yoga, awakening of Kundalini and 
Chakra Bh=
edan.

I had read his book in the past too. The other (Hariakhan) babaji 
t=
hat you mention he actually follows the lord shiva bhairav lineage. 

Infac=
t over and above the two that you have mentioned, I have heard 
of one more=
, Swami Rama who lived in USA and has ashram in the north 
east, his guruji=
 was also known as babaji and lived in the North 
India and Tibet. He is ye=
t another babaji.

These books that I have read and mentioned were publishe=
d some years 
ago, yes I agree this is the way Lahiri Mahashaya's Guru deci=
ded to 
act, how can I articulate what he wanted.

But if you go to india a=
nd visit Phuskar, he has a samadhi and you 
can ask anybody their or visit =
Rajkot Gujarat and you can read the 
books for yourshelf. I believe the aut=
hor of the book if alive may be 
staying in bombay.

Best Regards
Mitesh
