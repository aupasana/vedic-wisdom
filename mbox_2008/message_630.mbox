Namaste

Both  these are very credible saints. Sri Yogeshwar was a very hig=
hly
realized saint. His book is very good. He does mention about his
prevoi=
us birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirmed
the same thi=
ng. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint too.

Sri Yogeshwar =
had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and Naamdev
and also many othe=
r saints too. The initiation he got on the bank of
river Narmada awakened h=
is kundalini and he has described very
accurately the state and symptoms af=
ter awekaning of kunalini. He had
very good command on all aspects of sprit=
uality and was a fantastic
orator. His followers have done a very good job =
of putting up the web
site and sharing the information for free both audio =
and books.

Chiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, Ramak=
rishna
may have taken birth as more than one person and in future may take
=
more births.

His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use pa=
rdon my
lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest from time to t=
ime
After reading this and other books, I feel that each one of us has a
in=
ner guru along with our atma and this inner guru in conjunction with
our ac=
cumulated or sanchit sankaras give us visions of these mahatmas
or help us =
attach or attract to a Saint or some aspects of the saint
more than others.=
 This inner guru is the same in all humam beings but
manifests uniquely bas=
ed on each person. 

I also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Gu=
ru who is
present in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.=

There are many instances of other forms of inititations like
initiation in=
 dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms of
initiations though ve=
ry important are very rare or uncommon.


After reading Sri Yogeshwar's boo=
k I had some questions pop up in my
mind about him.

1) What was the purpos=
e of his birth? Yes he may have guided many
spiritual aspirants, but there =
has to be something more unique.
2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he ke=
eps mentioning in the book
about it in many places? Was he satisfied? How d=
id he feel after that?
3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the =
middle of giving
spirtual talks? It seems unusual.

I have also read somewh=
ere that once a person reaches a spiritual
state, he cannot remain in human=
 body for more than few days, was this
the case?

May be others who have re=
ad this book can share more light.
I do recommend to seekers of spirutualit=
y to read this book if one has
time, it is available for free to download a=
s a pdf book on his web site.

Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work f=
or the betterment and
upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown. He=
 spread the Devi
Gayatri mantra/homa and other things in a big way all arou=
nd india.

I feel like I have not even begun my spiritual journey which is =
very
very long too and many obstacles in the path.


Best Regards
Mitesh
