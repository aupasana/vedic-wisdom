Dear PVRji

I have started learning Jyothish by following the Audio recordi=
ngs of 
yours posted on the web-site of SJC and by reading the books  - BPH=
S 
and the one writtne by your goodself. 

Since I have some doubts regardi=
ng the charts I am looking into (both 
the example charts and the charts re=
lated to me and my kin), I was 
wondering if this is the right forum to rai=
se those doubts for seeking 
clarifictaions. 

If not, would appreciate if =
you can let me know the right place to 
refer these to. 

Thanks and 

Resp=
ectfully,

Rudra
