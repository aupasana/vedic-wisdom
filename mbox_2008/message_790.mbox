Dear Narasimha and other members,
=C2=A0
I am more busy with my career and =
hence my participation is very less on astrology groups that I am member of=
. Generally, I check messages once in a month.
=C2=A0
I would like to share=
 with you that I have been doing various mantras for=C2=A0more than=C2=A0fo=
ur years and now for past sometime, when I chant mantras, sometimes I get s=
ome thoughts or say realization or some answers that I am not actively look=
ing for. It seems that these thoughts are coming directly from somewhere an=
d I accept that these thoughts or knowledge or whatever you say (realizatio=
n, light) is directly from God. 
=C2=A0
Some of these thoughts, I don't sha=
re with anybody. Some I share with few of my very close friend. I would sha=
re some with you on this group as per time permits me.
=C2=A0
Today, in thi=
s world, people think that Astrology is just about knowing future and how t=
o avoid the mishappenings / bad times by paying many. This is what most ot =
the people believe.
=C2=A0
Astrology is a light and life is a journey. Say =
you are on a journey for the whole earth, you want to see the whole earth b=
y walking on foot and this is your journey. Now as you walk, there can be v=
arious things cities, lakes, rivers, forests, deserts, mountains etc. but a=
s life is also a journey you do not know what lies ahead a beautiful resort=
 or a wild long desert with no water no shade. As I said astrology is a lig=
ht and God has given different power to everybody to foresee his future. So=
, in this journey, you take out your light and tries to foresee (say there =
is a winter and there is lot of fog) and despite your powerful torchlight, =
you can see only few metres or say maximum one kilometre. Say, if you see a=
 desert what will you do. Well this is a journey (like life) and you cannot=
 stop or go back as time will automatically carry you forward. So what you =
will do at your best. May be you will try to take some water or can buy a u=
mbrella with you
 before you reach to the desert to minimize your pain or s=
truggle time.
=C2=A0
Ofcourse you cannot change it nor can you have a tanke=
r of water to carry with you. So here storing water is what we call remedie=
s. We all to have to go through the journey of life and the end point is sa=
me for everybody (death), however the path is different for everybody.
=C2=
=A0
Do not see astrology as definitive answer to solve all your queries, an=
swers, problems. It's a light and light cannot alter the journey.

That is the c=

ce and blessings, there is no reason to believe in somebody else.
=C2=A0
Ev=

Respected Ashwinji
This =
is a very good and inspiring thread. 
I would like to mention something tha=
t may be an interesting insight.
You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. H=
e actually said in his
autobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My Inher=
itances and Will,
loosely translated) that once when he was 14 years old an=
d sitting for
his Morning Sandhya, a divine figure appeared, guru
Sarweshwa=
ranandji. His Guru then made him realise his past lives and
gave him the wo=
rk for this life.
He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realised t=
hat he had
been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before that Gur=
u of
Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.

I will try to locate the exact link=
 and send it.The general site is
www.awgp.org I remember the book is there =
on pdf in English somewhere
online. It's in the very first few chapters.

<DIV>Respected Ashwinji<BR>This is a very good and inspiring thread. <BR>=
I would like to mention something that may be an interesting insight.<BR>Yo=
u mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. He actually said in his<BR>autobiogr=

nslated) that once when he was 14 years old and sitting for<BR>his Morning =
Sandhya, a divine figure appeared, guru<BR>Sarweshwaranandji. His Guru then=
 made him realise his past lives and<BR>gave him the work for this life.<BR=
>He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realised that he had<BR>bee=

pati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.<BR><BR>I will try to locate the exact link and =

ife. I am going back to the period of 1973/74.<BR>Kindly read this only whe=
n you are in religious mood.<BR>>  <BR>> I was working as telegr=
aphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka.<BR>My duty was from 7 am to 7 =
pm and I was getting late fee allowance for<BR>extra duty. There was a Tele=
phone exchange just opposite to Post<BR>office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99=
t; I had friendship with some Telephone<BR>operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Pat=
el, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)<BR>was working as Operator. He was a st=
aunch devotee of   
 shri<BR>Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was m=
eeting him he was always talking about<BR>shri Thakur. We came close day by=
 day. There was a weekly gathering at<BR>his home called SATSANGA. He was s=
inging devotional songs created by<BR>him and was weeping while singing. He=
 was reading Ramkrishna<BR>Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attendin=
g this weekly meeting<BR>on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. =
Patel was of 30<BR>then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after=
 duty hours<BR>and were talking only about Thakur.<BR>> One day when we =
were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,<BR>some guest ha=
ve come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son<BR>will come in a =
few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. --<BR>And with my =
surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. <BR>> At one another inci=
dent he told me that there will be a plane crash<BR>tomorrow and that also =
happened. I was very much impressed
 about him.<BR>He could foresee the eve=
nts. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he<BR>told me not to go through =
bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I<BR>went to Bus station but bus di=
d not come from Dwarka as was punctured<BR>on the way. This was surprising.=
<BR>> This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power=
<BR>and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to<BR>s=
hri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri<BR>Thakur =
and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself<BR>to Thaku=
r at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him<BR>deepl=
y from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. <BR>>=
 Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning<BR>while =
taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking<BR>up at 5.4=
5 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have<BR>accepted Shri Ra=
mkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife
 was annoyed and she<BR>argued with me a=
 lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD"=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision=
?<BR>Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a<=
BR>great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give<BR=
>us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya<BR>s=
ince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.<BR>> Her arguments were ri=
ght at her place as people in general not know<BR>much about Thakur and I w=
as confused. I thought-- yes I have taken<BR>hasty decision. I was in the i=
nfluence of Mr. Patel. --<BR>> But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me=
 that Thakur was telling<BR>their disciples to test him before accepting hi=
m. I also decided to<BR>test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD"=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has<BR>never come to our home. You hav=
e also not seen him. He has never asked<BR>me where I am living. Suppose Mr=
. Patel is coming to our house within<BR>10 to 15 minutes, would you
 belie=
ve that my selection for Thakur is<BR>perfect?=E2=80=9D--<BR>> She laugh=
ed at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD"=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t bel=
ieve.=E2=80=9D--<BR>> I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately=
 to justify my<BR>decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test yo=
ur existence even<BR>today.=E2=80=99<BR>> To our great surprise, Mr. Pat=
el was at my home at 06.30 in the<BR>morning with angry mood. What he told?=
<BR>> =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happ=
ened?<BR>Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.3=
0<BR>mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur<BR=
>pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s h=
ouse. He<BR>is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his ho=
use=E2=80=9D<BR>> I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding =
me the way to<BR>your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are =
disturbing<BR>him in such an early morning for such a silly
 things?=E2=80=
=99<BR>> We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that=
<BR>Morning. <BR>> I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in =
my life. There<BR>were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I=
 will write<BR>it sometime.<BR>> Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishan=
dev is still alive on the<BR>earth. This is a fact I have written and no wo=
