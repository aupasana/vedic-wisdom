Namaste

Recently I saw som=
e postings and thought I would share some 
information about Paramhans Yoga=
nanda's lineage.

Many already know that Swamiji's ( Paramahans Yogaanda) w=
as a direct 
disciple of Shri Yukteshwar Maharaj a disciple of Shri Lahiri =

Mahashaya.

As per his book Lahiri Mahashaya was a disciple of Babaji.
Bab=
aji lived in India in physical body till 1973. He took
Maha samadhi in Bomb=
ay and his Samadhi is located in Phuskar 
Rajasthan.

Babaji is also know a=
s Ranchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of Chirtakut 
and some more names too. H=
e was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin by 
birth and was born in Gwailor dist=
rict in MP.

Ranchod Dasji Maharaj name was given to him by his disciples i=
n 
Gujarat.

He may have lived for 700 plus years.

He ran away from home a=
t a very tender age and was taken up a 
disciple by Bala Krishna Dasji also=
 known as Paihari Baba.
Paihari baba was also very releaized, he only drank=
 milk and so the 
name. Paihari Baba was Gujarati by birth but spoke in Hin=
di.

Paihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pushkar, he was 
i=
n Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved from Mathura to 
Rajasthan=
. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in 
Pushkar. 
After tha=
t he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. 
Babaji also lived in Galta=
ji for about 12 years and he had the vision 
of Lord Rama in the same cave,=
 that exists today too.

It is located a few miles from Jaipur, there are a=
 few temples there 
near the cave. I have visited this cave too.

>From Galt=
aji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than to Kashmir where 
he lived in a p=
lace called "Rasayani Gufa".

Paihari Baba also may have lived for 500 plus=
 years too.

While at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsidas maharaj had visited Paih=
ari 
Baba and give a hand written manuscipt of Ramayana.

They belong to th=
e Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and Goddess 
Sita devi as ishta dev=
ata. Ramanandi Sampardaya came as an offshot of 
Ramanuja Sampradaya.

Baba=
ji or Ranchod Dasji Maharaj lived for many years in Bengal, 
Chitrakot and =
Also visited Gujarat. He also stayed in Kashmir.
One of the kings of Kashmi=
r was a devout disciple of Paihari Baba.

Both Babaji and Paihari Baba were=
 adept in "kaya kalpa" and they also 
had strong connection with saints loc=
ated in Tibet.

Paihari Baba used to remain in samadhi at a stretch for 2 t=
o 3 years.
Paihari Baba as a young brahamchari served also Swami Ramananda =
in 
Kashi.

Ranchoddasji Maharaj has samadhi in Pushkar, A trust in Rajkot,=
 
Gujarat and also in Chitakut too. At these places they do charitable 
act=
ivities.

Ranchoddasji Maharaj had many disciples but he never made anybody=
 his 
sucessor.

A lot of books have been written by one or two lady discip=
les of 
Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this information written here is comin=
g 
from those books. these books are avialable in his ashrams. They are 
wr=
itten in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.

These books describe Ranchoddasji Mah=
araj's teachings, his view on 
many things, his short speeches and kind of =
like biography.

These are very good books, they describe many aspects of s=
pirtuality 
in simple laymans language.

Babaji indicated that Lahiri Mahas=
haya was his disciple for 5 births
and in this birth with kriya yoga he cle=
ared all his impressions and 
was given authority to guide people and initi=
ate in kriya yoga after 
relalizing his true nature. Like him he had anothe=
r disciple in 
Bengal too known as "Din bandhu" but I do not have any infor=
mation on 
him.

Babaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar Maharaj a few times.

He al=
so indicated that many advanced saints from the Nath Sampradaya 
also took =
birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to experiance 
more bliss.

My =
intent here is to share information and not start any 
controversies.

If a=
nyone needs the names of these books and also the address of 
ashrams, I am=
 very happy to provide that too.

If there is interest in more information =
than I shall try to write 
more about the lineage and the prominent saints =
of the lineage too.

I also have many pictures of Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but=
 am not sure 
how to load them up for you all to see.

Happy Navratri

Best=
 Regards
Mitesh
