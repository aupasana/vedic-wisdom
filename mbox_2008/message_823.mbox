Dear Prasadji,
In this regard I would like to invite you to read a book, Gi=
ta Tatva Chintan written by Swamy Atmanandji- a unique book in this kinds p=
ublished by Shri Ramkrishna Mission. In the preface he has logically writte=
n so many things. As per his write up, 'Vyasji has created 18 Puranas for t=
he common people to explain the philosophy of Dharma through different stor=
ies who were unable to understand Vedas and Upanishadas.Every Puran has mul=
tiple stories. Even Shrimad Bhagvat is also containing lots of stories and =
deities.'- =C2=A0I will not comment here anything for Most revered Ved Vyas=
ji=C2=A0 but my point is every narration in Mahabharat can not=C2=A0be acce=
pted as=C2=A0true. Mahabharat is a history, I have already admitted but the=
re must be immaginary characters=C2=A0with some immaginary=C2=A0story too. =
And yes, this is my openion, you have rightly said. Everybody is free to be=
lieve whatever he is convinced.

Dr.Ashwin Rawal

N=
amaste Ashwin ji,

>>> But the Mahabharat is a story full of immaginations.=
 Most of the
characters are immaginary 

Can you elaborate with quoting a f=
ew samples of those 'imaginations'
and why you think that they are absolute=
ly 'imaginations' and not
'reality'? However, if you are not sure and the a=
bove was just a
statement intended to share 'what you like to believe' then=
 it is okay
and we respect that right of yours.

Regards,
-Prasad
