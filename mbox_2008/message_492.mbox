Hello Dilip

Wow you have meet him? very good, if you can get access to the=
se books
please read them, these are good books. I sincerely encourage you =
and 
than come back with more information.

He gave different types of init=
iations based on the state of 
sadhaka. he gave kriya yoga to very few disc=
ples explicitly.
He mostly gave rama mantra and then explained how to do pr=
ananyams.
Only one that I read about was a guy name jhadavjibhai in rajkot,=
 who 
did kriya yoga and was very advanced sadhaka.

He is the guru of all =
of my family members on my fathers side, except 
for me and some of my youn=
ger siblings. He used to visit our home 
too, however nobody in my home kne=
w about this too.

Best Regards

Mitesh
