Dear Prasad,
 
I do not know any specific mantra. I know many mantras for w=
hich Kashyapa is rishi, but no mantra to pray to Kashyapa himself.
 
There =
are many mantras for Prajapati in general ("prajaapate na tvadetaanyanyo...=
"), but I don't know a mantra specifically to worship Kashyapa.
 
If you pe=
rform a homam, you can add the following line after the poorvaangam (initia=
l five aahutis) and before the uttarangam.
 
Om kashyapaaya swaahaa. kashya=
paayedam na mama.
 
Say it and make an offering of ghee for Kashyapa.
 
Ano=
ther way to worship a rishi is to take section of Veda for which he is the =
rishi and try to experience that section. You can simply pick one rik for w=
hich Kashyapa is rishi and keep meditating on that rik. You can close your =
eyes, keep back straight and repeat the rik mentally with swaram without mo=
ving and do that everyday for a certain amount of time. Oneday the rishi ma=
y be pleased with you and you may experience something.
 
Best regards,
Nar=
asimha
