Namaste friends,
 
I need some help. I am looking for some punya chakra dat=
a - the date, time and place when certain persons left their bodies. I need=
 this data for some private research. The data need not be extremely accura=
te upto minute. I only need the rasi chart and not all divisional charts.
 =

Such data is available for 15 of Ramakrishna's 16 monastic disciples. Most=
 of them left their bodies with some level of prior knowledge, in the midst=
 of people and while meditating. There were clear external signs when they =
finally left. Thus, the date and time were noted down by their disciples. T=
his data is available for Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Sarada Mata also. So =
the practice of noting the data down is there among them. So it is possible=
 that such data is available for some other associated people also. The boo=
ks I have do not give such data for the following people and I am hoping th=
at some other book in English or Bengali or Hindi language that one of you =
may have may contain this data. If anybody has the data, please send it to =
me and mention the book that contains the data. Thank you very much for you=
r help.
 
The persons I am interested in are:
 
(1) Brahmachari Krishnalal =
(Swami Dhirananda). He was a close associate of Swami Yogananda, who was a =
direct disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and one of the six ishwara kotis=
 (ever free ones) among his disciples.
 
(2) Priest Ramkumar. He was the el=
der brother of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was the priest at the Kali templ=
e at Dakshineshwar before Ramakrishna and he was the one who brought Ramakr=
ishna to that temple.
 
(3) Dhan Gopal Mukherjee. He was a disciple of Swam=
i Shivananda, who was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and one =
of the six ishwara kotis (ever free ones) among his disciples. Any other pe=
ople having a strong attachment to Swami Shivananda are also of interest to=
 me.
 
If you come across the information I want for any of these, please l=
et me know privately.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
