Hare Rama Krsna,

Dear Utpal Bhai,
=C2=A0
Namaskar.
=C2=A0
Thank you =
for the link to Durga Saptshati. You have given me valuable advice which I =

You have conveyed answers to a lot of my unvoc=

I thank Narasimha ji =
for his spiritual help to people like me,

Nalini Bahen,

wish you and all a great Durgaashtami.

I'll put my 6 cent h=
ere if you don't mind:)

Yes, Narasimha Garu has recorded DeviMahatmya (DS)=
 on his site.

http://www.vedicast rologer.org
on the main page: click on '=
listen to some mantra', then you'll find
link for 'Durga Saptha Sathi in mp=
3 format'
------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -

Personally, i've never worried about Swara, Mantra chanting only 
after In=
itiation, correct protocols for Puja etc... Though i very 
much respect the=
se things, i have always believed that this is not 
the 'age' where one rea=
lly go for all *correctness* .

The most important is Bhavana ! Devotion !.=
 The almighty, The mother 
knows about our very intentions and would she re=
ally care about 
whether or not some body does proper rituals or not? if sh=
e needs to 
make it proper then she herself will bring about the changes.

=
I would quote Thakur here. he used to say that when just uttering 
Name of =
God brings tears in your eyes, know for sure that no rituals 
are required =
by you.
but that's very advance stage. for most of us, ChandiPaath, Naam 
J=
ap, mediatation etc.. are must to reach the stage.The only point 
here is t=
hat too much concern about correctness and such things will 
hamper us. the=
re will be so many people who wants to start some 
sadhana but are afraid o=
f starting becuase of these things.

I congratulate you and people must bec=
ome bold like you. no wories-
the almighty will take care of everything.

o=
nce Thakur scolded the great man Mahendranaath Gupta (M) and said 
that ***=
God knows that from the clay image worship, only he is being 
invoked. if t=
here are any flaws in the worship, he'll himself set it 
right***

personal=
ly, These ARE THE WORDS of Thakur which has given me immense 
confidence. t=
his couple of sentances from the Gospel has dispelled 
my many dowbts.
Shri=
 Krishna didn't bother about all protcols, Royal Pomp, outer 
show and Chap=
pan Bhoga of Duryodhana. instead he declined and went 
to Vidur's hut and w=
ith all love partaken his Bhaji. Same with 
Sudama.

One poet has narrated =
that episode in simple but beautiful words in 
Hindi. it goes like this

"D=
ekhi Sudaamaa ki Deen dasha, Karuna Karake Karunaa-Nidhi roye !
Pani paratk=
o haath chhuyo nahi, Nainan ke Jal se Pagu dhoye" !!!

It means- Krishna cr=
ied looking at the condition of his poor friend 
and didn't use water from =
the vessels but used his Tears to wash the 
feet of Sudaamaa.

that sums up=
 all.

I hope Rao garu will provide today with Technical details and 
Meani=
ng behind *various Nyaasa* for the benefit of all on this 
special day.

Ag=
ain wish you all a very happy Drgaashtami.

best regards,

utpal

I gave an analogy for this. A 
millionaire may open a bank account in his s=

starting balance of a million dollars. This is akin to a =
good guru 
initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by getting so=

of guru's attainment. But the son may waste those million dollars

end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not 
achieve anythin=
g. Another person may not have anyone to give money 
and may start off with=
 a zero bank balance but accumulate millions 
of dollars with own effort. T=
his is akin to=C3=82=C2=A0a person doing sadhana 
with a mantra without gur=
u and attaining some level in the mantra.
> =C3=82=C2=A0
> Some people hold=
 the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a 
proper "initiation" . T=
his view is especially prevalent in some 
sections of society w.r.t. navarn=
a mantra. However, I disagree with 
that view.
> =C3=82=C2=A0
> If you know=
 the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an 
initiating guru have done fo=
r you? Perhaps he would've given some of 
his attainment in the mantra to y=
ou. Well, you can do it yourself if 
you work hard. Or a guru would've taug=
ht you the right nyasas to be 
done before the mantra. Well, you can get th=
e nyasas from books too. 
Moreover, what most people do today for nyasas is=
 anyway just a 
ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. Yo=
u place 
various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of various 
fi=
ngers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some 
signals w=
hile saying the sounds. This "placement" is actually 
supposed to be an int=
ernal act and it creates an ideal environment 
for the repetition of mantra=
. Due to the external actions, what is 
supposed to occur internally does n=
ot occur in most. So the sounds 
end up not getting properly placed in the =
body. In other words, what 
I am trying to say is that most people do
> not=
 know how to "place" various "sounds" in various body parts. 
They merely p=
erform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if you do 
not know nyasas, you=
 are not really missing much compared to others 
who were initiated.

 <BR>I am trying to say is that most people do<BR>> not know how to "pla=
ce" various "sounds" in various body parts. <BR>They merely perform meaning=
less ritualistic actions. So, if you do <BR>not know nyasas, you are not re=
ally missing much compared to others <BR>who were initiated.<BR>> =C3=82=
 <BR>> In my humble opinion, the most important qualification is to=
 have <BR>devotion and sense of surrender to
 Her. If you have them, you ca=
n <BR>consider yourself "highly initiated".<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Be=

t; Dear Narasimha,<BR>> <BR>> When does Navratri end? It started on l=
ast Monday, September 29, <BR>2008 and should therefore end on Tuesday, Oct=
ober 7, 2008 (Nine <BR>Nights)...yet the panchang shows that at sunrise on =
Wednesday, <BR>October 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue our Navr=
atri on <BR>Wednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day? (All =
these <BR>times are based on US EST)..<BR>> <BR>> Also, can anyone do=
 the Navarna mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim <BR>Chamundayai Vicche" or does this=
 require initiation?<BR>> <BR>> Thanks,<BR>>
