  Subject: Manual for "Sri Mahalakshmi Homam" is availab=
le now


  Namaste friends,

  As some of you know, a Mahaganapathi homam m=
anual was made available about 2 years back and several people are performi=
ng Mahaganapathi homam on a daily or weekly or monthly basis using it. Rece=
ntly, we made a Chandi homam manual and Sri Krishna Homam manual available.=
 Our goal is to create manuals for homam of several deities so that people =
can pick the deity they like and do a regular homam. What we want to create=
 is a community of sincere spiritual seekers who regularly worship *a deity=
* (any) in fire.

  Now a manual for Sri Mahalakshmi homam is ready on this=
 auspicious day of Sraavana Sukravara with Sravana nakshatra! Tithi (Chatur=
dasi), vaara (Sukravara), yoga (Soubhagya) and karana (Vanija) are all owne=
d by Venus right now and Venus has risen just now. Nakshatra is Sravana bel=
onging to Vishnu.

  The procedure taught in the manual uses 3 mantras for =
the main fire ritual - Sri Suktam, Mahalakshmi's 108 names taught by Lord S=
hiva to Parvati and Mahalaskhmi's Ashtakam (8 verses) composed by Lord Indr=
a. One can pick the mantra one is most attracted to and try it. If one is u=
nable to pick, I suggest the 108 name prayer taught by Shiva. It is very po=
werful and appropriate for this age.

  This homam should take about 45 min=
utes (less with a smaller count and more with a higher count) and hence it =
is possible to use this procedure on a daily or weekly or monthly basis. Al=
l the mantras needed are given with detailed explanations. The document is =
appropriate for total novices also. This manual is a self-sufficient docume=
nt.

  Mahalakshmi is normally considered the goddess of money. People thin=
k that Her homam only gives money and not spiritual progress. However, the =
truth is that Mahalakshmi takes different forms such as Dhana Lakshmi (weal=
th), Dhaanya Lakshmi (food), Santana Lakshmi (children) etc and even Moksha=
 Lakshmi, who gives spiritual progress and liberation. Mahalakshmi is the g=
oddess of well-being and prosperity. Wealth is one kind of well-being and s=
piritual progress is another kind of well-being. Mahalakshmi covers all kin=
ds of well-being. If appropriate mantras are selected for Mahalakshmi homam=
, it can be great for spiritual progress without sacrificing material well-=
being.

  Please download the manual from

  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=
/homam/lakshmi.htm

  Please feel free to spread the word among interested =
people.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha
