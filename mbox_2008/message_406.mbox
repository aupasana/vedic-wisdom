Namaste,
 
Path of sattwa does not need a weapon in general. Its tools (as =
opposed to weapons) are surrender and devotion.
 
When a person of sattwa r=
eaches great spiritual heights and is beyond even surrender and devotion, t=
hen a question of a weapon to defeat taamasic influence may arise. Please r=
emember that Pratyangira was used to remove the agitation in a person no le=
ss than Lord Narasimha.
 
The weapon is made difficult to use because more =
and more people unaware of what the weapon is for would start using it in t=
his age for all kind of silly purposes.
 
If a black magician troubles one,=
 it is like the school bully troubling one in my allegory. As I said, locki=
ng mechanism on your mother's automatic gun that prevents you from using th=
e weapon does not prevent you from fighting the bully by reporting to your =
mother. You can fight black magic through surrender and devotion to god. In=
 fact, that is the best way to fight. In any case, Pratyangira homam as pra=
cticed by most people today does NOT help you fight black magicians.
 
*   =
     *        *
 
BTW, you are incorrectly equating vamachara with kshudra =
activities like black magic to trouble people. Not all who use vamachara ar=
e alike. Aghoris uses tamasik practices, but to test how saattwik one inter=
nally is and whether external tamasik influences can disturb the internal s=
attwa inside one. An aghori wants to be in such a perfect state of sattwik =
equilibrium of consciousness that he hones his equlibrium by using deprivin=
g external factors to try destabilizing the internal sattwa and eventually =
reaching a state that they have no effect on him.
 
Thus, the use of tamasi=
k practices by an aghori is different from the use of tamasik practices by =
some black magicians to trouble people. You can't place all vamamargis in o=
ne group.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Homam


  Dear Narasimhaji, Namaskara, 


  Thanks for this wonderful post=
 and explanation. The analogy really helps understand why this form of wors=
hip is not really appropriate in this Yuga. 


  At the same time, this rai=
ses a question in my mind. While the "weapon" has been locked and the "qual=
ification" for practicing Pratyangira Homam has been made more "rigid", the=
 same does not seem to be the case with those who practice Tamasic activiti=
es (Vaamachara/Vaamamarga). From what I understand, a lot of people still r=
esort to Vaamamarga and they seem to succeed far more easily than those who=
 try to counter them with Pratyangira or other related weapons.


  What ar=
e your thoughts on this aspect? Do you think the weapons for tamasic activi=
ties are far more easily available and usable because it is the basic natur=
e of Kali Yuga for adharma to increase? 


  Kindly let us know your though=
ts on this.


  Thanks and Regards,
  Hari

    Namaste friends,

   I recently saw the chart of a person who is in some troubles. He is trou=

am gives relief from this kind of petty troubles.

    Inspite of the risk =
of offending some elders, I want to put my foot down and assert one thing s=
trongly and bluntly, for whatever it is worth. More learned ones who disagr=
ee with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.

    *        *        *

 =
   Pratyangira is a very very powerful deity and very very few people know =
today how to worship her properly. I am talking about all kinds of worship =
here - worshipping Her in an external fire and worshipping Her in one's own=
 internal fire and Kundalini shakti.

    I do not want to emphasize the ne=
cessity to learn to worship Her properly, because very very few people are =
actually *ready* for worshipping this form today. Many other forms are far =
more suitable for most people.

    *        *        *

    Pratyangira is=
 an astra devata (astra=3Dweapon). A powerful automatic gun may be used to =
shoot a specific object at a large distance when an expert uses it. If one =
is not an expert, the gun may not fire at all or may hit some other object.=
 One is better off staying away from the gun in that case.

    I can give =
an allegory for today's situation w.r.t. Pratyangira.

    One's Mother had=
 a very powerful automatic gun. She was a high official in military and use=
d the gun in some important wars she participated in. Once upon a time, one=
 of her sons learnt how to use the gun and knew how to knock down powerful =
enemies in a combat using that gun.

    Many years later, a small young bo=
y of the lady was being troubled by a bully at school. He wanted to solve t=
he problem. A friend at school, who was known in his circle as a smart pers=
on, suggested using his mother's gun. They messed around with mother's gun,=
 but nothing happened because they did not know how to use it. But that was=
 good, because there could have been an accident and one of them could have=
 been hurt in the exercise! Luckily, his mother put a locking mechanism on =
the gun because she had young children at home. Another time, a smart frind=
 who knew how to unlock it but not knowing fully how to use the gun, unlock=
ed it and shot it. He ended up unintentionally hurting the young boy.

    =
In today's deepening age of Kali, "locking mechanism" is put on astra vidya=
s such as Pratyangira, Bala, Atibala, Mahabala, Paashupata etc. Going back =
to my allegory, because the home (world of sadhana) now includes a lot of y=
oung boys (most of us with half-knowledge and incomplete spiritual maturity=
), mother has placed locking mechanism on dangerous weapons that are risky =
in the hands of young children. She did not want automatic guns, assault ri=
fles, missile launchers etc to be used for getting back at a school bully. =
When one is brave enough, decides that one does not fear the possibility of=
 death and wants to go and fight the enemies of the nation in a war, then t=
hose big weapons are useful. They are not meant for standing up to a school=
 bully.

    If someone helps us unlock the weapons, it is still a bad idea=
 to try using them. It is very risky. The best thing a child can do when a =
school bully is troubling is to tell his mother about it and let her handle=
 it. Taking mother's weapons and trying to handle it oneself is a very bad =
idea.

    Simialrly, performing Pratyangira homam to overcome the obstacle=
s caused by an enemy or a rival or take care of some such material troubles=
 is unwise and risky. When one is very pure and saattwik and battle with a =
tamasik force has agitated a highly pure one, she is to be used as a weapon=
 to bring down that agitation and restore sattwa. Her purpose is a really h=
igh one and inapplicable to most people.

    *        *        *

    Some=
 temples perform Pratyangira homam regularly. I see it as an obedient son t=
aking the automatic gun of his mother, dusting it off, cleaning it, lubrica=
ting it and putting back where it belongs. The son may do this service on a=
 regular basis, without expecting any result and out of love for mother. Th=
at is fine.

    The problem comes only when a son tries to use the weapon =
against his enemies or rivals.

    *        *        *

    If you look at=
 Pratyangira's story, she came into being to pacify Lord Narasimha, who dra=
nk the blood of the demon he killed. The guna caused in him by the demon's =
blood created big problems for the universe and Pratyangira pacified Lord N=
arasimha and filled him with pure sattwa again.

    If a goddess could pac=
ify a deeply agitated and angry incarnation of Narayana himself and restore=
 sattwa in him, you can imagine what that goddess must be like. She is the =
ultimate power to restore saattwa and remove all kind of disturbance from o=
ne's consciousness. Such a high deity of purity, equanimity and sattwa rest=
oration has been converted to one who ruins one's enemies and rivals and gi=
ves material success and several people perform Pratyangira homam with drie=
d red chillies etc for petty purposes.

    Just as a young boy is better o=
ff approaching one's mother when harassed by a school bully instead of tryi=
ng to use his mother's machine gun, we are better off approaching the Mothe=
r and asking for help rather than trying to use Pratyangira shakti. Chandi =
homam, saptashati chanting, lalita sahasra nama chanting etc can be used in=
stead of Pratyangira vidya. Surrender to the Mother and chant her prayers, =
instead of trying to use her sophisticated astra shakti directly.

    Next=
 time somebody suggests a Pratyangira homam for material problems, please t=
hink of what I wrote.

    As I have already said, more learned ones who di=
sagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.

    Best regards,
    =
Narasimha
