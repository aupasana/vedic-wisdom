 to me.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
I think I am not able to fully connect with t=
his rik. However, as you asked, I will share what my intuition tells me abo=
ut its subtle meaning.
=C2=A0
Rik:

=C2=A0
Critique:
=C2=A0
The word "apsu=
" in the second half has been interpreted as "in waters". The word "ap" not=
 only means water, but also means "work" or "action". The word "div" in the=
 first half is interpreted as heaven. It also means "desire" or "wish". In =
fact, heaven is a place where all desires are instantly fulfilled (after al=
l, it is a result of your own previous good karmas and hence the period for=
 which you stay in heaven is limited by the good karmas you carry).
=C2=A0
=
Simple Translation:
=C2=A0
First, Fire is born around our wishes. Second, a=
s the all-knowing one. Third, in the actions of people. A thoughtful one ap=
proaches this perpetually kinding one.
=C2=A0
Commentary:
=C2=A0
In my view=
, this rik=C2=A0is referring to three shaktis - Ichchhaa shakti (power of d=
esire), Jnaana shakti (power of knowledge) and=C2=A0Kriyaa shakti (power of=
 action). These three powers are endowed with three=C2=A0gunas -=C2=A0tamas=
, sattwa and rajas - and overseen by the three goddesses - Maha Kali, Maha =
Lakshmi=C2=A0and Maha Saraswati, respectively. In fact, durga saptashati or=
 chandipath contains three parts for the three goddesses, in the same order=
. The Adi Shakti (primordial energy) that creates, sustains and destroys th=
e=C2=A0universe is the sum total of these three goddesses. Some call Her Na=
rayani or Aadyaadi Sri Mahaalakshmi; some call her Chandi; some call her Aa=
di Paraashakti;=C2=A0and, some call her by some other names. But names are =
secondary.
=C2=A0
The rik is saying that the god of Fire manifests in all o=
f us as the powers that cause desire,=C2=A0knowledge and actions. Fire is n=
ot just physical fire that we can see with eyes. Fire is essentially an ene=
rgy that transforms one thing into another. For example, fire in our belly =
takes in various food items and transforms them into things our body can us=
e. Fire in the brain takes in various sensory inputs and transforms them in=
to various experiences in the brain. Like this, different kinds of fire tra=
nsform different objects into some other objects. There are many kinds of f=
ires mentioned in various texts.
=C2=A0
The rik is saying that Fire manifes=
ts in 3 basic subtle forms - as the fire that transforms the quality of tam=
as in us into desires, as the fire that transforms the quality of sattwa in=
 us into knowledge, and as the fire that transforms the quality of rajas in=
 us into actions. Fire manifests as desires, knowledge and actions.

=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In the veda mantra of Mars also, the same word "ap" c=
omes. It says "apaaM retaaMsi jinvati". This is translated by many as "prom=
otes semens in waters".. However, I believe this means "incites force and e=
nergy in actions". Anyway, I will write about Mars mantra later.
