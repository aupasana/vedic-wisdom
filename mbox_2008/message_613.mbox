Dear Rajarshi ji,
Namaskar. 

<<Sorry for interrupting in your question to =
Narasimha>>

I am infact extremely grateful for your inputs.

The process o=
f going through an entire gamut of=C2=A0*experiences* after starting sadhan=
a, though not deliberately is very challenging when you are not aware of th=
e *depth* of those. I have always=C2=A0been drawn to The Mother in her so c=
alled *fierce*=C2=A0aspects. So has been my experience when praying to Sri =
Lakshmi Narasimha. It is not coincidence, I hope (: that=C2=A0the mantras a=
nd the deities I pray /worship are always related to the *agni* aspect- I h=
ave felt strange and strong vibrations emanating from deities I mentioned a=
bove, Sri Raghavendra Swami ( he is my Guru=C2=A0and has been since I was i=
n my teens) and it has been consistent of how I have always had association=
 with Sri Raghavendra Swami), Hanuman, and Durga Mata, and Sri Aurobindo in=
 certain places of worship and they have not always been *famous* ones. But=
 what I do understand is that it is always The Mother I see in each one of =
them=C2=A0when I=C2=A0pray. 
Sorry for a personal diatribe,

I am truly gra=
teful to Sri Narasimha ji for giving us the opportunity to *imbibe* so much=
 nectar through this forum,

Kind regards
Nalini=C2=A0

Dear Nalini
=

Sorry for interrupting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me=
 of a similar incident.=C2=A0I have a friend who does very severe japa of a=
 mantra she had recieved in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a=
 little girl, naked, come and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl wh=
o she (the girl) was, the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not kn=
ow or even understand Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl w=
as saying. Then after some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what s=
ounded like a mantra in her ears.

>From next day morning my friend started =
chanting that mantra, after about one and half years of chanting recently s=
he did a sankalpa for chanting and had experinces similar to the kind u des=
cribed. She felt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no=
 fever. Her relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant figh=
ts etc..

Later after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way =
the karmas are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tel=
l you better. He much more knowledgeable in=C2=A0 these things.

Guys,

I am glad everything=
 is sorted out. But, in general, let us be less 
defensive and instead focu=
s on subject. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly what he meant. However=
, even if Ajit or someone actually said 
something negative about me, it is=
 not a big deal. One is who one is and 
words, good or bad, do not change t=
hat, for better or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

Ajit, you are c=
ertainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that you have 
tremendous s=
cholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far less 
qualified than y=
ou talk/write so much in today's world. Please do write 
more.

The imagery=
 thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!

Friends,
=

Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for givi=
ng 
self-control.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (h=
rishika + isha =3D 
lord of senses). He can be worshipped for control over =
senses.

Mother Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She c=
an be 
worshipped for getting rid of desires.

Several things are possible.=
 But, for most people in today's times, it is 
not going to be one magic bu=
llet that does it, but a combination of various 
practices. Patience is nee=
ded.

Try to increase the understanding of what is permanent and what is 
t=
ransient.

Best regards,
Narasimha
