om] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)


Namaste Lakshmi Bahen,

I wish to tell you my =
experience in this connection as to how we can 
differentiate Real Spiritua=
l person amongst the fake one.

Once I was reading 'Autobiography of a Yogi=
', the very much 
celebrated book by Sri Paramhansa Yogananda. I was actual=
ly 
fascinated by the 'Kriya Yoga' mentioned in the book and there arose 
a=
 deep desire to learn this Kriya yoga. I came to reading the 
chapter on 'B=
abaji' in the same book. In the very chapter, Yogananda 
has mentioned that=
 Babaji is living since many centuries and he is 
still present in physical=
 form. Anybody who sincerely asks for 
spiritual help, he/she will be helpe=
d by Babaji even today. Reading 
the above, I instantly close my eyes and d=
eeply prayed Babaji. I 
prayed that if you are still there guiding spiritua=
l people then 
please help me for learning this Kriya yoga.
And to my pleas=
ant surprise, within a month I was introduced 
(accidentally/ unplanned way=
) to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga of Art of 
Living organization by Sri Sri Ravisha=
nkar. Few more such inner 
experiences happened which convinced me that Bab=
aji is there and 
gave me enough faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shanka=
r's 
greatness as real yogis.

My strong opinion is that if one goes by med=
ia (Print or electronic 
or internet), there are all the chances that most =
people will be 
confused and would not be able to decide about somebody's c=
haracter 
or caliber. Even Swami Vivekananda in his time was accused for ma=
ny 
wrong practices in USA and U.K. hence personally, I rely upon my own 
h=
eart and own experiences. I always stay far away from Print as well 
as TV =
reports. Big NO NO. to News channels. Most of them are 
spreading nonsense.=
 They have become script writer rather than 
authentic news providers. Even=
, random and reckless opinions of 
people in general is many a times misgui=
ding/confusin g.

Same way, for my Beloved Thakur, I relied on the same way=
s. After I 
read Gospel, I was drawn in to events which ultimately took me =
to My 
Guru of this life (It took 4 years). And it can not be a coincidence=
 
that my Guru is also very very much attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I 
rat=
e Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as the Best `darkness dispelling' book I 
read till=
 date and now spiritual books also doesn't interest me 
much. Enough of rea=
ding, now it's high time for *Doing*. 

Hence my input to all those serious=
 spiritualist, who are also 
seriously confused , that listen to yo=
u heart, Pray for the clarity, 
Meditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe t=
he chain of events 
happening around you. Those are the best ways to get th=
e clarity 
about any spiritual person or future spiritual Guru rather than =

depending, more than required, upon Media and such external inputs 
who ha=
ve hardly any sincere spiritual interest.

I clarify here that I am an almo=
st a novice who is struggling in the 
path of spirituality but still felt t=
hat my own inputs out of 
experience may help few.

Spiritually yours,
Utpa=

<P>Namaste Lakshmi Bahen,<BR><BR>I wish to tell=
 you my experience in this connection as to how we can <BR>differentiate Re=
al Spiritual person amongst the fake one.<BR><BR>Once I was reading 'Autobi=
ography of a Yogi', the very much <BR>celebrated book by Sri Paramhansa Yog=
ananda. I was actually <BR>fascinated by the 'Kriya Yoga' mentioned in the =
book and there arose <BR>a deep desire to learn this Kriya yoga. I came to =
reading the <BR>chapter on 'Babaji' in the same book. In the very chapter, =
Yogananda <BR>has mentioned that Babaji is living since many centuries and =
he is <BR>still present in physical form. Anybody who sincerely asks for <B=
R>spiritual help, he/she will be helped by Babaji even today. Reading <BR>t=
he above, I instantly close my eyes and deeply prayed Babaji. I <BR>prayed =
that if you are still there guiding spiritual people then <BR>please help m=
e for learning this Kriya yoga.<BR>And to my pleasant surprise, within a mo=
nth I was introduced
 <BR>(accidentally/ unplanned way) to Sudarshan Kriya =
Yoga of Art of <BR>Living organization by Sri Sri Ravishankar. Few more suc=
h inner <BR>experiences happened which convinced me that Babaji is there an=
d <BR>gave me enough faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's <BR>grea=
tness as real yogis.<BR><BR>My strong opinion is that if one goes by media =
(Print or electronic <BR>or internet), there are all the chances that most =
people will be <BR>confused and would not be able to decide about somebody'=
s character <BR>or caliber. Even Swami Vivekananda in his time was accused =
for many <BR>wrong practices in USA and U.K. hence personally, I rely upon =
my own <BR>heart and own experiences. I always stay far away from Print as =
well <BR>as TV reports. Big NO NO. to News channels. Most of them are <BR>s=
preading nonsense. They have become script writer rather than <BR>authentic=
 news providers. Even, random and reckless opinions of <BR>people in genera=
l is many a
 times misguiding/confusin g.<BR><BR>Same way, for my Beloved T=
hakur, I relied on the same ways. After I <BR>read Gospel, I was drawn in t=
o events which ultimately took me to My <BR>Guru of this life (It took 4 ye=
ars). And it can not be a coincidence <BR>that my Guru is also very very mu=
ch attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I <BR>rate Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as the B=
est `darkness dispelling' book I <BR>read till date and now spiritual books=
 also doesn't interest me <BR>much. Enough of reading, now it's high time f=
or *Doing*. <BR><BR>Hence my input to all those serious spiritualist, who a=
re also <BR>seriously confused&#61516; , that listen to you heart, Pray=
 for the clarity, <BR>Meditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe the chain o=
f events <BR>happening around you. Those are the best ways to get the clari=
ty <BR>about any spiritual person or future spiritual Guru rather than <BR>=
depending, more than required, upon Media and such external inputs <BR>who =
have
 hardly any sincere spiritual interest.<BR><BR>I clarify here that I a=
m an almost a novice who is struggling in the <BR>path of spirituality but =
still felt that my own inputs out of <BR>experience may help few.<BR><BR>Sp=

<BR>and <BR>> respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to =
kill <BR>them.<BR>> <BR>> When the same Arjuna was born again in the =
19th century as one of <BR>> Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Y=
ogananda had been <BR>Arjuna in a <BR>> previous life, according to Rama=
krishna) , his
 dharma was <BR>different in this <BR>> new time and plac=
e. He was born to renounce material life despite <BR>his <BR>> aristocra=
tic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and <BR>inspire <BR>> =
generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and <BR>service t=
o <BR>> others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what <BR>=
Ramakrishna <BR>> said), his dharma based on the time and place may be s=
omething <BR>else.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> The tricky quest=
ion is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?<BR>> <BR>> Some peo=
ple have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your <BR>own dharma <BR=
>> and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the <B=
R>concept <BR>> of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long t=
ime, the <BR>concept of <BR>> caste mobility was very much there. Valmik=
i was a shudra who lived <BR>by <BR>> killing birds. He became a brahman=
a and a
 maharshi later. <BR>Vishwamitra was a <BR>> kshatrita and a pow=
erful king. He became a brahmana and and a <BR>maharshi <BR>> later. Bas=
ically varna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with <BR>the varna <BR>&g=
t; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As <BR>o=
ne <BR>> develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one do=
es.<BR>> <BR>> Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which t=
ells you to <BR>know your <BR>> dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreove=
r, there are not just 4 <BR>dharmas in <BR>> the world. Each person has =
individual dharma.<BR>> <BR>> Knowing what one's dharma is is very ve=
ry very difficult. If one <BR>is pure <BR>> enough, one will *know* one'=
s dharma. In fact, all of us have a <BR>part of our <BR>> mind that tell=
s us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a <BR>lot of <BR>> nois=
e from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, <BR>we get
 =
<BR>> confused.<BR>> <BR>> We should make the best judgment combin=
ing discrimination and <BR>intuition and <BR>> decide what is our dharma=
 and follow it sincerely. We may be err, <BR>but doing <BR>> the best we=
 can is all that we can do!<BR>> <BR>> More than following dharma, wh=
at is of utmost importance is to <BR>engage in <BR>> actions without ide=
ntification. *That* alone ensures that we are <BR>not <BR>> accumulating=
 new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should <BR>not build <BR>>=
 too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the <BR>best=
 <BR>> possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma i=
n <BR>the given <BR>> situation is), with as little attachment and self-=
identification <BR>with the <BR>> action as possible. When the action is=
 finished, we should leave <BR>the result <BR>> to god. We should not th=
ink "I did it", "what will happen <BR>now", "will it <BR>> work"
 etc. S=
uch adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication <BR>through <BR>> untac=
hed action) will simplify our ego and purify our <BR>consciousness slowly. =
<BR>> As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma=
 <BR>clearer. <BR>> There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly =
enable us to <BR>see our <BR>> dharma clearly and follow it without incu=
rring new karmas. This is <BR>not easy, <BR>> but not as difficult as pe=
ople think.<BR>> <BR>> The bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=
g one's dharma, <BR>one's sense of <BR>> "this is my dharma" gets refine=
d with time if one engages in <BR>action with <BR>> little attachment.<B=
R>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> In deciding one's dharma, one's inte=
llect and intuition are the <BR>inputs. <BR>> Another external input is =
the words of scriptures and learned men. <BR>One can <BR>> derive one's =
dharma from them. A special place is given to one's
 <BR>spiritual <BR>>=
 master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the <BR>word=
s of <BR>> the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerely.=
<BR>> <BR>> When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and th=
ought <BR>killing gurus <BR>> and relatives was not dharma, he had a gur=
u in Krishna who <BR>clarified his <BR>> dharma. When Narendranath (Swam=
i Vivekananda) was confused about <BR>his dharma <BR>> and wanted to ren=
ounce the world and go to a secluded place to do <BR>sadhana, <BR>> Rama=
krishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in <BR>the materia=
l <BR>> world and do the work of Mother for him.<BR>> <BR>> One wh=
o is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, <BR>what one's <=
BR>> debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment =
<BR>of what <BR>> one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul wit=
h a clear <BR>insight into <BR>> one's
 inner core, such a guru can give=
 perfect guidance.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Bottomline is th=
at I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of <BR>principles and <BR>> decla=
re that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to <BR>person, from <=
BR>> time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no <BR>thumbr=
ules to find <BR>> out what one's dharma is. But, one can refine one's u=
nderstanding <BR>of one's <BR>> dharma by increasing internal purity. By=
 doing various kinds of <BR>spiritual <BR>> sadhana (like homam, japam e=
tc) and engaging in actions without <BR>much <BR>> attachment, one can s=
lowly purify oneself and refine one's <BR>understanding of <BR>> one's i=
ndividual dharma.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> =
