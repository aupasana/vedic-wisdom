Dear Rajarshi,

This has happened to me a couple of times early on when I s=
tarted
doing Homa. The best thing is as you did, lit it back and continue
w=
ith it. This is also a reason why I keep lots of camphor handy with
me. Whe=
n faced with such a scenario, I usually crush the camphor and
offer it to t=
he embers, which then slowly ignites.

Also, when you want to prevent a fir=
e from extinguishing, dont blow
direcly into the fire in the homa kundam. B=
low it on your hands and
direct it towards the agni in the kundam.

Hope th=
is helps.

Regards
-Narayan-

Actually, even listening to mantras with =

as powerful as saying mantras.

 However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra
is sub=
mitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in
the extern=
al fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound
(even if feeble) =
is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just
listening. Try to repe=
at slowly.

the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for

homam. I am willing t=

homam in the morning in several places (wherev=

trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me.=
 As monsoons come
only in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. =
We were in
New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartme=

smiled.

to us. Together, we=
 held it on top of the two small homa kundas,

. We held the cloth cover on the homa
kundas until fire in the two homa kun=
das went off and then packed
everything and went down. We left for Kurukshe=
tra later that day, but
we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few =
days in New Delhi.
In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the=
 north, east

finished
our task in that place and prepared to move on.
