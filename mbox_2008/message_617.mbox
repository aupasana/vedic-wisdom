Dear Narsimhaji,
I have joined this =
group for last one year. I have read your valuable articles on this site. I=
 also knew that you are the lover and follower of Shri Shri Thakur. This wa=
s the reason I wrote this mail on Thakur. I have narrated this incident to =
very few people who are loving Thakur and when I told this incident they al=
l were weeping. But I am sorry that your mail disappointed me. You have giv=
en analysis of this incident on intellectual level or it=C2=A0was more logi=
cal and less devotional. I was expecting the excitement in your mail but yo=
u just justified that it is possible as our faith is working...!!!
Dear Sir=
, for your information I would write that when this incident happened I was=
 not knowing Thakur, nor was any devotion towards Him. It was due to Mr. Pa=
tel I had just taken the decision to accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upse=
t in the morning after discussion with my wife and started thinking that my=
 decision was hasty. I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that =
you can test Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his wo=
rds that morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel s=
hould come to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come=
 to my place within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him the way to my home.=
 
You have written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 years. I =
think=C2=A0this was his desire and not necessary he is already born now.It =
is His will to take 100 years or 150 years for re-birth. I am now strongly =
believe that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another incidents ar=
e also leading me to believe that He is coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was=
 experiencing him very offen. 
It was a miracle and whenever I remember thi=
s day I am excited. I am not his staunch devotee even today but still He is=
 with me, He loves me rather. Oh, what to say !

=EF=BB=BF 
Dear Ashwin ji,=

=C2=A0
It is a very interesting episode you have narrated! Thank you for s=
haring it.
=C2=A0
After Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw him i=
n embodied form.
=C2=A0
That is entirely possible. When someone who did not=
 identify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bo=
dy and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom=
 and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and=
 he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in=
 that body. It is not that he is "alive" or "dead". It is just that he is i=
n every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realize=
d the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiz=
ation was intact even while leaving that body.
=C2=A0
According to Sarada M=
ata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years=
 and that all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 y=
ears. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that=
 does not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at =
the lower level form may still be able to access his previous form.
=C2=A0
=
Even after the form of Rama left this=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krish=
na was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be a=
ble to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna Paramahams=
a was almost certainly an avatara.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

=C2=A0




Dear Sir, =
I would like to share one of my great Devine experience about shri Ramkrish=
nadev. This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have not added=
 anything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I a=
m going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are i=
n religious mood. 

=C2=A0 

I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Pos=
t office near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late =
fee allowance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite =
to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Te=
lephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)=
 was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shr=
i Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shr=
i Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his hom=
e called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him and was w=
eeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 you=
ngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then =
24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore dail=
y at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur. 

One day wh=
en we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest=
 have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a =
few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my sur=
prise his 8 years old son came to call him. 

At one another incident he to=
ld me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I w=
as very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day I ha=
d to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire wil=
l be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka =
as was punctured on the way. This was surprising. 

This all incidents made=
 me to believe that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrishand=
ev worship only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I shoul=
d also be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 p=
m I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur=
 picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower an=
d bestow his grace. 

Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6=
.10 morning while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was w=
aking up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have acce=
pted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued w=
ith me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? =
Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great=
 Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra =
etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are d=
oing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. 

Her arguments were right at her place as =
people in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-=
- yes I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- =


But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their d=
isciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I=
 immediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never c=
ome to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I =
am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes=
, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- 

S=
he laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t belie=
ve.=E2=80=9D-- 

I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to just=
ify my decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existenc=
e even today.=E2=80=99 

To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at=
 06.30 in the morning with angry mood. What he told? 

=E2=80=98 How dare y=
ou test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night =
duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sl=
eep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=
=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He want=
s to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D 

I immediately rushed to =
your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. =
What you want? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such=
 a silly things?=E2=80=99 

We both were so excited and surprised that we h=
ad no words that Morning. 

I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle d=
ay in my life. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur bu=
t I will write it sometime. 

Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is=
 still alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is add=
ed to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us.

=3D3>I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My=
 duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra =
duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due t=
o same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One M=
r. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator=
. He was a staunch devotee of<SPAN>    </SPAN>shri Ramkrishn=
adev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. W=
e came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SA=
TSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping whil=
e singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters wer=
e attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years ol=
d. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm a=
