Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for your guidance. I am glad that you hinted about the Navarna Mantra...as per Swami Sivananda's writings, the Navarna Mantra is "Aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche "

http://www.dlshq.org/religions/navaratri.htm

Yet most people I have met continue to use "OM" before the mantra and still refer it as Navarna Mantra, similar to the Siva Panchaakshari Mantra, "Namah Sivaaya" which people commonly say is "Om Namah Sivaaya". The "OM" at the beginning of the mantra is supposedly added to "protect" us. Could you please share your thoughts on this topic.

Tommorrow evening, we have the Ashtami Chandi Havan and I would like to start reciting the mantra. Is it preferable to start the mantra during the Havan itself OR do I need to wait till the purnaahuti of the Havan and then start the mantra chanting at the Havan Kund?

warm regards,
Chandraprakash

Namaste,
 
There are 11 days instead of 10 from Pratipada to 
Vijaya Dasami this time. If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then 
there are ten nights instead of nine this year. This happens 
sometimes.
 
If you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi comes 
twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and 
extended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday 
(Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami 
is on Thursday (Oct 10).
 
If one's parents did not do a proper "anna 
praasana" ritual (the ritual of first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, 
should one consider oneself not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a 
mantra because of no initiation is basically like that.
 
Getting initiation is good, especially if the one 
initiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessary 
nor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.
 
If you see my homam document, I gave an analogy for 
this. A millionaire may open a bank account in his son's name with a starting 
balance of a million dollars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in 
a mantra. Sishya starts off by getting some of guru's attainment. But the son 
may waste those million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya 
may fall and not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give 
money and may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions of 
dollars with own effort. This is akin to a person doing sadhana with a 
mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.
 
Some people hold the view that mantras cannot be 
chanted without a proper "initiation" . This view is especially prevalent in some 
sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with that 
view.
 
If you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What 
would an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would've given some of 
his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if you work 
hard. Or a guru would've taught you the right nyasas to be done before the 
mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreover, what most people 
do today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally 
means placement. You place various sounds in various body parts (like the tips 
of various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some 
signals while saying the sounds. This "placement" is actually supposed to be an 
internal act and it creates an ideal environment for the repetition of mantra. 
Due to the external actions, what is supposed to occur internally does not occur 
in most. So the sounds end up not getting properly placed in the body. In other 
words, what I am trying to say is that most people do not know how to "place" 
various "sounds" in various body parts. They merely perform meaningless 
ritualistic actions. So, if you do not know nyasas, you are not really missing 
much compared to others who were initiated.
 
In my humble opinion, the most important 
qualification is to have devotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have 
them, you can consider yourself "highly initiated".
 
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

Navaratri...

Dear Narasimha,

When does Navratri end? It  started on last Monday, September 29, 2008 and should therefore end on  Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine Nights)...yet the panchang shows that at  sunrise on Wednesday, October 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue our  Navratri on Wednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day? (All  these times are based on US EST)..

Also, can anyone do the Navarna  mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim Chamundayai Vicche" or does this require  initiation?

Thanks,
Chandraprakash__
