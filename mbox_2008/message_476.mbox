> Dear Members please find herewith my 3rd Astro Capsule.
>    If Moon is in the 6th house with Mercury alone or Moon is in Gemini
> or Virgo in 6th, the person born will be the patient of Obsessive
> Compulsive Disorders. These patients are under chronic anxiety and are
> compelled to wash their hands , touch certain things, count the same
> things repeatedly, do certain actions just by force from within and
> they think that If they will not do this, certain horrible will happen
> to them. After obeying this order from  mind they will be relaxed and
> will be seen normal. THey are suffering from unknown fear.
