Subject: Aluminium trays and some need some clarifications for related stuff for homans

Namaste

In the US a lot of priest do use aluminium trays for conducting ho=
mams
In fact when I started doing homans I also used aluminium trays till 
=
I got a copper kunda. We had in the past done a couple of homans in 
the ho=
me and both times the priest(different) used aluminium trays
and inthat the=
y poured first sand and then on top of sand they used 
dry coconut and in t=
he US we also get something called quick burning 
fire logs I suppose they =
contain some wood and the same material they
use to make candles, Oops I fo=
rgot the name of this material and some 
other things.

So I also when I st=
arted did use initially aluminium trays and also
quick burning log along wi=
th coconut.

Further more I have actually wrapped the copper kunda with alu=
minium 
foil so that the kunda remains clean. May be I should remove the 
a=
luminium foil.

Any conclusive guidance about wrapping haven kunda with alu=
minium foil
and usage of quick burning log in the homa is appreciated.

Fur=
ther I think there are few other things that are also needed, I am 
note su=
re or understand their usage

Suchi, srava, proksani and pranita and sphya.=
 I have no understanding 
of these items as to how to use them. again any m=
ore information very 
much appreciated

Further I read somewhere that one n=
eeds to also invoke brahma for the 
entire time from start till poornahuti =
is done and is to be seated on 
the south side, I am not sure how to do it.=


Tarpana in the Ganapati homan, there is tarpana details but others 
like =
laxmi or krishna or saani homan manuals do not seem to have or I 
missed it=
. Do we need to do tarpana always with milk for all homans. 
I suppose so. =
Again some clarification would go long way

Best Regards
Mitesh
