Dear Narasimhaji

I was trying to read Sri Aurobindos translation of the my=
stic fire 
hymns from the Vedas. One of the riks is as follows:

divas pari=
 prathamaṃ jaj=F1e aghnirasmad dvitīyaṃ parijātaved&#=
257;ḥ | 
tṛtīyamapsu nṛmaṇā ajasramindh&#=
257;na enaṃjarate svādhīḥ || 

Translation done by Sr=
i Aurobindo:

10th Mandal SUKTA 45


1. Above heaven was the first birth of=
 the Fire, over us was his 
second birth as the knower of all things born, =
his third birth was 
in the waters, a god-mind; him continuously one kindle=
s and with 
one's thought perfectly fixed on him adores.

rate of the possible 
meaning of the above verse/translation.

Thanks for a=
ll your efforts.
