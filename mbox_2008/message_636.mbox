th 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of <BR>> things in the dual world that =
are impossible for others.<BR>> <BR>> Realizing the non-dual Self is =
something that is possible for anyone, but <BR>> there are limits impose=

of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one <BR>> (non-dual)=

it is tough to know for sure what one's caliber is. Thus, your basic <BR>&g=
t; point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same=

 disinterested in knowing who is what, not because =
all are the <BR>> same, but because we have no surefire way to know who =
