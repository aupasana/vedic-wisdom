|| Om Sri Gurubhyo Namah ||

Namaskaar Narasimha Ji,

 person, she is

Should this be the case for all rituals, or only=
 for Homam? I always sit
on the right hand side of my husband during the Po=
ojas. But now that I
read your directions, I realize that in the pictures o=
f the devatas, the
devi always stands/sits on the left hand side of the dev=
a (ref. Sri Rama
Darbara, or Sri Siva and Mother Parvati). So perhaps, then=
, the wife
should stand/sit on the left of the husband for all religious
wo=
rships/practices (including lighting of deepam and aarti)?

Thank you.

Wit=
h the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Reema.
