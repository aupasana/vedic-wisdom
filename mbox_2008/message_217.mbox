Generally, the tithi at sunrise is followed when one does not know the
rule. In the
case of shivaratri, the rule I specified earlier is agreed upon by the
following texts.
The only difference is when the rule is satisfied two days in a row. I
have not come
across a text that gives sUryodaya as a criteria.

The texts that agree on the rule are:

vaidyanAtha-diikShitiiyam
parva-nirNayaH
vrata-rAjaH
kalpa-chintAmaNIH

bhavadIyaH,

       ajit
