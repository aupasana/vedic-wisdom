Namaste,
 
Dogma is needed in the beginning of one's sadhana, but should be=
 rejected as one progresses. Otherwise, it becomes a blockage instead of pr=
omoting progress. But it IS needed in the beginning.
 
Dogma dictates maint=
aining several kinds of external purity when chanting mantras, slokas and p=
rayers. The purpose of external purity is to eventually promote internal pu=
rity.
 
If someone already has a high level of internal purity and can focu=
s the mind on god irrespective of external circumstances, external purity i=
s irrelevant.
 
But, in the case of a less evolved person, focussing on god=
 is difficult and depends on external factors. When one takes bath, wears c=
lean clothes, sits in a nice room with nice idols, nice lighting and incens=
e etc, one may be able to focus mind on god and mantra a little better. So =
dogma requires all those things.
 
If one is able to think of god's name al=
l the time and one's mind soars high irrespective of what the body is doing=
, it is foolish to try to stop the mind from soaring high and tying it down=
 to the acts of the body. Dogma should be dumped then.
 
*        *        =
*
 
One lady told me once, "when I have my monthly periods, I am not suppos=
ed to say mantras. But my mind is used to always silently repeating certain=
 mantras and that continues during my periods also. What should I do? It is=
 not easy for me to stop my mind. My mind is so used to saying those names.=
 Why should I stop consciously during my periods? Is it a sin to say god's =
name?"
 
This lady is very pure and clean-hearted. I see no reason to tell =
her, "no lady, it is a *sin* to say the mantra during your periods." Of cou=
rse, any clear-sighted person can see that it is NOT a sin to repeat god's =
name, irrespective of the circumstances and surroundings.
 
*        *     =
   *
 
How to decide whether you should stick to dogma or dump it? If there=
 is *any* little feeling of guilt inside you when you break a rule of dogma=
, it means you are not ready for breaking that rule. Then simply follow dog=
ma.
 
Suppose saying Gayatri mantra when you are urinating makes you a litt=
le uncomfortable or gives a little feeling of wrong-doing. Then don't say i=
t. Suppose someone else realizes that Gayatri mantra says that this entire =
universe is filled with the effulgence of Savita and thinks that the same S=
avita's effulgence is in a god's idol, in one's own body, in one's urine an=
d in the food one eats etc and there is no real distinction between all of =
them. Then he may chant Gayatri mantra even when urinating. What's wrong wi=
th it?
 
If there is ANY amount of guilt in one when are breaking dogma, on=
e probably needs to stick to dogma for more time.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=

  Dear Narasimha,

  Could you please elab=
orate on this statement.

  " Whether you are walking or talking or  drivin=
g or typing or reading 
  or writing or answering nature's calls, you can s=
till silently chant His name in the mind.

  I once had a discussion with o=
ur priest. We had gone to a temple where they had the intercom connection i=
n the restrooms, so that people could listen if there was some announcement=
 going on (as well as any prayers/bhajans). The priest felt that this was v=
ery inappropriate and that we should not be listening to any prayers in the=
 restroom (let alone chant anything silently or otherwise). Thanks.

  warm=
 regards,
  Chandraprakash

  Namaste Sir,

  Do I know you from before?

  If you do not =
mind, can I have your birthdata (date, time and place of 
  birth)? You can=
 send it privately to pvr@charter. net.

  If your goal is reaching Vaikunt=
ha loka and serving the Lord, just chant His 
  name all the time when you =
are awake. Whether you are walking or talking or 
  driving or typing or re=
ading or writing or answering nature's calls, you can 
  still silently cha=
nt His name in the mind.

  If you do this enough, your mind will start cha=
nting his name when it is 
  asleep too!

  Your goal should be to repeat a=
 (any) name of the Lord all the time, so that 
  taking that name becomes t=
he second nature to your mind!

  Other things are not as useful as getting=
 addicted to a name of the Lord.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha
