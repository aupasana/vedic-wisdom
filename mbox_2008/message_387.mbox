Namaste friends,

Happy Sri Kri=
shna Janmaashtami to all of you!

The astrological angle I criticized in an=
other mail today is only one aspect of the unnecessary technicalities that =
sometimes block people from progressing. There are other technicalities tha=
t can be done away with, when they start to block one.

* * *

I recently s=
aw the chart of a person, who I am sure will make much progress and be in a=
 position to guide thousands of people spiritually. His chart strongly sugg=
ested that he should chant Chandipath or do Chandi homam and then progress =
will come. I told him that. He said he learnt Chandipath sometime ago but h=
e does not read it regularly because he does not have the anga nyasam and k=
ara nyasam text. He cannot read Indian scripts and can only read English. C=
handipath is available in Roman script from Ramakrishna math, but that only=
 has the thirteen chapters, kavacham, argala and keelakam. It does not give=
 the nyasas, which are given in the Gita press version (available only in I=
ndian languages). The poor guy assumed he could not do it without proper ny=
asas and did not attempt to do it.

I told him that 13 chapters are the mai=
n thing and all else is secondary. I told him to just start with 13 chapter=
s.

* * *

Like this, many people have various ideas about "the right way" =
to do it and do not even try things lest they should it do it "a wrong way"=
!

Of course, there *are* right ways to do poojas, japas and homas. However=
, there are also right ways to do so many things. Let me give an analogy us=
ing eating.

* * *

There are right ways to eat too. There are certain mant=
ras you should say before eating, while eating and after eating. There are =
rules for what items should be eaten. There are rules for what order they s=
hould be served in, on the plate. There are rules for how the served items =
are arranged on the plate. There are rules for what order you eat them in. =
There are rules for what kind of plate can be used (silver, gloden, copper,=
 banana leaf etc). There are rules for what kind of clothese the person ser=
ving food can wear. There are rules for what kind of clothes eater can wear=
. There are many many rules.

Suppose you don't know some rules. Or suppose=
 you are unable to follow some rules and have to compromise. Or suppose you=
 don't know the mantras to be recited before and after eating. Will you the=
n stop eating? Won't it be foolish to not eat because you cannot follow all=
 the rules and technicalities of eating? Won't you compromise wherever you =
have to and just eat *some* food, so that you get some strength and sustain=
 yourself?

Friends, the *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether=
 you spend 5 hours or 1 hour or half hour or ten minutes everyday on spirit=
ual sadhana, it should be an integral part of your life. It should be as im=
portant as eating food, drinking water and breathing air. In fact, it reall=
y is. Just as not eating makes you weak, not doing any sadhana also makes y=
ou weak. Just as eating makes you stronger, doing some sadhana also makes y=
ou stronger.

People are unnecessarily afraid of spiritual sadhana. They ta=
ke all the rules and technicalities too seriously (unlike with other things=
 in life, such as eating, drinking, bathing etc) and block themselves from =
progressing.

This needs to change. People need to know that it is ok to co=
mpromise on most things, but important to do *some* sadhana. Just as you wo=
uld eat simple dal chaval (lentil soup with rice) or a bread and cheese san=
dwich when there is no multi-course meal that satisfies the rules, you can =
just sit down for 15 minutes without moving and repeat any mantra. Or just =
light a fire in a silver or copper or clay bowl with sticks, say "Om bhuh s=
waha, Om bhuvah swaha, Om suvah swaha, Om bhurbhuvassuvah swaha" and then r=
epeat some mantra with swaha added and some ghee drops poured into fire. Su=
ch a simple sadhana also, when repeated daily, can be powerful. It is defin=
itely better than avoiding sadhana at all, just as eating just a bread sand=
wich is better than not eating at all.

* * *

Rules and technicalities are=
 there to maximize the experience one gets from sadhana. They are NOT there=
 to block or stop one from doing sadhana altogether. That would be counter =
productive.

Each rule, each technicality and each step in the standard pro=
cedures has some deeper meaning and motive (which is lost on people these d=
ays!), but it is ok to compromise. If you can, follow *all* the rules. If y=
ou cannot, atleast do *something* with several rules compromised, rather th=
an not doing anything at all.

Too many people are suffering from intertia =
when it comes to progressing spiritually. I see some great souls meant for =
big things also suffering from inertia at various levels. Unnecessary fear =
of rules and technicalities is part of the reason for this inertia.

This n=
eeds to be changed. Spiritually inclined people have to be empowered and bo=
ldened. The fear and inertia in them need to be destroyed. This is very muc=
h needed for not just for the individual good of those people, but the coll=
ective good of world in these interesting times.

Best regards,
Narasimha
