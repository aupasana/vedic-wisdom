Namaste,
 
If you succeed in making your mind relatively silent, the sound =
of the mantra and energy of the deity will fill that vacuum. When your mind=
 reverberates with the energy of the mantra and deity, those gunas will dri=
ve your mind and create some changes internally. Internal changes facilitat=
e some external changes.
 
The whole world is connected. God's divine energ=
y is present in every atom or even sub-atomic particle. When you have a des=
ire for a specific result and create mental energy (through repetition of a=
 mantra) that is sufficient to break the barriers created by the previous k=
armas as represented by planetary combinations in your horoscope, nature wi=
ll remove the karmik barrier and make your desire fructify. What kind of ma=
ntras and deities have what kind of energy, what kind of karmas represented=
 by horoscopic combinations create what kind of barriers and what kind of e=
nergy is needed to break them was well-understood by rishis and captured in=
 a variety of works. Unfortunately, our own understanding of their teaching=
s is corrupted by the nature and quality of the times we live in.
 
Bottoml=
ine is: Without calming the mind down and creating some positive vibration,=
 no mantra will work. If you routinely read a mantra without any devotion a=
nd with business-like spirit, hardly anything will happen. In order to get =
something from a mantra, be calm, surrender, have devotion, feel the mantra=
, imagine the form of the deity and let the mantra and its deity fill your =
mind eventually.
 
Those who think that they can chant a mantra hastily for=
 10 min everyday and solve all their problems are kidding themselves.
 
Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha

          Namaste Ajit,

 =
         A really learned and elevated soul like you is asking a fool like =
me for my view - how weird is the play of the Mother! You read shastras far=
 more thoroughly than me. I read only a little and mostly go by my instinct=
s, words of gurus and insights from practical experience. Anyway, as you as=
ked, here are my 2 cents.

          The purpose of sadhana is to instill d=
iscipline and control the mind. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday th=
ere is a possibility of mind stopping completely for a little time. When th=
at happens, you perceive the underlying reality that an overactive mind nor=
mally stops you from perceiving. As this happens more frequently, you are a=
ble to control your mind far better.

          If you do things in a busin=
ess-like attitude, in haste, IMHO, it is not really conducive to slowing th=
e mind down and creating a useful complete/partial silence of the mind. It =
is very counter-productive. Before any ritual, we are expected to do praana=
ayaama. The idea is that you get as much control over breathing and hence o=
n mind, and then rely on the meditation/japam/ homam to take the mind furth=
er into calmness.

          If you are somebody who can maintain calmness =
of your mind even as you rush through some hymns in haste, then I see no pr=
oblem. But, normally, rushing through something under time pressure destroy=
s the calmness of the mind.

          On the other hand, if you do not hav=
e artificial pressures to meet a count and go calmly as long as you can, it=
 is more conducive to the calming down of the mind.

          Thus, I stro=
ngly recommend doing japam at the pace that is comfortable and not detrimen=
tal to the calmness and focus of mind. If necessary, I recommend dumping re=
strictions like meeting a count. In fact, in this age and time, it is proba=
bly better to not have a target count at all and have a target time only. I=
n other words, don't say "I will do this mantra for 1008 times" and instead=
 say "I will do this mantra for 40 minutes". Then, for those 40 minutes, yo=
u can focus on the mantra calmly.

          Of course, quantity also matte=
rs. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definitely better than half hour. B=
ut quantity without quality is useless. Very focussed meditation for half h=
our is better than distracted meditation for 4 hours. If you can maintain t=
he quality, then quantity starts to matter.

          Best regards,
      =

            namaste mahodaya,

            I =
have a doubt that I've wanted to ask for a while. Please do reply on vedic-=
wisdom.

            Assuming that one has limited time for japa (or other =
sadhana), which is better -- doing a 
            smaller count slowly and =
deliberately, or trying to do the japa very quickly in order to have 
     =
       a higher "count"?

            Since it is navaratram, take devi-mah=
atmyam as an example -- is it better to read a few chapters
            slo=
wly each day, or is it better to try and finish the parayana of all 700 shl=
okas at superspeed?

            bhavadIyaH,

                  ajit
