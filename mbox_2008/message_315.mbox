Dear Kumar,
   
  Very good mail. I completely agree to it. 100 percent. One ounce of practise is far far far better. You have hit the nail on the head. Very correct..
   
  I personally feel a terrific devotion for Ramakrishna Paramhamsa and Lahiri Mahasaya.. not that the other saints any less..(it is foolish for us to compare them).. but Ramakrishna Paramhamsa i find to be just amazing.. specially if  u read that book by Sri Saradananda where a lot of details is mentioned about thakur's sadhana days.. its mind boggling..
  and Lahiri Mahasays.. what a man.. what a yogi.. being a houselholder goign to these heights.. oh my god.. its just too much..!
   
  -Regards
   Rajarshi

          Dear Rajarshiji,
Thank you very much for the response. Sometimes I feel I missed the 
golden era(1800- early 1900). It was the time many saints were born. 
Sri Shirdi Saibaba, Sri Swami Samarth(Akkalkot maharaj), Sri Ramana 
Maharshi, Sri Tajuddin baba, Sri Bhagavan Nityananda, Nisargadatta 
Maharaj, Ramakrishna parmahansa, Trilinga swami, Lahiri baba, 
Yukteswara Maharaj, Pakalapati guruji and many other saints were 
born in that golden era. I too accept that the presence of the 
saints just near to us is highly benificial than anything. However 
still many people near to those saints didn't use those great saints 
help. Sri Shirdi Saibaba himself told that everybody was coming to 
him for material wealth and nobody was asking spiritual wealth. In 
my opinion, if we pray sincerely, even now also those saints will 
respond to us. In my observation, devotion with other kinds of 
meditation gives excellent results. Combination of strong conviction 
on guru or god, meditation on beingness(I like pranayama, vipasana, 
and zen too), chanting of the powerful Gayatri Mantra or any other 
mantras we are connected gives highly benificial results. Finally it 
leads us to sarwasya saranagati and complete detachment. As human 
mind needs variety, we can increase our sadhana time by trying all 
these different approaches. 
Indeed this is also great time. As technology advanced 
very well with internet and computers, now we can have a great 
awareness on many spiritual topics. We can read and analyze about 
various kinds of spiritual practises and choose which one fits best 
to our temper irrespective of religion. 

However as sri Sivananda swami told as ounce of 
practise is better than tons of theory. Let us practise, practise, 
practise until being one with oneness.


Thanks and Regards
Kumar Ghanta
