Namaste,
 
Gayatri mantra is essentially a mantra for self-realization. It =
can awaken Kundalini and make Kundalini reach higher chakras. It can even p=
ut one in samadhi. It is too powerful a mantra. Veda mantras in general are=
 powerful and Savitri Gayatri mantra is one of the most potent ones.
 
Howe=
ver, pronunciation and intonation have to be perfect when meditating with a=
 veda mantra. Very very very few people today are capable of pronouncing Ve=
da mantras perfectly while maintaining a calm and detached mind at the same=
 time. Thus, very few people actually *experience* Veda mantras.
 
One may =
definitely get things like what you described. One may get income growth, i=
ntelligence, good predictions, good health etc. But those are not the real =
purpose of this mantra.
 
*        *        *
 
I will mention an allegory.=

 
If one has a small aeroplane, one can use it to drive around on a hillsi=
de country road and enjoy beautiful scenery of hills, valleys, villages, tr=
ees, green pastures, fields and lakes. But then, the true purpose of the ae=
roplane is to get away from all those things, soar high and fly in the sky.=
 One not knowing it may only drive around on roads, enjoy the scenery and m=
ay even feel proud of what he is able to do with his aeroplane. One knowing=
 what the aeroplane is really for may still be unable to fly because he doe=
s not know how to fly.
 
*        *        *
 
I will speak in terms of a m=
etaphor.
 
This life is a drama. We are actors in the drama. I am not sugge=
sting that you should mess up your role in the drama. Do continue to play y=
our role in the drama. But do so with a full understanding that this is jus=
t a drama, that it will end one day and that you may get a new role in a ne=
w drama. An actor who is supposed to do great deeds in a drama can do them =
without thinking foolishly that he is great because he is doing those great=
 deeds. An actor who is praised by all in a drama can be praised by everybo=
dy without taking it personally and feeling great about it. An actor who is=
 supposed to be faulted and hated by everybody in the drama can get faulted=
 and hated by everyone without taking it personally and feeling bad about i=
t. Whether something good or bad happens, it is just happening to a charact=
er in the drama. One should be able to detach oneself from the character on=
e is playing and go through with the role without attaching oneself to the =
experiences - good or bad - of that character.
 
A full understanding of th=
is fact of life and imbibing that understanding fully in one's attitude, th=
oughts and actions is what one needs to progress spiritually. The rest - li=
ke being able to make your role in the drama do what you like and being abl=
e to make your role in the drama avoid things you do not like - are irrelev=
ant. Any things that are only making you get caught further in the drama wi=
thout realizing its fakeness are not helping you, but getting you entangled=
 further. The true purpose of spiritual sadhana is to make you realize the =
fakeness of the drama and make you play your role in the drama without gett=
ing affected by it or getting carried away.
 
The true purpose of Gayatri m=
antra is to unentangle one and make one fully realize this fact of life. As=
 I said, it is the mantra of realizing the Self.
 
Its true purpose is not =
to make this thing or that thing happen in the *drama* of life, but to make=
 one *realize* that life is a drama and to give one the ability to *play* o=
ne's role in the drama without being *affected* by it.
 
*        *        =
*
 
Personally, Gayatri mantra is what brought most of the experiences, und=
erstanding and clarity that I could get in my spiritual life. It has been t=
he vehicle of my spiritual evolution. I am grateful to that mantra, to Moth=
er Savitri, Mother Gayatri and Maharshi Viswamitra.
 
*        *        *
 =

I am never a believer in counts. I have seen a lot of evidence of how coun=
t requirements spoil the way people do mantras and render them totally inef=
fective. Doing a mantra for 5 malas with better pronunciation, focus and pe=
ace/calmness of mind is far better than doing a mantra for 11 malas with fa=
ster and inaccurate pronunciation, less focus and an agitated mind.
 
We se=
e so many people doing powerful mantras for lakhs of times without experien=
cing much. I have also seen people experiencing great things very quickly w=
ith some mantras, without meeting any significant count requirements.
 
Sur=
render to your ishta devata, think of the mantra (Gayatri or whatever you d=
o) as just a small tool to purify yourself and to remove traces of ego from=
 your thoughts and actions and offer the mantra to your ishta devata.
 
Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Narsimhaji,

  I would like to k=
now about Gayatri Mantra in your words. I had very good experiences in my y=
oung age when I was doing Gayatri Japam. The very important result of this =
Mantra was, I was able to know certain events well in advance that time. I =
had told one of my friends that he will be transferred in next month to so =
and so place and he was transferred. This is just one example. I was able t=
o predict very correctly. Peace in my life with good growth of income I exp=
erienced. Much has been said for Gayatri Mantra but I have not read anythin=
g about this Mantra in this Forum hence this mail posted. 

  One great sai=
nt had said in his lectures that everybody should recite at least 11 Malas =
(108 x 11) along with his routine worship

  Your write up and experiences =
if any will inspire us all.

  Dr. Ashwin Rawal
