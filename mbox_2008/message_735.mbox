Dear Utpal
=C2=A0
some ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is you and=
 
MahaGanapati (or some other deitiy). so even if some unwanted things 
hap=
pens, you can talk to the deity and say "it is you who is 
performing throu=
gh me so i need not worry. it is you who needs to 
worry about that afteral=
l. I eat, drink and make marry as thakur 
would say..Tension leneka nahi...=
Tension deneka :) lekin Homam karate 
raheneka."

Beautifully said -:).
=C2=
=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - =
Shiva Sutra

namaste

Namaste B=
harati !!!

I too thought about it the same way as you mentioned. but as yo=
u and 
Narasimha Garu Mentioned, God'll decide our worth and why should we =

bother about that. we should be doing just HER work without any sense 
of =
pride and It is Much much much more difficult to achieve than 
said. 

Nara=
simha has really made the difference with me and i am sure with 
many other=
s as well. he has clarified some really nagging doubts. He 
has effectively=
 convinced me that Pride is the one what needs to be 
controlled and finall=
y annihilate. in my case, whenever i did some 
sadhana, i would feel some p=
ride which used to go unnoticed by me 
most of the times. Now atleast i've =
started acknowledging it and 
that, in my opinion is the first step. once y=
ou acknowledge some 
errors then only you can take a corrective steps.

He =
has also blew away a big burden from my heart and that is the 
burden of Lo=
nging for subtle experiences.

and there are some other things which was cl=
arified very effectively 
which i would mention some other time.

the follo=
wing sentences of his would be really inspirational for many

>Don't worry =
about mundane things like respect, disrespect, 
>silliness, smartness, eloq=
uence, disorganized writings etc. We are 
>not here to impress anyone, incl=
uding our gurus or sishyas. We are 
>here to do sadhana, become pure, reali=
ze our mission, finish the 
>mission and then give up the body.

some ligth=
er thought from me: During Havan, it is you and 
MahaGanapati (or some othe=
r deitiy). so even if some unwanted things 
happens, you can talk to the de=
ity and say "it is you who is 
performing through me so i need not worry. i=
t is you who needs to 
worry about that afterall. I eat, drink and make mar=
ry as thakur 
would say..Tension leneka nahi...Tension deneka :) lekin Homa=
