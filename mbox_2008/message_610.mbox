Dear Ashwin ji,
 
It is a very interesting episode you have narrated! Thank=
 you for sharing it.
 
After Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw =
him in embodied form.
 
That is entirely possible. When someone who did not=
 identify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bo=
dy and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom=
 and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and=
 he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in=
 that body. It is not that he is "alive" or "dead". It is just that he is i=
n every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realize=
d the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiz=
ation was intact even while leaving that body.
 
According to Sarada Mata, =
Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years and =
that all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 years.=
 Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that does=
 not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at the l=
ower level form may still be able to access his previous form.
 
Even after=
 the form of Rama left this world and the form of Krishna was born, a devot=
ee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be able to realize a dar=
shan of the form of Rama.
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an=
 avatara.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Subject: Shri Shri THAKUR is still ali=
ve today

        Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great Devine ex=
perience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experience that =
I have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly as =
was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly r=
ead this only when you are in religious mood.

         

        I was wor=
king as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My duty was from=
 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra duty. There wa=
s a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=
=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai =
Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He was a st=
aunch devotee of    shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was a=
lways talking about shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a week=
ly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs c=
reated by him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kath=
amrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturd=
ay evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used=
 to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only abo=
ut Thakur.

        One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=
=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and my wife is remember=
ing me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go no=
w=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. 
=

        At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane cras=
h tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him. He =
could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me =
not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus sta=
tion but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This was=
 surprising.

        This all incidents made me to believe that he had som=
e super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attract=
ed to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Tha=
kur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thak=
ur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply =
from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. 

        =
Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taki=
ng the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morni=
ng. I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnade=
v as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=
=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhams=
a was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru =
should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you=
 take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=
=E2=80=9D--.

        Her arguments were right at her place as people in ge=
neral not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have=
 taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --

        But=
 I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their discip=
les to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I imme=
diately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come t=
o our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am li=
ving. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, wou=
ld you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D--

       =
 She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t bel=
ieve.=E2=80=9D--

        I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediatel=
y to justify my decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your=
 existence even today.=E2=80=99

        To our great surprise, Mr. Patel w=
as at my home at 06.30 in the morning with angry mood. What he told?

     =
   =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? =
Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 morning=
s today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blan=
ket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is wai=
ting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D

    =
    I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to you=
r house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbing him in su=
ch an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99

        We both were=
 so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. 

        I wi=
ll never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some m=
ore Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime.

   =
     Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth=
. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.  May Sh=
ri Thakur bless all of us.

        Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad
