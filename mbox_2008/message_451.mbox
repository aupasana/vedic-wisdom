For the reference on Yogananda, you can read =
the section on Swami Yogananda in "God Lived with Them: Life Stories of Six=

There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and s=
wamis in the last few thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramaha=
msa stands out in one way. He is one master who mastered every single path.=
 He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He w=
orshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even r=
eached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no "experience" . He=
 was in sahaja samadhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in =
people by mere touch or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had z=
ero ego (that is why he could do all that!!!).
=C2=A0
Many "gurus" force th=
eir dharma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true natur=
e and dharma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they ch=
ant, worship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna=
 had deep insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific ins=
tructions. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and=
 totally different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory=
 things to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggres=
sive attitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded "shame=
 on you. With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought sham=
e to him. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will pl=
ace your guru in a good stead and not your aggression". When another sishya=
 who needed to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by som=
e people and came away silently, he scolded him
 "shame on you. Shastras sa=
y that you should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such w=
rong behavior? You should give them a piece of your mind."
=C2=A0
Spiritual=
 sadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra=C2=A0or repeating a procedure=
 everyday for a certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous p=
rocess by which one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself=
. That way, every action and every thought=C2=A0becomes a sadhana and offer=
s an opportunity for introspection and transformation of=C2=A0internal atti=
tude.
=C2=A0
Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal =
sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of sadhakas a=
nd he was an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of sishyas.
=C2=A0
Wi=
thout his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would be lower than=
 dirt. I would not be able to say anything intelligent or meaningful in spi=
ritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspired by something I write shoul=
d be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and to Sri Ramakrishna for shower=
ing their grace using me as an instrument and not to me.
=C2=A0
BTW, you ar=
e all free to forward my posts that you like to people who may be intereste=

Namaste,

As Vimalananda says, dharma =
is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in 
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your ow=
n dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone 
else's dharma".

Following the=
 path of dharma basically means engaging in the right 
action/duty. Right a=
ction varies from person to person, from time to time 
and from place to pl=
ace. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, 
which in turn is bas=
ed on who you have been in the past, what actions you 
did in the past whil=
e identifying with the action, who you affected in the 
past (and how) with=
 the actions that you identified with, what debts you 
created in the proce=
ss, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until 
now.

If, based on on=
e's mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
to kill evil=
 persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
tendencies =
and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of 
uniformit=
y of all religions, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental t=
endencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the 
ritual of =
homam in the world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental t=
endencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of 
money a=
nd construct a temple, that becomes one's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a b=
eing may change from one life to another.

At the time of Mahabharata war, =
it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, 
elders and relatives. The time t=
hen was such that there was too much weight 
on earth and nature wanted ear=
th to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous 
destruction was to take place=
 and civilization destroyed to a great extent, 
to welcome Kali yuga and se=
t the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, 
it was his dharma to faci=
litate that. Some people he deeply loved and 
respected were on the other s=
ide and it was his dharma to kill them.

When the same Arjuna was born agai=
n in the 19th century as one of 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami =
Yogananda had been Arjuna in a 
previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , =
his dharma was different in this 
new time and place. He was born to renoun=
ce material life despite his 
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple l=
ife of a monk and inspire 
generations to embrace a simple life of mental d=
etachment and service to 
others. When he is born again (which he has to, a=
s per what Ramakrishna 
said), his dharma based on the time and place may b=
e something else.

* * *

The tricky question is: How does one decide what =
is one's dharma?

Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "foll=
ow your own dharma 
and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism.=
 Though the concept 
of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long=
 time, the concept of 
caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a sh=
udra who lived by 
killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later=
. Vishwamitra was a 
kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana an=
d and a maharshi 
later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One starts o=
ff with the varna 
of father, because that is what one is exposed to in chi=
ldhood. As one 
develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what on=
e does.

Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to =
know your 
dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 =
dharmas in 
the world. Each person has individual dharma.

Knowing what one=
's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure 
enough, one will =
*know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
mind that tells=
 us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of 
noise from other =
parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get 
confused.

We sho=
uld make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and 
deci=
de what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
th=
e best we can is all that we can do!

More than following dharma, what is o=
f utmost importance is to engage in 
actions without identification. *That*=
 alone ensures that we are not 
accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasin=
g the load. We should not build 
too much attachment to what we are doing. =
We should engage in the best 
possible actions (based on our best judgment =
on what our dharma in the given 
situation is), with as little attachment a=
nd self-identification with the 
action as possible. When the action is fin=
ished, we should leave the result 
to god. We should not think "I did it", =
"what will happen now", "will it 
work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama kar=
ma yoga (unfication through 
untached action) will simplify our ego and pur=
ify our consciousness slowly. 
As we become purer, our mind will work sharp=
er and tell our dharma clearer. 
There is a positive feedback here. This wi=
ll slowly enable us to see our 
dharma clearly and follow it without incurr=
ing new karmas. This is not easy, 
but not as difficult as people think.

T=
he bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of=
 
"this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in action with =

little attachment.

* * *

In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and i=
ntuition are the inputs. 
Another external input is the words of scriptures=
 and learned men. One can 
derive one's dharma from them. A special place i=
s given to one's spiritual 
master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master=
, one can take the words of 
the master to determine one's dharma and follo=
w it sincerely.

When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and tho=
ught killing gurus 
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna =
who clarified his 
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confus=
ed about his dharma 
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =
place to do sadhana, 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him =
to stay in the material 
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One who =
is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
debts =
are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what 
one's=
 dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into 
on=
e's inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline i=
s that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
declare that =
as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from 
time to time=
 and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
out what o=
ne's dharma is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's 
dharma by=
 increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
sadhana (=
like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much 
attachment, on=
e can slowly purify oneself and refine one's understanding of 
one's indivi=
dual dharma.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed=
 personal. Krishna clearly says in <BR>Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dhar=
ma. It is dangerous to follow someone <BR>else's dharma".<BR><BR>Following =
the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right <BR>action/duty. R=
ight action varies from person to person, from time to time <BR>and from pl=
ace to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, <BR>which in=
 turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you <BR>did i=
n the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the <BR>p=
ast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you <BR=
>created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until <=
BR>now.<BR><BR>If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic debts, natur=
e wants a person <BR>to kill evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, b=
ased on one's mental <BR>tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person=
 to spread
 the message of <BR>uniformity of all religions, that becomes on=
e's dharma. If, based on one's <BR>mental tendencies and karmic debts, natu=
re wants a person to spread the <BR>ritual of homam in the world, that beco=
mes one's dharma. If, based on one's <BR>mental tendencies and karmic debts=
, nature wants a person to make a lot of <BR>money and construct a temple, =
that becomes one's dharma.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The dharma of a being may ch=
ange from one life to another.<BR><BR>At the time of Mahabharata war, it wa=
s Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, <BR>elders and relatives. The time the=
n was such that there was too much weight <BR>on earth and nature wanted ea=
rth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous <BR>destruction was to take p=
lace and civilization destroyed to a great extent, <BR>to welcome Kali yuga=
 and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, <BR>it was his dhar=
ma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and <BR>respected were o=
n
 the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.<BR><BR>When the same =
Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of <BR>Ramakrishna Paramah=
amsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a <BR>previous life, ac=
cording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this <BR>new time and=
 place. He was born to renounce material life despite his <BR>aristocratic =
upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire <BR>generations t=
o embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to <BR>others. Whe=
n he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna <BR>said), his=
 dharma based on the time and place may be something else.<BR><BR>* * *<BR>=
<BR>The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?<BR><B=
R>Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dhar=
ma <BR>and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the c=
oncept <BR>of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long
 time, th=
e concept of <BR>caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra w=
ho lived by <BR>killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. V=
ishwamitra was a <BR>kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana an=
d and a maharshi <BR>later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One start=
s off with the varna <BR>of father, because that is what one is exposed to =
in childhood. As one <BR>develops in life, one gets one's own varna based o=
n what one does.<BR><BR>Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words whic=
h tells you to know your <BR>dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, the=
re are not just 4 dharmas in <BR>the world. Each person has individual dhar=
ma.<BR><BR>Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one=
 is pure <BR>enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have =
a part of our <BR>mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surround=
ed by a lot of <BR>noise from other parts of our minds
 which tell other th=
ings. Thus, we get <BR>confused.<BR><BR>We should make the best judgment co=
mbining discrimination and intuition and <BR>decide what is our dharma and =
follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing <BR>the best we can is all th=
at we can do!<BR><BR>More than following dharma, what is of utmost importan=
ce is to engage in <BR>actions without identification. *That* alone ensures=
 that we are not <BR>accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=
 We should not build <BR>too much attachment to what we are doing. We shoul=
d engage in the best <BR>possible actions (based on our best judgment on wh=
at our dharma in the given <BR>situation is), with as little attachment and=
 self-identification with the <BR>action as possible. When the action is fi=
nished, we should leave the result <BR>to god. We should not think "I did i=
t", "what will happen now", "will it <BR>work" etc. Such adherence of nishk=
ama karma yoga (unfication through <BR>untached
 action) will simplify our =
ego and purify our consciousness slowly. <BR>As we become purer, our mind w=
ill work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. <BR>There is a positive feedb=
ack here. This will slowly enable us to see our <BR>dharma clearly and foll=
ow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, <BR>but not as diffic=
ult as people think.<BR><BR>The bottomline is: Even if one is not following=
 one's dharma, one's sense of <BR>"this is my dharma" gets refined with tim=
e if one engages in action with <BR>little attachment.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>=
In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the inputs. <BR=
>Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can=
 <BR>derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to one's spiri=
tual <BR>master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the =
words of <BR>the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerely.<=
BR><BR>When Arjuna was confused about
 what his dharma was and thought kill=
ing gurus <BR>and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who cl=
arified his <BR>dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused =
about his dharma <BR>and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =
place to do sadhana, <BR>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon h=
im to stay in the material <BR>world and do the work of Mother for him.<BR>=
<BR>One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what o=
ne's <BR>debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment=
 of what <BR>one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clea=
r insight into <BR>one's inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.=
<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set=
 of principles and <BR>declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from =
person to person, from <BR>time to time and from place to place. Also, ther=
e are no thumbrules to find
 <BR>out what one's dharma is. But, one can ref=
ine one's understanding of one's <BR>dharma by increasing internal purity. =
By doing various kinds of spiritual <BR>sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=
 engaging in actions without much <BR>attachment, one can slowly purify one=
self and refine one's understanding of <BR>one's individual dharma.<BR><BR>=
