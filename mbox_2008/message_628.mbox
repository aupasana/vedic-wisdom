Dear Sir, I have read that chapter. I have always faith on such great souls=
. But the problem and confusion is I have read 3 autobiographies, including=
=C2=A0Shri Ram Sharmaji=C2=A0wherein it is mentioned that the authors were=
=C2=A0 Thakur himself in=C2=A0their previous birth.=C2=A0Two were=C2=A0from=
 Gujarat. One was Swami yogeshwarji who lived his life in Himalayas and oth=
er was Mr. Nathalal from Gondal, Saurashtra, Gujarat. I have met all these =
three. All were on very high state of mind and living spiritual life. It is=
 beyond our capacity to judge what is right and what is hallucination...!=
=C2=A0 As Mr. Narsimhaji told I believe only Thakur as he is alive for me t=
oday.

Respected Ashwinji
This is a ver=
y good and inspiring thread. 
I would like to mention something that may be=
 an interesting insight.
You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. He actual=
ly said in his
autobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My Inheritances =
and Will,
loosely translated) that once when he was 14 years old and sittin=
g for
his Morning Sandhya, a divine figure appeared, guru
Sarweshwaranandji=
. His Guru then made him realise his past lives and
gave him the work for t=
his life.
He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realised that he h=
ad
been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before that Guru of
Cha=
trapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.

I will try to locate the exact link and sen=
d it.The general site is
www.awgp.org I remember the book is there on pdf i=
n English somewhere
online. It's in the very first few chapters.

Thanks

was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=

Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was al=
ways talking about
shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekl=

his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs cr=
eated by
him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna
Katha=

on Saturda=

He could fores=

told me not to go t=

went to Bus station but bu=

on the way. This was surprising=

this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to

Thakur and the day ca=
me. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself
to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=

deeply from my heart to a=

while taking the tea. As my duty wa=

up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in =

accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife =
was annoyed and she
argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD"=E2=80=9CWhy s=

Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee o=

Yesterday was my night duty and I ha=

mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or =
2 hours. Suddenly Thakur
pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to=
