Dear Nalini
=C2=A0
Sorry for interrupting in your question to Narasimha.You=
r mail reminded me of a similar incident.=C2=A0I have a friend who does ver=
y severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. It was a strange dre=
am where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on her lap and when she=
 asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the reply came in sanskrit. Now my =
friend does not know or even understand Sanskrit, so she could not understa=
nd what the girl was saying. Then after some time the girl in the dream kep=
t repeating what sounded like a mantra in her ears.
=C2=A0
>From next day mo=
rning my friend started chanting that mantra, after about one and half year=
s of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for chanting and had experinces s=
imilar to the kind u described. She felt her whole body was internally burn=
ing, though there was no fever. Her relation with her mom started getting b=
itter with constant fights etc..
=C2=A0
Later after some days it reduced ag=
ain. I think this maybe a way the karmas are cut off from you. I am not sur=
e of course, Narasimha can tell you better. He much more knowledgeable in=
=C2=A0 these things.

Dear Al=

Yes, indeed.
I=C2=A0had a doubt that I wanted to ask Na=

I=C2=A0vaguely remember Narasimha ji telli=

Guys,

I am glad everything is sorted ou=
t. But, in general, let us be less 
defensive and instead focus on subject.=
 Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly what he meant. However, even if Aji=
t or someone actually said 
something negative about me, it is not a big de=
al. One is who one is and 
words, good or bad, do not change that, for bett=
er or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

Ajit, you are certainly qual=
ified in commenting. I always knew that you have 
tremendous scholarship, g=
reat humility and sincerity. People far less 
qualified than you talk/write=
 so much in today's world. Please do write 
more.

The imagery thrown up by=
 the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman=
 is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
self-cont=
rol.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hrishika + ish=
a =3D 
lord of senses). He can be worshipped for control over senses.

Moth=
er Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be 
worshi=
pped for getting rid of desires.

Several things are possible. But, for mos=
t people in today's times, it is 
not going to be one magic bullet that doe=
s it, but a combination of various 
practices. Patience is needed.

Try to =
increase the understanding of what is permanent and what is 
transient.

Be=
st regards,
Narasimha
