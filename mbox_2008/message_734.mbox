namaste

Namaste Bharati !!!

I too thought about it the same way as you me=
ntioned. but as you and 
Narasimha Garu Mentioned, God'll decide our worth =
and why should we 
bother about that. we should be doing just HER work with=
out any sense 
of pride and It is Much much much more difficult to achieve =
than 
said. 

Narasimha has really made the difference with me and i am sur=
e with 
many others as well. he has clarified some really nagging doubts. H=
e 
has effectively convinced me that Pride is the one what needs to be 
con=
trolled and finally annihilate. in my case, whenever i did some 
sadhana, i=
 would feel some pride which used to go unnoticed by me 
most of the times.=
 Now atleast i've started acknowledging it and 
that, in my opinion is the =
first step. once you acknowledge some 
errors then only you can take a corr=
ective steps.

He has also blew away a big burden from my heart and that is=
 the 
burden of Longing for subtle experiences.

and there are some other t=
hings which was clarified very effectively 
which i would mention some othe=
r time.

the following sentences of his would be really inspirational for m=
any

>Don't worry about mundane things like respect, disrespect, 
>sillines=
s, smartness, eloquence, disorganized writings etc. We are 
>not here to im=
press anyone, including our gurus or sishyas. We are 
>here to do sadhana, =
become pure, realize our mission, finish the 
>mission and then give up the=
 body.

some ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is you and 
MahaGana=
pati (or some other deitiy). so even if some unwanted things 
happens, you =
can talk to the deity and say "it is you who is 
performing through me so i=
 need not worry. it is you who needs to 
worry about that afterall. I eat, =
drink and make marry as thakur 
would say..Tension leneka nahi...Tension de=
neka :) lekin Homam karate 
raheneka."

Warm Regards,

Utpal
