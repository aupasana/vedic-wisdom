Dear Narasimhaji

I came across a verse in the Rig Veda. 

"11 Let us serve=
 Agni with our hymns, Disposer, fed on ox and cow,"


http://www.sacred-tex=
ts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08043.htm

Does that mean cow sacrifice was allowed in=
 Vedic times?

Kindly enlighten us on the meaning of this verse.

-Regards
