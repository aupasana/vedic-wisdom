Dear Sir,

MahaLakshmi Ashtottadashnaam (108 Names) can be recited without =

saying 'Swaha'. Infact Narasimha Garu is eciting 108 Names for 108 
times =
Every Friday for last 13 years or so..

I think you can recite either 108 N=
ames or SriSukt or Mahalakshmi 
Ashtakam or anyother prayer....the point is=
 stcking to one generally 
and consistency.

just for the inspiration.

Utpal
