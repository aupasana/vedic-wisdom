The group of "Vedichistory" endeavors to be a professional forum on
indolog=
y and Vedic history on one hand and a meeting place of like
minds, exchangi=
ng their views here,on the other.

The supreme spiritual antenna of Indian thought, Vedas have a place
unpa=
ralleled not only in Hinduism, but also in the world wide
scriptural litera=
ture. They are the oldest of the world scriptures.

Vedas, literally meanin=
g the (true) knowledge, are not only the
epitomes of philosophical, spiritu=
al and religious vision, dogmas and
aptitudes, but also are a storehouse of=
 sociological
processes, historical events and verily, the
cultural thread =
of the Indian subcontinent. However, most of us,
whether Indians or foreign=
ers, have failed to read correctly into
these great literature.

In an atte=
mpt to understand these super scriptures, I have not only
created web pages=
 http://www.geocities.com/siva_sai19/vedas, which
have had a wide acclamati=
on from the netizens, but also recently
started a group on Vedic history.

=
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedichistory

This group endeavors to read in=
to the currently available Vedas and
make the reading a commentary on the h=
istorical, cultural and
spiritual saga of ancient India

However, in Vedic =
history, instead of projecting my views, I like
more learned and the common=
ers alike to join and exchange views.

I cordially invite every one of you,=
 especially the spiritually
elevated, to join my group to make it a success=
 and useful to others.

groups.yahoo.com/group/vedichistory/join 

I hope y=
ou will join and actively participate in this
humble, yet noble and holy, e=
ndeavor.
