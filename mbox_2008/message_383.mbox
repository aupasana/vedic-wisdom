Namaste,
 
Thanks for the link. Yes, the person in the video is my guru Dr =
Manish Pandit. He is the same person mentioned in the introduction of the h=
omam manuals as the one instructed by Her to spread homam.
 
He performs ho=
mam using a slightly different procedure, but it is mostly similar to what =
we taught in the manual. The video is only 6 or 7 minutes long. So obviousl=
y it is not the entire homam. It is only a part of it.
 
He asked me to rec=
ord a video just like the audio, with exactly what is in the manual, and pu=
t it on the web. But it never worked out so far.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
