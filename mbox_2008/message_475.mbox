Dear Members please find herewith my 3rd Astro Capsule.
    If Moon is in t=
he 6th house with Mercury alone or Moon is in Gemini 
or Virgo in 6th, the =
person born will be the patient of Obsessive 
Compulsive Disorders. These p=
atients are under chronic anxiety and are 
compelled to wash their hands , =
touch certain things, count the same 
things repeatedly, do certain actions=
 just by force from within and 
they think that If they will not do this, c=
ertain horrible will happen 
to them. After obeying this order from  mind t=
hey will be relaxed and 
will be seen normal. THey are suffering from unkno=
wn fear.
Dr. Ashwin Rawal
