In a small town, a person decided to open up his Bar  usiness, which was right opposite to the Temple. The Temple & its congregation  started a campaign to block the Bar from opening with petitions and  prayed daily against his business.

Work progressed. However, when it was almost complete and was about  to open a few days later, a strong lightning struck the Bar and it  was burnt to the ground.

The temple folks were rather smug in their outlook after that, till the Bar owner sued the Temple authorities on the grounds that the Temple through its congregation & prayers was ultimately responsible for the demise of his bar shop, either through direct or indirect actions or means. 

In its reply to the court, the temple vehemently denied all 
responsibility or any connection that their prayers were reasons to the bar shop's demise. As the case made its way into court, the judge looked over the paperwork at the hearing and commented:

"I don't know how I'm going to decide this case, but it appears from 
the paperwork, we have a bar owner who believes in the power of 
prayer and we have an entire temple and its devotees that dont."
