Respected Sir,
   
  Thank you for your reply. I see your point though I do not completely agree to either of the veiw points or logics.
   
  Yes the interpretation of the shatras are in unison. But then Sri Yukteshwar also mentions that the post the mahabharata war, the interpretation of the scriptures as well as the manu smriti was misguided by wrong connotations which resulted in the error having creeped in. 
   
  Actually what is interesting in the theory is the concept of the binray oppostise for the sun. Generally science at this point does not accept such a view,(neitehr does it categorically reject the same), its still open to speculation and research. And astronomy being the kind of science that it is, enough data or sameples cannot really be gathered for proper testing since the time scales are so vast. The other debatable issue with Sri Yukteshwars theory is that the precission of the equinoxes should be around 25,770 years which is in variace with the 24000 years scheme given by him. But then the equinoxes may not( one of the scientic views) move at fixed rates or the motion maybe such that over sufficient theoritical distances in space it averages out to create a 24000 years scheme. 
   
  Anyway only future can tell for sure what is correct and what is not.  As per his theory the Kalki Avatar will come when the equinox will reach a certain point in the leo aquarius axis. 
   
  -Regards
   Rajarshi

Well, all shastras are clear. Common Hindu understanding is clear. Millions 
of Hindus mention the current yuga as Kali yuga before doing any pooja and 
religiously keep count of the years that passed in Kali yuga. Moreover, when 
I see the happenings in the world and how dharma is deteriorating compared 
to even a few hundred years back, I cannot think that anything other than 
Kali yuga is running right now. I reject the notion that Kali yuga is only 
1200 years and that we are in Dwapara yuga right now.

Even great souls can advance incorrect or partially correct understanding at 
times, because there is some purpose.

I reject the teaching of Yukteshwar Maharaj related to yugas and yet retain 
respect for him and his lineage.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<div>Respected Sir,</div>  <div> </div>  <div>Thank you for your reply. I see your point though I do not completely agree to either of the veiw points or logics.</div>  <div> </div>  <div>Yes the interpretation of the shatras are in unison. But then Sri Yukteshwar also mentions that the post the mahabharata war, the interpretation of the scriptures as well as the manu smriti was misguided by wrong connotations which resulted in the error having creeped in. </div>  <div> </div>  <div>Actually what is interesting in the theory is the concept of the binray oppostise for the sun. Generally science at this point does not accept such a view,(neitehr does it categorically reject the same), its still open to speculation and research. And astronomy being the kind of science that it is, enough data or sameples cannot really be gathered for proper testing since the time scales are so vast. The other debatable issue with Sri Yukteshwars theory is that the
 precission of the equinoxes should be around 25,770 years which is in variace with the 24000 years scheme given by him. But then the equinoxes may not( one of the scientic views) move at fixed rates or the motion maybe such that over sufficient theoritical distances in space it averages out to create a 24000 years scheme. </div>  <div> </div>  <div>Anyway only future can tell for sure what is correct and what is not.  As per his theory the Kalki Avatar will come when the equinox will reach a certain point in the leo aquarius axis. </div>  <div> </div>  <div>-Regards</div>  <div> Rajarshi</div>  <div> </div>  <div><BR><BR><B><I>"Narasimha P.V.R.

 community when I came<BR>> across this mail. This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar<BR>> Giris calculations of the yugas.<BR>><BR>> Firstly let me clarify that I personally am no vedic scholar, nor<BR>> can I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea of what or who is<BR>> right. But I had the good fortune of reading the book "The Holy<BR>> Science" where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must<BR>> have read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had<BR>> instructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he<BR>> could meet the Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri<BR>> Maharaj had completed his book, that very day he met the Mahamauni<BR>> who was sitting under a tree with his disciples. Infact the incident<BR>> goes this way that as the Mahamauni had promised Yukteshwar Giri<BR>> that he would meet him once the book get written. So as Sri<BR>> Yukteshwar Giri was passing
 by in the morning to take a bath<BR>> suddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And<BR>> the first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to<BR>> to bring perfection in his vision by increasing his meditation<BR>> because had he done so he should have been able to see Him(the<BR>> Mahamauni) and his disciple inside the sunlight. Anyway that is<BR>> beside the point.<BR>> What I was wondering is that, if the calculation of yugas as given<BR>> by Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then that means even the Mahamauni Babaji<BR>> blessing the book and meeting him in kumb and again later is also<BR>> wrong. I mean all these people are way way way way ahead of me, but<BR>> even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadhaka or a yogi. He<BR>> is the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy."budhe babai<BR>> kisun hai".. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe baba.<BR>> And Kisun was Krishna. To
 think that, THAT supersoul specifically<BR>> blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong<BR>> calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.<BR>> I of my own have no knowledge or learning to be able to decide what<BR>> is right and what is not. I just voiced a concern of mine from the<BR>> point of view of an ordinary individual who considers the Mahamauni<BR>> to be one with God himself. If He is can make such a mistake, then<BR>> God is not really that omnipotent I guess.<BR>><BR>> -Regards<BR>> Rajarshi<BR>><BR>> --- In <A href="mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com">vedic-wisdom@<WBR>yahoogroups.<WBR>com</A>, "Narasimha P.V.R.

Can you please explain it.<BR>>><BR>>> Krita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,000<BR>> years long.<BR>>> Dwapara yuga is 864,000 years long.

He is a great yogi<BR>> and<BR>>> belongs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he<BR>> is simply<BR>>> wrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In<BR>> fact, time is<BR>>> a very
 weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we<BR>> are<BR>>> completely bound to this body in this particular space-time<BR>> continuum. When<BR>>> a yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for<BR>> him/her.<BR>>> The space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different realms<BR>> of<BR>>> consciousness are different.

The number mentioned (about<BR>> 5,000<BR>>> years) matches with the astronomical dating of Mahabharata.

 consistent manner about 5,000 years back. There were<BR>> tens of<BR>>> those eventsand they occurred in that sequence only once in the<BR>> last 7,400<BR>>> years.

 equally<BR>> valid to see<BR>>> them as real stories and as metaphors. When one's self-<BR>> consciousness ascends<BR>>> to a particular realm of consciousness, it is actually possible to<BR>> see one<BR>>> of these stories actually happening.

The story of Jupiter's wife Tara<BR>> begetting<BR>>> a child (Mercury) through Moon is real.

 here is my view. Hiranya means gold and<BR>> also<BR>>> great. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them is "sense organs".<BR>> The demon<BR>>> Hiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense organs. He stole Mother<BR>> earth and<BR>>> sunk Her in water. Mother earth is symbolized by Kundalini<BR>>> (self-consciousness<WBR>, microcosmic representation of the divine<BR>> Mother within<BR>>> each person) who is normally in the Mooladhara chakra (earth<BR>> element). When<BR>>> a sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense organs, Kundalini<BR>>> (self-consciousness<WBR>) is stuck in the samsara saagara (the ocean of<BR>> material<BR>>> life) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna in a person)<BR>> takes the<BR>>> form of a boar and comes from the nostril of the creator. He digs<BR>> in and<BR>>> rescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa guna enters the praana<BR>> (life<BR>>> force -
 nostril reference) of a person, dives down to Mooladhara<BR>> and<BR>>> destroys the attachment to the mighty sense organs there, the<BR>> Mother is<BR>>> freed and can move up to Merge with the Lord (i.e. self-<BR>> consciousness<BR>>> ascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Varaha avatara<BR>> represents the<BR>>> sattwa guna in a person that tries to give detachment from the<BR>> perceptions<BR>>> of the sense organs and then make the calm praana dives down to<BR>> Mooladhara<BR>>> to give balance to Kundalini to move up.<BR>>><BR>>> > -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how<BR>> is it<BR>>> > going to affect my spiritual life.
