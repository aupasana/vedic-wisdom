Namaste Narsimhaji,

Can u please expound more on this question :

 "when I=
 have my monthly periods, I am not supposed to say mantras.
But my mind is =
used to always silently repeating certain mantras and
that continues during=
 my periods also. What should I do?"

What is the reason behind not praying=
 at this time and what are the
Dos and Dont's to be followed.

Kind Regards=
,

Sunita

Of course, any clear-sighted=

repeat god's name, irrespective of =
