Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Today I performed a homa of Lord Bhairav along with=
 the additions that you recomended. It went very well, from now on I shall =
slowly try and incorporate more of the mantras/procedures as per your manua=
l. Thanks to you and Dr Manish Pandit, laymen like me are getting to learn =
things.
=C2=A0

Namaste,

Obviously, there are some previ=
ous samskaras that pulled you in this 
direction. That is good. This is wha=
t Vimalananda alluded to, when he said 
those who have the desire have no k=
nowledge and those who have the knowledge 
have no desire in this age. He a=
lso said, "if you have a deep desire to 
learn something, nature will find =
a way to teach you that".

If you see the super-short method, you will see =
that it is very similar to 
yours. Just add the ahutis to Prajapati, Agni e=
tc at the beginning and at 
the end. Before you call Bhairava, call Ganesha=
 in fire and make 8 aahuties 
with a simple mantra ("Om Gam Ganapataye Nama=
h" is fine). Then call Bhairava 
in fire. Make the offerings. After the ahu=
tis to Agni, Vaayu etc, give 
Poornaahuti. Basically follow the super-short=
 procedure. It is also ok to 
not do panchopachara pooja etc. You can be in=
formal with someone you know 
reasonably well.

Of course, you can continue=
 the way you were doing also, but the additions I 
am suggeting (ahutis at =
start/end and Ganesha) are small and worthwhile. As 
(if) you make addition=
s, do it with a positive frame of mind and do NOT 
worry about past. There =
is a reason for everything. Just leave the past and 
don't worry that you d=
id some "mistake". It is never a mistake to worship 
god in the way you kno=
w. God is always happy if you do the best job you can, 
with what you know.=
 But, as god gives you more knowledge, he may raise the 
bar for you. :-)

=
For invoking Ganapathi or Bhairava in fire, thinking of the form in the min=
d 
and requesting him mentally to come into the fire is sufficient.

Best r=
egards,
Narasimha
