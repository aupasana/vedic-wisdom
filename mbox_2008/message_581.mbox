Narasimha Garu,
Namaste,

my Apology for sending the Jyotisha content in th=
is forum.

few questions are arising while doing Homam which is listed as u=
nder;

1)'Suddhaanna Bali' offerings for Parshadas can be consumed later on=
 
by people as Prasad?

2) 'Two parallel lines' from Homam Kund to Aaasan c=
an be permanent 
or required to draw fresh everytime? what does those lines=
 mean?

3) 'Remains in Homa Kunad' can be used as *Raksha* or Raksha is onl=
y 
considered which is obtained from the procedure given.

4) The problem o=
f disposal of Nirmaalya (Remains of Homam-such as 
flowers, Akshataas, etc.=
.)is a issue especially in the city where i 
stay, due to local restriction=
s. to put it in a normal garbage is 
difficult physcologically. any suggeti=
ons from anybody?

--------------------------------------------------------=
----------
I need to share my experience about Dry coconut pieces. If one t=
akes 
a Dray coconut Half and presses it by holding in both Palms, it'll 
b=
reak in to 3 to 4 pieces. if required, one can further make one or 
two pie=
ces from those again by breaking it by using palms. I've 
experinced that t=
hose pieces works out to be very useful (Size wise) 
to sustain fire for lo=
ng time hence one can concentrate more in 
reciting Mantra then worrying ab=
out sustainance of fire. the another 
important advantage is that use of Kn=
ife can be completely avoided.

just one input if it helps some..

Warm Reg=
ards,
utpal
