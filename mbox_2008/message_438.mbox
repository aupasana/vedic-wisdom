Namaste,
 
There are really two different things here.
 
Some people are bo=
rn with an amsa (part) of a rishi's consciousness. For example, Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa said that Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was one of the seve=
n great rishis. Many people did meet him. Thus, meeting the physical manife=
station of an amsa of a rishi is not that difficult (though that also requi=
res some punya).
 
The second thing is to meet the physical manifestation o=
f the entire consciousness of a rishi. *That* is very very very difficult. =
As Vimalananda said, that may require a terrific amount of tapascharya (unl=
ess you are one of that rishi's people who came to do some work on earth an=
d have already done a terrific amount of tapascharya in past lives).
 
*   =
     *        *
 
One may wonder: If rishis are so great, why do they not g=
et moksha and why do they remain in physical manifestation?
 
Though the fo=
llowing is essentially like a kindergartener explaining Einstein's theory o=
f general relativity to fellow kindergarteners, I will nevertheless try to =
explain it.
 
All that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is creat=
ed by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no=
 duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variousl=
y as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undiv=
ided consciousness is known as "unmanifested Brahman". The world of duality=
, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahman only, bu=
t Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation. It is know=
n as "manifested Brahman". Both are Brahman only.
 
Normally, living in the=
 domain of duality without being deluded by some aspect of duality or the o=
ther is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understandi=
ng of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving all those object=
s of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single ob=
ject of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach=
 the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is=
 no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in that state fore=
ver. That is the advaitic experience of "nirvikalpa samadhi" and what happe=
ns in "moksha".
 
However, maharshis have described higher states. It is po=
ssible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at=
 the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses percei=
ving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying onen=
ess (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either=
 attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of obje=
cts by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some =
attractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain=
 in a state where there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object =
is possible.
 
Such a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna =
Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekanan=
da also experienced it.
 
Rishis are beings who are always in a very high s=
tate. They are always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perce=
ive objects of duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. I=
f one overcomes attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one ca=
n pretty much do anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled=
 by anything, it means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do =
anything for personal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakri=
ti) and implements the wish of nature through one's actions, which are perf=
ormed without any attachment or personal identification. One who has a pers=
onal ego can do limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do gr=
eat things. One who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does thin=
gs that are desired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can=
 change the course of history of nations and planets.
 
A rishi in this sta=
te may engage in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, t=
here is no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument=
 of Nature.
 
If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmani=
fested Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal=
 vision of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated=
). Thus, he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion.=
 Amsa of such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as =
a process running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some =
focussed task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initializa=
tion and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initializat=
ion etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the p=
rocess of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a V=
ivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initia=
lly and overcome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is =
the amsa of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.
 =

Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and=
 with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument o=
f Nature performing actions of tremendous consequences without any personal=
 ego driving those actions.
 
*        *        *
 
Worshipping the rishi o=
f one's gotra and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, ge=
tting the blessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of one=
's gotra is relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connection=
 with a specific rishi (apart from the rishi of one's gotra), one can worsh=
ip that rishi. However, it is not easy to know that.
 
Suppose several mant=
ras you find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific Maha=
rshi as the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. You c=
an try praying to him.

Narasimha

        Dear Narasimhaji

        I had a question=
 about Rishis. In the Aghora books, it is mentioned that the Rishis of yest=
eryears are still alive and roam around in this planet. There are signs on =
their body.And that only some who has done terrific amount of tapashya is e=
ligible to meet a Rishi. And also that praying to Rishi of ones gotra can h=
elp to acclerate ones spirtual progress. Kindly enlighten us with your thou=
ghts on this topic. I am really curious..

        Thanks in advance.

          Dear Prasad,

          I =
do not know any specific mantra. I know many mantras for which Kashyapa is =
rishi, but no mantra to pray to Kashyapa himself.

          There are many=
 mantras for Prajapati in general ("prajaapate na tvadetaanyanyo. .."), but=
 I don't know a mantra specifically to worship Kashyapa.

          If you =
perform a homam, you can add the following line after the poorvaangam (init=
ial five aahutis) and before the uttarangam.

          Om kashyapaaya swaa=
haa. kashyapaayedam na mama.

          Say it and make an offering of ghee=
 for Kashyapa.

          Another way to worship a rishi is to take section=
 of Veda for which he is the rishi and try to experience that section. You =
can simply pick one rik for which Kashyapa is rishi and keep meditating on =
that rik. You can close your eyes, keep back straight and repeat the rik me=
ntally with swaram without moving and do that everyday for a certain amount=
 of time. Oneday the rishi may be pleased with you and you may experience s=
omething.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

   <DIV>I had a question about Rishis. In the Aghora books, it is mentioned=
 
        that the Rishis of yesteryears are still alive and roam around in=
 this 
        planet. There are signs on their body.And that only some who=
 has done 
        terrific amount of tapashya is eligible to meet a Rishi.=
 And also that 
        praying to Rishi of ones gotra can help to acclerat=
e ones spirtual 
        progress. Kindly enlighten us with your thoughts o=
n this topic. I am 
        really curious..</DIV>
