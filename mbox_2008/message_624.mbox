Dear Narasimha ji,
Namaskar.
I am happy that something *positive* emerged!!=
!
Thank you for your guidance,
one other thing I wished to ask you and woul=
d you please answer if time permits?
One of my friends accidently touched t=
he chair I was sitting in and felt a jolt of charge a few days back but I d=
id not attribute it to myself. A couple of days back she casually touched m=
e on the shoulder and immediately retracted it saying it was like touching =
a live wire. Is it also due to the experiencing of the mantra? 

Sorry to h=
ave asked you to interpret personal experiences but I am clueless and highl=
y appreciative of the enormous *knowledge* of practise of spirituality you =
have rather than mere mouthing of wis(e)dom we get to see these days,

Rega=

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Nalini ji,
=C2=A0
Most people do not experience a =
mantra. They just mechanically chant it and nothing happens. What you descr=
ibed tells me that you were able to experience the manta to some extent. Th=
at is a good sign.
=C2=A0
Though I have never done the mantra you mentioned=
, from the name, I would imagine that this mantra makes energy flow in ping=
ala nadi.
=C2=A0
Different mantras, when they work, force energy to flow in=
 different subtle channel of energy flow in our subtle body, resulting in t=
he perception of a different "experience" to "self". Some mantras (e.g. try=
ambakam yajaamahe) are extremely cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chand=
ra) nadi. Some mantras (e.g. Savitri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Sury=
a) nadi.
=C2=A0
When merely some vaayu (movement of air) enters a nadi also=
, there is some experience. When the entire energy of self-awareness (aka K=
undalini) enters a nadi, it is a very powerful experience and one's percept=
ion of self alters drastically.
=C2=A0
There are thousands of nadis in the =
body and thousands of possible experiences. The key is to NOT be distracted=
 by the experience. Mystical experiences are signs of spiritual progress, b=
ut they are also traps where we can get stuck (i.e. not progress further). =
Do not think much about the experience. In a normal wakeful experience, our=
 senses perceive various objects of the external world. We know that all th=
at is just superficial and the reality within all of them (i.e. Brahman) is=
 imperceptible to senses. Similarly, whatever our inward-directed senses pe=
rceive (e.g. vision of a being, sound of a mantra, feeling of heat from fir=
e engulfing one etc) in an intense meditation session is ALSO superficial (=
though perhaps less superficial than the objects we see in the external wor=
ld usually) and the reality within those experiences (i.e. Brahman) is expe=
rienced only when you transcend the superficial sense experiences.
=C2=A0
W=
hile it is difficult, the right thing to do when you feel like you describe=
d is to ignore it and keep the intense mental focus on the mantra or on the=
 deity. The good thing is that your experience is a sign of spiritual progr=
ess and the bad thing is that it can distract you from the final goal.
=C2=
=A0
Feeling hot while and *after* meditation and fighting are signs of some=
 diturbation in the pingala nadi. When the corresponding karmas are flushed=
 out of the system, things may be fine.
=C2=A0
I am not really knowledgeabl=
e. With my guru's blessings, I have experienced some things and realized so=
me things. Then he told me to not hold back and boldly declare answers to q=
uestions on spirituality and religion as if I just know. I just follow his =
word and do as he said. It is upto my guru and the Mother to impregnate my =
words with meaning as they are received by people. From my end, I just type=
 out whatever comes to my mind...

Narasimha

Dear Nalini
=C2=A0
Sorry for interrup=
ting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar incid=
ent.=C2=A0I have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had rec=
ieved in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked=
, come and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) wa=
s, the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understa=
nd Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then aft=
er some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantr=
a in her ears.
=C2=A0
>From next day morning my friend started chanting that=
 mantra, after about one and half years of chanting recently she did a sank=
alpa for chanting and had experinces similar to the kind u described. She f=
elt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her r=
elation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..

Lat=
er after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way the karmas ar=
e cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell you better.=
 He much more knowledgeable in=C2=A0 these things.

Dear All,

=C2=A0
Yes, indeed.
I=C2=A0had a doubt that I wa=

time back. I had an unusual experience of 'being on fire',=C2=A0during the =

 receded over time. I had a similar experience during the Navaratri puja wh=
en reciting
Devi kavacham. I still have that feeling of an=C2=A0aura of fir=
e around me and feel extremely hot and sweat=C2=A0even in the cold weather.=
 This stays on for a time. I also had to face extreme circumstances in 'rel=
ationships' that matter to me and there is a steady deterioration, almost a=
s if a=C2=A0heavy veil has been torn asunder. 
I=C2=A0vaguely remember Nara=
simha ji telling us in some forum that there might be some ramifications re=
lating to karma that could manifest when/ after sadhana/worship.
Could you =
please clarify, Narasimha garu?

Guys=
,

I am glad everything is sorted out. But, in general, let us be less 
def=
ensive and instead focus on subject. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly=
 what he meant. However, even if Ajit or someone actually said 
something n=
egative about me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and 
words, good =
or bad, do not change that, for better or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words=
 then?

Ajit, you are certainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that=
 you have 
tremendous scholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far=
 less 
qualified than you talk/write so much in today's world. Please do wr=
ite 
more.

The imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is =
really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcame lust. He can=
 be worshipped for giving 
self-control.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and=
 control over senses (hrishika + isha =3D 
lord of senses). He can be worsh=
ipped for control over senses.

Mother Kaali gives dispassion and kills the=
 root of desires. She can be 
worshipped for getting rid of desires.

Sever=
al things are possible. But, for most people in today's times, it is 
not g=
oing to be one magic bullet that does it, but a combination of various 
pra=
ctices. Patience is needed.

Try to increase the understanding of what is p=
ermanent and what is 
transient.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Dear Nalini</DIV>
<DIV=
><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Sorry for interruptin=
g in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar incident=
. I have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had reciev=
ed in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked, c=
ome and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, =
the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understand =
Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then after =
some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantra i=
n her ears.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV=
>From next day morning my friend started chanting that mantra, after about =
one and half years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for chanting and=
 had experinces similar to the kind u described. She felt her whole body wa=
s internally burning, though there was no fever. Her relation with her mom =
started getting bitter with constant fights etc..</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<=
DIV>Later after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way the ka=
rmas are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell you =
better. He much more knowledgeable in  these things.</DIV>

<DIV>Ye=

<DIV>I had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasimha gar=
u. I recited Sree Hanumathbadabanala stotram some time back. I had an unusu=
al experience of 'being on fire', during the initial stages. It was as=
 if I was engulfed in a ball of fire, which slowly receded over time. I had=
 a similar experience during the Navaratri puja when reciting</DIV>
<DIV>De=
vi kavacham. I still have that feeling of an aura of fire around me an=
d feel extremely hot and sweat even in the cold weather. This stays on=
 for a time. I also had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' th=
at matter to me and there is a steady deterioration, almost as if a he=
avy veil has been torn asunder. </DIV>
<DIV>I vaguely remember Narasim=
ha ji telling us in some forum that there might be some ramifications relat=
ing to karma that could manifest when/ after sadhana/worship.</DIV>
<DIV>Co=

<DIV>Guys,<BR><BR>I am glad everything i=

write <BR>more.<BR><BR>The imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned=
