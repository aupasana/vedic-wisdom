Namaste Ashwin ji,

>>> But the Mahabharat is a story full of immaginations=
. Most of the
characters are immaginary       

Can you elaborate with quot=
ing a few samples of those 'imaginations'
and why you think that they are a=
bsolutely 'imaginations' and not
'reality'? However, if you are not sure an=
d the above was just a
statement intended to share 'what you like to believ=
e' then it is okay
and we respect that right of yours.

Regards,
-Prasad
