 Dear Narasimha,

When does Navratri end? It started on last Monday, September 29, 2008 and should therefore end on Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine Nights)...yet the panchang shows that at sunrise on Wednesday, October 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue our Navratri on Wednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day? (All these times are based on US EST)..

Also, can anyone do the Navarna mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim Chamundayai  Vicche" or does this require initiation?

Thanks,
Chandraprakash
