Dear Utpal Bhai and others,

Namaskar.
Yes. absolutely true. We are indeed =
fortunate that=C2=A0Manishji and Narsimhaji are amidst us to guide us as mo=
st people like me, being * blind* need not only a stick but also a *guide* =
to lead us. 

Though I know that astrology is not for this list, I still ca=
nnot but marvel at the generosity of the=C2=A0author of the astro software,=
 Jhora and each time I use it I cannot but wonder at his selflessness.
Even=
 at the cost of sycophancy I cant but praise Sri Narasimha ji's efforts, it=
 is the gratitude from the bottom of the hearts of people who genuinely lov=
e him

May his tribe increase!!
May the Divine Mother shower Her choicest B=
lessings on him,

Nalini
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Nalini Bahen, Rajarshi &=
 other members,

I normally don't praise Narasimha much because esle i have=
 to write 
words of praise always. Each & every message of his is outstandi=
ng 
which clears one or other doubt of us.

I actually *love* him that is h=
ow i would summerise my feelings.

following are very emotional words extra=
cted from one of the recent 
messages of Shri Narayan, which aptly tells ho=
w i and am sure many 
others would be feeling for him

"We should really th=
ank
our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding
us=
 ... what would be life without them!"

I am in Love with this beloved bagg=
er !!!

Emotional Regards,

Utpal

<DIV>Yes. absolutely true. We are indeed fortunate th=

<DIV>Though I know that astrology is not for this =

<DIV>Even at the cost of sycophancy I cant but praise Sri=
 Narasimha ji's efforts, it is the gratitude from the bottom of the hearts =
of people who genuinely love him</DIV>

 <BR>not like <BR>> too many people to beg in the same area. However, th=
is begging is <BR>different <BR>> and there is no competition between di=
fferent beggars. The owner <BR>of the <BR>> house has enough to give to =
every beggar and does not mind giving <BR>to many <BR>> beggars at the s=

something, it will be so much that <BR>he/she can <BR>> share some of it=
 with all around him/her. If you go with 100 other <BR>beggars <BR>> and=
 beg, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt <BR>the heart =
of <BR>> the owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it to=
 <BR>varying <BR>> degrees!<BR>> <BR>> When I tell people about ex=
ternal practices such as homam and <BR>internal <BR>> practices such as =
surrender and detachment in actions, all I am
 <BR>really doing <BR>> is=
 to take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person <BR>lives. =
If <BR>> they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, thei=
r <BR>begging <BR>> will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hand=
s.<BR>> <BR>> I am only a beggar who can show a place where other beg=
gars can <BR>beg and I am <BR>> not really "capable" of anything more. P=

a, Sai Baba, Kabir, <BR>Jesus Christ, <BR>> Buddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar=
 etc. Try to understand what they are <BR>saying. <BR>> Try to integrate=
 some of it into your common sense, your way of <BR>thinking and <BR>> y=
our life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is <BR>inner <=
BR>> transformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some <BR>=
inspired <BR>> writings.<BR>> <BR>> Nobody can change you. You you=
rself can do it. You CAN do it, if <BR>you really <BR>> want to. Introsp=
ect and go to the root of your
 problems. If you <BR>introspect <BR>> an=
d analyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the <BR>root of it=
 <BR>> all. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, <B=
R>question why. <BR>> I am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally =
do. But, atleast <BR>analyze <BR>> why it is important and try to unders=
tand your inner motives. Scuh <BR>> introspection will eventually lighte=
n the clouds of fear, <BR>expectation, <BR>> attachment and pride that o=
ften color one's attitude.<BR>> <BR>> Introspect on your attitude and=
 motives and contemplate on the <BR>nature of <BR>> god. Meditate.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> In this age, there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lor=
d. <BR>Of course, <BR>> saying "I surrender to you. So give me x or y" i=
s NOT total <BR>surrender. Total <BR>> surrender means you take whatever=
 the Lord gives without questions <BR>and <BR>> expectations. If you can=
 manage it, you are all
 set!<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Homam=
 or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught <BR>by rishis.=
 <BR>> I know from experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables =
<BR>the inner <BR>> transformation. It is a very useful spiritual practi=
ce. I know <BR>people who <BR>> made (and are making) considerable spiri=
tual progress through <BR>regular <BR>> practice of homam. It is the mos=
t powerful method I know of and <BR>teaching it <BR>> is one of my tasks=
 for this life.<BR>> <BR>> Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your=
 daily schedule and <BR>start doing <BR>> Mahaganapathi homam everyday. =
After a few months, you should <BR>switch to <BR>> Vishnu sahasra naama =
homam (I will put it up on my website by <BR>then). THAT <BR>> should he=
lp you find your way in your spiritual life and strike <BR>the right <BR>&g=
t; balance between spiritual life and material life.<BR>> <BR>> The p=
urpose of
 material life on this earth is to perform actions <BR>to pay bac=
k <BR>> debts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress <B=
R>becomes <BR>> smoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life c=
annot <BR>become smooth. <BR>> However, without some spiritual progress,=
 actions in material life <BR>create <BR>> new debts. In the beginning, =
one needs to create a synergy between <BR>the two <BR>> and use the acti=
ons in material life to promote spiritual life. <BR>For true <BR>> spiri=
tual progress, most people cannot and should not run away <BR>from material=
 <BR>> life.<BR>> <BR>> Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yo=
ga Vaasishtham that <BR>action and <BR>> knowledge are two wings with wh=
ich the bird of manifested Self <BR>flies and <BR>> becomes liberated. A=
ction without correct knowledge creates pride, <BR>promote <BR>> ego and=
 binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without <BR>action
 <BR=
>> does not become complete because of the remaining debts and one is <B=
R>stuck. <BR>> One needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to =
become <BR>free.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> -=
