Namaste Sir,

Hoping you won't mind, I am sending this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without 
revealing your identity.

I will keep in mind what you suggested. I will add a few more homams slowly.

Regarding yantra:

If one has a yantra appropriate for the deity of homam, one can place the 
yantra inside the homa kundam (at the bottom). However, I do not consider it 
necessary. Fire is a powerful enough medium to invoke deities in. It is not 
necessary to have a yantra in addition.

Of course, if you have a charged yantra that was used by a reasonably pure 
person for a while in his rituals and you use it as the base of the fire in 
homa kundam, it can then enhance the divine presence in your homam. It can 
be helpful. However, it is not easy to find a charged yantra these days. It 
is difficult to know also.

Let me give an analogy. If one is opening a bank account, one can open with 
a zero balance and work hard to increase the balance. Or one can also look 
for someone who will donate $10,000 so that one can open a bank account with 
$10,000 balance at start. But the latter approach creates a distraction and 
the chance of success is low. So I tell people to forget all of that and 
just open an account with a small balance, keep working hard and save. They 
will evenutally have enough balance.

Things like using a charged yantra in homa kundam, charged idol in front of 
homa kundam and getting the main mantra of the homam given by a qualified 
guru in a proper diksha etc are like the latter case in the above analogy. 
One is better off starting off humbly and working one's way up. Start the 
ritual, surrender to the deity, work on your attitude with constant 
introspection and just be patient. That is a winning formula.

Of course, you can also use an uncharged yantra. But then, it does not 
really enhance your homam. It only serves to capture a little bit of the 
energy generated in your homam and become charged in time. Generating a 
charged yantra does not help you become purer. On the contrary, some energy 
of the homam is being diverted instead of being used to purify you. 
Moreover, now you have the responsibility of ensuring that the yantra is not 
misused later by anyone. Not worth it, unless there is someone truly 
deserving that you want to help by gifting the yantra and giving a head 
start..

Regarding the comment on Gayatri mantra in Aghora book:

In general, I found that Vimalananda is to be taken very seriously. He knows 
what he says and definitely does not fool around.

He may be correct. But the standard Savitri Gayatri mantra in Rigveda does 
have a great effect in purifying one. One need not worry about secrets that 
are not yet revealed to one and instead focus on using what one already has.

Regarding Navagraha homam:

Navagraha homam is more involved and not easy to do everyday. I will 
probably come to it last. There are others that are more suited for doing 
daily. Our goal is to create a community of sadhakas who do homam daily with 
a reasonably saattwik attitude in different places in India and world.

I was asked to teach homam of kroora grahas like Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Ketu 
before teaching a full Navagraha homam, because so many people suffer 
because of these planets. I started with Saturn. Homam for one planet is 
reasonable to do daily, while Navagraha homam is more time consuming. But it 
will come too, eventually.

Homa kunda construction:

Aghora book second part (Kundalini) has a very nice section on homam. Please 
refer to it for homa kunda construction. In general I recommend square and 
circle shapes only. Square is appropriate for most people for most purposes. 
When there is a serious problem and we are doing for relief from it, 
circular homa kundam is good.

Best regards,
Narasimha

AUM SRI SAI RAM
Respected Sri.Narasimha Rao Garu,
                                               Greetings from
<deleted>.At the outset on behalf of thousands of
beneficiaries let me offer my sincere thanks to you for the wonderful
presentation of various homams in the net.It is indeed a very great
service in kali yuga & Divine Mother will always have a special share
of blessings for you.It would be of a great help if you can put on the
net,Navagraha homam procedure,Dhanvantari homam,Lalitha homam,Rudra
homam & Mrityunjaya homam.With dedicated priests becoming a fading
race I feel people now have to gear up for doing fire rituals on their
own.Also I have some doubts.It is said that the homa kunda should have
a yantra placed inside appropriate to the diety being invoked;your
kind comments on it.Also I infer that you have gone through
Dr.Svoboda's Aghora series.In it, it is  mentioned that the real
gayatri is not known to most,and what is chanted today is the Savitri
mantra;Your kind comments on it.Now with the Jupiter transit next
month it will not be a bad idea to have a Navagraha homam module from
your wonderful gifted hands.Also regarding details of construction of
various types of homa kundams;are there any good resources available?
