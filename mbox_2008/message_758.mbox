Namaste,

There is need at all to address me as Ji or Sir.

Mind anyway preoccupies itself with many things! :-) By giving it an anchor 
to focus on (like handling of the maalaa), you are actually stabilizing it 
somewhat. If this specific pre-occupation minimized many other (and worse) 
pre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at all.

It is like a monkey that keeps jumping from one place to another place being 
tied to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey may still be 
jumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its movement around one 
pole.

Of course, if the monkey learns to stay in one place without jumping, it 
needs no chain or pole anymore. Chain was there in the first place to limit 
its jumping.

Each person is the best judge of where one is and what is appropriate for 
oneself. We make progress by recognizing our weaknesses and addressing them.

In addition, there are certain chakras in the tips of fingers that are 
directly connected to the brain. Objects like rudraksha and tulasi beads can 
stimulate those minor energy centers. Thus, there is *some* use in the 
beginning.

> 1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?

Upto you. For most people, I recommend using a maalaa.

> 1. What are the ramifications of crossing the Meru bead?

What use is it to know? Avoid it as much as you can. If you cross it, so be 
it. Don't worry and move on. But, avoid crossing it again.

It is also given in a scripture that Rudraksha and Tulasi maalaas can be 
used for chanting any mantra and they are many more times powerful than 
other maalaas. My suggestion is to pick up either a Rudraksha maalaa or a 
Tulasi maalaa based on your taste and use it for *all* mantras.

I want to categorically state that using a Tulasi maalaa for Shiva or a 
Rudraksha maalaa for Vishnu will NOT do you any harm.

Anything that works as an anchor to limit the mind from straying away too 
much is useful. An image or visualization of deity may work for some. 
Focussing on each sound and ups and downs in intonation may work for some. 
The goal is to minimize other thoughts. Thinking of one's goals will usually 
make the mind stray away into unnecessary pre-occupations. It is better to 
focus on deity or mantra.

Best regards,
Narasimha
