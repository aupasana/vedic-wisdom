Hello Rashmi

It seems here in east coast all the tithis start from 
aftern=
oon to next afternoon, it is the case with Dhan Theras, Diwali
and also Kaa=
li Chaudas.

So I think one has to pick the morning time as early as after =
sunrise.

Becuase in the evening or night the thithi is already changed to =
next 
day.

They say one needs to pick Sthir Lagna, I believe around 9:00 A=
M US 
EST it is Vrishchik Lagna rising so it can be used too.

Hope this he=
lps, other learned people can share better window of time

Best Regards
Mit=
esh
