I didn't mean to make you feel bad or to suggest t=
hat one should not try to help others and focus on oneself. If I thought so=
, I would not be doing so many things I do, like replying to mails, putting=
 together homam manuals etc. My comment 3 came after the first 2. I was jus=
t trying to bring in another angle after the first two.
 
One cannot stop f=
ocussing inwards and correcting oneself ever. Even a yogi who is able to ch=
ange the spiritual lives of millions cannot drop guard and has to be lookin=
g inwards. That was my point.
 
It is good to help others and try to be "in=
strumental in their path to know the truth". However, after engaging in act=
ion that one's judgment says one should engage in, one should earnestly sur=
render the doership to the Lord and move on. It is not worthwhile to cling =
on to the ownership of too many actions for too long as people normally do.=
 In fact, it is a big problem. People don't realize it. One getting used to=
 cancer and living with it for 50 years may forget how it is to live withou=
t that disease. Similarly, a being used to living with this cancer (of pers=
istent mental ownership of many many many actions) for many lives may forge=
t how it is to live without that disease!
 
After all rituals like pooja an=
d homam, we do say "sarvam sree krishnaarpanamastu". Though people say it w=
ithout understanding, it means that you surrender the action finished just =
now to Krishna. After that, you are not the owner. You should really feel t=
hat way.
 
One can adopt that attitude to everything in life, do the action=
 as perfectly as one can and then surrender the doership to the Lord. Unfor=
tunately, many people do good things and cling on to the ownership within t=
heir mind for too long. This causes many problems and also binds one. Pride=
 that they did something good or sadness that they missed something or happ=
iness that a good result came from that action or sadness that the intended=
 result did not happen start eating one's mind later on and stop the mind f=
rom acting optimally on *future actions*. If one truly surrenders the owner=
ship of every action after the action finishes, one forms a distance betwee=
n oneself and the results that the actions may bring later on. That distanc=
e is really needed for a stable and blissful state of mind and optimum outp=
ut from one's mind.

Quite honestly, ego IS present in all beings by default, inc=
luding the lowest beings like amoeba and bacteria. A discussion of the nece=
ssity of ego to be present is superfluous, as ego IS present anyway in all =
beings. By the way, ego in our literature does not mean "egotism" or self-i=
mportance or pride (which are the meaning in which the word is used these d=
ays). Ego simply means self-consciousness and self-awareness. They are alwa=
ys there in all beings and it is an uphill climb to lose them by introspect=
ing each thought, word and action of oneself.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

But that <BR>> is the fact. Whatever action we 
perform with a sense of =
*I-ness* <BR>> behind that action becomes a karma 
(action) and an equal=
 and opposite <BR>> phala (fruit/reaction) will come.

the person g=

some beau=

of=
 that karma! The laws of <BR>> karma are complex. Thinking like "this is=
 a 
noble karma. So it is <BR>> good only" is incorrect. Each action res=
ults in a 
series of <BR>> developments and begets some karma for the pe=
rson. Of course, 
if an <BR>> act is with committed with ego but not an =
intention to affect a 
<BR>> particular development, the part of the kar=
ma begotten from that 
<BR>> development is smaller (than it would be if=
 that development was 
<BR>> intended). Thus, even bacteria and amoeba c=
an beget karma from the 
<BR>> results of their actions. But it is very =
small and accumulates <BR>> 
slowly. Highly taamasik beings such as tree=

stly a long way from moksha. Not 
all beings need to get <BR>> moksha ri=

not need to create this <BR>> worl=

nothing else in this <BR>> univ=
erse, that will solve all problems. But the 
fact is that <BR>> manifest=

those =
who got the valuable human birth and yet act <BR>> like amoeba and

those books came out just as Vimalananda intended.<BR>> &g=
