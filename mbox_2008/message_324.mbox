Moola Mantras are powerful sounds and are very rich in their meaning which when chanted produce great effects. These are chanted repeatedly and that is called Japa. 
Japa is a key part of Hindu prayer
  While doing japa one can meditate on the mantra and its meaning. As the mind dwell more and more into that, the mind and takes up to the higher States and forms the path to the great liberation -eternal bliss (SELF HYPNOTIC)
  What makes moola mantras so special as compared to the normal words? Moola mantras are not human creations. Especially given that there are sages associated with the moola mantras! 
  The point to be noted is that these sages are not composers of these moola mantras. Only the perfect one can unchangedly reproduce the moola mantra heard. The only one that is absolutely perfect is God. Vedas are full of moola mantras and hence have been preserved for ages in their pure form by utilizing the various techniques like PATHA, KRAMA, JATA, GANA PATAS, that ensure that the chanter clearly gets the correct letters and even the correct level of sound for each letter (svara). 
There would be gurus who initiate the disciple in a moola mantra, ensuring that the disciple receive the mantra in perfect original format. (It is really amazing to note that without being written down, the Vedas have been preserved in pure form across the land for ages. Though the texts are freely available now for anybody to read, it would be important to ensure that these moola mantras are properly learnt and then chanted. This way the treasure that as been preserved so carefully over multiple millenniums do not deteriorate due to indifference.
  
Definition # 1:
  Moola mantras are energy-based sounds. Saying any word produces an actual physical vibration. Over time, if we know the effect of that vibration, then the word may come to have meaning associated with it. If the actual physical vibration is coupled with a mental intention, the vibration then contains an additional mental component, which influences the result of saying it. 
The Sound is the carrier wave and the intent is overlaid upon the waveform, just as a colored gel influences the appearance and effect of a white light.
  In either instance, the word is based upon energy. Nowhere is this idea truer than for Sanskrit moola mantra. For although there is a general meaning which comes to be associated with moola mantras, the only lasting definition is the result or effect of saying the moola mantra as passed on from generation to generation. 
  Definition # 2:
  Moola mantras create thought-energy waves. The human consciousness is really a collection of states of consciousness, which distributively exist throughout the physical and subtle bodies. So individual organ consciousness is overlaid by system consciousness, overlaid again by subtle body counterparts and consciousness, and so ad infinitum. Moola mantras start a powerful vibration, which corresponds to both a specific spiritual energy frequency and a state of consciousness in seed form. Over time, the moola mantra process begins to override all of the other smaller vibrations, which eventually become absorbed by the moola mantra. After a length of time, which varies from individual to individual, the great wave of the moola mantra stills all other vibrations. Ultimately, the moola mantra produces a state where the organism vibrates at the rate completely in tune with the energy and spiritual state represented by and contained within the moola mantra
  
Definition #3:
  Moola mantras are tools of power and tools for power. The word "moola mantra" is derived from two Sanskrit words. Moola mantra is, at its core, a tool used by the mind, which eventually frees one from the vagaries of the mind. But the journey from moola mantra to freedom is a wondrous one. In the case of moola mantra, this power is tangible and wieldable.
Statements About Moola mantra Moola mantras have close, approximate one-to-one direct language-based translation. Definitions of moola mantras are oriented toward either the results of repeating the moola mantra or of the intentions of the original framers and testers of the moola mantra. In Sanskrit, sounds which have no direct translation but which contain great power which can be‚Äù grown" from it are called "seed moola mantras." The moola mantra "Hirim" or Hireem is the seed sound for the principle of abundance.
  Although the oral tradition predates written speech by centuries, those earliest oral records annotated on palm leaves discussed earlier clearly designate a specific sage as the "seer_ of the moola mantra. Relationship between the moola mantra sound, either vocalized or sub vocalized, and the charkas located throughout the body.
Moola mantras are energy, which can be likened to fire. Similarly, moola mantra can bring a positive and beneficial result, or it can produce an energy meltdown when misused or practiced without some guidance. Moola mantra energizes prana.
  A massage therapist can transfer prana with beneficial effect. For instance, by saying a certain moola mantra while visualizing an internal organ bathed in light, the
Specific power of the moola mantra can become concentrated there with great beneficial effect.
  Moola mantras eventually quiet the mind. At a deep level, subconscious mind is a collective consciousness of all the forms of primitive consciousnesses, which exist throughout the physical and subtle bodies. The dedicated use of moola mantra can dig into subconscious crystallized thoughts stored in the organs and glands and transform these bodily parts into repositories of peace. Some of you may be interested or even fascinated by the discipline of moola mantra, but feel somewhat overwhelmed by the array of moola mantras and disciplines, stotaras and pujas you find in here. It contains some simple moola mantras and their common application. If you want more information or more moola mantras relating to the deities or principles involved
Summary:
1.Manthra should initiated by reverable GURU *Guru Mukhena. At the initial period, Guru will be traitor. It depends upon your grasping power.For Deeksha you should be well prepared and ready to offer Guru Dakshina. Now adays just like school fees taken in advance of entire course, Manthra is not commodity saleable. Dakshina here is somewhat like offerings.
2.External cleanliness at most should be maintained for quick result.
3.Internal cleanliness, i.e. meditating the meaning of the mantra along with recitation, so that our thought and process of chanting will become one and oneness.
4.Without failure daily you must chant minimum number of count with specific mala *(beads).
5.After completing prescribed number along with Guru advice you should proceed to do Purascharan.for this matter Guru is the only sole guide.
6. Manthra should not recited after reading from book, internet, or from inapropriate person. Though SADANA is yours but REGULATOR is GURU.
7.At no Time you should have insulted the Guru one who initiate the manthra. Before accepting the manthra you can doubt him or test his capabilities, after accepting, you should never get doubt, or uttering a word cause discomfort to GURU. This will become GURU SHAB, and there is no remedies available in shastras.
