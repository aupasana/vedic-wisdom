Namaste to all
It was a wonderful post as usual
but if i say what i think ,=
then there is a problem
of plenty.There are so many mantras ,so many deitie=
s
so many methods of worshipping GOD that one despite knowing 
that all the=
se are equal still suffers some or other illusion

regards

spiritual sadhana, it shou=

light a fire in a silver or

swaha, Om bhuvah 
swaha, Om suvah swaha, Om bhurbhuvassuvah swaha" and then=
 repeat 
some mantra with swaha added and some ghee drops poured into fire.=
 
Such a simple sadhana also, when repeated daily, can be powerful. It 
is =
definitely better than avoiding sadhana at all, just as eating 
just a brea=
