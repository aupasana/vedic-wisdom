SARVAM GYANANANDAMAYAM
AUM GURUBHYO NAMAH

Dear Shri Dr.Ashwinrawal ji,

Na=
maste. May i write a few lines. At the outset i wish to state that you are =
already aware of the answers for these questions you have posted. But then =
..

1.The 'I' which says it has cured/is curing, needs to be cured.
2.The c=
laim that this 'I' is superior in intelligence to Almighty is too tall !!!
=
3.Instead of planting cds/cassettes in pooja rooms/cars one may seek the Lo=
rd for planting His grace/upadesha through Himself or in the form of Guru i=
nto one's own system!
4.If we consider experience as the unit of life or in=
 other words life is made up of so many experiences we need to understand w=
hat this experience primarily is made of. There should be a subject, an obj=
ect and a simultaneous relationship to form an experience is it not?
Let us=
 think that the intellect is always like a sparrow and that Garuda is alway=
s way ahead!!!

The great Thakur says " Ma my heart is like a towel - why d=
o you squeeze it so hard - can't you show up" - this statement of Thakur st=
ands taller than any Mantra/Sanskrit. 

The word 'janma ashtami gives us th=
e clue that the janma itself should be oriented towards identifying the rel=
ationship with the Almighty as a first step. 

Let me stop here - the mail =
is becoming lengthier!

Best wishes.

May Mother Bless.

Astrologically & s=
piritually yours,
p.s.ramanarayanan.

Dear Sir, 
1. I had visited one Gentleman in 1980 who was curing the patien=
ts by simply their photographs. He was demamding photo of the patient. He h=
ad pasted Gayatri Mantra sticker on all the three wings of a table fan and =
he was keeping the photograph of the patient just opposit the fan. He was s=
witching his fan on for 1 or 2 hours daily for couple of days and as per hi=
s say, he was throwing the vibrations of Gayatri Mantra directly to the pho=
tograph. He was claiming that he has cured so many patients by Gayatri Mant=
ra vibrations.=C2=A0
2. Some people are arranging some Mantra cassette or C=
D in their worship room and playing them for couple of hours daily and beli=
eving that the room is charged due to Mantra vibrations. Some are playing t=
hese type of =C2=A0CDs in their Car to get protection from accidents and li=
ke. All are doing these as per their believes.
=C2=A0=C2=A0 What I want to =
know from you Sir is whether this is really working? Can anybody be cured b=
y=C2=A0 Gayatri Mantra-written Fan?
=C2=A0 Can a CD or Cassette create vibr=
ations? If someone is sleeping in the room where whole night one CD of a ce=
rain Mantra is played. The person is unaware of it. Whether Mantra will cre=
rate any positive effect on him?
