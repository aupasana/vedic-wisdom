Namaste SS,
 
Sabda (loosely translated as sound or vibration) has 4 levels=
 - vaikhari, madhyama, pastanti and para. When moving parts of our gross bo=
dy (e.g. lips) move the gross bodies of objects around us (particles in air=
) and this vibration is perceived by the senses attached to the gross bodie=
s of people around us (e.g. ears), that vibration is at the level of vaikha=
ri. When we are talking about pronunciation of mantras, we are essentially =
talking about vaikhari.
 
But we are not just our sthoola sareera (gross bo=
dy). There is also a sookshma sareera (subtle body), kaarana sareera (causa=
l body) and finally MahaKaarana sareera (cosmic body). Just as vibration in=
 sthoola sareera creates vaikhari, vibrations in other levels also create v=
ibrations at other levels.
 
The image you have in mind when you chant a ma=
ntra and the thoughts you are thinking when you chant a mantra go towards s=
haping the subtle vibrations behind a mantra. They vibrate the space around=
 you at the subtle level.
 
Once you cause of vibration of space around you=
 (at gross or subtle level), it is there. One with an ability to perceive i=
t can perceive it. Of course, the deity of your mantra does not receive jus=
t the gross vibration produced by you, but receives and responds to the ent=
irety of the vibrations produced by you at all levels.
 
Vaikhari is the le=
ast powerful level and para is the most powerful level.
 
All the scholarly=
 preoccupation with the correct pronunciation etc is a little trite. The de=
votion, sense of surrender and the ability to create the correct mental ima=
ges and correct thoughts to accompany the chanting of the mantra are far mo=
re important.
 
Of course, it is helpful to pronounce the mantra correctly =
too. I am not saying ignore the correct pronunciation. Do your BEST to get =
it correct. But all I am saying is that that plays a small part and a bigge=
r part is played by other factors which are often ignored. Do NOT ignore th=
ose.
 
Secondly, being a child as opposed to an arrogant scholar helps with=
 gods. If you can be like a child who is lost by parents at a fair and cryi=
ng for them, it is easier to find god. As a matter of fact, we ARE almost l=
ike a clueless little children left by parents at the fair (of samsara)!

Best regards,
Narasimha
