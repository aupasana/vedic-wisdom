Om Gurave Namah!

When I was active in DLS (Divine Life Society), I have he=
ard and read
that the name can be taken anytime. This is true when the soul=
 is not
interested in material success or to that mater even any form of
kn=
owledge. I think Guru Shivanand gave the example of toothache. Does
one for=
get the toothache at any state? Why should one forget the names
of god then=
?
