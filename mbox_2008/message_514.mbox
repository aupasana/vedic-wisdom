Hare Rama Krsna,
=C2=A0
Dear Utpal Bhai,
Namaskar.
Thank you for giving me =
the privilege of adressing you as bhai,
Mine is avery funny predicament, th=
e reason I got into the ritualistic sadhana is that I notmally dont progres=
s beyond a few of Her Namas, especially Lalita Sahasranamam. Some poignant =
namas have special significance for me for not any new reason and each time=
 I cant progress beyond that as I envisage the Supreme Beauty of The Mother=
. It makes me too emotional and ritualistic sadhana with proper uccharana a=
nd swaras I thought would make me go ahead in the path of sadhana. Though I=
 am still confused if a moment's 'ananda' at the glimpse of the Mother's so=
undarya can be less valuable than all the sadhana...
But I still persist in=
 the hope being able to try 'see' Her....
=C2=A0
Wish you=C2=A0a Happy Durg=
ashtami too,
Thanks 
regards
=C2=A0
Nalini

Nalini Bahen,

wish you and all a gr=
eat Durgaashtami.

I'll put my 6 cent here if you don't mind:)

Yes, Narasi=
mha Garu has recorded DeviMahatmya (DS) on his site.

http://www.vedicast r=
ologer.org
on the main page: click on 'listen to some mantra', then you'll =
find
link for 'Durga Saptha Sathi in mp3 format'
------------ --------- ---=
------ --------- --------- --------- -

Personally, i've never worried abou=
t Swara, Mantra chanting only 
after Initiation, correct protocols for Puja=
 etc... Though i very 
much respect these things, i have always believed th=
at this is not 
the 'age' where one really go for all *correctness* .

The =
most important is Bhavana ! Devotion !. The almighty, The mother 
knows abo=
ut our very intentions and would she really care about 
whether or not some=
 body does proper rituals or not? if she needs to 
make it proper then she =
herself will bring about the changes.

I would quote Thakur here. he used t=
o say that when just uttering 
Name of God brings tears in your eyes, know =
for sure that no rituals 
are required by you.
but that's very advance stag=
e. for most of us, ChandiPaath, Naam 
Jap, mediatation etc.. are must to re=
ach the stage.The only point 
here is that too much concern about correctne=
ss and such things will 
hamper us. there will be so many people who wants =
to start some 
sadhana but are afraid of starting becuase of these things.
=

I congratulate you and people must become bold like you. no wories-
the al=
mighty will take care of everything.

once Thakur scolded the great man Mah=
endranaath Gupta (M) and said 
that ***God knows that from the clay image w=
orship, only he is being 
invoked. if there are any flaws in the worship, h=
e'll himself set it 
right***

personally, These ARE THE WORDS of Thakur wh=
ich has given me immense 
confidence. this couple of sentances from the Gos=
pel has dispelled 
my many dowbts.
Shri Krishna didn't bother about all pro=
tcols, Royal Pomp, outer 
show and Chappan Bhoga of Duryodhana. instead he =
declined and went 
to Vidur's hut and with all love partaken his Bhaji. Sam=
e with 
Sudama.

One poet has narrated that episode in simple but beautiful=
 words in 
Hindi. it goes like this

"Dekhi Sudaamaa ki Deen dasha, Karuna =
Karake Karunaa-Nidhi roye !
Pani paratko haath chhuyo nahi, Nainan ke Jal s=
e Pagu dhoye" !!!

It means- Krishna cried looking at the condition of his =
poor friend 
and didn't use water from the vessels but used his Tears to wa=
sh the 
feet of Sudaamaa.

that sums up all.

I hope Rao garu will provide =
today with Technical details and 
Meaning behind *various Nyaasa* for the b=
enefit of all on this 
special day.

Again wish you all a very happy Drgaas=
htami.

best regards,

utpal

Moreover, =
what most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a 
ritual with no meani=
ng. Nyasa literally means placement. You place 
various sounds in various b=
ody parts (like the tips of various 
fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc)=
. People merely act out some 
signals while saying the sounds. This "placem=
ent" is actually 
supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal en=
vironment 
for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what =
is 
supposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds 
end=
 up not getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what 
I am try=
ing to say is that most people do

who were initiated.

nyway just a <BR>ritual
 with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. =
You place <BR>various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of variou=
s <BR>fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some <B=
R>signals while saying the sounds. This "placement" is actually <BR>suppose=
d to be an internal act and it creates an ideal environment <BR>for the rep=
etition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is <BR>supposed to occ=
ur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds <BR>end up not getting =
properly placed in the body. In other words, what <BR>I am trying to say is=
 that most people do<BR>> not know how to "place" various "sounds" in va=
rious body parts. <BR>They merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. =
So, if you do <BR>not know nyasas, you are not really missing much compared=
 to others <BR>who were initiated.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> In my humbl=
e opinion, the most important qualification is to have <BR>devotion and sen=
se of surrender to
 Her. If you have them, you can <BR>consider yourself "h=
ighly initiated".<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasi=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Navaratri...<BR>> <BR>> Dear Narasimha,<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> When does Navratri end? It started on last Monday, September 29=
, <BR>2008 and should therefore end on Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine <BR>N=
ights)...yet the panchang shows that at sunrise on Wednesday, <BR>October 8=
 starts with Navami, so should we continue our Navratri on <BR>Wednesday to=
o even though it is technically the 10th day? (All these <BR>times are base=
d on US EST)..<BR>> <BR>> Also, can anyone do the Navarna mantra, "Om=
 Aim Hrim Klim <BR>Chamundayai Vicche" or does this require initiation?<BR>=
> <BR>> Thanks,<BR>>
