Thank you! 

Will try with the Tulsi Mala. 

Sorry to get so technical but =
the Tulsi mala I have seems to be
cracked in many places, is this is ok? An=
y suggestions for a good
place to purchase? I bought mine from Organic farm=
ers in India.

I have heard best place to keep mala while doing Japa is nea=
r  the
heart, at least always above navel, is that correct?

Lastly, I dist=
inctly notice feelings of anger after doing Japa?I have
just started doing =
Japa as a remedy, is this anger residue some kind
of by product of the puri=
fication process? The mantra is a very
common, Prasiddha Vishnu Mantra.

Th=
ank you
