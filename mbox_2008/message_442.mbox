Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Another wonderly inspired post by you!!!!
=C2=A0
I =
did not understand one line of your post. You said during the time of Mahab=
hrata there was tremendous weight on this planet. I could not completely un=
derstand what you ment by this. Is it a literal meaning of figuratative mea=
ning?
=C2=A0
Also, could you tell me the name of reference of the book wher=
e Sri Ramakrishna says Yogananda was Arjuna. 
=C2=A0
Thank you once again f=
or your mails which are an inspiration to us all.

Namaste,

As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed pe=
rsonal. Krishna clearly says in 
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It=
 is dangerous to follow someone 
else's dharma".

Following the path of dha=
rma basically means engaging in the right 
action/duty. Right action varies=
 from person to person, from time to time 
and from place to place. It is d=
ependent on what nature expects from you, 
which in turn is based on who yo=
u have been in the past, what actions you 
did in the past while identifyin=
g with the action, who you affected in the 
past (and how) with the actions=
 that you identified with, what debts you 
created in the process, and what=
 mental tendencies you accumulated until 
now.

If, based on one's mental t=
endencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
to kill evil persons, th=
at becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
tendencies and karmic d=
ebts, nature wants a person to spread the message of 
uniformity of all rel=
igions, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies an=
d karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the 
ritual of homam in the=
 world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies an=
d karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of 
money and construct=
 a temple, that becomes one's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a being may cha=
nge from one life to another.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjun=
a's dharma to kill his gurus, 
elders and relatives. The time then was such=
 that there was too much weight 
on earth and nature wanted earth to be rel=
ieved of some weight. Tremendous 
destruction was to take place and civiliz=
ation destroyed to a great extent, 
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone f=
or it. Arjuna being a great warrior, 
it was his dharma to facilitate that.=
 Some people he deeply loved and 
respected were on the other side and it w=
as his dharma to kill them.

When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19t=
h century as one of 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda ha=
d been Arjuna in a 
previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma w=
as different in this 
new time and place. He was born to renounce material =
life despite his 
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a mon=
k and inspire 
generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment an=
d service to 
others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what R=
amakrishna 
said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something =
else.

* * *

The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dha=
rma?

Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own =
dharma 
and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the =
concept 
of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the c=
oncept of 
caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who liv=
ed by 
killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitr=
a was a 
kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maha=
rshi 
later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the =
varna 
of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As o=
ne 
develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one does.

Thu=
s, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
d=
harma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
=
the world. Each person has individual dharma.

Knowing what one's dharma is=
 is very very very difficult. If one is pure 
enough, one will *know* one's=
 dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
mind that tells us what our=
 dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of 
noise from other parts of our=
 minds which tell other things. Thus, we get 
confused.

We should make the=
 best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and 
decide what is o=
ur dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
the best we ca=
n is all that we can do!

More than following dharma, what is of utmost imp=
ortance is to engage in 
actions without identification. *That* alone ensur=
es that we are not 
accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. =
We should not build 
too much attachment to what we are doing. We should en=
gage in the best 
possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our =
dharma in the given 
situation is), with as little attachment and self-iden=
tification with the 
action as possible. When the action is finished, we sh=
ould leave the result 
to god. We should not think "I did it", "what will h=
appen now", "will it 
work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unf=
ication through 
untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our cons=
ciousness slowly. 
As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell =
our dharma clearer. 
There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly en=
able us to see our 
dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karm=
as. This is not easy, 
but not as difficult as people think.

The bottomlin=
e is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of 
"this is m=
y dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in action with 
little atta=
chment.

* * *

In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are=
 the inputs. 
Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned=
 men. One can 
derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to o=
ne's spiritual 
master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can ta=
ke the words of 
the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincere=
ly.

When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing=
 gurus 
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarifie=
d his 
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his=
 dharma 
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do =
sadhana, 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in t=
he material 
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One who is not in tu=
ne with nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
debts are and what=
 nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what 
one's dharma is. =
If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into 
one's inner co=
re, such a guru can give perfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline is that I (or=
 anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
declare that as the dharm=
a. No, dharma changes from person to person, from 
time to time and from pl=
ace to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
out what one's dharma =
is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's 
dharma by increasing =
internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
sadhana (like homam, =
japam etc) and engaging in actions without much 
attachment, one can slowly=
 purify oneself and refine one's understanding of 
one's individual dharma.=

Narasimha
