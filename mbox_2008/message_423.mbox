Mr Kaul

It is nice to see that you have a very exhaustive knowledge of ved=
as, upanishads and vast things that our rishis have left for us.Read your e=
xhaustive lecture on vedic astrology which you have written what you have f=
elt. At least finally at the end of the mail you felt that god almighty is =
there even though we dont see him.=A0 That was your belief and also the bel=
ief of the entire humanity whether dead or alive.=A0 In the same way most o=
f the Indians, why only Indians the entire community feels that astrology d=
o exists and we can predict our future may not be 100% but yes to some exte=
nt.=A0 If human beings are given the power to predict that we do not call o=
urselves as human beings we would call our selves as gods.=A0 Hence god the=
 almighty has not given us the power to forsee the future.


But please und=
erstand that there are great souls on this earth like Pandit Sanjay Rath, S=
hri PVR Narsimha rao their disciples who have understood the subject in dep=
th.=A0 The parampara has not come to them just like that it is there from t=
heir forefathers and it has come up to them.

Everybody has the right not t=
o believe things but please note that no human being has got the right to d=
egrade this science.

You said there is no Sade Sathi, I know what Sade Sat=
hi is because I have through it and those tortorous 7 years.=A0 It is not t=
hat I am a dumb person and will take whatever comes to me , I am a very har=
d working person but still the situation has arisen for me without my contr=
ol and myself and soul has gone through those torterous years.

I know you =
would be a very learned person and if that is the case kindly keep your com=
ments for your self and please do not hurt the feelings of those people who=
 believe in destiny and people who would like to learn astrology

With Rega=

"Vedic
Astrology" - the greatest fraud on the Vedas! 

Dear friends. Good
=
evening to everybody! 

I feel highly honoured
to have been invited by Shri=
 Ajay Bhasin for sharing my views about astrology
and related topics with r=
espected personalities assembled here.=A0 As most
of us already know, we ca=
ll these predictive gimmicks as =93Vedic
astrology=94 these days.=A0 =A0 

=
 =A0 

When I was asked by Shri
Bhasin about the heading of my talk, I had =
thought of making it as =93Vedic
Astrology =96 the greatest fraud on the Ve=
das=94.=A0 On second
thoughts, fearing that it would be too explosive a hea=
ding, I made it a sugar
coated bitter pill by changing it to =93Do we celeb=
rate our festivals on
correct days?=94. 

 =A0 

Well, actually, both
i.e.,=
 the fraud known as =93Vedic astrology=94 and =93our
celebrating all our fe=
stivals on wrong days=94 are inter-related.  

Let me start with
=93Vedic a=
strology=94=A0 -=A0 as to why I call it a fraud! 

There is hardly anyone
i=
n India ,
who does not want to know as to when his =93sade=96sati=94 will
s=
tart or end or as to which Dasha-antardasha he is running and when that wil=
l
end etc. etc.=A0even if he does not know ABC of jyotisha.=A0 I have gone
=
through all those pangs myself and made a thorough study of all the
astrolo=
gical works besides a lot of astronomical books!=A0 I studied Western
syste=
m of astrology also and had become a sort of famous astrologer, though my
p=
redictions were as correct as anybody else=92s i.e. hardly 50%.=A0
However,=
 this is a secret that no =93jyotishi=94 shares with anybody --
that his/he=
r predictions are hardly more correct than fifty per cent, whatever
logic o=
r Ayanamsha he/she may use!=A0 When I analyzed the reasons for such a
disma=
l rate of success, the conclusions were startling!=A0 And I am keeping
thos=
e very conclusions before you! 

 =A0 

Before proceeding
further, I must, =
however, say something about myself since you are well within
your rights t=
o ask me as to what =93qualifications=94 I have to
demolish=A0 astrology th=
at is being practised over the last several
centuries, nay even millennia! =


 =A0 

My
credentials Though I am not laying any claims
to being a schola=
r, however, I have actually studied all the four Vedas in
original =93archa=
ic=94 Sanskrit with their different
=93Bhashyas=94, besides the various Bra=
hmanas=A0 like Shatapatha,
Aitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc. I have studied, (in =
original Sanskrit!) about two
hundred all the important Upanishads as well!=
 I have also gone through both the
epics viz. the Valmiki Ramayana and the =
Mahabharata --- in=A0 Sanskrit and
from cover to cover, besides Adhyatma Ra=
mayana, Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc.!
There is hardly any Purana whether the=
 Bhagavata, Shivapurana, Vishnu, Narada,
Devi, Varaha, Matsya and Vishnudha=
rmotara etc. etc. that I have not gone
through in original Sanskrit. I have=
 also studied exhaustively all the ancient
astronomical works like the Veda=
nga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, Surya Sidhanta,
Arya Bhati, Sidhanta Shirom=
ani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was not a born
renegade against the establ=
ished traditions.=A0 On the other hand, I was
initially =93hypnotized=94 by=
 =93Vedic astrology=94 and
=93panchangas=94 myself and there is hardly any =
=93text-book=94
of astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or English or Hindi=
 that I have not
studied with due reverence, as if I was studying the Vedas=
!  

 =A0 

Having established my
credentials thus, I CAN DECLARE IT WITHOU=
T ANY HESITATION AND WITH ALL 
THE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND, =A0THAT THERE IS=
 ABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE
ASTROLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPANISHADAS OR BRA=
HMANAS. There are, however,
some references to some odd types of prediction=
s in some of the Puranas and the
epics and therefore calling it as really a=
 post-Vedic astrology is more
correct.=A0 There is a rider there also, and =
that is that according to these
scriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal is=
 nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana
(the shortest day of the year) i.e. Wi=
nter Solstice and as everybody knows, it
can take place these days only on =
or around December 21 every year.=A0 Thus
the Uttarayana-cum- Makar Sankran=
ti that we are celebrating now-a-days on
January 14 is absolutely wrong and=
 does not have any authority from any shastra
or even modern astronomy.=A0 =
Similarly, the Vaishakhi that is being
celebrated on April 14 or so also is=
 wrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but
Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) or Vas=
ant Sampat and it cannot take place on any
=A0day other than March 21/22, w=
hen the day and night are equal. Actually
these Makara etc. sankrantis were=
 known as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic
period as there are no rashis =
in the Vedas but just six seasons and Madhu,
Madhava etc. twelve months.=A0=
 As such, we are celebrating all our fasts,
fairs and muhurtas on wrong day=
s=A0 -- thanks to =93Vedic
astrologers=94=A0 and their =93Vedic astrology=
=94.  

 =A0 

=A0The first and
foremost thing I learnt from our shastras i=
s that no system of predictions has
any sanction=A0 either from the Vedas=
=A0 or even Puranas least of all our
dharmashastras etc.=A0since all our sh=
astras admonish us from consulting
=93nakshatra jeevis=94 so much so that t=
he Manusmriti calls these
nakshatrasoochis as outcastes and not fit to sit =
in any sabha of learned
people. 

Those
who can foresee our future do not r=
eveal it to us beforehand: 

All the Ramayanas,
whether Valmiki or Adhyatma=
 or Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc. say that before
deciding about the coronati=
on of Bhagwan Rama, Dashratha wanted his guru
Vasishtha to confirm the suit=
able muhurta for that function.=A0 It was on
the advice of =A0Vasishtha Mun=
i that Dasharatha decided to anoint Rama as
the Yuvraja the very next day, =
as it was =93Tishya=94 =A0i.e. Pushya
nakshata then.=A0 From this anecdote,=
 it is clear that either Vasishtha Muni
did not know as to what was going t=
o happen to Dasharatha by declaring Bhagwan
Rama as a crown-prince or Vasis=
htha kept quiet deliberately since he did not
want to interfere in the divi=
ne dispensation! 

 =A0 

Obviously, being the son
of Brahmaji and a highly=
 exalted yogi as well as a jnyani, Vasishtha-muni could
peep into past as w=
ell as future.=A0 It means that even if some exalted
souls can foresee as t=
o what is going to happen, they do not reveal our
=93bhavishya=94 before ha=
nd, unlike some of the astrologers of today,
who masquerade as =93Parashara=
s=94 and =93Vamadevas=94 to tell
us even our past and future janmas just by=
 glancing at our birth-charts, even
if those charts are wrong! 

 =A0 

The=
 Gita is said to be
the gist of all our shastras.=A0 When Arjuna expressed =
his doubt by saying naitadvidmah katarnno gareeyo, yadva jayema yadi va
no =
jayeyuh =93I do not know what is good for me nor do I know
whether we will =
win or the Kauravas will win the war=94, Bhagwan Krishna
neither asked him =
to consult some soothsayer nor did He tell him to wear some
ruby!=A0 He jus=
t advised Arjuna =94hato
va prapsyasi swargam jitva va bokshyase maheem=94=
=A0 i.e.
=93You must fight.=A0 If you get killed in the war, you will go to=
 the
heavens and if you win it you will be the lord of the whole world=94. =


Thus all it boils down
to is the fact that those who know (including Lord=
 Krishna Himself!) as to what
is going to happen and when do not divulge su=
ch =93secrets=94 before
hand to us. 

 =A0 

Remedial
measures are a farce:=
 Almost all the
jyotishis suggest one or the other remedial measure to thei=
r clients, and
mostly these are gems like diamond or ruby or sapphire etc. =
etc.=A0 What is
surprising is that we have become so obsessed with Jyotish =
that we forget the
entire itihasa of our past! 

(i)=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0If
these=
 gems are that efficacious, why was then Dasharatha not suggested some
=93r=
uby=94 or =93coral=94 to ward off the evil Dasha that was
going to kill him=
 when Rama would leave for the forests?=A0 Well, because
our Rishis did not=
 believe in such gimmicks at all! 

(ii) Bhagwan Krishna was
born in a pris=
on=A0 ---=A0=A0 I wonder why He could not use some=A0=A0=A0
=93sapphire=94 =
to be born in a palace! 

=A0(iii)
Vasudeva and Devaki---the parents of Bha=
gwan Krishna--- were in chains when He
was born! It is said that Lord Krish=
na was a complete =96 16 kala sampoorna=A0 --- divine
incarnation of Vishnu=
 and was thus really Omnipotent, Omnipresent and
Omniscient!=A0 But in spit=
e of His Omniscience, Omnipotence and
Omnipresence, Lord Krishna could not =
relieve the miseries of his parents,
Vasudeva and Devaki, who had to remain=
 in chains till Krishna 
killed Kansa! 

What does it demonstrate?=A0
Just =
the fact that if the Omniscient, Omnipresent and Omnipotent Krishna could
n=
ot relieve the miseries of His own father or mother before the appointed ti=
me,
how can a ruby or a sapphire---or some Mangala or Shani yagya--- remove=
 all our
miseries or fulfil all our ambitions?=A0 Obviously, we are being t=
aken for a
ride by such Jyotishis! 

iv)
Then not in the distant past, Smti=
 Indira Gandhi would run after astrologers
for knowing her future.=A0 She w=
ore a rare and original ekamukhi rudraksha, which only either the
Maharaja =
of Nepal had or she was wearing!=A0 It is said that some top-notch
jyotishi=
s had suggested that rudraksha to her!=A0 Ironically, both the King
of Nepa=
l as well Mrs. Indira Gandhi were assassinated =93by the
people=94 they =93=
had trusted=94----ekamukhi rudraksha not withstanding!=A0What does it
prove=
?=A0 That we should not be hoodwinked by soothsayers! 

v) Then again a wel=
l
known Tantrik of yore---highly respected by the then PM--- is out on bail=
, not
by dint of his =93Tantra-Kriya=94 but because of some legal loopholes=

in FERA!

Similarly, Dhirendra Brahmachari, another high profile =93Tantri=
k=94,
met with an accident in the plane he was flying himself!=A0 If he cou=
ld not
see his own death looming large how could he forewarn others! 



Wh=
at does that prove?=A0 Obviously, it warns us against relying on any
sooths=
ayers, especially if they call themselves =93Vedic Jyotishis=94
since they =
are taking us for a ride literally.=A0 

Kalasarpa
Dosha=A0 -- a non-existe=
nt fear psychosis: These
days we hear a lot about Kalasarpa Dosha!=A0 It is=
 said to be present in any
horoscope if all the planets are between Rahu an=
d Ketu!=A0 My God!=A0
What a humbug!=A0 Rahu and Ketu are actually nodes of=
 the Moon!=A0 That
means they are just mathematical points without any dime=
nsions ---therefore
without any physical existence whatsoever!=A0 So accord=
ing to =93Vedic
astrologers=94 even such =93non-existent=94 phenomena can m=
ake our
lives miserable for which we must do some upay!=A0
Do you need any =
other proofs for the jugglery that these cheats are indulging
in? 

THE ONL=
Y EFFECTIVE
REMEDY, or UPAY, THEREFORE, IS
THAT WE MUST REMEMBER HIM, THE A=
LMIGHTY, EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES AND LEAVE EVERY THING TO HIS DIVINE WILL=
!.=A0  

 =A0 

Fake
Brighu Samhitas and Parasharis: 

We find a Brighu Sam=
hita
or a nadi Jyotishi or Aruna Samhita etc. in every Muhalla these days!=
=A0
However, there is no mention in any of the Puranas or shastras that any=
 Rishi
like Vasishtha or Garga or Brighu etc. have ever written=A0any books=
 on
predictive astrology.=A0 The Vishnu Purana by Parashara is=A0 full of
a=
stronomical references ---and that also sayana i.e. the seasonal year when
=
Mesha sankranti is another name of Spring Equinox and so on, but we do not =
find
any mention of any Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra there!=A0 Obviously, =
it is
the worst concoction that can ever be had, and may be that is why suc=
h a
Parashari is the bible of =93Vedic astrologers=94 



India has gone do=
wnhill because of astrology and
astrologers: In India ,
we have started goi=
ng downhill ever since our rulers started running after
Jyotishis.=A0 In an=
cient days, during the time of the Mahabharata, it was a
dharma yudha that =
we had to fight against our own Duryodhanas but ever since
the advent of as=
trology almost simultaneously with the invasion of Alexander
the Great, and=
 then the =93Yavana Jatakam=94 of Sphujidwaja and the
Surya Sidhanta of May=
a the Yavana (mlechha!),=A0 we had to fight
outsiders!=A0 The more the fore=
igners invaded us the more our rulers,
instead of making a united effort ag=
ainst the invaders, started consulting
soothsayers whom they called Rajajyo=
tishis!=A0 

 =A0 

Varahamihira
the worst culprit: 

The maximum credit fo=
r
creating such a fear psychosis of omens and ghosts and ghouls and
storms=
=A0=A0 and even clouds goes to Varahamihira of 5th century AD
through his B=
rihat Samita and Brihat Jatakam and Panchasidhantika!=A0 Before
venturing i=
nto the battlefield, our monarchs would ask their soothsayers to
prepare =
=93narpati jaya charya=94
and consult Brihat Samhita etc. to see whether th=
e =93ketuchara=94 was
favourable at that time or not!=A0 No wonder with suc=
h a preliminary and
hopeless knowledge of astronomical facts, we were being=
 pushed back into dark
ages by Varahamihira and his followers! 

 =A0 

Our=
 historical records
are witness to the fact that we were =A0=A0vanquished i=
n every
battle,=A0whether it was with Alexander the Great or Muhamud of Gaz=
ni or
Chengiz Khan or Nadir Shah or the Moguls=A0 or finally the East India=

Company, thanks to the dependence of our monarchs on soothsayers
(Rajajyot=
ishis, huh!) instead of the principles of war strategy and statecraft
as ad=
umbrated by the Vedas, the Manu and even Chanakya, who chided kings for
con=
sulting soothsayers! 



BJP the latest example: 

The fate of the BJP has
=
not been any better than that of our earlier monarchs by depending more on
=
their =93Vedic Jyotishis=94 who were responsible for getting
=93Vedic Jyoti=
sha (sic!)=94 prescribed in Indian Universities!=A0 It
is that very move th=
at boomeranged on the party and even the =93Minister of
astrology=94 did no=
t win his own parliamentary seat from Allahabad , let alone being the Union=
 Minister
again. Do you need any other proofs of the fact that these =93Ved=
ic
Jyotishis=94=A0 will make you lose your seat of power well before the
ap=
pointed day just by making you advance your elections? 

=A0 

=A0If we con=
tinue to
follow the trend of our =93monarchs=94 of having blind faith in
ou=
r=A0soothsayers, then =A0sooner than later we will become Babylon of yester=
years, which is known as Iraq 
today! 

 =A0 

Kashmiri
Pandits were the wo=
rst affected by their blind faith in Jyotishis: 

=A0Another reason for
my =
revolt against the so called =93Vedic astrology=94 is that as a
Kashmiri Pa=
ndit, I have more to =A0blame panchanga makers and soothsayers
and their pr=
edictive gimmicks than anything or anybody else since they never
forewarned=
 us about any calamities that were going to befall us!=A0 On the
other hand=
, just to prove their astrological gimmicks, they just made ---and
are stil=
l making --- us celebrate all our festivals, including Mahashivaratri,
Vasa=
nti Navratras, Ramanavami, Janmashtami and Sharadiya navratras etc. on
wron=
g days. It is these very jyotishis, whom we had treated as our friends,
phi=
losophers and guides, who are responsible for our downfall as Kahsmiri
Pand=
its, since they proved neither our friends, nor philosophers least of all
o=
ur guides!=A0 These Panchanga makers/jyotishis were the first to flee from
=
Kashmir=A0 in 1990--- like the king Hari Singh at the time of Pakistani rai=
d
in 1948--- since they had already made their alternate homes in safer pla=
ces
like=A0 Jammu and Delhi .=A0=A0 Those Jyotishis just
proved to be Shylo=
cks, who were only interested in their Pound of flesh by way
of Dakshinas f=
or janmapatris and matching of horoscopes=A0 -- all cheating
and nothing el=
se! 

 =A0 

These
soothsayers have such a hypnotic grip on us that initial=
ly even I was brain
washed to believe that the Vedas had nothing else to do=
 excepting teaching us
predictive astrology!=A0 I was so convinced that it =
appeared that even the
principle of Secondary Progressions must have been e=
xported from India 
to Western countries as the principle of =93A day equal=
s a year=94 was
mentioned in our Vedas!=A0 But thank God, I woke up to the =
situation and
could see through their tricks. 

There
are no Mesha, Vrisha =
=A0etc. Rashis in the Vedas:=A0  

=A0Leave alone
predictive gimmicks, actu=
ally there are neither rashis like Mesha, Vrisha etc.
nor planets like Mang=
al, Shani etc. in the=A0 Vedas, Upanishads, Brahmanas
etc. Similarly, the V=
edanga Jyotisha, the first indigenous astronomical work of
14th century BCE=
 , just
tells us only as to how to calculate tithi, nakshatra and
Uttarayan=
a-cum- Tapah-cum Magha etc. months.=A0 It does not list any Mesha
etc. rash=
is nor any planets like Mangal, Budha etc.=A0 Same is the case with
Yajur J=
yotisha of about 11th century BCE 
and later Atharva Jyotisha of about 5th =
century BCE , which does not have any Rashis though it talks
of planets.=A0=
 As such, it is=A0really a fraud on the Vedas being played
by some charlata=
ns to call any predictive gimmicks as Vedic astrology and hail
themselves a=
s =93Vedic Jyotishis=94. It is a crime under =93The
Consumer Protection Act=
=94 as it is a misrepresentation of facts to a
client and is thus a deficie=
ncy in service.=A0  

 =A0 

Our
predictions in the past also could never h=
ave been correct: 

=A0It is said that
over the past about 2000 years, our =
ancestors like Varahamihira or his son
Prithuyashas etc., could make marvel=
lously correct predictions. THAT IS NOTHING
BUT HOGWASH! Let us see how: pr=
ior to the advent of scientific astronomy into India ,
i.e. about a couple =
of centuries back, panchangas were based on astronomical
works like the Sur=
ya Sidhanta or Aryabhati or Sidhanta Shirmoani etc.
etc.=A0 I have prepared=
 a software called =93Mahesh=94.=A0 It
calculates, apart from the actual ti=
thi, nakshatra, yoga, karna etc., the mean
longitudes of all the planets fr=
om 10000 BCE 
to 12030 AD i.e. for more than 22,000 years as per the Surya =
Sidhanta,
Aryabhati or Sidhanta Shiromani etc. besides comparing them with =
the longitudes
as per modern astronomy. Anybody can download it freely from=

jyotishis, we find that the very fundamental argume=
nts of these sidahntas like
the Surya Sidhanta, the Aryabhati, the Sidhanta=
 Shiromani etc. etc. are
absolutely wrong!=A0 .=A0  

That naturally means
=
that any panchanga based on them would also be wrong, with the result that =
any
horoscope prepared on the basis of those panchangas could never be corr=
ect.
Thus it is impossible for any astrological predictions to have been co=
rrect in
the past!=A0 As such, it is all like the famous couplet of Ghalib =
=A0=93yoon to hai=A0 hamko janat ki haqeeqat
maloom lekin; dil ke bahlane k=
o Ghalib yeh khayal achha hai=94 

 =A0 

Astrology
cannot be a science Pre=
dictive astrology is
supposed to be a =93science=94!=A0 What a preposterous=
 statement!
When the data on which predictions were based or are based thes=
e days are not
correct, how can the results be correct and how can we call =
it a science at
all?  

 =A0 

Stars
do not affect us: 

=A0It is said that=

stars affect us!=A0 It appears either these astrologers have gone honkers
=
themselves or they suppose that the whole world has really gone mad!=A0 Let=

us see how:

I am a puny human being on this small planet called earth.=A0=
 The sun is
hundreds of thousands of times larger than the earth! And there=
 are other stars
of our nakshatra/rashichak ra that are supposed to affect =
me individually as per
the Dasha-Bhukti that is running in my horoscope! Ho=
wever, this fantastic
statement has no leg to stand upon since the nearest =
star of that Rashichakra
is Shravana! And do you know its distance from me?=
 It is seventeen light
years!=A0 And it is several times larger than our su=
n!=A0 In other words,
if that star wants i.e. Shravana wants to =93affect=
=94 me individually,
it will take it at least seventeen years to do so even=
 if that
=93effect=94 travels at the speed of light!=A0 And by then, my Rah=
u
or Shani or whatever Dasha it may be must have been over! Then how can su=
ch a
star which is trillions of times larger than me send its rays in a con=
centrated
form just to haunt me at a particular point of time!=A0 Can you i=
magine what
type of laughing stocks we are making of ourselves=A0 by believ=
ing in such
hocus pocus!

Similarly, the next nearest star of our Rashichak=
ra is Swati !=A0 It is away
by 26 light years from me  

and is again sever=
al
times larger than our sun!! 

It thus defies
imagination as to how we ca=
n call astrology a science or how it can be said
that the =93Stars affect u=
s=94. 

 =A0 

Patri
Melapak (Horoscope Matching) is not warranted by shast=
ras nor =A0astrology
books: 

=A0Now coming to the
fad called Patri Melapak=
=A0 i.e. horoscope matching!=A0 This fad is the
rage of the day! You will b=
e surprised to know that none of our shastras,
whether the Manusmriti or th=
e Ramayana or the Mahabharata, leave alone the
Vedas, have anything to do w=
ith Patri Melapak even by mistake!=A0 We do not
find any instances that any=
 Vedic Rishi was addicted to such a fad, since may
be then most of them wou=
ld still have been looking for a =93suitable
Patri=94 for melapak! Not to s=
peak of Dharma shastras, there is no mention
of this type of a malady in an=
y of the astrology books like the so called
Parashari, or Mansagari or Phal=
a Deepika or Jataka Parijata or any other
work!=A0 It appears to be a creat=
ion of the jyotishis of over the last
=A0one hundred years or so. Aleberuni=
, who visited India in 1030 AD and =A0recorded quite
faithfully all his exp=
eriences about Jyotisha and other things in India 
also has not mentioned a=
nything of any =93Melapak=94 in his work!

Calendar Reform =
Committee=94: 

Summing up, as we have
just seen, not only are we subjected=
 to non-existent fear psychosis like
Kalasarpa Dosha and Patri Melapak etc.=
 but we are compelled to celebrate all
our festivals on worng days.=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0There are quite
a few people who agree with my point of view th=
at these days we are celebrating
Pitra Amavasya on the day of Dipavali and =
marriages during Pitra-Paksha!=A0
Similarly, we never celebrate Makar Sankr=
anti on correct days i.e. December
21/22 but we celebrate it on January 14.=
=A0 We also celebrate Vaishakhi on
April 14 instead of the day of Spring Eq=
uinox i.e., March 21 or so.=A0 This
has been all because of the so called =
=93Vedic astrology=94 

To put our festivals
back on the right track, I mad=
e quite a few representations to the
Hon=92ble President of India, the Prim=
e Minister of India, various ministries
besides the Positional Astronomy Ce=
ntre at Calcutta , who publish our Rashtriya
Panchanga.=A0 I also made simi=
lar representations to all the reverred
Shankaracharyas of all the six peet=
has,
besides other saints and Mahatmas, but sorry to say, there has been ab=
solutely
no response from any quarter! 

We=A0 have now formed
an =93All In=

for the same.=A0=
 Those interested can log on to http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/HinduCalen =

; That was your belief and also the belief of the entire humanity whether d=
ead or alive.  In the same way most of the Indians, why only Indians t=
he entire community feels that astrology do exists and we can predict our f=
uture may not be 100% but yes to some extent.  If human beings are giv=
en the power to predict that we do not call ourselves as human beings we wo=

the power to forsee the future.<br><br><br>But please understand that there=

 are great souls on this earth like Pandit Sanjay Rath, Shri PVR Narsimha =
rao their disciples who have understood the subject in depth.  The par=

his science.<br><br>You said there is no Sade Sathi, I know what Sade Sathi=

that I am a dumb person and will take whatever comes to me , I am a very ha=

the Uttarayan=

January 14 is =

odern astronomy.  Similarly, the Vaishakhi that is being

 April 14 or so also is wrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but
Vishuva =
(Vernal Equinox) or Vasant Sampat and it cannot take place on any
 day=
 other than March 21/22, when the day and night are equal. Actually
these M=
akara etc. sankrantis were known as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic
peri=

Madh=
