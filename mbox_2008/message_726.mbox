from where such a telling analogy comes out? :) it was too =
good and

Namaste Rajarshi ji,


toda=
y when i offered Purnahuti (Dry Half Coconut) the fire was about 
to exting=
uish. when such things happen, i take a couple of Camphor 
peice (square or=
 round shape) put it in homa kund and light it by 
some external stick ligh=
ted from a ghee-lamp.

during Homam- 1) I keep vigile that fire remains alw=
ays sufficiently 
blazing.

2) if still in case if it extinguishes, i lit i=
t again with Camphor 
pieces and carry on without worrying about anything a=
s if nothing has 
happenned. MahaGanapati for sure will not be unhappy even=
 if such a 
thing happenned even after careful conduct..but NOT on account =
of 
repeated negligence. 

warm regards,

utpal

 Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is 
actually better =
than doing it in closed space. But realize that a

           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish 
traveled=
 together to several places (on a specific project). We ended 
up doing hom=
am in the morning in several places (wherever we were). 
Before the trip, m=
y guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As 
monsoons come only in June=
/July in India, I did not take it 
seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-M=
ay.. We proceeded to the 
rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to d=
o a homam. Manish 
told me, "Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this=
 city after 
our homam finishes". I just smiled.

ise, it did rain as soon as our homas 
finished. After we offered poornaahu=

with really big drops. Luckily, there was =
a small towel/blanket on 
the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on =
top of the two small 
homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held t=
he cloth cover 
on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went o=
ff and 
then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later=
 
that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days 
in=
 New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered 
the north=
, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went 
to, as we finis=
hed our task in that place and prepared to move on.
