Garu,

2 more questions

1) For a Family, both husband and wife needs to do=
 the procedure or 
only one of them can do it or is it better if both of th=
em together 
do it?

2)In the conclusion of Tarpan (Refering to Manual), I =
assume that 
the Sitting Posture is as described Initially in the manual (D=
eva 
Parpan) i.e. Righ knee touching Ground and left knee out of contact.

Best Regards,

Utpal
