Namaste,
=A0
Every tradition has a valid basis, but also corrupted in tim=
e..
=A0
So many people touch the feet with hands or forehead when bowing to=
 elders. It is incorrect to say that "all of elder's punyas" are transferre=
d then. So many people touch the head of youngsters with hand to bless. It =
is incorrect to say that "all of youngster's sins" are transferred then.
=
=A0
However, this belief is not without a basis. When a person touches the =
feet of a person with awakened energy, *some* transfer of energy occurs aut=
omatically, whether or not one is aware (that is why we have the tradition =
of touching the feet of saints). However, how much energy gets transferred =
is dependent on the capabilities of the two persons, the strength of the de=
sire in the two persons for (or against) the transfer and the previous rina=
 between the person.
=A0
It is not necessary to touch the feet of a person =
with the forehead. It is possible to touch with hands and receive energy. O=
nce one young man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched my feet at=
 the end=A0to take blessings. Normally, when people to do that, I mentally =
say "sarvam Sri Krishnarpanamastu" and imagine that the obeisance is going =
to Lord Krishna. But, this time, I could clearly feel some energy leaving m=
e. It was a very tangible feeling. This person touched specific spots in th=
e two feet with a specific mudra of the two hands.
=A0
Of course, one can d=
ismiss my feeling as a hallucination. But, when the same young man came to =
a Satya Narayana vratam at my house later in the week and touched the feet =
of a very good priest who came from India (the same one who I said performe=
d the first Chandi homam at my house, arranged for the shata Chandi homam i=
n Chennai and had books on homam gifted to us), he immediately exclaimed "s=
ir, we have to be careful with this boy! He seems to do some sadhana. He de=
finitely knows how to take away some energy from people." I had not told hi=
m what I had experienced a few days back and this was his independent concl=
usion after the same experience as mine!
=A0
I am convinced that some enegy=
 give and take happens when feet and head are touched for blessings. Howeve=
r, it requires a certain level of ability and purity to receive energy from=
 someone by touching feet. So many people touched my feet.=A0Only a handful=
 gave me the feeling that some energy left me.
=A0
There is another way to =
look at this. If a person gets something=A0from me, it is probably because =
there is some rina.=A0Why should I try to resist a payback of rina? Who are=
 we anyway to give or to take? All the energy deposited in all the beings o=
f this universe is Hers anyway. Why should one look at the energy deposited=
 in oneself as one's own?
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *
=A0
My simple bottomline advice is this:
=A0
If someone pays obeisance t=
o you, let them do it. Do not feel proud or superior when someone touches y=
our feet.=A0Think that Krishna (or Shiva) in him is paying obeisance to Kri=
shna (or Shiva) in you and offer it to Krishna (or Shiva). When you touch t=
he feet of someone, feel humble and think that the person you are bowing to=
 is a limited manifestation of Krishna (or Shiva). Leave the rest of the ka=
rma/energy=A0calculations out and do not worry.
=A0
At the same time, if so=
meone does not let you touch his/her feet, just bow to them and pay obeisan=
ce in the mind without a physical touch. You can still feel humble and thin=
k that the person you are bowing to is a limited manifestation of Krishna (=
or Shiva).
=A0
A lot of this is in the mind and controlling the mind is the=
 key.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
