Dear Rajarshiji,
Thank you very much for the response. Sometimes I feel I m=
issed the 
golden era(1800- early 1900). It was the time many saints were b=
orn. 
Sri Shirdi Saibaba, Sri Swami Samarth(Akkalkot maharaj), Sri Ramana 
=
Maharshi, Sri Tajuddin baba, Sri Bhagavan Nityananda, Nisargadatta 
Maharaj=
, Ramakrishna parmahansa, Trilinga swami, Lahiri baba, 
Yukteswara Maharaj,=
 Pakalapati guruji and many other saints were 
born in that golden era. I t=
oo accept that the presence of the 
saints just near to us is highly benifi=
cial than anything. However 
still many people near to those saints didn't =
use those great saints 
help. Sri Shirdi Saibaba himself told that everybod=
y was coming to 
him for material wealth and nobody was asking spiritual we=
alth. In 
my opinion, if we pray sincerely, even now also those saints will=
 
respond to us. In my observation, devotion with other kinds of 
meditatio=
n gives excellent results. Combination of strong conviction 
on guru or god=
, meditation on beingness(I like pranayama, vipasana, 
and zen too), chanti=
ng of the powerful Gayatri Mantra or any other 
mantras we are connected gi=
ves highly benificial results. Finally it 
leads us to sarwasya saranagati =
and complete detachment. As human 
mind needs variety, we can increase our =
sadhana time by trying all 
these different approaches. 
              Inde=
ed this is also great time. As technology advanced 
very well with internet=
 and computers, now we can have a great 
awareness on many spiritual topics=
. We can read and analyze about 
various kinds of spiritual practises and c=
hoose which one fits best 
to our temper irrespective of religion. 

      =
         However as sri Sivananda swami told as ounce of 
practise is bette=
r than tons  of theory. Let us practise, practise, 
practise until being on=
e with oneness.
                                     

                    =
           Thanks and Regards
