OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA
Dear Sri Narasimha P.V.R. Rao Ji,
Namaskar.
We expected a =
small bite but you gave us a full meal. Thank you very 
much ji.
One more r=
equest is there for your kind help ji. After performing 
the Homa, some tim=
es I may be blessed to receive the coins which 
were put in the fire along =
with aguthi; but still now I do not know 
how to preserve it. When I asked,=
 peoples told me to keep them in my 
pooja room. At this juncture I request=
 your kind help to shed more 
light on this so that we will be able to unde=
rstand the things that 
what we are doing.
With respects.
Yours Sincerely,
=
S.Dheenadayalan
