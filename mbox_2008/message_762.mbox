Respected sirs,

just joined the group today and apologise if i am asking e=
lementary 
things.

Is it necessary that if one does japa or mantra chantin=
g, the mantra 
should be given by  a Guru ?  I chant gayatri mantra, but it=
s not 
guru given, does this make the mantra less effective ?

Kindly guide=
.

Thanks

Usha
