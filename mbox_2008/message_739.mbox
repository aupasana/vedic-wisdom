Hare Rama Krishna
Dear Narasimha.
Yes, I agree, it is impossible to know the hearts and
mind of  pure devotees.The simple phrase, "actions
speak louder than words", can often times make things
clear, over time, great personalities are revealed.
Even when Krishna was on the planet how many were
aware of him?

Or the "proof is in the pudding"  : )
I also agree it is best not to make judgments on
others spiritual lives.
And what maybe good for one person , might not be
suitable for another.
Most important thing is that people are on SOME path!
If you come to San Jose area, please let me know,I
like to video tape you doing a havan etc.
Thanks
Lakshmi
