Hi,

With all due respect to both Gandhiji and Yogeshwar, I completely 
dis=
agree to this story. If you look deeper Gnadhiji and Narshi Mehta 
are pole=
s apart. Narsi Mehta was one of those few people who in the 
path of bhakti=
 had come to the stage of being able to percieve and 
uderstand the real ra=
sa-lila of krishna. This happens at a VERY VERY 
VERY advanced stage. All t=
he nadis in the body get cleared beyond 
the three gunas and then and only =
then the energy of the soul flows 
throught them and rasa lila can be under=
stood happening inside the 
body. Someone who has reached this stage would =
NEVER EVER in any 
birth think of anything other than this stage. It is, th=
ey say, far 
beyond anythin one can even remote imagine.

Gandhiji had a di=
fferent purpose, and he was a different man 
completely from Narsi Mehta. H=
is aim and focus of life was 
independence struggle which he did fight for =
in his own remarkable 
way. No doubt he was a terrific personality in terms=
 of the indian 
as well as the world politcan scenario. But he was not real=
ly a 
spiritual saint. Unlike Narsi Mehta who was a pure saint and nothing =

else. Both have their purpose in the scheme of things and both are 
equall=
y worthy of respect. But one is not the other at all! No even 
in any birth=
s. Never.
