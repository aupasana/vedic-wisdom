Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for this. My last question and a comment/questio=
n if you 
have a moment in your busy day.

Is it always advisable to start =
out with a Ganesh Mantra just to be 
sure that our prayers are actually acc=
epted by the Lord? Is "Om Gam 
Ganapataye Namaha" considered a Prasiddha ma=
ntra? Is "Om Hrim Gam 
Hrim Mahaganapataye Namaha" also considered Prasiddh=
a? I have heard 
that Hrim bija can be very detrimental to 7th house so not=
 sure about 
the later mantra.

My following comment/question is meant in a=
n purely inquisitve sense 
and not in a judgemental one. It always struck m=
e as odd, that 
pronunciation of Mantra can be very critical, especially wi=
th mantra 
like Gayatri. This makes me think we are merely tapping into som=
e 
kind of power to be sure, but not God himself as why would God care 
abo=
ut things such as pronunciation/intonation? Same goes for 
Homa/Yagya and s=
o forth. Why the need for such elaborate things? I 
also know some Kriya Yo=
ga practioners and it can be quite complex. 
Why not something simple like =
sitting and concentrating at third eye 
center? Does one really need to und=
ertake elaborate/ritualistic 
measures to "reach" God? I personally like th=
e approach of Zen 
Buddhism or Surat Shabd Yoga. This is just my opinion an=
d not meant 
to be construed as offensive or even abrasive in any manner, m=
y 
apologies if it does.

Thank you.
