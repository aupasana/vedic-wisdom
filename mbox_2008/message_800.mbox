Dear Utpalji,
So far my limited knowledge is concerned, Shri Krishna was a =
historical reality. He was born and the time given in Notable Horoscope is =
also correct. Ved Vyasji was also alive in the same period when Shri Krishn=
a was alive. Ved Vyasji tried to spread knowledge of Vedas and Upanishadas =
to common men and he wrote lots of Puranas and long poem of Mahabharat. Mah=
abharat was a reality but was not in the same form as narrated by Vyasji. V=
yasji has given immaginary characters and incidents but his intention was t=
o spread knowledge of Vedas/Upanishadas thru Gita. There was a discussion b=
etween Krishna and Arjuna in a normal form and not in Sanskrit. He advised =
Arjuna to start war after giving him the theory of Karma. Vyasji just gave =
a poetic form in sanskrit.

Narasimha Garu & Members,

There is a long pending question wit=
h me and that is Historical 
reality or otherwise of our many revered perso=
nalities/ events.

Take for instance, 'Mahabhaarat' & 'Shri Krishna'.

I wo=
uld try to give some view points gathered from all these years 
from variou=
s sources and my own thinking as well-

1) Mahatma Gandhi didn't belive tha=
t Mahabhaarat was a reality.he 
thought that it was 'epic'-creation of a po=
et. he seems to be unable 
to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc=
...

2) How can parents name their children as 'DURYodhan', 'Du:Shasan' 
et=
c.. i am not sure about the meaning of the names but it implies 
something =
perverted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can shed some 
light on this.

3=
) Mahabhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent author, 
Mahars=
hi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and krsihna 
was just a '=
imaginary' central character of his grand work.

!.....!..... !

1) Dr. Ram=
an, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly written that Shri 
Krishna was a his=
torically reality. His reasoning was that an 
*Imaginery creation* of some =
poet can never Inspire & attract 
millions of people for thousans of years.=


2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to 
satis=
fy his poetic genious then how come he himself features in the 
story? if l=
et's consider even that as a possibility but then WHY 
he'll write another =
book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why 
he'll himself Worship his o=
wn 'Kaalpanik Paatra'.

3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so=
 many Saints of 
yesteryears, saw his form.
One can argue that becuase of t=
heir intense worship of that 
perticular Form, they could see the same form=
 of the supreme 
reality...the supreme power can take any form for the Bhak=
ta.
The solid counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and 
Maharshi =
Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of that form of 
Shri Krishna, th=
en how come in their case, without devotion & desire 
they got to see the f=
orm of Shri Krushna?

!....!....!

Any thoughts about this? How to conclusi=
vely establish the Truth in 
this case?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
