Namaste dear Manjunath ji,
 
All the best for Mahaganapathi homam. I expect=
 to upload the mp3 for the latest manual in 2 weeks. Yes, I realize that au=
dio helped, and will help, many.
 
Chandi homam is quite powerful. If one w=
ith strong desires performs it well for a period of time, one can fulfil mo=
st desires. Thus, there is scope for abuse. On the other hand, if one perfo=
rms it well for a period of time without much desire, She can put one on th=
e fast track and give a high level of detachment and very quick spiritual p=
rogresss. It can sometimes be too quick for the person.
 
Chandi (also refe=
rred to in the saptashati as "Narayani" or the energy of Narayana) is the u=
nification of various energies represented by Braahmi, Vaishnavi, Maheswari=
, Koumari, Vaaraahi, Kaali etc. She is the union of Mahakaali, Mahalakshmi =
and Mahasaraswati - three root energies behind the creation, sustenance and=
 destruction of this universe. If someone is ready to worship that *primord=
ial energy* in fire, I can give some instructions privately. But there are =
no plans to create a Chandi homam manual like Mahaganapathi homam manual.
 =

Best regards,
Narasimha

omplete,<BR>> why do more sadhanas?<BR>>  
<BR>> Homam (fire =
ritual) is more effective than worshipping an idol or 
a<BR>> kalasham. =
If you can learn Chandi homam in laghu paddhati (2 hours) 
and<BR>> do i=
t once in the morning and once in the evening (or atleast once 
in<BR>> =
the day) for 128 days, you should see a big improvement in your 
material<B=
R>> and spiritual lives.<BR>>  <BR>> With some heavy 
sadhana=
 with Chandi patham/homam, you can recover most<BR>> of your 
investment=
 and minimize the loss. But, in future, do not make<BR>> any risky 
inve=
stments. This is not your time to do such things.<BR>>  <BR>>
