You are right - there are different traditions. I t=
oo have not seen the installation of dik-palakas as part of Mahaganapathi h=
omam before. As you said, we pray to dikpalakas on the 8 or 10 corners of h=
oma kundam as a part of every homa, but installing them before the homa is =
new.
 
However, installation of dikpalakas happens traditionally in some ot=
her homas such as Chandi homam. In a traditional Chandi homam, we install t=
ens of deities including the ten dikpalakas, in separate kalashas on a big =
peetham before starting the homam. They are arranged in a specific way on a=
 specific yantra drawn on rice with turmeric and vermilion. We pray to them=
 and then do the fire ritual.
 
Though I know that I will ruffle some feath=
ers with this, I must make a related point. The point of a homam is to call=
 deities in fire (as fire is a purer and better medium to host their energy=
 than an idol or a water pot) and offer mantras. Though there is some proce=
dure before starting fire, care should taken so that one spends a majority =
of the time worshipping in fire. That is the basic idea of a homam. While s=
ome priests do that, I have seen some who miss the point and do a lot of th=
e procedure before starting the fire and spend a minimal time with the fire=
. For the best results, maximize the time your spend with fire and offer mo=
re and more mantra to the deity in fire.
 
> In my native place, the tradit=
ional homa only takes half that time,
> and it is not due to shortcuts.
 
I=
ndia's Kerala state (aren't you from there?) used to have a community of le=
arned Brahmanas who would do an half hour Ganapathi homam every morning bef=
ore leaving the house. What a great sadhana! Even if one is carrying a lot =
of bad karmas, such a powerful sadhana will eventually free one. Hopefully,=
 such a community - spread across the entire world - will be created in the=
 next 100 years.
 
This is Kali yuga. Bad karmas are accumulated very quick=
ly. Even a pure soul who took birth with very few bad karmas accumulates en=
ough of them by the age of 20 that it takes heavy sadhana thereafter to bur=
n them! Then what of those who are *born* with many bad karmas?
 
Whether y=
ou do homam or something else, spiritual sadhana to burn karmas and overcom=
e ego is a must for every thinking human being. Use the human birth to do y=
our dharma, purify yourself and overcome ego. Kali does everything to make =
you forget your dharma, add impurities to your system and feed your ego fur=
ther. That is the nature of Kali.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
