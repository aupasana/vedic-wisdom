"Dr. Frank Morale=
s represents the Sankalpa [the will] of the Hindu
people and the cause of S=
anatana Dharma. I urge all Hindus
everywhere to give him your full support,=
 assistance, and
encouragement in his crucial work. He needs and deserves o=
ur help."

- Dr. David Frawley (Oct. 14, 2007)




The Teachings of the Bha=
gavad Gita

The one who controls the senses by the trained and purified min=
d and
intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service is
co=
nsidered superior. (3.07)

Perform your obligatory duty, because working is=
 indeed better than
sitting idle. Even the maintenance of your body would n=
ot be possible
without work. (3.08)

Work other than those done as a selfle=
ss service (Seva) binds human
beings. Therefore, becoming free from selfish=
 attachment to the fruits
of work, do your duty efficiently as a service to=
 Me. (3.09)

Q=
uestion from one of Dr. Morales' students:


Namaste,

As so many of us the=
se days seem to be doing much of this work
all at once, how do we structure=
 our spiritual practices to better
fit in to this traditional model? Especi=
ally in the West, we tend to
get a little overzealous about everything, alm=
ost looking at the
System of Yoga as something to push through or conquer. =
I think it
is wonderful that we get so excited about our spirituality, but =
do we
need to slow down, back-up a little, and be on a more natural
"schedu=
le"? Or can we just be fully aware of the Four Ashramas and All
the Eight L=
imbs of Yoga and continue to pursue each one sincerely and
with devotion re=
cognizing this shift?

Many thanks to Acharyaji Dr. Frank Morales.

Om Shan=
ti,

Sita




Dr. Morales' Answer:


Dear Sita,

Namaste. It does seem that=
 there are an infinite number of demands
on our schedules today compared to=
 the past! People today are
riddled with jobs, classes, active Internet liv=
es, family, a barrage
of information coming at us, etc., etc. To add Yoga, =
meditation and
a satisfying spiritual life on top of all this often seems p=
retty
daunting.

The idea of spiritual life is ultimately one of balance. T=
he path of
Yoga teaches us that balance in all things is necessary to make
=
spiritual progress. In the Bhagavad Gita, for example, Sri Krishna
says:

"=
One can have no success in Yoga if one eats too much or eats too
little. No=
r can one be successful if one sleeps too much or does not
sleep enough." (=
B.G. 6:16)

We are meant to practice Yoga in a way that is healthy, realist=
ic,
and conducive to advancement. Thus, we have to avoid extremes in our
li=
fe, and live our life in such a way that we can come to a happy
compromise =
with A) our sadhana (practice) and B) our duties in life.

As far as knowin=
g where the line lies between balance and obsession,
that will vary in acco=
rdance with the individual. A good indicator
that you may be over-extending=
 yourself in sadhana at the expense of
the other important aspects of your =
life is precisely when sadhana
begins to be seen as a burden rather than a =
joy, and to produce
anxiety rather than peace.

When we are performing asan=
as, for example, we know that we have
pushed our bodies too far when an asa=
na has gone from being merely
challenging to being painful. At that point, =
we are being given a
hint by our body that it is time to pull back a little=
, and if we go
further, we may end up injuring ourselves.

In the same way =
that we need to hear and respect what our body is
communicating to us in as=
ana, we also need to hear what our inner
self is telling us with our sadhan=
a practice. It is important always
to challenge ourselves in a healthy and =
progressive manner. But if
we go beyond that fine line from challenge to un=
healthy extremes,
then we need to adjust ourselves accordingly and reassess=
 how much we
can do in accordance with our capabilities, the time we have, =
our
other demands in life, and our goal in spiritual practice.

If, on the =
other hand, our problem is not just that we feel that
we're pushing ourselv=
es too much spiritually, but that we actually
want to perform more sadhana =
but simply do not have the time, then
this is a different concern. This is =
still a matter of balance, but it
is now one of a balance of priorities. In=
 this case, there are several
options that one can follow. These include: A=
) reassessing just how
important other specific, non-spiritual activities a=
re to one's
life. Are there some activities =96 even just one or two =96 th=
at can be
put on hold or scaled down to give you more time? Can you take on=
e
less class, work a few less hours a week, or make some other minor
adjust=
ments? B) Another course of action is maximizing the time you
do have, doin=
g things more efficiently as much as is feasible.

What spiritual practitio=
ners often find is that, interestingly, when
we take somewhat of a leap of =
faith and put our spiritual life first,
what then happens is that the rest =
of our life quite naturally
becomes more balanced and efficient. When we ma=
ke room in our lives
for meditation, Yoga, and spirituality in general, we =
consequently
find the energy, inspiration, focus, and determination to maxi=
mize
what we're doing in the rest of our lives.

While the four ashramas (t=
he four successive stages of life in
Hinduism: a) student life, b) married =
life, c) retired life, d) a life
of complete dedication to spirituality) ar=
e certainly excellent guides
as to how we should structure our lives in acc=
ordance with where we
find ourselves in the ashrama time-frame, as people l=
iving in the
modern world, we also have to make whatever adjustments are ne=
cessary
giving thought to our present demands and lifestyles.

For many of =
us, for example, we might be in the grihastha (married)
stage, but also fin=
d ourselves as students (brahmacharya). Or some
might be in the student sta=
ge, but also be married and having to work
at least part time. So, ideally =
we are meant to follow one ashrama at
a time, but if we need to make some a=
djustments for our own situation,
that's fine.

The best way to see stages =
and categories in Vedic culture (whether
ashramas, varnas, yugas, etc.) is =
to see the boundaries between each
to be somewhat fluid. Rather than seeing=
 such stages as strict,
compartmental categories where one ends and the oth=
er abruptly
begins, the following might be a good analogy to understand the=
se
stages better:

Such stages are similar to the area between the land and=
 the sea on a
beach. While one can clearly distinguish land from water, at =
the
same time it is difficult to say exactly where one begins and the
other=
 ends. In the same way, if we find ourselves clearly in one
ashrama, while =
still performing some duties of another ashrama out of
necessity, that's fi=
ne. Guidelines like ashrama are meant to enhance
our spiritual life, and no=
t hamper it.

For the eight limbs of Yoga, in the beginning stages we often=
 have no
choice but to incrementally add one limb after another over a peri=
od
of time=85again, mostly do to a lack of time in our lives. However, it
i=
s not the case that we need to perfect our practice of one limb
before proc=
eeding to another. Rather, we're meant ultimately to be
following all eight=
 limbs simultaneously =96 from Yama/Niyama to
Samadhi.

I hope this was hel=
pful. Take care.

Om Shanti,

Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

The Spiritual and Empirical Realities

"Our perception=

each day are real o=
nly in a secondary, derivative sense. While it
would be foolish to deny the=
 actual existence of empirical reality, it
is even more foolish to claim th=

while real on the material level =96 is only a=
 pale shadow of the
spiritual Reality that is our home and that is the basi=
s of our true
being. While the objects, situations, and causality of this s=
ensory
realm are all temporary, the nature of the highest, spiritual Realit=

is eternal =96 being a Reality that transcends the element of time, and
t=
