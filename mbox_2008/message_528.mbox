Dear members,

  This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya which was expounded by a
great Dattatreya Upasaka.  The turiya asrama name of this upasaka is
Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati who happens to be the devi upasaka in
the lineage of Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati (Tembe Maharaj).  There
is no whereabouts of this great upasaka but I got some of the
wonderful manuscripts related to Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya and Yoga
Gayatri Upasana, its process of meditation and the process of Shat
Chakra Bhedana.

  Though the presentation of entire contents of the manuscripts is
not possible for me as the manuscripts runs into 150 pages, here is
an attempt of mine to highlight some of the important points which
may be useful to the upasakas.  However, this should be learnt from
sadguru hailing from sat-sampradaya.

  The 3 charitas of sapthasati are the symbolic representation of 3
knots or grandhis namely brahma grandhi, Vishnu grandhi and rudra
grandhi.  The chit-AbhAsa (false identification of the sthula,
sukshma and karana dehas to be �?oone�?Ts own self�?�).  This
�?~chidAbhAsa�?� is of 3 types: karmaja, sahaja and bhramaja.

  Brahma grandhi is the identification of oneself with sthula deha
(sthula deha abhimana).   The sthula and sukshma deha tAdAtmyata
(false identification of oneself with gross and subtle body). This is
Karmaja Chidabhasa. The annihilation of pUrvajanma vAsanAs in the
form of �?oMala�?� or �?odirt�?� is Brahma Grandhi Bhedana.

  Vishnu Grandhi is the identification of oneself with sukshma deha
(sukshma deha abhimana).    AntahkaraNa-chidAbhAsa-tadAtmyata is the
Sahaja ChidAbhAsa.  Annihilation of manO-vikshEpa is the Vishnu
Grandhi Bhedana.

  Rudra Grandhi is the identification of oneself with Karana deha
(chidAbhAsa adhishTAna chaitanya tAdAtmyata).  This is Bhramaja
Chidabhasa.  The dawn of sva-svarupa jnana when the avarana dosha
(veil of ignorance in the form of Avidya) is removed is the Rudra
Grandhi Bhedana.

  So, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra Grandhis are the 3 episodes or charitas of
Chandi Sapthasati.  The sumedha rishi of Sapthasathi is the Rishi
Haritayana who was initiated into Srividya by Shri Parashurama.
Parashurama inturn was initiated by Sage Dattatreya.

  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner significance of
Sapthsati says that �?osavarni�?� is the surya sakti,
�?osvArochisha�?� is the svarga-sambandha-jyoti,
�?ochaitravamshasamudbhavah�?� is the being born and re-born as
different species (chitra vichitra janma), �?okshitimandala�?� is the
gross physical body or sarira, �?osuratha�?� is the jiva who is
interested in 3rd purusharta ie., kama and �?oSamadhi�?� is the jiva
who is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.


  Vishnu-karna-mala is the �?omala�?� or �?odirt�?� or �?ocovering�?�
around the chidAkasa (Vishnu-karna).  During the dissolution, Vishnu
is one with Yogamaya and hence Chit swarupa.  Karna is the sruti
(ear) whose tanmatra is sound.  So, Madhu and Kaitabha are the Mala /
Dirt that covers the Nirmala Chidakasa.  Madhu is the Ananda Lakshana
and Kaitabha is the �?omyriad of insects�?� in the form of Sanchita
Karma.  The Brahma which is symbolic representation of Manas (Mind)
praises the Mahamaya to annihilate the Madhu-Kaitabha in the form of
Sanchita Karma.  Waking up of Vishnu is the MahAprANa in Action.

  So, annihilitation of   Madhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Karmajata-
tadAtmyata in the form of brahmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).

  The Madhyama Charita indicates the Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is
of the form of Sahaja Chidabhasa.  Mahishasura represents Rajo Guna
in the form of Krodha (anger).

  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a �?oSecret Upanishad
Vidya�?� which is embedded in Madhyama Charita.  This is called
�?oJyotishmati Vidya�?�.  The Nada which the Devi makes is the
Anahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is the Himsa dharma which
the sadhaka has to adopt during the upasana. The Jiva with Himsa
Bhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava.  The vyashti prana of the
Jiva dissolves in Samasti Prana.  When this is achieved, the Sukshma-
deha abhimana drops off.  This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana.  This is
the victory over sahaja-chidAbhAsa.

  Though among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has penetrated till Vijnana-maya
Kosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhUti which is only through
AparOksha Jnana.  With the dawn of Aparoksha Jnana, the last knot is
removed which is Rudra Grandhi.  With the removal of veil of
ignorance, the avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa.

  Chanda denotes mUlAvidya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana
denotes bhrAnti, raktabIja denotes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);
shumbha denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denotes mamakara. The 8 armies of
shumbha-nishumbha denotes:
  ghriNa, lajja, bhaya, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, jAti.  These 8
tendencies are 8 pAsAs (ashta-pAsa).  To remove these 8 pasas, the 8
vidya murtis come forth in the form of Brahmi, �?�..etc.

  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explains wonderfully the Chandi
Navakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara Tantra and Shri
Bhaskara.  Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya.

  There are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya.  They are Viccheswari,
Hamseshwari, Samvartheshwari.  Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa
Amnaya Devata �?oViccheshwari�?� which is the �?overy auspicious
deity�?� and �?oever intent in giving liberation out of
compassion�?�.  This is the �?ochitkala rupa parama Ardra dEvta�?�
which bestows the �?opralaya jnana�?� to the upasaka.  Moreover,
�?ovicche�?� is vit+cha+I which implies �?ochit�?�, �?osat�?� and
Ananda rupa of the Chamunda which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali
(aim), Mahalakshi (hrim) and Mahasaraswati (klim).  To such Chamunda
who destroys the Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya, I bow.


  This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya given by Paramahamsa
Parivrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who hails from Datta
Sampradaya.

  With regards,
  sriram
