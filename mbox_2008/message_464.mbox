Sir
=C2=A0
Thanks you VERY VERY much! I had this doubt that it cannot be wh=
at it shows in the internet translation, but since I myself do not know san=
skrit I though you would be the most authentic person to ask. Thank you onc=
e again!.
=C2=A0
I shall try to get Sri Aurobindos translations. Thank you =
Sir.

Namaste,

Do you really think that these internet translations are a=
ccurate? Of course 
not. These are unintelligent and dumb translations at b=
est and ill-motivated 
translations with a hideous agenda at worst. In eith=
er case, do bot rely on 
them.

Let me reproduce the rik.

Rishi: Angirasa =
Virupa, Chhandas: Gayatri, Devata: Agni

ukShaannaaya vashaannaaya somapR^i=
ShThaaya vedhase | stomairvidhemaagnay e | 
RV 8-43-11 |

The translation g=
iven by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati in the version 
published by Veda Pra=
tishthana, New Delhi is: "Let us adore with hymns the 
fire-divine, who is =
fed on agricultural products, dairy products, and who 
bears the herbal pla=
nts on the back."

This is far more intelligent than what you quoted. Howev=
er, I am still not 
satisfied. Let me give my take on it. I just meditated =
on it for a few 
minutes and this is what I make of it.

* * *

(uksha =3D =
supreme, large
anna =3D matter)
ukshaannaaya =3D to one who feeds the chann=
el of domination, i.e. pingala nadi
(vasha =3D submissive, controlled, obed=
ient
anna =3D matter)
vashaannaaya =3D to one who feeds the channel of subm=
ission, i.e. ida nadi
somapR^iShThaaya =3D to one who carries the nectar of=
 immortality in the 
middle channel, i.e. sushumna nadi
vedhase =3D to the =
one who is virtuous and great
stomaih =3D by hymns
vidhema =3D may we worsh=
ip/praise/ honor/contemplat e
agnaye =3D to fire.

MEANING: "May we contemp=
late on the fire god, who feeds the pingala nadi of 
dominance and ida nadi=
 of submission and virtuously carries the nectar of 
immortality in the sus=
humna nadi."

PURPORT: "Fire is the transformative power. It is the basis o=
f our 
existence. It is what fuels (feeds) every part of our being. The fir=
e that 
burns in the sookshma sareera (subtle body) is called bhoota agni. =
This fire 
feeds the pingala nadi (solar channel of the subtle body) and ca=
uses 
analytical and logical abilities and aggressive instincts of dominati=
on and 
control. The same bhoota agni also feeds the ida nadi (lunar channe=
l of the 
subtle body) and causes submission and calmness. In modern medica=
l parlance, 
we can say the same fire feeds and runs the sympathetic and pa=
rasympathetic 
nervous systems and provokes the "push" and "pull" actions o=
f the push-pull 
nervous system. In addition, the same bhoota agni also dri=
ves the sushumna 
nadi and makes the nectar of immortality (sat-chid-ananda=
) flow in that 
channel. We should contemplate the various roles played by =
this subtle fire 
in our subtle body in amazement."

If I spend more time, =
I may be able to do better justice. But this is what I 
understand of this =
rik as of now.

* * *

Veda is about self-knowledge and nothing less. Most =
people cannot understand 
even a single verse of Veda fully in an entire li=
fe. Ignore the people who 
claim to be scholars in Veda and make claims on =
what Veda says and what Veda 
does not say. Secondly, time has come to dump=
 all the abusive and motivated 
translations of Veda.

The only translation=
/ commentary on Veda that pleased me until now is the one 
by Sri Aurobindo=
. He is undoubtedly a reborn rishi. Such depth and clarity 
of thinking is =
impossible otherwise.

Best regards,
Narasimha
