Namaste,

Whether you want a guru to come to you or a deity to come to you, feeling a 
strong desire emotionally is important. Use the mental energy.

As Ramakrishna waited for Kali to give him darshan, he used to cry for Her. 
He also used to cry as he waited for the arrival of his disciples such as 
Naren, Rakhal, Jogin, Tarak etc. The people around him then were unable to 
understand his teachings and he knew that his eternal companions who would 
spend a few years with him and then spread true spirituality in the world 
were yet to come. He waited for several years and used to cry.

A child who is lost by parents at a fair and is alone may cry in pain and 
confusion, for parents. If one can become like that child and cry from the 
heart for deity or guru, one can get them. If you ask me, that is the best 
way.

Some also recommend chanting mantras of Dattatreya or Shiva or Krishna to 
get one's guru. One can do that, but feeling from the depths of one's heart 
the pain from the pangs of separation is vital.

Best regards,
Narasimha
