It is debatable whether this is actually a foregone conclusion or not. The =
times are different now than when NTR came. However, that is besides the po=
int.

Given that Chiranjeevi is said to be seriously considering political =
entry, this prediction, if made now, has a 50% (or perhaps higher) chance. =
However, when the Express Star Teller article was written in August 2000, t=
he chances of Chiranjeevi coming into politics in 2008-09 were not at all h=
igh. It was not a commonsense prediction, but made based just on the astrol=
ogical principles I know.

My purpose was not to tout, though one may assum=
e so. Because it is an interesting prediction from 8 years back, I wanted t=
o share it with fellow *fans of astrology*. This is about the greatness of =
Jyotish principles taught by Parasara and other rishis and how beautifully =
they work sometimes, even when applied by an idiot like me (my knowledge is=
 small now but was even smaller in 2000 when this prediction was made). Thi=
s is about Jyotish and not at all about me. Though some people like me and =
praise me, I am realistic enough to know how little I know. Also, I did mak=
e many bad predictions in the past. Thus, this is not at all about me and I=
 have no reason to tout.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
