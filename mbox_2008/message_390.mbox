Namaste,

Yes, sticking to one mantra and doing japam without any desire or
expectation is the *best* way to do spiritual sadhana. If you are doing
different mantras for different purposes (e.g. marital bliss, children,
money, job etc), it is ok to do many mantras. But, for spiritual progress,
it is better to leave everything else and get hold of just one mantra.

If you pray to any god to the best of your ability, using the best procedure
to *your knowledge*, without any expectations, then it is *never* a wrong
thing to do. Learn to love god, learn to ask god to help you overcome ego,
learn to *not* ask god for petty and impermanent things and learn to not
fear god or worship.

In my judgment, Shiva or Dattatreya are the best for you. Stick to a guru
form of god.

Best regards,
Narasimha
