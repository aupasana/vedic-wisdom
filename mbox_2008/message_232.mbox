Regular Health Mistakes   
        All of us make  little health mistakes that cause damage to our bodies in the long run -  simply because we are unaware we are doing something wrong. Here are some of  the most common mistakes made by  many of us.

Crossing our  legs 
Do you cross  your legs at your  knees when sitting? Although we may believe that this is the  lady-like elegant  way to sit, sitting this way cuts down circulation to your legs. If you don't  want varicose veins to mar the beauty of your legs  and compromise your  health, uncross your legs every time you realize you have one knee on top of the  other. The best way to sit is to simply place both legs together on the  floor, balancing your weight equally. If you feel like changing position, instead of crossing your legs, simply move both  legs together to one side. As an alternative, you could also consider  crossing your legs loosely at the ankles. This is  a classically elegant  way to sit, and is far better for your legs and  your health than  sitting with your legs  crossed at your knees.

Not changing our  toothbrush 
How often do  you change your toothbrush? Most of  us wait until most of the bristles have  either fallen off, or are in such bad  shape that we'd be embarrassed to pull out our brush in public. However,  since not many of us need to pull out our  brush in public, we carry on with our  frayed one until we lose it. Replace your  toothbrush often. Damaged  bristles can harm the enamel, and don't massage your  gums well. If you find brushing your teeth a pain like I do, but know you must do it, you  might as well be  doing it right. Imagine going through the  annoyance of brushing your teeth twice a  day only to find out that you're damaging your enamel every time you clean your  teeth. Also, use a brush with soft bristles unless your dentist has advised  otherwise.

Eating out  often
There are oils  that are high in  cholesterol, and oils that cause little harm and are better  for your heart.  However, no matter how light
the oil is, it is never a good idea to  eat too much of it.  Avoid fried foods. Remember that in all probability your favorite Indian  food
restaurant throws a huge, HUGE chunk of butter in a tiny bowl of dal. Rita,  who worked in the kitchen of a 5 star hotel, was shocked when she saw the cook  chop a 500gm butter slab in half, and throw half into a Paneer Makhani dish.  No wonder the  customers left licking their fingers. And no wonder they felt  so stuffed and heavy  afterwards. Limit outdoor eating unless you know that you're getting  served light and healthy food.

Skipping  breakfast
Never, ever  skip breakfast. Remember, when you wake up in the morning it's been  around 10-12 hours since your last meal. Your body needs food now, more than at  any other time. Eat a heavy breakfast. You will then be busy through the day,  and the calories will get expended quickly. If you are trying to diet, eat a  light dinner. Here are some more  common health mistakes we make.  Being informed and making a few  changes can help make us feel a whole lot  better.
  High  heels 
High heels sure  look great, but they're  murder for your back. This however doesn't mean you should steer clear of  stilettos. Wear them, but not when you know you will be walking around a lot. Wear  them when going out for lunch or dinner -  when the only walking you will be  doing is to your car, to the table, and back. Avoid high heels when you are  going somewhere on foot. If you are constantly tempted to wear your heels, take a good look at your flats. Is there something about them you dislike? Invest  in a new pair of beautiful flats or shoes with a low heel. Buy something you  love, that you will enjoy wearing. If possible, get a matching bag. You will  then enjoy your flats as  much as you do your heels.

Sleeping on a soft  bed
You don't have  to sleep on the floor be kind to your back,  but do make sure you have a firm  mattress. Although a mattress on springs  is soft and lovely to sink into, it's bad for your back. If you already have an old bed with springs, you don't need to invest in a new one - simply get a thick wooden plank put over the springs, and place the mattress on the plank.  Similarly, if your mattress is  old and lumpy, throw it out and get a new one. Your  neck and your back will thank you. The same rule applies to sofas. If  you will be spending  hours on a sofa, get a firm yet comfortable one. Sofas you  completely sink into are not the best idea.

Pillows
No matter how  comfortable sleeping with ten cushions is, have pity on your neck and resist.  Sleep with one pillow, and make sure it is not too thick.  If your pillow gets lumpy, discard it and go for a new one. Get a thin pillow  if you sleep on your stomach, and something a little thicker if you sleep on  your back, to give your neck adequate support.

Not  exercising 
So all of us  know we should exercise more, but many of us don't. This is a  health mistake we consciously make! And why is that? Simply because we refuse  to admit the damage we are causing to our bodies by not working out. A number of people  only start working out once they've experienced a warning signal.  Don't wait for a heart attack to strike before you decide to opt for a lifestyle  change. Make the change now. You don't need to train for the marathon to be in  top shape. Half an hour of brisk walking three to four times a week will make a  world of difference to your health. You could then increase this to forty  minutes, four times a week - and you're all set. If you haven't  exercised for a week, you're making a mistake.
