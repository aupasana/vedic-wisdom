Dear All

I wanted to share an experince I had with everyone. Since the tim=
e I 
had been doing homa on a regular basis I had first started off with 
a=
n iron kunda, then an aluminium and finally shifted to a copper 
homa kunda=
. And in each cases, I could feel some very papable 
effects.

When I was d=
oing it in an iron kunda for some days I would often get 
singed in the fla=
mes. Once it was to quite an extent, such taht I 
had problems in walking f=
or a few days. This was after I had used 
the iron kunda for consequetive h=
omas for some days.

Then I changed it and started using an Aluminuim kunda=
 which became 
dark and black with use. I had been using this aluminum kund=
a for 
about a month and half regularly when some strange things started 
h=
appening. There used to be some sort of infestation of incests in 
my pooja=
 room. One day I found a scorpion in my room! This was quite 
strange since=
 I had been living there for many months and now and 
never have I seen any=
 before. Then came spiders. Now I am generally 
scared of spiders. This had=
 a strange psychological effect on my 
mind, such that one day when I close=
d my eyes to meditate infront of 
the fire, I could just see spiders all ar=
ound. And strangest of all, 
within a few days I got bitten by one! Never h=
ad I or anyone else I 
knew, had known that spiders can bite. But this is a=
 fact, cause I 
went through it and it is quite painful. It sort of left a =
small 
gaping wound on my neck.

Then finally I shifted to a copper kunda a=
nd all such incidents 
stopped. Infact after using a copper kunda for somet=
ime it created a 
marked feeling of lightness and joy. Very distinct and pa=
pable.

Of course if someone takes a hard rational stance, all this can be =

put down to coincidence. But I personally do not think so. Infact 
these j=
ust proved the truth of Narasimhajis advice. Copper kundas 
are the best. I=
ron can increase effects of Shani in a person's life 
and sadhana. And Alum=
inium I believe is Rahu. The homa agni just 
amplified the effects.
