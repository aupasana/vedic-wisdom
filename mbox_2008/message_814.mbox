No my dear. My statement is not contradictory. I have said that Shri Krishn=
a is a reality and Ved Vyasji was also in the same time. This is what I hav=
e read. But the Mahabharat is a story full of immaginations. Most of the ch=
aracters are immaginary.

The above two statem=

However, the point is to find out the trut=
