Namaste Kumar ji,

     At Isha yOga=
, there are never any teachings, morals or philosophies
taught. In fact, an=
y academic or scholarly pursuit of subjects related
to Spirituality, Enligh=
tenment or Realization is softly discouraged. The
initiations are based on =
the ancient and eternal kriya yOga traditions
originally taught by the Adi =
yOgi, Shiva himself and subsequently
revealed to many yOgis viz. Agastya, K=
rishna, Patanjali and now Sadhguru
himself. The basic initiation is either =
a) shAmbhavi mahA mudra (Inner
Engineering Program <http://www.ishafoundati=
on.org/InnerEngineering> )
or b) shakti chalana kriya & shoonya meditation =
(Wholeness Program
<http://www.ishafoundation.org/Wholeness>  ). There are =
no preset
conditions or goals for initiations and subsequent sAdhana
<http:=
//archives.chennaionline.com/health/yoga/2006/12yoga118.asp> . The
idea is =
to stick to the kriyas and emphasis laid on observing one's own
experiences=
 and Inner Transformation
<http://www.ishafoundation.org/InnerTransformatio=
n>  . As mentioned in
the website, shoonya  <http://www.ishafoundation.org/=
ShoonyaMeditations>
is an initiation into the pragna
<http://www.ishafounda=
tion.org/Isha-Yoga-Programs/Samyama-Dual-Path-to-D\
ivinity.isa>   (awarene=
ss) path of yOga
<http://www.ishafoundation.org/Inner-Transformation/What-i=
s-Yoga.isa> .
Hope that helps and if you have any more questions do email m=
e.

Regards,
-Prasad
