SARVAM GYANANANDAMAYAM
AUM GURUBYO NAMAH

Dear Shri Narasimha,

Namaste.=C2=
=A0 May i write a few lines?

Most of the times the following enlisted acti=
vities viz., walking or talking or 

driving or typing or reading or writin=
g or answering nature's calls, take place in a semi-conscious state/mechani=
cally.

Utterance of the Nama/name of the Lord should take place in a fully=
 conscious state.=C2=A0 In other words highest value should be given to the=
 utterance of the 'nama' as both the 'nama' and the lord are one and the sa=
me/inseparable. The person is not indeed aware about the other activities e=
nlisted above when he is in the 'nama-yamuna'!!/nama-vrindavana!!/nama-saga=
ra!!.

The goal therefore should be to transcend from the state of mechanic=
alness to that of consciousness.

HARE KRSNA HARE KRSNA KRSNA KRSNA HARE HA=
RE
HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE

Best wishes.

May Mother Bless.=


Astrologically & spiritually yours,
p.s.ramanarayanan.

            Namaste Sir,



Do I know you from before?



If you =
do not mind, can I have your birthdata (date, time and place of 

birth)? Y=
ou can send it privately to pvr@charter. net.



If your goal is reaching V=
aikuntha loka and serving the Lord, just chant His 

name all the time when=
 you are awake. Whether you are walking or talking or 

driving or typing o=
r reading or writing or answering nature's calls, you can 

still silently =
chant His name in the mind.



If you do this enough, your mind will start =
chanting his name when it is 

asleep too!



Your goal should be to repeat=
 a (any) name of the Lord all the time, so that 

taking that name becomes =
the second nature to your mind!



Other things are not as useful as gettin=
g addicted to a name of the Lord.



Best regards,

Narasimha
