Namaste Friends,

S=
ome ramblings ...

Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar=
 to it), it
happens with all beginners and its only practice which makes on=
e
perfect. Most of us assume that this is only applicable in mundane
matter=
s. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I know
there are peo=
ple who think that any affair/process related to God must
be done perfectly=
. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is
impossible and only repeated=
 and sincere attempts makes one an adept.

Reminds me of the great Kalidasa=
 who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for
nine lives and he was born a dunce in =
his tenth and she appeared to
him in his 10th lifetime, when his sadhana wa=
s complete and he banged
his head out of sheer frustration. Imagine!!! In K=
aliyuga, along with
Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best pat=
h for most. 

Let me share one incident, when Narasimha's spiritual Guru wh=
om I also
consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Cha=
ndi
Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!
When=
 I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then
occured =
to me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on
the net and I=
 found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took
it up and performe=
d it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then
reminded me of the book he gi=
fted me, but even in that it was entirely
in Samskrit and illiterate that I=
 am, I couldn't distinguish between
an instruction and sloka :). Around thi=
s time, Narasimha occasionally
performed a longer version of the homam and =
I particpated in it, but
never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to gu=
ide me, which he
did, but still it did not get through my really dense brai=
ns :). I
felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up=
,
instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really
intend=
s that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the
way. In around=
 two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided
to document the Lagh=
u (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt
believe my luck and thanked =
the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his
grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yr=
s and I am still at it taking
baby-steps and making progress everyday.

I t=
hank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for helping
me progr=
ess.

My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We
a=
re humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very
first=
 time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.
Its all a co=
ntinuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...
plenty of time. Th=
ese things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen
overnight. No matter wh=
at, complete your homa everyday, that should be
the primary goal ... nothin=
g else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you
get or dont get anything. Slowl=
y we'll progress in our Sadhana and
move on to higher things. I wish all th=
e best. We should really thank
our stars that people like Manishji and Nara=
simhaji are here guiding
us ... what would be life without them!

Thanks fo=
r listening.
Regards
-Narayan-

iterate that I am, I couldn't distinguish between<BR>an instruction and slo=
ka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally<BR>performed a longer versi=
on of the homam and I particpated in it, but<BR>never could grasp it. I the=
n asked Narasimha to guide me, which he<BR>did, but still it did not get th=
rough my really dense brains :). I<BR>felt really helpless, but the stars w=
ere such that I never gave
 up,<BR>instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord =
Ganesha, that If he really<BR>intends that I perform the homa, then he shou=
ld kindly show me the<BR>way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me t=
hat he has decided<BR>to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I=
 just couldnt<BR>believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent=
 for his<BR>grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taki=
ng<BR>baby-steps and making progress everyday.<BR><BR>I thank Manishji, Nar=
asimha and the all the divine forces for helping<BR>me progress.<BR><BR>My =
request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We<BR>are hum=
ans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very<BR>first ti=
me, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.<BR>Its all a co=
ntinuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...<BR>plenty of time.=
 These things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen<BR>overnight. No mat=
ter what, complete
 your homa everyday, that should be<BR>the primary goal =
... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you<BR>get or dont get an=
ything. Slowly we'll progress in our Sadhana and<BR>move on to higher thing=
s. I wish all the best. We should really thank<BR>our stars that people lik=
e Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding<BR>us ... what would be life wi=
thout them!<BR><BR>Thanks for listening.<BR>Regards<BR>-Narayan-<BR><BR>---=
