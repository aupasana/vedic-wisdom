Namaste,

Obviously, there are some previous samskaras that pulled you in this 
direction. That is good. This is what Vimalananda alluded to, when he said 
those who have the desire have no knowledge and those who have the knowledge 
have no desire in this age. He also said, "if you have a deep desire to 
learn something, nature will find a way to teach you that".

If you see the super-short method, you will see that it is very similar to 
yours. Just add the ahutis to Prajapati, Agni etc at the beginning and at 
the end. Before you call Bhairava, call Ganesha in fire and make 8 aahuties 
with a simple mantra ("Om Gam Ganapataye Namah" is fine). Then call Bhairava 
in fire. Make the offerings. After the ahutis to Agni, Vaayu etc, give 
Poornaahuti. Basically follow the super-short procedure. It is also ok to 
not do panchopachara pooja etc. You can be informal with someone you know 
reasonably well.

Of course, you can continue the way you were doing also, but the additions I 
am suggeting (ahutis at start/end and Ganesha) are small and worthwhile. As 
(if) you make additions, do it with a positive frame of mind and do NOT 
worry about past. There is a reason for everything. Just leave the past and 
don't worry that you did some "mistake". It is never a mistake to worship 
god in the way you know. God is always happy if you do the best job you can, 
with what you know. But, as god gives you more knowledge, he may raise the 
bar for you. :-)

For invoking Ganapathi or Bhairava in fire, thinking of the form in the mind 
and requesting him mentally to come into the fire is sufficient.

Best regards,
Narasimha

> Dear Narasimhaji

>
> The basic procedure I followed was drawing the yantra of the deity in

> Mother to forgive all mistakes. And next I would straight away start
> off with the main mantra and its ahuti in fire. That used to me the
> major part of the homa. And I loved watching the peculiar behaviour of
