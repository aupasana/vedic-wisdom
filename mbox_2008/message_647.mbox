Resp=C2=A0Ashwini ji,
Namaskar.
As Narasimha ji said earlier I believe that=
 the manner/shraddha /faith in chanting would confer more *blessings* apart=
 from the mantra itself. I have been drawn to certain mantras and I dont=C2=
=A0know why. They give me a feeling that I am familiart with them and=C2=A0=
am comfortable with them. Though I dont know much Sanskrit( apart from bein=
g able to read and basics) I can *feel* the flow even during the first reci=
ting.

Some have just *come* to me like wanting to worship a certain manife=
station and stumbling upon the means to do so and I always considered it as=
 being the *ajna* of=C2=A0The Mother. The worship during Navaratras was Dev=
i Kavacham, Durga Ashtottaram and Devi Khadgamala which I did each day apar=
t from Lalita Shasranamam etc. As I always associated mantras and worship w=
ith music I do it musically, a real boon for me as it gives me the ananda t=
hat is beyond words.
During the Navaratras in 2006, I chanted the Hanumathv=
adabanala stotram and Nrusimha Kavacham(prahlada's stuti)=C2=A0at sunset. T=
hat was when I was very ill with a debilitating lung condition. 

If I am a=
live today it is=C2=A0=C2=A0Her Will, as I always believe, Mother=C2=A0Thy =
Will be done.=C2=A0
I am attaching the two stotras please do have a look, t=
he others are easy to find on the net and Devi kavacham is on Narasimha ji'=
s site as part of Saptashati

But I truly believe that you are most fortuna=
te and blessed to have experienced Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's *miracles*=
.=C2=A0

With kind regards,

Nalini

Dear Narasimha ji,
Namaskar.
I am happy t=

Thank you for your guidance,
one other =
thing I wished to ask you and would you please answer if time permits?
One =
of my friends accidently touched the chair I was sitting in and felt a jolt=
 of charge a few days back but I did not attribute it to myself. A couple o=
f days back she casually touched me on the shoulder and immediately retract=
ed it saying it was like touching a live wire. Is it also due to the experi=
encing of the mantra? 

Sorry to have asked you to interpret personal exper=
iences but I am clueless and highly appreciative of the enormous *knowledge=
* of practise of spirituality you have rather than mere mouthing of wis(e)d=
om we get to see these days,

Regards
Nalini=C2=A0

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Nalini ji,
=
=C2=A0
Most people do not experience a mantra. They just mechanically chant=
 it and nothing happens. What you described tells me that you were able to =
experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign.
=C2=A0
Though I h=
ave never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, I would imagine tha=
t this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.
=C2=A0
Different mantras, =
when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle channel of energy =
flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of a different "experi=
ence" to "self". Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe) are extremely coo=
ling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some mantras (e.g. Savitri=
 Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.
=C2=A0
When merely some vaa=
yu (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some experience. When the=
 entire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters a nadi, it is a ver=
y powerful experience and one's perception of self alters drastically.
=C2=
=A0
There are thousands of nadis in the body and thousands of possible expe=
riences. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experience. Mystical experi=
ences are signs of spiritual progress, but they are also traps where we can=
 get stuck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much about the experie=
nce. In a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive various objects of=
 the external world. We know that all that is just superficial and the real=
ity within all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to senses. Similarly=
, whatever our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. vision of a being, sou=
nd of a mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one etc) in an intense =
meditation session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less superficial tha=
n the objects we see in the external world usually) and the reality within =
those experiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when you transcend the=
 superficial sense experiences.
=C2=A0
While it is difficult, the right thi=
ng to do when you feel like you described is to ignore it and keep the inte=
nse mental focus on the mantra or on the deity. The good thing is that your=
 experience is a sign of spiritual progress and the bad thing is that it ca=
n distract you from the final goal.
=C2=A0
Feeling hot while and *after* me=
ditation and fighting are signs of some diturbation in the pingala nadi. Wh=
en the corresponding karmas are flushed out of the system, things may be fi=
ne.
=C2=A0
I am not really knowledgeable. With my guru's blessings, I have =
experienced some things and realized some things. Then he told me to not ho=
ld back and boldly declare answers to questions on spirituality and religio=
n as if I just know. I just follow his word and do as he said. It is upto m=
y guru and the Mother to impregnate my words with meaning as they are recei=
ved by people. From my end, I just type out whatever comes to my mind...

Narasimha

Dear Nalini
=C2=A0
Sorry for interrupting in your question to Narasimha=
.Your mail reminded me of a similar incident.=C2=A0I have a friend who does=
 very severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. It was a strange=
 dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on her lap and when=
 she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the reply came in sanskrit. Now=
 my friend does not know or even understand Sanskrit, so she could not unde=
rstand what the girl was saying. Then after some time the girl in the dream=
 kept repeating what sounded like a mantra in her ears.
=C2=A0
>From next da=
y morning my friend started chanting that mantra, after about one and half =
years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for chanting and had experinc=
es similar to the kind u described. She felt her whole body was internally =
burning, though there was no fever. Her relation with her mom started getti=
ng bitter with constant fights etc..

Later after some days it reduced agai=
n. I think this maybe a way the karmas are cut off from you. I am not sure =
of course, Narasimha can tell you better. He much more knowledgeable in=C2=
=A0 these things.

Dear All,
Namaskar.
=C2=A0=

Yes, indeed.
I=C2=A0had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasimha garu. I rec=
ited Sree Hanumathbadabanala stotram some time back. I had an unusual exper=
ience of 'being on fire',=C2=A0during the initial stages. It was as if I wa=
s engulfed in a ball of fire, which slowly receded over time. I had a simil=
ar experience during the Navaratri puja when reciting
Devi kavacham. I stil=
l have that feeling of an=C2=A0aura of fire around me and feel extremely ho=
t and sweat=C2=A0even in the cold weather. This stays on for a time. I also=
 had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' that matter to me and=
 there is a steady deterioration, almost as if a=C2=A0heavy veil has been t=
orn asunder. 
I=C2=A0vaguely remember Narasimha ji telling us in some forum=
 that there might be some ramifications relating to karma that could manife=
st when/ after sadhana/worship.
Could you please clarify, Narasimha garu?

Guys,

I am glad everything is sorted=
 out. But, in general, let us be less 
defensive and instead focus on subje=
ct. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly what he meant. However, even if =
Ajit or someone actually said 
something negative about me, it is not a big=
 deal. One is who one is and 
words, good or bad, do not change that, for b=
etter or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

Ajit, you are certainly q=
ualified in commenting. I always knew that you have 
tremendous scholarship=
, great humility and sincerity. People far less 
qualified than you talk/wr=
ite so much in today's world. Please do write 
more.

The imagery thrown up=
 by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanu=
man is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
self-c=
ontrol.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hrishika + =
isha =3D 
lord of senses). He can be worshipped for control over senses.

M=
other Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be 
wor=
shipped for getting rid of desires.

Several things are possible. But, for =
most people in today's times, it is 
not going to be one magic bullet that =
does it, but a combination of various 
practices. Patience is needed.

Try =
to increase the understanding of what is permanent and what is 
transient.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>I am happy that something *positive* emerged!!!</DIV>
<D=

<DIV>one other thing I wished to ask =
you and would you please answer if time permits?</DIV>
<DIV>One of my frien=
ds accidently touched the chair I was sitting in and felt a jolt of charge =
a few days back but I did not attribute it to myself. A couple of days back=
 she casually touched me on the shoulder and immediately retracted it sayin=
g it was like touching a live wire. Is it also due to the experiencing of t=
he mantra? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Sorry to have asked you to interpr=
et personal experiences but I am clueless and highly appreciative of the en=
ormous *knowledge* of practise of spirituality you have rather than mere mo=
uthing of wis(e)dom we get to see these days,</DIV>

<DIV>Dear Nalini</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Sorry for interrupting in your questio=
n to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar incident. I have a f=
riend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. It=
 was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on he=
r lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the reply came in=
 sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understand Sanskrit, so she =
could not understand what the girl was saying. Then after some time the gir=
l in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantra in her ears.</DIV>=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>From next day mo=
rning my friend started chanting that mantra, after about one and half year=
s of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for chanting and had experinces s=
imilar to the kind u described. She felt her whole body was internally burn=
ing, though there was no fever. Her relation with her mom started getting b=
itter with constant fights etc..</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Later after s=
ome days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way the karmas are cut off =
from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell you better. He much m=
ore knowledgeable in  these things.</DIV>

so had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' that matter to me a=

<DIV>I vaguely remember Narasimha ji telling us =
