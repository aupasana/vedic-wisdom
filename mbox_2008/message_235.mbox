Dear Narasimha rao garu

Many pranams , found the group searching for other=
 messages on the 
vedic astrology groups .At the very beginning let me than=
k you for 
the great work you are doing both with the mp3 classes on astrol=
ogy 
and with the ganapathi homam making it easily accessible to the 
spiri=
tually minded.

My questions might seem very rudimentary , hopefully none o=
f the 
learned members take offense if any mistakes are committed.



1. In=
 the Shrividya worship of the goddess , We even find 
Dhumavathi , Bhagalam=
ukhi and Smashantaara...I have read previous 
explanations of Sanjay ji and=
 other SJC gurus giving one form of 
interpretation of Smashaan tara as Bha=
va Taarini(one who takes us 
across the ocean of the world ) ...

Yet the f=
orm of the goddess itself is awe and fear inspiring....but 
to sever the mo=
re grosser afflictions like lust and 
anger ...probably feel the great kind=
 mother has taken various 
forms...


The question I have specifically is t=
his..just like a child who 
plays with fire...If a devotee chooses the ugra=
 roopa of the goddes 
but still prays with a sincere heart...will he still =
be punished by 
a misprounciation of the mantras.



2.My second question i=
s related to the first one....Right from the 
Pancharatra school of worship=
 system followed in major temples in 
India ...Which is one the factor that=
 gives strength to Prayer..

Is it emotion that gives strength and directio=
n to prayer...or is it 
the proper prounciation ,gotra pravara information =
and the strict 
rules...


If a devotee is very sincere but does not know t=
he proper rules , by 
taking part in a puja method involving bija mantras w=
ill he still 
get the benefit.



3.The third question is with respect to V=
imalananda and the Aghora 
books ....I agree with you they have been writte=
n by a rishi , but 
one doubt keeps on nagging my mind.

Dr Robert Svoboda =
who is also on the academic list of the American 
Ayurvedic Institute in Ne=
w Mexico serving along with Dr Vasant lad 
who is a respected name in Ayurv=
eda in America styled this books on 
the style of carlos castaneda , castan=
eda's books are very popular , 
take a similar cryptic style of teaching wh=
ere is suddenly abducted 
by a mexican shaman...Svoboda even refers to this=
 fact in the 
preface where he does not explicity say it is true or false :=
) he 
leaves it to the readers.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Castan=
eda


Coming back to my questions...Most of the theory in the books seems 
=
very well grounded....

But many examples do not seem to tally .....

1.In =
the book on karma he gives the example of a snake eaten by a 
thousand ants=
 which are again reborn as a fisherman at whose hands 
those thousand ants =
now reborn as fish die...

:) But animals do not accumulate karma since the=
y are only following 
their nature ......


2.He gives the example of Akbar=
 (have followed the previous messages)

Akbar might have been a huge depart=
ure from his bloodthirsty 
ancestors.

1.So was Hemu the hindu king who fou=
ght valiantly...it was only a 
stroke of luck that delivered the throne to =
Akbar.Some of the more 
balanced historians have written of the battle (R C=
 Majumdar for 
example in his book History of the mughals) 

2.Akbar for al=
l his magnanimity never got one of his daughters 
married in reverse to the=
 rajputs.


3.Jiziyah was still not lifted in akbar's regime ...only the pi=
lgrim 
tax was abolished.


4.Rana Pratap the bravest of the brave fought a=
kbar all his 
life...he fought for the people of mewar not for his personal=
 pride.

:) Akabar could not defeat Rana pratap even after 30 yrs...

Now i=
n my eyes Rana Pratap was a true king ...much more kind , much 
more brave =
.




Still Vimalananda praises him in the book....The book no doubt has 
m=
any gems but still attempts a very simiplistic explanation of 
karma .

I c=
an understand from a pure point of historical interest , the nath 
panthis =
were always outside society , in the 1500,1600 ,1700 era 
they mixed freely=
 with the sufis so can understand the influence and 
acceptance .....


I m=
ight differ strongly on the historical questions which anyhow 
would not be=
 relevant to this group ,a lot of proof can be furnished 
on rana pratap an=
d his battles with akbar but that would be an 
altogether different topic ,=
 my primary focus was maybe the books 
have to be taken with a pinch of sal=
t...





But the rest would be more than willing to learn from the group .=





Regards
Vivek
