Dear Narsimhaji,

I would like to know about Gayatri Mantra in your words.=
 I had very good
experiences in my young age when I was doing Gayatri Japam=
. The very
important result of this Mantra was, I was able to know certain =
events
well in advance that time. I had told one of my friends that he will=
 be
transferred in next month to so and so place and he was transferred.
Th=
is is just one example. I was able to predict very correctly. Peace in
my l=
ife with good growth of income I experienced. Much has been said for
Gayatr=
i Mantra but I have not read anything about this Mantra in this
Forum hence=
 this mail posted.

One great saint had said in his lectures that everybody=
 should recite at
least 11 Malas (108 x 11) along with his routine worship
=

Your write up and experiences if any will inspire us all.

Dr. Ashwin Rawa=
l
