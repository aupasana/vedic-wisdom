Dear Karthi
The books that I have  mentioned are as follows:

Shri Gurudev =
ki sannidhi me
By Kumari Kumudini Paramanand Panjwani

She has covered in t=
he books from 1950 to 1973 over the six volumes
In volume 1 he himself indi=
cates the lineage. 
I have read vol 1 to vol 6, it appears they started pub=
lishing in 
1980s.

In Vol 3 on page 239 he discusses about Lahiri Mahashay=
a.
He also indicated there that all the story described in Paramhans 
Yogan=
anda's book about the surrondings at the time of Lahiri 
Mahashaya's initia=
tion are not true. He also has indicated that he 
never physically met Yoga=
nanda, always they met in Samadhi state.

These are very good books with lo=
ts of knowledge and practical things 
with good scientific explanation of m=
any aspects of vedas, yoga, etc.


One can get this books at following plac=
es

1) Shri Sadguru Sadan Trust Ashram
   Kuvadvaa Road Rajkot, Gujarat, In=
dia 360003
2) Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust
   Mafatlal house
   Back bay r=
eclamation
   Bombay 400020
3) Shri Ramdham Trust
   Phuskar, Rajasthan
4) =
Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust
   Janki Kund
   Chitrakut, UP, India 210204 =


Over and above this there are other books too like "Sudha 
Sarita", "Mana=
v Drasti" etc.

Hope this clarifies your query

Best Regards
Mitesh
