Dear Karthi
The books that I have mentioned are as =
follows:

Shri Gurudev ki sannidhi me
By Kumari Kumudini Paramanand Panjwan=
i

She has covered in the books from 1950 to 1973 over the six volumes
In v=
olume 1 he himself indicates the lineage. 
I have read vol 1 to vol 6, it a=
ppears they started publishing in 
1980s.

In Vol 3 on page 239 he discusse=
s about Lahiri Mahashaya.
He also indicated there that all the story descri=
bed in Paramhans 
Yogananda's book about the surrondings at the time of Lah=
iri 
Mahashaya's initiation are not true. He also has indicated that he 
ne=
ver physically met Yogananda, always they met in Samadhi state.

These are =
very good books with lots of knowledge and practical things 
with good scie=
ntific explanation of many aspects of vedas, yoga, etc.

One can get this b=
ooks at following places

1) Shri Sadguru Sadan Trust Ashram
Kuvadvaa Road =
Rajkot, Gujarat, India 360003
2) Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust
Mafatlal hou=
se
Back bay reclamation
Bombay 400020
3) Shri Ramdham Trust
Phuskar, Rajast=
han
4) Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust
Janki Kund
Chitrakut, UP, India 210204=
 

Over and above this there are other books too like "Sudha 
Sarita", "Man=
av Drasti" etc.

Hope this clarifies your query

Best Regards
Mitesh
