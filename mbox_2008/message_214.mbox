Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for your enlightening and inspiring posts. 

Could you please clarify when we are supposed to celebrate MahaShivratri this year in America. I looked up in JHora and thought it was Wednesday, March 5. Chaturdashi starts around 3 pm EST on March 5 and ends on Thursday, March 6 around 2 pm EST. I assumed that you would fast and pray the night of March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire night...

Thanks once again,
Chandraprakash
