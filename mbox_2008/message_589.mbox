Dear Narayan
=C2=A0
THANK YOU so much for your words and advice. Yes the sa=
nkalpa is takne before I start so you are so correct. Actually today while =
doing homa this kind of a situation happened with me, and for a moment I wa=
s in a dilema about what to do but then I rekindlied the fire. Mentally i w=
as feeling confused because at that point I did not know what is the right =
course of action. So I thought of asking in this forum to Narasimhaji. Than=
k you once again for explaining. Jai Vatuk Bhairav.

Namaste Rajarshi,

When faced with any such =
situation ... important point ... never
nerver abandon your Homa!! You actu=
ally have taken a samkalpam
(vow/resolution) that you will do the homa (hom=
akarma karishye) ... so
never ever abandon it!!

Secondly, these things hap=
pen early on in our attempts. As one gains
experience, it becomes easy to m=
aintain the fire. In such situations
as you mentioned, I keep camphor handy=
. Usually, powedering the
camphor and sprinkling will rejuvenate the fire d=
ue to the embers,
else, light the camphor capsule using the deepa and offer=
 it in the
homa kundam.

Problem Solved ... move ahead with your Homa and c=
omplete it.

Regards
-Narayan-
