Namaste Dinesh,

Your skepticism is justified.

The duality is infinite and impossible t=
o master. Even great jnaanis are 
occasionally deluded by Her power. One ca=
n understand unmanifested non-dual 
Brahman, but one cannot hope to underst=
and the dual world fully ever. She is 
capable of deluding even the greates=
t sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as 
one ventures into duality. She can =
mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She 
does and why She does that is so =
difficult to fathom. The only way to deal 
with Her is to surrender to Her =
power *fully*.

> on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity

BTW, tho=
ugh we are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. 
In the =
non-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
have=
 differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what 
an=
d how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is 
b=
orn with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world.=
 
When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of =

things in the dual world that are impossible for others.

Realizing the no=
n-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but 
there are limits=
 imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based 
on the force o=
f previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one 
(non-dual) level an=
d all are different at another (dual) level.

But it is tough to know for s=
ure what one's caliber is. Thus, your basic 
point holds. But I just wanted=
 to point that all are not indeed the same. We 
should be disinterested in =
knowing who is what, not because all are the 
same, but because we have no =
surefire way to know who is what.

Best regards,
Narasimha
