Namaste friends,
 
As some of you know, a Mahaganapathi homam manual was ma=
de available about 2 years back and several people are performing Mahaganap=
athi homam on a daily or weekly or monthly basis using it. Recently, we mad=
e a Chandi homam manual available.
 
When my spiritual master Dr Manish Pan=
dit and I were at Mayapur, India in May 2008, we were mesmerized by the spi=
ritual vibrations there due to the continuous chanting of mahamantra. We re=
ceived an inspiration then to create a Sri Krishna Homam manual for Krishna=
 devotees.
 
I announce today on Sraavana Sukla Ekadasi that a "Sri Krishna=
 Homam" manual is available to interested people, in time for the coming Kr=
ishnashtami. This 45-minute procedure was derived based on the traditional =
Bhagavad Gita homam. Its pradhaana (main) homam can be performed with sever=
al mantras, including mahamantra. A few possibilities are suggested in the =
manual. For those who are not comfortable with Sanskrit and/or have time co=
nstraints, a super-short 10-15 minute procedure is also given.
 
All the ma=
ntras needed are given and detailed explanations are given. The document is=
 appropriate for total novices also. This manual is a self-sufficient docum=
ent. Quotes from Bhagavad Gita are given in the manual for explaining the i=
mportance of fire sacrifice (yajnam or homam).
 
Please download the manual=
 from
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/krishna.htm
 
Please feel free=
 to spread the word among the devotees of Lord Krishna, who may be interest=
ed in performing a fire sacrifice for Lord Krishna on a regular basis. We s=
incerely hope that this small offering from us at the lotus feet of Lord wi=
ll benefit some people somewhere sometime.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
