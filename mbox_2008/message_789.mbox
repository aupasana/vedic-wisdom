Utpalji,
You have rightly said that we are really lucky that we have got su=
ch a great person who guides us like a God. We always get one kind of solac=
e and inspiration. The way of His explanation is indeed GREAT.

Nalini Bahen, Rajarshi & ot=
her members,

I normally don't praise Narasimha much because esle i have to=
 write 
words of praise always. Each & every message of his is outstanding =

which clears one or other doubt of us.

I actually *love* him that is how =
i would summerise my feelings.

following are very emotional words extracte=
d from one of the recent 
messages of Shri Narayan, which aptly tells how i=
 and am sure many 
others would be feeling for him

"We should really thank=

our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding
us ..=
. what would be life without them!"

I am in Love with this beloved bagger =
!!!

Emotional Regards,

Utpal

R>> Normally, one beggar may view another beggar as a
 competitor and <B=
R>not like <BR>> too many people to beg in the same area. However, this =
begging is <BR>different <BR>> and there is no competition between diffe=
rent beggars. The owner <BR>of the <BR>> house has enough to give to eve=
ry beggar and does not mind giving <BR>to many <BR>> beggars at the same=
 time if they are worthy.<BR>> <BR>> Actually, if one beggar gets som=
ething, it will be so much that <BR>he/she can <BR>> share some of it wi=
th all around him/her. If you go with 100 other <BR>beggars <BR>> and be=
g, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt <BR>the heart of =
<BR>> the owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it to <B=
R>varying <BR>> degrees!<BR>> <BR>> When I tell people about exter=
nal practices such as homam and <BR>internal <BR>> practices such as sur=
render and detachment in actions, all I am <BR>really doing <BR>> is to =
take fellow beggars in front of a house where a
 rich person <BR>lives. If =
<BR>> they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their <=
BR>begging <BR>> will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.<=
BR>> <BR>> I am only a beggar who can show a place where other beggar=
s can <BR>beg and I am <BR>> not really "capable" of anything more. Plea=
se do not treat me in <BR>any other <BR>> way.<BR>> <BR>> When Swa=
mi Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna <BR>Paramahamsa, and <BR>&=

 <BR>There is <BR>> no need to panic or give up hope.<BR>> <BR>> *=
 * *<BR>> <BR>> Be patient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints=

haitanya Mahaprabhu, <BR>> Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, =
Sai Baba, Kabir, <BR>Jesus Christ, <BR>> Buddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar et=
c. Try to understand what they are <BR>saying. <BR>> Try to integrate so=
me of it into your common sense, your way of <BR>thinking and <BR>> your=
 life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is <BR>inner <BR>=

pired <BR>> writings.<BR>> <BR>> Nobody can change you. You yourse=
lf can do it. You CAN do it, if <BR>you really <BR>> want to. Introspect=
 and go to the root of your problems. If you <BR>introspect <BR>> and an=
alyze each big problem, you will
 realize that ego is the <BR>root of it <B=
R>> all. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, <BR>q=
uestion why. <BR>> I am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do.=
 But, atleast <BR>analyze <BR>> why it is important and try to understan=

>the inner <BR>> transformation. It is a very useful spiritual practice.=
 I know <BR>people who <BR>> made (and are making) considerable spiritua=
l progress through <BR>regular <BR>> practice of homam. It is the most p=
owerful method I know of and <BR>teaching it <BR>> is one of my tasks fo=
r this life.<BR>> <BR>> Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your da=
ily schedule and <BR>start doing <BR>> Mahaganapathi homam everyday. Aft=
er a few months, you should <BR>switch to <BR>> Vishnu sahasra naama hom=
am (I will put it up on my website by <BR>then). THAT <BR>> should help =
you find your way in your spiritual life and strike <BR>the right <BR>> =
balance between spiritual life and material life.<BR>> <BR>> The purp=
ose of material life on this earth is to perform actions <BR>to pay back <B=
R>> debts without
 incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress <BR>b=
ecomes <BR>> smoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cann=
ot <BR>become smooth. <BR>> However, without some spiritual progress, ac=
tions in material life <BR>create <BR>> new debts. In the beginning, one=
 needs to create a synergy between <BR>the two <BR>> and use the actions=
 in material life to promote spiritual life. <BR>For true <BR>> spiritua=
l progress, most people cannot and should not run away <BR>from material <B=
R>> life.<BR>> <BR>> Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga =
Vaasishtham that <BR>action and <BR>> knowledge are two wings with which=
 the bird of manifested Self <BR>flies and <BR>> becomes liberated. Acti=
on without correct knowledge creates pride, <BR>promote <BR>> ego and bi=
nds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without <BR>action <BR>>=
; does not become complete because of the remaining debts and one is <BR>st=
uck. <BR>>
 One needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to bec=
ome <BR>free.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> ----=
