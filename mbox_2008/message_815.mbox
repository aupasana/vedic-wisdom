Dear Dr. Rawal,


Today itself, i saw in AAJ TAK channel, that they discovered some proof 
of King Acheekak, who was killed by Bhima, though i was not seen the 
complete commentary, but it was enough convincing.

I hope you know this character in the Mahabharat. Their is not a single 
fictitious character in Mahabharat.

One of my close has old scripture which completely described about the 
aeroplane and its making.
It has many chapters in Sanskrit stanzas devoted to it. He is looking 
for the translation. This Granth is written by Rishi Bhardwaj.

We have certainly lost huge knowledge in last 1500 yrs.

Best Wishes,
Vijay Goel
Jaipur.
