Namaste,

If 3067 BCE is now reasonably confirmed with Planetorium Software=
,

then Two popular beliefs are immediately shattered:

1) Shri Krishna's b=
irth date as 19.july.3228 BC
2) His Departure in 3102 BC

Some other 'compl=
etely false' & poisonous doctrain injected in mind 
of our people & world a=
t large such as
- Aryan were foreigners & invaded India 
- Aryan/Dravid cla=
shes

i am actually excited with these topic. till now i really didn't 
loo=
k for findings in this matter and really missed article of Shri 
Narhari ti=
ll now.

....

Shri Goel's information about discovery of proofs of Achheka=
k's 
existence, among other already available proofs such as Vrindawan, 
Dw=
araka etc.. gives me a good material to form a logical opinion 
about MB's =
Historical reality.

I am also looking for informations from project of Nar=
asimha & 
Manish bhai.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
