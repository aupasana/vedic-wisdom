Namaste,

Choosing the right deity for sadhana is important. If you d=
o not know the 
right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better t=
han waiting. Pick 
whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.

Ple=
ase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from 
sadhana=
 for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, 
sadhan=
a performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, 
sometimes it=
 may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas 
before some=
 good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a 
basket. =
Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you to do 
serious =
sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of 
the pil=
e. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits 
of t=
hose auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and 
retrieving =
those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill over 
and give th=
eir fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had 
to be expe=
rienced sometime or the other, anyway!

A serious sadhaka should never be d=
isheartened by a few seemingly 
undesirable results after starting a spirit=
ual sadhana. Just keep going.

One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaa=
li from a very good 
priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra =
for a few days, he was 
laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He=
 continued his sadhana 
and used the break to go on an extended trip to Ind=
ia and make a pilgrimage 
to some nice places. He participated in the Shata=
 Chandi homam we conducted 
at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2=
006. He met my guru and got 
the opportunity to be his room mate for a week=
 when we stayed at the house 
of a priest during the homam. He could observ=
e and interact with my guru 
very closely. Most importantly, when my guru h=
ad a vision of the Mother on 
2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him=
 to start the work on spreading 
homam in the world, this gentleman was pre=
sent there. Though he could not 
see the Mother, he actually smelled someth=
ing out of the world and was 
baffled. He knew something was going on, but =
did not know what. The temple 
was closed at the time and my guru and this =
gentlemen were the only people 
on the premises when the Mother appeared. E=
ven though he could not see the 
Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be=
 present there at *that* crucial 
moment. That is enough to mould the rest =
of his life.

You never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on =
you. 
Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god.=
 Just 
surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs 
f=
ine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that 
hap=
pen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
som=
e debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really 
ausp=
icious karmas.

As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and sabur=
i". Have devotion 
and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<BR><BR>One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good <BR=
>priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he w=
as <BR>laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sa=
dhana <BR>and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a =
pilgrimage <BR>to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi hom=
am we conducted <BR>at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He =
met my guru and got <BR>the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when=
 we stayed at the house <BR>of a priest during the homam. He could observe =
and interact with my guru <BR>very closely.
 Most importantly, when my guru=
 had a vision of the Mother on <BR>2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She tol=
d him to start the work on spreading <BR>homam in the world, this gentleman=
 was present there. Though he could not <BR>see the Mother, he actually sme=
lled something out of the world and was <BR>baffled. He knew something was =
going on, but did not know what. The temple <BR>was closed at the time and =
my guru and this gentlemen were the only people <BR>on the premises when th=
e Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the <BR>Mother, it was most=
 fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial <BR>moment. That is=
 enough to mould the rest of his life.<BR><BR>You never know how, when and =
where the grace of god falls on you. <BR>Calculations and logic are useless=
 when it comes to the grace of god. Just <BR>surrender and keep doing whate=
ver sadhana you picked. If it needs <BR>fine-tuning, somebody will appear t=
o tell you that. Any bad things that
 <BR>happen when doing a spiritual sad=
hana should be viewed as nature settling <BR>some debts so that you are pre=
pared to receive the fruits of some really <BR>auspicious karmas.<BR><BR>As=
 Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have devotion =
<BR>and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.<BR><BR>Best r=

--- --------- - <BR><BR>----- Original Message ----- <BR>> Namaste Sir<B=
R>> what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous<BR>> but i =
have some small doubts<BR>><BR>> Leaving astrology aside and those wh=
o do not have a guru<BR>> how can they chooose a particular form of GOD<=
BR>> bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity=
<BR>> is very important, as the analogy he gave of a person<BR>> who =
is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed<BR>><BR>> One=
 thing more<BR>> we have so many deities that on
 diwali i would like to=
 worship<BR>> Lakshmi and Kali<BR>> in navaratri (nowadays) we would =
worship Durga<BR>> on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA<BR>> an o=
n MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA<BR>> like this<BR>> with hte change in fes=
tival the deity changes<BR>><BR>> though everybody knows GOD is ONE b=
ut it becomes difficult to get<BR>> out of this<BR>> mould and if i d=
idnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become<BR>> angry<BR>><B=
R>> I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind=
<BR>><BR>> One thing more<BR>><BR>> Suppose if i choose a deity=
 and something wrong happens<BR>> (materiallistically )<BR>><BR>> =
what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my<BR>> DEB=
TS/WRONG DEEDS<BR>> or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as =
I am not fit<BR>> for that DEITY<BR>><BR>> and sometimes you feel<=
BR>> o what am i doing does this really
 works<BR>><BR>> and one t=
hing more<BR>><BR>> what if we go on doing our pooja and someday<BR>&=
gt; something like what happened to Pt. GOPI KRISHNA JI<BR>> happens to =
us also<BR>> though he says in his book that he read a lot about yoga<BR=
>> and stuff like this<BR>><BR>> At any stage i do not want you pe=
ople to get offended<BR>> but these are my doubts which are there in my =
mind<BR>><BR>> i will not say much now bcoz in<BR>> Swami Sivanand=
a's KUNDALINI YOGA on the last page he says<BR>><BR>> "the shastras a=
re endless and there is so much to be known<BR>> turn the gaze. draw the=
 indriyas.still the mind.then<BR>> dive deep into the divine source and =
realise the infinite bliss"<BR>><BR>> ************ ********* ********=
* ********* ********* ********* ********* ***<BR>> *<BR>> i ll give o=
ne small personal example here<BR>><BR>> around 26 or 27 dec.2007 i s=
tarted chanting 2 mantras (one kar
 mala<BR>> each)<BR>> in morning a=
nd evening<BR>> and on 9 january 2008 my parents met an accident<BR>>=
 though my father suffered small injuries my mother suffred fracture<BR>>=
; in shoulder and Leg<BR>><BR>> and she is still undergoing treatment=
 and will have to<BR>> undergo one more operation in this month<BR>><=
BR>> and in February and March i got placement in<BR>> 2 companies (i=
 m doing MCA in india) where most of my friends have<BR>> not<BR>> ev=
en got one and let me tell you i m not very intelligent<BR>><BR>> so =
sometimes even now i consider whether my choosen deity is correct<BR>> o=
r not<BR>><BR>> so everyday in the end of my pooja what i ask GOD is<=
BR>> to help me find the right path<BR>> ************ ********* *****=
