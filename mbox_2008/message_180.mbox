Hindu Temple Adds Resident Scholar, Spiritual Teacher

By BOB REEVES/Lincol=

Saturday, Jan 12, 2008 - 12:37:29 am CST

The Hindu Temple o=
f Nebraska recently announced the appointment of Dr.
Frank Morales (also kn=
own as Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya) as the
resident scholar and spiritual=
 teacher for the temple.

Dr. Morales will teach weekly classes for adults =
and youths at the
Hindu Temple, 13010 Arbor St., in Omaha. He also will lea=
d a satsang,
or discourse, on the Hindu religion on the third Thursday of e=
ach
month in Lincoln.

The Nebraska temple is the first in the nation to ha=
ve an acharya, or
resident scholar, which is common at temples in India, sa=
id Ram Bishu,
chairman of the temple's religious committee.

"The whole ide=
a is to make sure we educate the young people =97 and
adults =97 in all asp=
ects of spirituality," Bishu said.

Dr. Morales, a native of New York, bega=
n studying Hinduism at age 10
and converted to the Indian religion at age 1=
4. He spent many years in
intensive study of Hindu scriptures and teachings=
.

After living the life of a celibate Hindu monk for six years, he was
ini=
tiated as a Hindu priest in India in 1986.

In an interview in Lincoln, Dr.=
 Morales said he earned a bachelor's
degree in philosophy and theology from=
 Loyola University in Chicago
and master's and doctoral degrees in Hindu st=
udies from the University
of Wisconsin-Madison.

He is now a nationally rec=
ognized Hindu teacher whose Web site,
www.dharmacentral.com, is one of the =
largest and most popular Internet
sites relating to Hinduism.

Being a U.S.=
-born convert to Hinduism is really not that unusual, he said.

"There are =
1.5 million non-Indian Hindus in the United States," he
said. "I personally=
 call them the `hidden Hindus.'"

Hinduism is the traditional faith of Indi=
a but has spread throughout
the world, he said. It's the fastest-growing re=
ligion in eastern
Europe and has converts in many other parts of the world.=


The Nebraska temple serves about 1,000 families, 95 percent of which
are =
from India. The remaining 5 percent are converts, Dr. Morales said.

Attend=
ance at Dr. Morales' two adult classes on Saturdays has been
averaging 40 p=
ercent non-Indians, while the Sunday youth class is 100
percent Indian.

"Y=
ou can be a practicing Hindu and not be a member of a temple," he
said. "It=
's a very personal thing =97 what one believes and what one
practices."

He=
 is president-acharya of the International Santana Dharma Society.
Santana =
Dharma is the Sanskrit name for Hinduism.

Many westerners are attracted to=
 the religion because of experience
with yoga or through books or the Inter=
net, he said.

Most Americans don't know much about the history and philoso=
phy of
Hinduism, a well-developed belief system that is thousands of years
=
old, he said.

"Hinduism teaches tolerance and that to attain God and enlig=
htenment
is not simply a matter of accepting a dogma but something you have=
 to
work toward."

As a teacher, his goal is to help people along that path=
, he said.
"The idea of Hinduism is to encourage people but not chastise th=
em."

Before coming to Omaha last fall, Dr. Morales taught classes in
Hindu=
ism in Madison, Wis. He is one of fewer than 10 non-Indians who
are recogni=
zed scholars of the Hindu scriptures, Bishu said.

The Omaha temple, which =
was consecrated in 2003, has 12 separate
sanctums where people may show dev=
otions to deities from all regions
of India. Bishu said he knows of no othe=
r American temple that has
such a wide representation of regional forms of =
Hinduism. "It's a
fully integrated little Indian temple."

Dr. Morales head=
s a staff that includes two resident priests, Damodar
Bhattar and Vidya Sha=
nker, who lead worship at the temple.

Another priest may be added as Nebra=
ska's Hindu community continues to
grow, Bishu said.
