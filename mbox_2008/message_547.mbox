Namaste,
 
I will reply to your mail using a metaphor.
 
Suppose one is abo=
ut to sink in the ocean and gets hold of a boat with just one hand. Suppose=
 he just clings on to the boat with one hand as the fierce waves of the oce=
an keep pushing him in all directions.
 
Suppose a learned man comes and sa=
ys "this is not the way to ride a boat. My son, climb the boat, sit down ca=
lmly inside the boat and ride out the stormy waters of the ocean". Of cours=
e, the learned man is correct. That would definitely be a better way to rid=
e the boat!
 
But, if the waves keep pushing the hapless man and he is unab=
le to hold the boat with both hands and climb it, he should ensure that he =
is *atleast* hanging on to it with one hand. That will atleast stop him fro=
m sinking in the ocean! When the waves become less fierce and one gets an o=
pportunity, one may be able to climb inside the boat.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

AUM GURUBYO NAMAH

        Dear Shri Narasimha,

        Namaste.  May i wr=
ite a few lines?

        Most of the times the following enlisted activiti=
es viz., walking or talking or 
        driving or typing or reading or wri=
ting or answering nature's calls, take place in a semi-conscious state/mech=
anically.

        Utterance of the Nama/name of the Lord should take place=
 in a fully conscious state.  In other words highest value should be given =
to the utterance of the 'nama' as both the 'nama' and the lord are one and =
the same/inseparable. The person is not indeed aware about the other activi=
ties enlisted above when he is in the 'nama-yamuna'!!/nama-vrindavana!!/nam=
a-sagara!!.

        The goal therefore should be to transcend from the sta=
te of mechanicalness to that of consciousness.

        HARE KRSNA HARE KRS=
NA KRSNA KRSNA HARE HARE
        HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE

       Best wishes.

        May Mother Bless.

        Astrologically & sp=
iritually yours,
        p.s.ramanarayanan.

          Namaste Sir,

          Do I kno=
w you from before?

          If you do not mind, can I have your birthdata=
 (date, time and place of 
          birth)? You can send it privately to p=
vr@charter. net.

          If your goal is reaching Vaikuntha loka and ser=
ving the Lord, just chant His 
          name all the time when you are awa=
ke. Whether you are walking or talking or 
          driving or typing or r=
eading or writing or answering nature's calls, you can 
          still sil=
ently chant His name in the mind.

          If you do this enough, your mi=
nd will start chanting his name when it is 
          asleep too!

        =
  Your goal should be to repeat a (any) name of the Lord all the time, so t=
hat 
          taking that name becomes the second nature to your mind!

  =
        Other things are not as useful as getting addicted to a name of the=
 Lord.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha
