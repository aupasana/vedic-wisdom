Namaste Sir,

Sitting in pleasure world and earning money=
 is NOT synonymous to "enjoying all world pleasures". One may be sitting in=
 pleasure world, earning money and engaging externally in various activitie=
s, but the mind may be established in peace and bliss.
 
A realized person =
is NOT identified by the actions he/she engages in. Just as an electric fan=
 continues to turn for a few minutes even after the electricity is turned o=
ff, a realized person who is still in a body continues to engage in actions=
 based on the previous flow. After King Janaka realized Self, he continued =
as the king of Mithila and did all royal duties. After Krishna made Arjuna =
realize Self, Arjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, grandfath=
er etc.
 
One who has not yet realized Self will distinguish between variou=
s objects of this dual world and view some as good and some as bad. He/she =
will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the other hand, a real=
ized person sees all people, objects and actions of this universe as the sa=
me Self and sees no reason to either be attracted to or repelled from anyth=
ing. His/her actions and inactions are thus not based on the principles of =
attraction and repulsion. They are based on the previous flow.
 
Renouncing=
 wife, children, job, money etc is an attempt to find true mental renunciat=
ion. Renouncing external objects can promote mental renunciation, but not g=
uarantee it. On the other hand, one can remain in the midst of the material=
 world and all the external objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peacef=
ul and blissful mind that is not attracted to or repelled from any of the o=
bjects one is surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star like Rajinik=
anth, who makes millions of dollars per movie, surrounded by glamour, money=
 and adulation, may be more detached at the mental level than many yogis in=
 Himalayas. It is probably true in the case of Rajinikanth.
 
When one stay=
s away from objects that may attract one, it is relatively easy to overcome=
 attraction temporarily. Whether one can retain that renunciation when one =
comes in contact with the objects again or not is a questionmark. On the ot=
her hand, to be in contact with the objects that may attract one and yet ma=
intain mental detachment and mental renunciation is tougher. It is the true=
 test.
 
It is not out of place to mention a small story.
 
Trilinga Swami =
lived for about 300 years and did unbelievable austerities in Kashi. When R=
amakrishna Paramahamsa met him in Kashi, he remarked to his sishyas that Tr=
ilinga Swami was Shiva Himself and a fully realized being. Narendranath (Sw=
ami Vivekananda) was not with him on that pilgrimage and he made a point to=
 force Narendranath to go to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga Swam=
i!
 
Lahiri Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was the guru =
of Paramahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a householder and had a high=
-paying job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami spoke little, but he once =
spoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya's praise. He said, "The state of mind=
 I achieved by renouncing everything, Lahiri achieved it while being a hous=
eholder, being in the middle of everything. I bow to him."
 
*         *   =

> > in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to cert=
ify any
> > persons doings as good and spiritual.
 
Nobody can "certify" an=
ybody. However, those who know some astrology can give their views on chart=
s that are shared and discussed publicly. If some people see those views as=
 a "certificates", it is their perception.
 
*         *         *
 
Self-r=
ealization can be consistently defined. However, spirituality is tough to d=
efine. It will mean different things to different people.
 
The goal of all=
 spiritual journeys is to realize Self, at some time or the other. However,=
 most spiritual journeys of this age do NOT end in Self-realization.
 
It i=
s limited ego that binds one to a limited existence like a body and stops o=
ne from realizing the all-pervading true Self. While a self-realized person=
's ego is completely killed, it is possible to make partial progress. There=
 are many people, who overcome ego to various extents and realize to variou=
s degrees that body is temporary and it is not the true self. One can do so=
 by following many spiritual paths, like the path of knowledge, the path of=
 devotion, the path of pranayama, the path of hatha yoga, the path of work =
and service etc. One who overcomes ego to some extent, using any path, is m=
aking some spiritual progress. When the ego is completely subdued, one real=
izes the true Self. This realization is the same irrespective of the path f=
ollowed. However, intermediate steps look and feel different based on the p=
ath.
 
Enough of my 2 cents for tonight...
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
