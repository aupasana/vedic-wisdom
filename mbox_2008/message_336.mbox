          Folks,
I came across 2 wonderful living jnanis through the web. 

Please check the website below. Actually books were written in telugu. 
If you have time and you are in India, please don't miss these great 
jnanis. As I didn't go to India recently, I haven't yet met these great 
living yogis. Remember, Nowadays, it is very difficult to see a living 
jnani. So please don't miss the opportunity to visit them.

I read a story from dhuniwala dada's life in one of the books I 
couldn't recall. 
Once a old lady begger came to Dhuniwala's ashram. Then dada send her 
out with so much anger and hate. His pupil asked him why he was very 
angry on her. Then dada told them that she killed a saint in her past 
life. So she has to has 7 more lifes(incarnations) like that. Just 
because she visited the ashram, some of her sins were burnt, and 6 more 
lifes would be enough to burn her sins.

Visiting living saints is a great opportunity. They never care about 
anything in the earth and don't judge them by their appearance too.
