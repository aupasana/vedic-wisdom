Namaste,
=A0
People whose karmas are very intricately intertwined together =
can perform homam together in the same homa kundam. You and your=A0wife can=
 sit next to each other, both facing homa kundam on your east. Both can mak=
e offerings in the fire.
=A0
All procedures can be done by one of you or bo=
th of you. Sankalpam can be taken by both of you simultaneously but separat=
ely. Or you could take sankalpam with your wife touching your left shoulder=
 with her right hand while you take sankalpam. When mantras are offered in =
fire later, make sure that atleast one of you (or both) make offerings with=
 each mantra.
=A0
Your wife can sit on your left, next to you. If you consi=
der you and your wife together as one person, she is the left, i.e. lunar n=
adi (Ida), and you are the right, i.e. solar nadi (Pingala).
=A0
It is poss=
ible to do separately in two different homa kundams. It is also possible to=
 time share=A0the same homa kundam, i.e. do at different times in the same =
homa kundam. But it is perfectly acceptable for husband and wife to do toge=
ther at the same time in the same homa kundam.
=A0
Yes, as long as you do t=
his desiring only spiritual progress, you can consder me as guru. Though I =
am not really capable of dispelling anyone's darkness, I am willing to take=
 responsibility for teaching people how to walk in darkness. It is my belie=
f that one walking in the specific direction pointed by me=A0(performing ho=
mam for spiritual progress) will eventually=A0reach a room with some light.=

=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste Narasimhaji,
=A0
I am planning to start doi=
ng mahaganapathi homam based on your manual. I just
finished reading the ma=
nual and I have a question,

need to be a passive observer or does s=
he need to setup her own set of materials
and do the same action I do ? If =
yes, Where does she sit.
=A0
Basically the question is, What is the procedu=
re if more than one person wants
to actively participate in the homam ?
=A0=

I would be grateful if you can answer the above question. Also please cons=
ider
this email a request from me to consider you as my Guru when performin=
g the
Homam.
=A0
Please include vedic-wisdom group in your response if you =
think it would be
valuable to others.
