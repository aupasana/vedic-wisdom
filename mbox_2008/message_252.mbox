Sorry, out of context for the group but still good enough to be shared with all.
   The Technique can be practiced against such type of customers whom the Astrologer face regularly..
   
   
  A candle loses nothing if it is used to light another one.   
  a girl named Lalitha got married & went to live with her husband and mother-in-law. In a very short time, Lalitha found that she couldn't get along with mother-in-law at all. Their personalities were very different, and Lalitha was angered by many of her mother-in-law' s habits. In addition, she criticized Lalitha constantly. 
   
  Days passed, and weeks passed. Lalitha and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting. But what made the situation even worse was that, according to ancient Indian tradition, Lalitha had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in the house was causing Li-Li's poor husband great distress. 
   
  Finally, Lalitha could not stand her mother-in-law' s bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it! Lalitha went to see her father's good friend, Vighnesh, who sold herbs. She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all.. 
   
  Vighnesh thought for a while, and finally said, 'Li-Li, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and obey what I tell you.'
   
  Lalithasaid, 'Yes, Vighnesh, I will do whatever you tell me to do.'Vighnesh went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs. He told Lalitha, 'You can't use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day prepare some delicious meal and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspect you, when she dies, you must be very careful to be actively friendly towards her. 'Don't argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen.' Lalitha was so happy. She thanked Vighnesh and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law. 
   
  Weeks went by, and months went by, and every other day, Lalitha served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. . She remembered what Vighnesh had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother. 
   
  After 6 months had passed, the whole household had changed. Lalitha had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found that she almost never got mad or upset. She hadn't had an argument with her mother-in-law in 6 months because she now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with. 
   
  The mother-in-law' s attitude toward Lalitha changed, and she began to love Lalitha like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Lalitha was the best daughter-in- law one could ever find. Lalitha and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter. Lalitha's husband was very happy to see what was happening.
   
  One day, Lalitha came to see Vighnesh and asked for his help again She said, 'Dear Vighnesh, please help me to keep the poison from killing my mother-in-law. She's changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her.' 
   
  Vighnesh smiled and nodded his head.. 'Li-Li, there's nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her.' 
   
  There is a wise Chinese saying: 'The person who loves others will also be loved in return.' God might be trying to work in another person's life through you. 
   
  'A candle loses nothing if it is used to light another one�.
   
  And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary  - Paul The Apostle 
   
  LIVE well .... LAUGH often ... LOVE much.
   
  Do forward it to your friends wherever you can to spread the knowledge. You will surely be remembered for Good.
   
  Regards,
  Vighnesh
