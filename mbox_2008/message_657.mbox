Dear Sir,

1. I had visited one Gentleman in 1980 who was curing the patie=
nts by
simply their photographs. He was demamding photo of the patient. He =
had
pasted Gayatri Mantra sticker on all the three wings of a table fan and=

he was keeping the photograph of the patient just opposit the fan. He
was =
switching his fan on for 1 or 2 hours daily for couple of days and
as per h=
is say, he was throwing the vibrations of Gayatri Mantra
directly to the ph=
otograph. He was claiming that he has cured so many
patients by Gayatri Man=
tra vibrations.

2. Some people are arranging some Mantra cassette or CD in=
 their worship
room and playing them for couple of hours daily and believin=
g that the
room is charged due to Mantra vibrations. Some are playing these=
 type of
CDs in their Car to get protection from accidents and like. All ar=
e
doing these as per their believes.

    What I want to know from you Sir =
is whether this is really working?
Can anybody be cured by  Gayatri Mantra-=
written Fan?

   Can a CD or Cassette create vibrations? If someone is slee=
ping in the
room where whole night one CD of a cerain Mantra is played. The=
 person
is unaware of it. Whether Mantra will crerate any positive effect o=
n
him?

Dr. Ashwin Rawal
