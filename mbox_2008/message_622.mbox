Respected Ashwinji
This is a very good and inspiring thread. 
I would like =
to mention something that may be an interesting insight.
You mentioned Pt S=
hriram Sharma Acharya. He actually said in his
autobiography ( Hamari Viras=
at aur Vasiyat, My Inheritances and Will,
loosely translated) that once whe=
n he was 14 years old and sitting for
his Morning Sandhya,  a divine figure=
 appeared, guru
Sarweshwaranandji. His Guru then made him realise his past =
lives and
gave him the work for this life.
He took him back as in a flash t=
o the past. He realised that he had
been born as Thakur, before that Saint =
Kabir and before that Guru of
Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.

I will try=
 to locate the exact link and send it.The general site is
www.awgp.org I re=
member the book is there on pdf in English somewhere
online. It's in the ve=
ry first few chapters.



Thanks
Shiv

He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka =
