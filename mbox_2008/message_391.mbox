Namaste,

I am cc'ing the reply to the lists, maintaining your privacy.

Let me give a simple analogy. Suppose one is digging with a spade to find 
water. Spade is a tool and represents a mantra or a maalaa or an idol etc. 
Digging represents sadhana and search for god. Finding water is finding god. 
A guru is one who helps one in the process of digging and enables one to 
find water. If one is using a bad spade, he may give a good spade. If one is 
digging inefficiently, he may teach a better and smarter way to dig. If one 
is digging in a wrong place, he may show where to dig (which god to worship) 
for faster results. So, a guru should simply help one in finding god. 
Exactly what help is needed depends on the situation. It is neither 
necessary nor sufficient to give a mantra.

Some gurus give mantras or other objects such as idols or maalas etc and 
transfer some of their sadhana through that medium. In my experience that I 
mentioned, my guru sent me a rudraksha maalaa he specially made for me and 
he tranferred some of his sadhana and acquired purity to me through that 
medium and that made some things possible for me.

When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) went to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he 
touched Narendranath's chest with his foot and Narendranath went into 
samadhi. Ramana Maharshi just glanced at Ganapathi Muni silently and all of 
latter's questions were answered. There are different gurus, different 
sishyas, different karmas, different rinas and different relationships.

:-) Two things. Books and emails such as this one are not just words. They 
consist of words at the gross level and thoughts at a subtler level. 
Depending on the energy (purity) level of the person composing those books 
or emails, some energy is placed in the words and the thoughts behind them. 
Depending on your own capacity to receive and your own rinas with the 
author, you may grasp some of that energy, get the right thoughts from the 
words and benefit from them. The words themselves are just useless. It is 
the thoughts and energy behind them that may actually benefit someone and 
help in internal purification.

Secondly, one can have many gurus, though one ideally wants one guru who 
takes care of it all. Dattatreya had many gurus.

Let me deviate a bit. I was once meditating in the garbhalaya of a temple, 
sitting directly in front of a yogi. We were both meditating on Savitri 
Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awareness of my body 
and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw that there was 
a person at the center of that light, who was emiting that light. When I 
looked closer, it was that yogi (who was sitting in front of me and 
meditating). After a little time, he suddenly changed into another person 
that I could recognize. This was a very famous spiritual giant from the past 
and he was not alive then. I wondered "why did X change into Y". That 
disturbed my focus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware 
that I was Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and X was sitting in 
front of me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, that yogi also opened his 
eyes. Without my saying anything, he asked "you saw me, no?" I was surprised 
that he knew it. However, what baffled me the most was why he transformed 
into Y. I stuttered, "but...". Without my finishing it, he remarked, "you 
see Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of last life are still with me. That 
is why you saw him in me!" He not only knew what I saw, but explained it 
succintly. This yogi attributes a lot of progress he made in this life to 
his past life guru (in addition to current life guru of course). His 
gratitude to his past life guru is immense. Existence of such people 
convinces me fully that when a spiritual giant comes and goes, his thoughts 
and his energy linger on earth for a long time and those who are 
sufficiently pure and receptive can actually receive from them. The body in 
which the soul lived may decay, but Maharshi Vasishtha teaches that thoughts 
of the person never die and stay in space for ever and may guide many.

Bottomline: You can consider anybody as your guru. If you are lucky, that 
person will also consider you as a sishya and have a more active 
relationship. A more active guru may even take some really blocking karmas 
from a disciple to speed up purification and progress. Thus, it is 
beneficial to have such a guru. But, when you are talking about a spiritual 
giant, even a passive (from his/her side) relationship is immensely 
beneficial.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Respected Sir,

This mail was really worth reading.
But I have a few doubts. Is the criteria for accepting somebody as
our Guru that the person must give us a mantra/or ask us to chant
some specific mantra?
What if we are already chanting some mantra?
I have been chanting Shiv mantra since my childhood, as I had a some
kind of affinity towards Shiv and Shiv mantra(like in dreams I would
see myself chanting shive mantra, or when I get up in the morning the
mantra would come to my mind automatically, even if I was not
thinking about it). But I never practised chanting the mantra till I
I read about meditation and mantra from a book written by Swami
Chinmayananda(when I was in 8th or 9th std). Since then I thought of
Swami Chinmayananda as my spritual Guru. More than that I grew up
reading Swamiji's books and listening to his Geeta classes whenever
he came to my native place. So is it right to consider him as my Guru
because I got the mantra from his book and started chanting after
reading the book? Or is it that since it is from a book, I cannot
call him as my Guru and I dont have a guru yet? Should I think that a
guru is yet to come for me?
Is it necessary that a Guru should be alive and should directly speak
to us and give a mantra to consider him as out Guru? I know, I am
putting the same question in different ways, but still, these are my
doubts.

Please let me know your comments on this.

With respects,
