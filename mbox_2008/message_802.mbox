Namaste,
I vaguely recall reading somewhere that Shri Ramakrishna Paramaham=
sa once stated that he 
would be reborn in 100 or 150 years time, can anyon=
e kindly verify whether that statement 
is indeed true; and if so kindly pr=
ovide a reference to the text that has that quote? I also 
recall reading t=
hat he mentioned that his disciples would again gather with him this time 
=
around as well; so any references to that would be appreciated as well.
Bes=
t.
