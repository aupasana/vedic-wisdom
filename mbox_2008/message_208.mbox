Narasimhaji,
Thanks for informative post. Could you please tell me how to g=

Aghora Series by Swami Vimalananda and his biography?
                 =

He received a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. 
According=
ing to him, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of 
Samyukta and Rajput=
 King Prithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he 
repelled so many Muslim invade=
rs at the border of India. When Muslims 
finally conquered India, he was re=
born as one of them and put breaks 
on their aggression and changed their w=
ays.
>  
> In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed 
te=
mples, libraries and other relics of native religion and culture. 
They beh=
eaded Hindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women 
and they behea=
ded defeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the 
native religion and cu=
lture and replace with theirs. Akbar slowed 
down the barbarism and aggress=
ion and promoted tolerance and 
integration. He stopped the forced conversi=
ons, rapes and beheadings 
of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples=
 and libraries. He 
talked about respecting other religions while following=
 one's own 
religion. He even took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abo=
lished 
a special tax on Hindus based on religion. He was a man of great 
c=
haracter, conviction and principles and was utterly fearless. He had 
affin=
ity for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput family and spent 
early years=
 there. He displayed the samskaras and instincts of a 
refined and cultured=
 Rajput more than those a of Mughal king - he was 
so unlike his grandfathe=
r Babar, father Humayun and step-brother 
Adham.
>  
> He used to offer arg=
hyas to Sun in the morning and then participate 
in a Zoroastrian fire ritu=
al of Farsis (similar to our homam) and 
then do a namaz with Muslim cleric=
s. Such tolerance was unheard of 
from any other Muslim ruler in those days=
 (or perhaps even today!). 
Towards the end of his life, he even started hi=
s own religion, which 
was based on his realization and is quite noble. He =
was a spiritually 
elevated soul. Irrespective of the religion one follows,=
 one deserves 
our respect and admiration if one embodies the spirit of san=
atana 
dharma in one's thoughts and actions.
>  
> Akbar was a true hero - =
a being who came down from a higher loka to 
fulfil a certain mission with =
the blessings of rishis. His 
contribution to the safekeeping of sanatana d=
harma is not to be 
judged from what harm his fellow Muslims inflicted on s=
anatana 
dharma. His contribution is to be judged from what *more* harm to =

sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, I have no 
doubt th=

did. That wa=
s not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent 
somebody to alter the c=
ourse and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate 
that those who see the good=
ness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji 
cannot see the goodness of Akbar s=
imply because he was a Muslim.
>

like him. He was a great inspirational figure then and should be now 
too.=
