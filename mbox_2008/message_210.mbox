00Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Akbar (Re: Boycott 'Jodhaa Akbar' | Participat=
e in awareness drive)



Namaskaram anna,
 
I saw this movie and I cannot h=
elp responding.
 
It is true that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffered badly=
 at the hands of Muslim invaders (and other invaders), but it is wrong to t=
ake out that anger on Akbar. Some people cannot see beyond a man's name and=
 religion and hence cannot recognize when a great celestial being is born i=
n a different religion.
 
Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in t=
he "Aghora" series books, is somebody who achieved the highest states of co=
nsciousness. He received a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Acco=
rdinging to him, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Ra=
jput King Prithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim inv=
aders at the border of India. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was =
reborn as one of them and put breaks on their aggression and changed their =
ways.
 
In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temple=
s, libraries and other relics of native religion and culture. They beheaded=
 Hindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded de=
feated kings. They just tried to wipe out the native religion and culture a=
nd replace with theirs. Akbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and =
promoted tolerance and integration. He stopped the forced conversions, rape=
s and beheadings of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples and libra=
ries. He talked about respecting other religions while following one's own =
religion. He even took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a spe=
cial tax on Hindus based on religion. He was a man of great character, conv=
iction and principles and was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs=
 and was even born in a Rajput family and spent early years there. He displ=
ayed the samskaras and instincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than=
 those a of Mughal king - he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Hu=
mayun and step-brother Adham.
 
He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morn=
ing and then participate in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to=
 our homam) and then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unh=
eard of from any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!).=
 Towards the end of his life, he even started his own religion, which was b=
ased on his realization and is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated s=
oul. Irrespective of the religion one follows, one deserves our respect and=
 admiration if one embodies the spirit of sanatana dharma in one's thoughts=
 and actions.
 
Akbar was a true hero - a being who came down from a higher=
 loka to fulfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. His contrib=
ution to the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what h=
arm his fellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to=
 be judged from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If h=
e had not come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered mu=
ch much more than it did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why t=
hey sent somebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortun=
ate that those who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cann=
ot see the goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.
 
It is unfort=
unate that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric=
 Muslim kings. Who should be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as=
 an enemy and being shot down. Instead, we should promote his story and ins=
pire more people to be like him. He was a great inspirational figure then a=
nd should be now too.
 
The epic movie "Jodha Albar" is a very good movie a=
bout one of the greatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director a=
nd actor did justice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad a=
bout the mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please=
 do not assassinate the character of Akbar.
 
If you want, please make movi=
es of the same caliber and cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such =
as Chatrapati Shivaji, Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka=
, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ra=
makrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no ne=
ed to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.
 
These are my 2 cents on the f=
ire over Jodha Akbar.
