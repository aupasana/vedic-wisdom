night. Several joints, such as =
the ankle or knee, may also be 
affected at the same time.

in becomes more severe as fluid collects in the joint 
space and in the sur=
rounding soft tissues. The skin is tense, hot, 
and shining, and is of a re=

likely to have chills and fever, a rap=

general weakness. Severe attacks may continue fo=

milder attacks usually last only a few days. Repeated att=
acks may 
occur each year, gradually becoming more severe and prolonged.

health=
y should be tested for gout. There are times when gout may 
stimulate rheum=
atic fever, but this disease is more likely to attack 
larger joints, while=
 gout tends to involve the smaller joints.
>   Gout Symptoms  Acute pain in=
 the toe, swelling  The most common 
Gout symptom is acute pain in the big =
toe, which becomes tender, 
hot, and swollen in a few hours. It may also si=
milarly affect other 
joints such as the knees and wrists, and sometimes mo=
re than one 
joint may be affected at a time. The attack, usually occurs at=
 
midnight or in the early hours of the morning when the patient is 
sudden=
ly awakened. The acute attack generally lasts for a week or 
so. During thi=
s period, the patient may run a slight fever, and feel 
disinclined to eat.=
 A serious complication of gout is the presence 
of kidney stones containin=
g uric acid. In some cases the kidneys get 
damaged and do not function pro=
perly. 
>   Causes of Gout  Gout caused due to Uric Acid Crystals  One of 
=
main causes of gout is the formation of uric acid crystals in the 
joints, =
skin, and kidneys. Uric acid is an end product of the body's 
chemical proc=
esses. Those affected by gout have a higher level of 
uric acid in the bloo=
d than the normal, due either to formation of 
increased amounts or reduced=
 amounts of acid being passed out by the 
kidneys in the urine. This uric a=
cid usually remains dissolved in 
the blood. But when the blood becomes too=
 full of it, the uric acid 
forms needle-shaped crystals in the joints whic=
h bring about attacks 
of gout.
>   Excessive alcohol, heredity, rich foods=

coholic drinks, 
regular eating of foods rich in protein and carbohydrate, =
