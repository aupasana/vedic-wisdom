Narasimha Garu & others,
Namaste !!!

let's take a time-off from CK..:-)

a=
 couple of days back, i was going through your 2008 TP chart & TP 
Ashtotta=
ri Dasha. few intresting coincidence was noticed which i 
wish to share her=
e.

1]

-Your TP'08 chart has Digbali Mangal in 10th where as strong Guru i=
n 
4th in Dhanu.

- Mangal's TPA dasha was on from 10.aug to 5th Sept'08.

=
Now this is the time when for the first time i was inspired to think 
if yo=
u are my spiritual guide (The exact day was 24th Aug, 
Janmashtami day). I =
wrote you the mail same day asking about it. and 
i got the mail from you a=
ccepting me as your disciple on 3rd of sept 
(Ganesh Chaturthi day).

both =
the above dates falls in the Mangal period, which is in Mithun 
Rashi.

*NO=
W The main connection is that in my Birth Rashi chart, I have 
Mithun Lagna=
 having Mars and Guru is in Dhanu* the situation exactly 
found in yout TP'=
08 chart as indicated above. 

Adding to the above,Your TP'08 Rashi chart h=
as Kanya Lagna & my 
TP'08 chart has also Kanya Lagna.

2] Today just thoug=
ht of seeing the same chart (your TP'08) with 7 
or 8 CK scheme. Honest per=
suit to see how it shows up.

settings done for 8 CK scheme - Mangal is Pik=
 & Guru is BK hence no 
connection to Shishya. PK is Budha debiliated. peri=
od

The chart has no planets on the same degree. so let's apply the rule 
o=
f 7CK which has comeup as a fresh translation.

Mangal becomes MK. if we ap=
ply the second rule that MK also acts as 
PK. then things are explained. in=
 Mangal (PK) ATP Dasha you found, a 
Shishya who intrestingly has Mangal in=
 Muthun Lagna.
------------------------------------------------------------=
--------

No way i am making any judgment about *working in practise* for 7=
/8 
CK. what i tried is just to apply on the said chart and found 
working =
nicely. however it is a long way to confirm if it works 
practically or not=
.

but one thing is for sure that TP works amazingly. this is the one 
tool=
 which i love to use with good confidence.
 
Is it not another confirmation=
 about GURU, Shishya & Jyotish Shastra?

Aadhyaatmically & Jyotishially you=
