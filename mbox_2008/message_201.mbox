Dear Narsimha ji, I entirely share your sentiments. Jodha Akbar is a
tremen=
dous film showing the glorious reign of Akbar, who indeed was
truly a great=
 ruler. I feel ashamed of Hindus who try and bring a Muslim
bias into such =
cinematic achievements. I will implore such people to
appreciate the truth =
behind Akbar and his admiraton of Hindu religion
which has been beautifully=
 depicted in the movie. For those who havent
seen it yet, it is not be miss=
ed. Best wishes Sharat
