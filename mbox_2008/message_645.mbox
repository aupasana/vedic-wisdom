Namaste

I heard a lecture from his web site where he describes about the s=
igns
in a sadhak when kundalini is awakened and also in his book
too.

If y=
ou want to read more about kundalini shakti and awakening than I
recommend =
some of the books as follows:

The first book in english came out from Swam=
i Vishnutirth Maharaj.
He wrote it in english and then his successor Swami =
Shivom Tirth
Maharaj wrote some very good books there are about 8 or 10 boo=
ks.
Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj just passed away this year and his last
book=
 is "Last Journey" or in hindi "antim charan" just came out a few
month ago=
. On Kundalini Shakti and Shaktipat this parampara has been
one of the very=
 reputed ones. One of his books "Chiti Leela" is a very
good book that desc=
ribes the Kundalini Shakti and its working and the
experiances of different=
 chakra bedhans etc.

Vishnitirth Maharaj wrote also some sutras on kundali=
ni Shakti.

Even Swami Muktanand Maharaj of Ganeshpuri did refer to Swami
V=
ishnutirth maharaj's book and his guru Brahamchari Yoganand Maharaj.
His bo=
ok "Chiti Leela" is very good too. He was also a very authentic
saint.

Fro=
m this same lineage there were also some masters in Maharastra
one Shri Gul=
vani Maharaj who was also a disciple of Shri Vasudevanand
Sarawati -- the f=
amous master from Dattatreya lineage.
Gulvani Maharaj was a contemporary of=
 Vishnutirth Maharaj and he was
initiated into Shaktipat by Shri Loknath Ti=
rth Maharaj. There is still
one direct disciple of Shri Loknath Tirth Mahar=
aj going by name of
shri Kaka.
 
These lineages are originally from Kashmir=
 Shaivism.
I believe one Saint Laksman Joo from kashmir has written a coupl=
e of
books on Kunadlini Shakti too. These are also good books too.

Mother =
Lal or Devi Laleshwari the very famous devi from kashmir was
also from the =
same lineage as Shri Vishnutirth Maharaj, although she
happened many centur=
ies ago.

Apart from above I believe the Nath Sampradaya also is very adept=
 in
Kundalini Awakening. I donot have any information of present saints in
=
this lineage.

Some of the books by Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj are availabl=
e on
Amazon.com. (in engish too) here in US in India there are many ashrams=

where one can get these books. Same with Swami Muktanand Maharaj's
books t=
oo.

In short after one makes lots of effort like hath yoga or mantra yoga
=
or even homans or kriya yoga, there is a chance that kundalini shakti
can a=
waken or
the other way is by the grace of guru when he initiates a disciple=
.
The above saints initiated their disciples and awakened kundalini.

Param=
hans Ramakrishna had that capability too and he had awakened
kundalini shak=
ti of Swami Vivekanand and other disciples of him.
Raman Maharshi also had =
similar capabilities too.

I am sure there are many other saints who are ve=
ry adapt in it.

Hope this information helps.

Best Regards
Mitesh
