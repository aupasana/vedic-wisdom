Namaste Narsimhaji

Detachment from karma ( kartabhav) is difficult.. and i=
 am at the lowest step of this path finding it much much difficult.. i have=
 lust in me.. i have pride in me.. and i have ego also in me.. i know i nee=
d to come out of this.. this is not what i am suppose to do.. i shared this=
 with my friend utpal.. we both are schoolmates and his talk and his attitu=
de was always different from others since our childhood.. i have high regar=
ds for him and he had always helped me during the hour of my need.... He is=
 the person who had brought me in this site.. his inspirational talk and th=
inking had made me thinking about my life, about my self . 

When we met la=
st i shared my dilema with him too.. he said i must do sadhna... and there =
is no shortcut for this.. miracle can happen only through sadhna..Sadhna wi=
ll only give clarity in your life.. and i am doing it..Honestly not much.. =
but he advised me that i should atleast=C2=A0 chant gayatri mantra 20 minut=
es in a day and i am doing it.. 

I want help to have control over me mysel=
f.. i am lacking it ... you have rightly said that ''WHEN THE CONTROL OVER =
SELF IS '' PERFECT'' ONE MAY FIND GOD. I want to find god.. i want to feel =
god.. kindly guide me.. kindly help me..

Namaste,
=C2=A0
Abstinence is =
not brahmacharya, but it is a good 
start towards it.
=C2=A0
To have the mi=
nd established in god and not have 
any desires spring in it is brahmachary=
a.
=C2=A0
But, as long as we keep fulfilling desires, more 
and more of the=
m keep springing up. The process of overcoming the springing up 
of=C2=A0ne=
w desires often starts with suppressing (and not fulfilling) old 
desires a=
nd take the mind away from it.
=C2=A0
But, that is the beginning and not th=
e 
end.
=C2=A0

Regarding being married and not ful=
filling the 
desire of spouse:
=C2=A0
One's karmik debts may require one to=
 fulfil the 
sexual desire of another person. But, the problem is that we i=
ncur new debts 
while paying off old debts in this matter, like in many oth=
er matters. In 
general, if one engages in an action with a detached mind t=
hat finds the action 
neither attractive nor repulsive, one is not committi=
ng a new karma and creating 
new debts to be settled later. One is merely s=
ettling old debts with such 
detached actions. But, if one engages in an ac=
tion with an attached mind that 
finds the action either attractive or repu=
lsive, one IS committing a new karma 
and creating new debts to be settled =
later. This becomes an endless cycle! 

=C2=A0
Sex is a highly physical act=
ion. While engaging in 
it, it is nearly impossible to detach the mind from=
 body and focus on god. Mind 
invariably gets attached to the body and its =
experience. Thus, one is not only 
settling old debts by giving pleasure, b=
ut one also creates a new debt by 
deriving pleasure again. This is an endl=
ess cycle.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Scriptures cover a lot of ground=
 and they say a lot 
of things that may contradict one another. Yes, one wh=
o marries and begets 
children is needed for the continuation of human race=
 and smooth running of 
society. But, dharma and moksha are different. Perf=
orming your duties sincerely 
is good and takes you to heaven for a while a=
nd then brings you back here. For 
liberation from the cycle, one has to ov=
ercome the weaknesses and 
desires.
=C2=A0
Do not compare with gods like Ra=
ma and Krishna. Our 
minds are totally different from those of gods and ris=
his. Krishna was the 
Ishwara of Yogis, whose mind was eternally in yoga wi=
th the Absolute. Actually, 
his mind may be taken as the definition of Abso=
lute. His mind is not anything 
like ours.
=C2=A0

regards,
Narasimha

Namaste,

I have 
        read the content=
s of utpal.. that had raised few questions in to my 
        mind.. i would=
 be happy if utpal can answer me..

1. Supressing 
        desire cannot be=
 termed as a brahmacharya. .right?
2. To control 
        desire is also no=
t brahmacharya? 

In our vedic books also, it is 
        specifically ment=
ioned that DHANYO GRUHASTHASHARAM. Lord rama was also 
        married and =
had kids..still he was called Maryada purushottam. ..Lord 
        Krishna =
has 8 patranis and 16000 gopia.. well does it mean that Lord 
        krish=
na had physical relationship with all of them.. or he had not? that 
      =
  is all together different issue..But lord krishna was shringar 
        p=
riya=C2=A0 and=C2=A0 it seems that he had enjoyed physical 
        realtio=
nship. . (???)=C2=A0 still he was called brahmachari. . how? i am 
        =
bit confused.. 

I personally feel that to have sexual desire and 
        =
not fulfilling it,=C2=A0 cannot be termed as brahmacharya. . it is like 
  =
      cheating yourself... and if you are married and if you donot fulfill =

        desire of your spouse is also not good.. Please 
        advise.

Thanks

          Namaste,

Let me put s=
ome thoughts and i'll continue writng 
          as it keeps on 
occuring t=
o me...

1) Thakur's marraige was 
          never a marriage in physical s=
ense

2) The author of 
          'Autobiography of a Yogi', Paramhamsa Yog=
ananda has 
mentioned in 
          the same book that his parents lived li=
ke a Husband & 
wife 
          only once a year to biget child.

3) I've r=
ead some where that 
          our ancient Rishis though married, 
lived ex=
tremely restarined 
          married life and that too only to beget 
chil=
dren.

4) Adi 
          Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all monastic=
 disciples 
of 
          Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aur=
obindo, Sri Sri 
          
Ravishankar and countless known realised souls =
never married (We 
          
assume that they maintained perfect brahmacha=
rya) .

5) Many 
          saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta,=
 Jalaaram, 
Rishis 
          of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and man=
y other saints 
were 
          married. but i am confident that at some st=
age in their life 
they 
          would have ended, forever, the physical =
relationship with their 
          
spouses.

6)complete Brahmachaya includ=
es Physical & 
          Mental. physical 
brahmacharya includes Restrain o=
f all the 
          indriyaas and not just the 
procreative organs.

There=
 are 
          many things looks contradictory in above but if one see 
de=
eper 
          then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a common truth.=
 
what 
          i've started believing from the above written thoughts as=
 well 
as 
          many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one of =
the most 
          
important vertue for realisation. but it seems that ev=
en married 
          
people will also start maintaining that, knowingly o=
r unknowingly 
          
before final realisation. actually, it seems that=
 Like 
          realisation, 
Brahmachrya aslo DAWNS !!!

Warm 
          =

Utpal
