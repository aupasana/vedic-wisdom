Namaste,

Let me put some thoughts and i'll continue writng as it keeps on =

occuring to me...

1) Thakur's marraige was never a marriage in physical s=
ense

2) The author of 'Autobiography of a Yogi', Paramhamsa Yogananda has =

mentioned in the same book that his parents lived like a Husband & 
wife o=
nly once a year to biget child.

3) I've read some where that our ancient R=
ishis though married, 
lived extremely restarined married life and that too=
 only to beget 
children.

4) Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all=
 monastic disciples 
of Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurob=
indo, Sri Sri 
Ravishankar and countless known realised souls never married=
 (We 
assume that they maintained perfect brahmacharya).

5) Many saints su=
ch as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Jalaaram, 
Rishis of yore, Ekanaath=
, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other saints 
were married. but i am confiden=
t that at some stage in their life 
they would have ended, forever, the phy=
sical relationship with their 
spouses.

6)complete Brahmachaya includes Ph=
ysical & Mental. physical 
brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriy=
aas and not just the 
procreative organs.

There are many things looks cont=
radictory in above but if one see 
deeper then there is a wonderful synergy=
. there is a common truth. 
what i've started believing from the above writ=
ten thoughts as well 
as many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one=
 of the most 
important vertue for realisation. but it seems that even marr=
ied 
people will also start maintaining that, knowingly or unknowingly 
bef=
ore final realisation. actually, it seems that Like realisation, 
Brahmachr=
ya aslo DAWNS !!!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
