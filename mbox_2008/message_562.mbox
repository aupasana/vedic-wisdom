Namaste friends,

In the next few weeks/months, I want to share with all my=
 independent interpretations of the vedic mantras for nine planets.

Though=
 I am mostly restricting my spiritual writings to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup t=
hese days and sparing astrology related yahoogroups, I am sending this to a=
strology yahoogroups also, as BPHS talks about these mantras in the chapter=
 on graha shanti.

*        *        *

This mantra is a very popular mantr=
a for worshipping Surya (Sun god). It is used in Navagraha homam and navagr=
aha pooja as a part of Satya Narayana vratam. Parasara Maharshi (father of =
Veda Vyasa Maharshi) specified this mantra as a remedy for any problems rel=
ated to Sun in the horoscope (see "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram").

My =
interpretation may be different from what Sayana, Max Muller etc gave. Espe=
cially when it comes to the second line, most scholars have interpreted "ra=
tha" as chariot and alluded to Sun going around earth on a chariot. I have =
a different Vedantic take on it. I know some Sanskrit, but it is the inner =
inspiration given by Mother Mahalakshmi that enables to interpret.

May eru=
dite scholars ignore me if they find my interpretation faulty!

Meaning in Brief:

Existing with all the light and the darkness=
, dwelling in the imperishable Brahman as well as the perishable creation, =
Savita, with the pure essence of Brahman and with the desire that causes mo=
vement in it (and results in creation), moves into all beings including the=
 gods and experiences through them all the worlds and the beings of this di=
verse creation.

Detailed Commentary:

If you study carefully, this verse g=
ives the essence of Vedic philosophy. It contains the essence of great scri=
ptures such as "Yoga Vaasishtham" and "BhagavadGita", sooktas such as Purus=
ha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and hymns such as Ganapathi Atharva Seersha=
m. It is a very important hymn.

Savita is the highest form of Surya. He is=
 basically the supreme cosmic being. He is Atman, the pure spirit that fill=
s the entire universe - the creation as well as the uncreated. He is the pu=
re light behind all the light and darkness that we see. Good and bad, gods =
and demons, pleasure and pain, all such dualities are but different manifes=
tations of the same Brahman. The ONE Brahman manifests as the duality and d=
iverse beings.

The one Atman, which is but pure light, manifests as dualit=
y - as light and darkness - and fills the entire universe. Savita dwells in=
 Brahman as well as the entire perishable creation. Everything that has man=
ifested has to perish. Savita dwells in all - in the imperishable Brahman a=
s well as the perishable manifestations of Brahman (various worlds, gods, d=
emons and other beings).

The ONE pure light of Savita manifests as DIVERSE=
 objects ranging all the way from pure light to darkness and fills all bein=
gs. With the pure and untaintable essence of Brahman and the movement cause=
d in Brahman due to desire, Savita enters all the beings including gods. In=
 other words, all the beings are created from Brahman and the desire/moveme=
nt in Brahman.

Vedanta teaches that Brahman is unmanifested pure conscious=
ness. A part of Brahman causes movement in Brahman, which becomes a desire =
and gets fulfilled immediately. This results in the creation of various bei=
ngs. The word "ratha" refers to this. The pure essence of Brahman (hiraNyay=
a) as well as the desire that caused a movement of thought in Brahman (rath=
a) enter all beings. Savita enters all being as Shiva as well as Shakti!

W=
hen all the desires come to a halt and the movement of mind stops, all bein=
gs can experience the pure essence of Brahman that has entered them (i.e. s=
at-chid-ananda). When the desire is there, there are thoughts and movement =
of mind and the beings do not experience the pure essence of Brahman that h=
as entered them.

The hymn says that the pure essence of Brahman (Shiva) an=
d the desire that causes movement of thought (Shakti) are both aspects of O=
NE Savita only.

Savita enters all the beings with the pure essence and the=
 desire/thought and experiences the worlds and beings through them. If a pe=
rson called "Narasimha Rao" exists, it is actually Savita who exists throug=
h him. If a person called "Narasimha Rao" experiences the entire world - va=
rious worlds and beings in those worlds - it is actually Savita who has ent=
ered him that experiences the entire world through him!! All his thoughts, =
experiences and actions are actually those of Savita - the in-dwelling spir=
it.

This is the same as what Ganapathi Atharva Seersham means by "tvameva =
kevalam kartAsi...". This is the same as what Krishna means when he tells A=
rjuna in BhagavadGita that it is Krishna who acts through various beings an=
d that the beings should not be deluded to think that they are doing things=
.

Savita in this hymn is represented as the same supreme cosmic being that=
 is referred in various other Vedic scriptures!

Most authorities have inte=
rpreted the second line to mean that Sun goes on a chariot and watches the =
entire world. That is a gross interpretation and misses the subtle and deep=
er meaning.

In fact, when Atman goes on the chariot (ratha) of desire (rat=
ha), it moves and sees the diverse creation. When the chariot (ratha) stops=
, then the desire (ratha) stops and there is no movement of thought. No lon=
ger a diverse creation is perceived and there is only bliss of true being (=
sat-chid-ananda). Thus, even the gross chaiot interpretation is a metaphor =
for the subtle interpretation given above!

This hymn is very important as =
it covers several important Vedantic concepts:

(1) The supreme cosmic bein=
g is one, but assumes duality.
(2) The supreme cosmic being enters all the =
beings with the duality.
(3) The supreme cosmic being experiences through a=
ll the beings.
(4) The pure essence of supreme cosmic being enters all the =
beings and helps them experience sat-chid-ananda.
(5) The desire (movement =
of thought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all the beings and results i=
n movement of thought within them and diverse world experiences. 

Best reg=
ards,
Narasimha
