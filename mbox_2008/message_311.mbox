Dear Jitendra
   
  Good question. Honestly speaking, "infinite conscinousness" is for all practical purposes what we call God. I don't think there is anyone here among us who can really make you or anyone else understand because undestanding is a faculty of the mind and "inflinte consciousness" is way beyond the mind. Only the greatest of men realize it in their heart of hearts.  If we could understand and realize that, we would probbably not be here in this forum today. So its quite normal.
   
  -Regards
   Rajarshi

swami venkateshananda (1 book edition) but i wanted to ask the members 
that i m not understanding it properly even after reading it again and 
again

understanding
Before this i have read Autobiography of yogi by Sh. paramhansa 
yogananda

of "infinite consciousnesss" , this term has been used repetitively
