Namaste,
 
Hoping you won't mind, I am cc'ing the reply to vedic-wisdom.
 
=
This is a good question. When offering five services to deities representin=
g the five elements, flower is used to represent the element of ether or ra=
ther space (aakaasa tattva). The question is why, i.e. what is the link.
 
=
Aakaasa is the subtlest element. Aakaasa or space is that which is everywhe=
re. It changes and other elements come from it. You may see a solid matter =
or liquid matter or air in a place *now*, but there was space there before.=
 It is the basis of all other elements.
 
Similarly, a flower is the basis =
of many things. Flower gives rise to a fruit. Fruit contains seeds and seed=
s give rise to plants. Plants become trees. Trees give more flowers and fru=
its. All these lie within the original flower as a potentiality, just as va=
rious element lie within space (aakaasa) as a potentiality.
 
When you see =
a tree or a plant or a fruit, you do not see a flower in them and yet they =
came from a flower. Similarly, when you see a solid or liquid or airy matte=
r, you do not see space in it and yet they came from space.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
The purpose of mantras and rituals is to guide the mind along cert=
ain routes where it can visualize certain things well and forget other thin=
gs. A lot of deep philosophy exists behind symbols used in rituals. The bas=
ic philosophy of veda and upanishad is behind a lot of symbols used in ritu=
als and mantras. Following rituals faithfully without understanding the sym=
bolism is also very good. It will eventually have the desired effect on the=
 mind. But, pondering the symbolism can take one closer to the upanishadic =
essence represented by the symbols.
 
Somebody like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
 might offer a flower to Kaali, immediately visualize the symbolism represe=
nted by it, visualize how fruit, plant, tree, more flowers, more fruits and=
 more trees come from a flower and, at a deeper level, how various tattvas,=
 deities, worlds and beings evolve from the Supreme Being and just go into =
samadhi mesmerized by the lila of god. We should try to overcome the regula=
r pre-occupations of the mind and focus it on god and god's lila.
 
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha

  ----- Original Message ----- 
        Dear Narasimha garu,

      =
  Can you please explain how flower indicates the aakasa tatva ? It is easy=
 to understand for the other 4 elements.

        Deepa - light - Agni
    =
    Gandha - smell - Bhu
        Naivedya - taste - Jala
        Dhoopa - s=
moke - Vayu

        But not able to understand how flower signifies aakasa=
 tatva. 

        Thanks,
        <deleted>
