Dear all,
 This is my first time posting on the vedic-wisdom group. Hope th=
e 
topic is not inappropriate.

 I was wondering if someone could tell me o=
r point me to articles 
which explain to some depth what a Bijakshara is, w=
hat are the 
Bijaksharas and why they are said to be powerful. 

 Specifica=
lly, I also want to know - why do only some 
sounds/syllables qualify as Bi=
jaksharas? Also, what exactly is the 
difference between a mantra and bijak=
sharas? Are all bijaksharas 
automatically mantras? Do mantras consist only=
 of bijaksharas? What 
effects do bijaksharas have that mantras dont have a=
nd vice versa?

 As you can see, I want a detailed explanation.. Any and al=
l details 
will be highly appreciated..

Thanks,

Sundeep
