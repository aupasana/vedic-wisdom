Namaste,

I have read the contents of utpal.. that had raised few question=
s in to my mind.. i would be happy if utpal can answer me..

1. Supressing =
desire cannot be termed as a brahmacharya..right?
2. To control desire is a=
lso not brahmacharya? 

In our vedic books also, it is specifically mention=
ed that DHANYO GRUHASTHASHARAM. Lord rama was also married and had kids..st=
ill he was called Maryada purushottam...Lord Krishna has 8 patranis and 160=
00 gopia.. well does it mean that Lord krishna had physical relationship wi=
th all of them.. or he had not? that is all together different issue..But l=
ord krishna was shringar priya=C2=A0 and=C2=A0 it seems that he had enjoyed=
 physical realtionship.. (???)=C2=A0 still he was called brahmachari.. how?=
 i am bit confused.. 

I personally feel that to have sexual desire and not=
 fulfilling it,=C2=A0 cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is like cheatin=
g yourself.. and if you are married and if you donot fulfill desire of your=
 spouse is also not good.. Please advise.

Thanks

Rajesh

            Namaste,



Let me put some thoughts and i'll con=
tinue writng as it keeps on 

occuring to me...



1) Thakur's marraige was=
 never a marriage in physical sense



2) The author of 'Autobiography of a=
 Yogi', Paramhamsa Yogananda has 

mentioned in the same book that his pare=
nts lived like a Husband & 

wife only once a year to biget child.



3) I'=
ve read some where that our ancient Rishis though married, 

lived extremel=
y restarined married life and that too only to beget 

children.



4) Adi =
Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all monastic disciples 

of Thakur, S=
wami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri 

Ravishankar and c=
ountless known realised souls never married (We 

assume that they maintain=
ed perfect brahmacharya) .



5) Many saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Nar=
asee Mehta, Jalaaram, 

Rishis of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and ma=
ny other saints 

were married. but i am confident that at some stage in th=
eir life 

they would have ended, forever, the physical relationship with t=
heir 

spouses.



6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical & Mental. physi=
cal 

brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not just the =


procreative organs.



There are many things looks contradictory in above=
 but if one see 

deeper then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a comm=
on truth. 

what i've started believing from the above written thoughts as =
well 

as many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one of the most 

=
important vertue for realisation. but it seems that even married 

people w=
ill also start maintaining that, knowingly or unknowingly 

before final re=
alisation. actually, it seems that Like realisation, 

Brahmachrya aslo DAW=
NS !!!



Warm Regards,



Utpal
