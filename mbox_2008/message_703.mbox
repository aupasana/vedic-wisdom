Namaste,
 
I think I am not able to fully connect with this rik. However, a=
s you asked, I will share what my intuition tells me about its subtle meani=
ng.
 
Rik:
 
divaspari prathamaM jaGYe agnirasmad dvitIyaM pari jaatavedaaH=
 .
tR^itIyamapsu nR^maNaa ajasramindhaana enaM jarate svaadhIH ..  RV 10.45=
.1
 
Critique:
 
The word "apsu" in the second half has been interpreted as=
 "in waters". The word "ap" not only means water, but also means "work" or =
"action". The word "div" in the first half is interpreted as heaven. It als=
o means "desire" or "wish". In fact, heaven is a place where all desires ar=
e instantly fulfilled (after all, it is a result of your own previous good =
karmas and hence the period for which you stay in heaven is limited by the =
good karmas you carry).
 
Simple Translation:
 
First, Fire is born around =
our wishes. Second, as the all-knowing one. Third, in the actions of people=
. A thoughtful one approaches this perpetually kinding one.
 
Commentary:
 =

In my view, this rik is referring to three shaktis - Ichchhaa shakti (powe=
r of desire), Jnaana shakti (power of knowledge) and Kriyaa shakti (power o=
f action). These three powers are endowed with three gunas - tamas, sattwa =
and rajas - and overseen by the three goddesses - Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi a=
nd Maha Saraswati, respectively. In fact, durga saptashati or chandipath co=
ntains three parts for the three goddesses, in the same order. The Adi Shak=
ti (primordial energy) that creates, sustains and destroys the universe is =
the sum total of these three goddesses. Some call Her Narayani or Aadyaadi =
Sri Mahaalakshmi; some call her Chandi; some call her Aadi Paraashakti; and=
, some call her by some other names. But names are secondary.
 
The rik is =
saying that the god of Fire manifests in all of us as the powers that cause=
 desire, knowledge and actions. Fire is not just physical fire that we can =
see with eyes. Fire is essentially an energy that transforms one thing into=
 another. For example, fire in our belly takes in various food items and tr=
ansforms them into things our body can use. Fire in the brain takes in vari=
ous sensory inputs and transforms them into various experiences in the brai=
n. Like this, different kinds of fire transform different objects into some=
 other objects. There are many kinds of fires mentioned in various texts.
 =

The rik is saying that Fire manifests in 3 basic subtle forms - as the fir=
e that transforms the quality of tamas in us into desires, as the fire that=
 transforms the quality of sattwa in us into knowledge, and as the fire tha=
t transforms the quality of rajas in us into actions. Fire manifests as des=
ires, knowledge and actions.
 
*        *        *
 
In the veda mantra of =
Mars also, the same word "ap" comes. It says "apaaM retaaMsi jinvati". This=
 is translated by many as "promotes semens in waters". However, I believe t=
his means "incites force and energy in actions". Anyway, I will write about=
 Mars mantra later.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
 
PS: I stopped posting to si=
vacharya yahoogroup and restricting my posts to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup the=
se days, in order to not spam a list dedicated to Saiva agamas with my writ=
ings on generic spiritual knowledge. But this post may be interesting and I=
 am sending it to sivacharya too.

Dear Nara=
simhaji
 
I was trying to read Sri Aurobindos translation of the mystic fir=
e 
hymns from the Vedas. One of the riks is as follows:
 
divas pari pratha=
maṃ jaj=F1e aghnirasmad dvitīyaṃ parijātavedā=
717; | 
tṛtīyamapsu nṛmaṇā ajasramindhāna =
enaṃjarate svādhīḥ || 
 
Translation done by Sri Auro=
bindo:
 
10th Mandal SUKTA 45
 
 
1. Above heaven was the first birth of th=
e Fire, over us was his 
second birth as the knower of all things born, his=
 third birth was 
in the waters, a god-mind; him continuously one kindles a=
nd with 
one's thought perfectly fixed on him adores.
 
http://www.mountain=
man.com.au/rghmf_09.htm]
 
Sir, when you have time could you kindly deliber=
ate of the possible 
meaning of the above verse/translation.
 
Thanks for a=
ll your efforts.
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi
