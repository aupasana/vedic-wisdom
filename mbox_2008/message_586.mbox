Namaste Rajarshi,

When faced with any such situation ... important point .=
.. never
nerver abandon your Homa!! You actually have taken a samkalpam
(vo=
w/resolution) that you will do the homa (homakarma karishye) ... so
never e=
ver abandon it!!

Secondly, these things happen early on in our attempts. A=
s one gains
experience, it becomes easy to maintain the fire. In such situa=
tions
as you mentioned, I keep camphor handy. Usually, powedering the
camph=
or and sprinkling will rejuvenate the fire due to the embers,
else, light t=
he camphor capsule using the deepa and offer it in the
homa kundam.

Proble=
m Solved ... move ahead with your Homa and complete it.

Regards
-Narayan-
