Came across this incident regarding Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharishi and 
Ganap=
ati Muni. Anyone who has ever tried even a minutest fraction of 
sadhana no=
t to gain a better happy life but to get that one small 
fraction of an inc=
h closer to God will know the millions of troubles 
and frustation that com=
e in the path. It was on one such moment when 
I came across this writing a=
nd felt humbled. Ganapati Muni was known 
as a siddha who had done terrific=
, i repeat terrific amount of 
penances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maha=
rishi. If such a man 
could be troubled by doubts and frustation, what to s=
peak of us 
ordinary men whos minds are overcrowded with multiple weaknesse=
ss. 
Also the followinf conversation shows how a real understanding of 
the=
 shastra is possible ONLY for a man who is that spiritually 
elevated. Like=
 Lahiri Mahasaya used to say to his disciples, only a 
true yogi will under=
stand the spriptures. Others will only get a 
incomplete surface view of th=
ings. And based on our incomplete 
inefficient understand of shatras we kee=
p fighting with others 
claiming our path our tradition our understading is=
 the only true 
one.

"Ganapati Muni had met the yet-to-be-called Sri Raman=
a on the 
southern slopes of Arunachala. One day he was assailed by pains, =

troubles, doubts. He remembered that the young Swami was on the 
hill, and=
 at midday, a little after noon, he climbed and found him 
sitting outside =
Virupaksha cave, alone. He prostrated and said, "All 
the scriptures that h=
ave to be read, I have read. All the mantras 
and japa that have to be done=
, I have done. Still I have no peace. 
Please save me." The young Swami too=
k a little time. For at least 
fifteen minutes he silently gazed at him. Th=
en in Tamil, he spoke. 
The English translation is simple:

"If one watches=
 whence the notion 'I' arises, the mind is absorbed 
in That; that is tapas=
. When you recite a mantra, watch where the 
sound is coming from, within y=
ou; when you sing a song or prayer, 
watch where it is emanating from: your=
 Heart. Put your attention on 
That. That is tyaga, that is TAPASYA, that i=
s all." 
All his doubts and delusions were washed away that day. "
