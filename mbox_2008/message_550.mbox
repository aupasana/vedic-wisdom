Dear Members

I have heard the two following verses from various sources an=
d they 
are quite famous too!

"Sarve bhavantu sukhina, sarve santu niramay=
a,
sarve bhadrani pashayantu, maa kashchid-dukhabhavbhaveta!" 

And Vasudiv=
a Kutumvakam 

Which scriptures mention these two verses, can someone pleas=
e provide 
me the names?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
