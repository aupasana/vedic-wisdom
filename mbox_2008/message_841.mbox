Dear All,

It seems that this issue of doing prayers in Sanskrit or any other regional languages seems to be a recurring theme...we had a similar discussion about this a few years back, regarding chanting of Vishnu Sahasranama...here is an excerpt from that discussion.


"Recently we had a discussion about correct pronounciation and also
about whether to chant in sanskrit or other languages. Here is a good
quote on that:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Some might say that they do not understand the meaning of the
Sanskrit words in the stotram and therefore do not feel comfortable
chanting it. Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswathi Swami has given us his
guidance on this issue in one of his discourses. He advises us that
learning the chanting of prayers even without knowing the meaning is a
worthwhile act, and can be compared to finding a box of treasure
without the key. As long as we have the box, we can open it whenever we
get the key of knowledge later, but the treasure will be already there.
Some could feel that they do not know the correct pronunciation, and
so do not want to chant incorrectly. H. J. Achar, in his book "Sri
Vishnu Sahasranama - A Study", H.J. Achar, Sharada Press, Mangalore, 1972, has given the
analogy of a mother to whom a child goes and asks for an orange. The
child does not know how to pronounce the word "orange", and so asks for
"ange". The mother does not turn away the child and does not refuse to
give the child the orange just because the child does not know how to
pronounce the word. It is the spirit or bhava that matters, and so as
long as one chants the name of God with sincerity, considerations such as not knowing the meaning, not
knowing the pronunciation, etc., do not matter, and God who is the
Mother of all of us will confer His blessings on us."

Namaste,
 
Thinking of the stories of the Mother and 
contemplating on them can help one. However, there are a few other factors to 
consider:
 
(1) Mantras in Sanskrit have been meditated upon by 
many saints and yogis in the past and their effect on the mind is 
well-understood. A sequence of sounds, when repeated with full mental focus, 
creates a certain energy. Just thinking of the meaning may not create the same 
energy. For example, sounds without any meaning also produce specific energies 
in the mind when we focus on those sounds single-mindedly.
 
(2) The sadhana of so many saints and yogis who 
used the mantras before adds to the power of those Sanskrit 
mantras.
 
This is my opinion: Reading meanings of Chandipath 
is also good and creates positive thoughts. But repeating the Sanskrit mantras 
(even without understanding the meaning) is superior to that! It creates 
well-understood energy in the consciousness.
 
If one carrying a seed does not understand what it 
is for and makes a replica in gold, which in his opinion is better, one is 
losing the basic functionality of the seed. The golden seed may appeal to one as 
it does not get spoiled and looks better to one's senses, but it can never give 
rise to a plant. The original seed, on the other hand, can give rise to a plant 
when one figures out how to germinate it.
 
*        
*        *
 
One or two years back, I wanted to translate 
Chandipath into Hindi or Telugu (my mother tongue) in poetic form or even 
prose form so that people speaking those languages can read it instead of 
Sanskrit verses and understand better what they are reading. But my guru 
(Manish) discouraged me. He said something written by a person like me with a 
dense ego would not have the same power as a Puranic verse. The Sanskrit verses 
of Chandipath were composed by someone with a highly effaced ego and in 
communion with divinity. The same could be said about several sacred writings in 
many religions in many languages. There is something special about words 
composed by saints, yogis and messiahs who were in a very elevated state of 
being, where the individual ego is effaced largely and the mind is filled with 
some divine energy (which is not possible when individual ego occupies the space 
of mind).
 
So Manish told me to wait till I was ready (if 
ever) for such a project. I realized the wisdom in his advice and removed the 
thought of this project from my mind.
 
When Jnaneshwar Maharaj composed Jnaneshwari 
(Marathi translation of Bhagavad Gita in poetic form), he was in a very purified 
state of consciousness. Hence there is divine power in his Marathi words and 
many saints experienced divinity by chanting his Marathi verses. Same with Ram 
Charit Manas by Sant Tulasidas. Those are inspired translations.
 
If one has access only to words spoken by a normal 
person in a language that one can understand, it is better to repeat words 
spoken by an elevated being instead, even if one does not understand the 
meaning.
 
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sir  Narsimhaji,
There are two thinking for Chandipath  chanting.
1. Every verse in Chandipath is a mantra and reading of  Chandipath in Sanskrit is more meaningful to please Goddess and to get desired  results. It is created in Sanskrit and whether we may follow the meaning of  the verses or not, we should read in Sanskrit only if we can read  Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has its vibrations with full of  energy.
2. If we read in Sanskrit, we never involve  ourselves in the 'Lila' of Durga nor we enjoy the story of Janma(Birth) of  different Shakties narrated in Chandipath  (This is only possible for  those who are scholars in Sanskrit and can translate each and every verse  immediately while reading. For others it is simply reading with faith and  devotion.)- Better way is, it should be read in regional language with full  involvement in the 'Lila'. Here we can enjoy the different roles of Shaktis,  fully understand the differnet Births etc. This type of reading makes  Chandipath more meaningful. 
Dear Sir, I request your advice as what is the real way  of chanting Sri Chandipath from these two?
Dr. Ashwin Rawal__.
