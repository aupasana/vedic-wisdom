Dear Narasimha P.V.R. Rao ji,
Namaskar.
Kindly permit me to know that it is=
 permissible for ladies to do Sri 
Chakra pooja. One elder member of my fam=
ily told that it is not 
permissible and supported by a priest, hence this =
request for further 
clarification please.
With respects.
Yours Sincerely,
=
S.Dheenadayalan
