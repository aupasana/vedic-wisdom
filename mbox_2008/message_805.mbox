Namaste,

i found another link, wherein Thakur's reincarnation is touched u=
pon 
briefly by a questioner.
http://www.ramakrishnamath.in/pages/q_and_a/9=
.html


Question: Thank you for your valuable reply. I have another doubt 
=
sir and I hope you can clear it. I have been reading the book-They 
lived w=
ith God by Swami Chetanananda. In that book in the chapter 
related to Sri =
Ramakrishna's niece (Lakshmi) if I am not mistaken he 
says that he will be=
 born again after 100 years and the Holy Mother 
and his neice will be born=
 along with him. As 100 years are already 
finish is it possible that Sri R=
amakrishna is already living 
somewhere in some other incarnation. Ho do we=
 recognize or identify 
him? My other doubt is has anyone living at present=
 experienced 
Nirvikalpa Samadhi? How does it feel when we are in that stat=
e? 
Hoping to receive your reply 

Answer: Your observation in the book "Th=
ey lived with God" is 
correct. It is only those who are of the level of an=
 incarnation can 
recognize another incarnation, unless one reveals himself=
. In the 
modern days there is no depth of fake god-men which makes it all =
the 
more difficult to recognize. I feel if we have true devotion to the 
i=
ncarnation of the God as Sri Ramakrishna is sufficient for our 
spiritual p=
rogress, instead of our trying to judge an incarnation 
person. 
Since you =
have come across this statement in the book of Swami 
Chetananandaji, if yo=
u desire you can send your question to him. His 
e-mail address is: vedanta=
stl@....

Spiritually yours,

Utpal
