|| Om Sri Gurubhyo Namah ||

Namaskaar Rajarshi,

64 =3D Total number of Ka=
las
16 =3D Maximum number of Kalas that one can acquire in his physical
man=
ifestation

16/64 =3D 1/4

Manifest Universe =3D 1/4th of Naaraayana =3D Ph=
ysical manifestation of
Naaraayana

There is an interesting parallel here, =
however not sure what to think of
it.

With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Re=
ema.

ng out from a centre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm =
was one layer of the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" plac=
ed at various places on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. <br>> H=
e said these 64 represent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the three =
realms. A man when born in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire =
mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more=
 Kala staying in this physical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.Th=

ama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16 wo=

 <br>> Now this 16/64 is theoritically=C2 the maximum knowledg=

about this, he was also trying to explain to me how these kalas interact wi=
th tattwas, or rather how and in what degree should each tattwa interact wi=
th a person in his system for him to be able to gain mastery of any particu=
lar of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and that b=

his body, it can be ascertained whether he had use and access to tattwas be=
yond the 5 gross "asudha tattwas" of this physical plane of existence. <br>=
