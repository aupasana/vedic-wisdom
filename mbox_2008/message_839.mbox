  Dear Friends
  I encourage everyone who cares about India, USA or any country to read up on GMO seeds. PLease read the article below, if you have any shakti to do anything about it, contact whomever is in power positions in India and let them know they are being duped by Monsanto.
  Also, I would be interested in any astrology quotes and references people have or can dig up in  regards to predicting droughts,famine, blight, and things related to agriculture.
  If anyone cares to do some predicting in agriculture it would be nice.
   
  On another note -The past week everywhere I go I see almost everything in usa is made in china, a communist country that has no regard for individuals, or their suffering, that includes animals of any type.United States is getting increasingly dependant on other countries , often ones like China with a terrible reputation for cruelty, and inhumanity.
  Why is USA laying in bed with a communist country?Just look at how they murder thier own people, they brutalized, horribly tortured and drove the native peoples out of Tibet, using inhuman forms of torture.USA is importing so many food products as well(many of our fruits are from chile-while our own fruit orchards are abandoned), when our own ag land gets turned into houses , or is destroyed by the economy /climate changes.
  What is ahead for us, for everyone? 
  I ask everyone instead of chanting mantras for a new car, or some other mundane issue,
  take some time to meditate and pray/chant for the world, for your neighbor.
  Do SOMETHING for someone else. Do something for world health. 
  If you have money, or a prominant position, use a little of it to try and make some changes in the world around you.
   
  Wishing everyone the best in this new year. Lets stick together, 
  Get wise learning astro and see what we can do with it to affect the world around us.

  Article from anti GMO-
  Battling Monsanto in India
  On November 3rd, the UK�s Daily Mail reported that an astounding 125,000 Indian famers�all duped into borrowing money to plant Monsanto�s genetically engineered Bt cotton seeds and associated chemical sprays�were so desperately in debt when their harvests failed to perform that they took their own lives. The scale of this horror, which has unfolded over the past 3-4 years, is hard to imagine; but it gets worse. Thousands of laborers picking or cleaning the cotton are getting debilitating allergic reactions, and thousands of sheep, goats, cows and buffalo fed Bt cotton plants or seed cakes have died. Other livestock are sick or experiencing reproductive, skin, digestive, or upper respiratory problems. The mainstream Indian press has been slow to cover the details, and the government�s pro-GM approval committee continues to dismiss numerous regional reports.
  I am in India now, touring and presenting evidence in order to help turn the tide against GMOs. Just before the trip, our funding fell through. But the situation was too important to delay, so we decided to book to go forward. As this is not a time when we can tap the strained resources of our general fund, we warmly welcome contributions specifically earmarked for this effort. Simply send the donation as described above, and also send an email to info@... letting us know that we should use your donation for the India trip.
  Wishing you a healthy, non-GMO new year.
  Safe eating,
  Jeffrey
