Namaste Aparajita ji & Reema ji,


My 2 cents is that we should stick to Co=
pper, Silver or Golf. However,
Gold & Silver are very expensive and hence C=
opper is good for all
practical purposes.

Homa is signified by Agni Tattva=
 which in astrology is signified by
Sun/Mars. Copper is signified by Sun an=
d I guess copper-ore by Mars,
and hence is very apt for Homa.

Iron on the =
other hand is signified by Saturn and is not friendly with
Sun/Mars. So I w=
ould never use Iron. It is said that bracelets made of
iron/steel (Saturn) =
prevent people from being possessed by certain
low-class of spirits, but it=
 also dulls the mind considerably!

I too have seen Iron Homa Kundam, and i=
nvariable it is very big and
sold/leased by people who arrange marriagess o=
r where you want to do a
reasonable big homa and when you want to avoid cre=
ating your own
kundam with bricks etc.

My suggestion ... Copper is the bes=
t!

Narasimha may add more.

Thanks
-Narayan-
