Please check the website below. Actually books were written in telugu=

If you have time and you are in India, please don't miss these great 
jn=

livi=
ng yogis.
 Remember, Nowadays, it is very difficult to see a living 
jnani.=
 So please don't miss the opportunity to visit them.

I read a story from d=
huniwala dada's life in one of the books I 
couldn't recall. 
Once a old la=
dy begger came to Dhuniwala's ashram. Then dada send her 
out with so much =
anger and hate. His pupil asked him why he was very 
angry on her. Then dad=
a told them that she killed a saint in her past 
life. So she has to has 7 =
more lifes(incarnations) like that. Just 
because she visited the ashram, s=
ome of her sins were burnt, and 6 more 
lifes would be enough to burn her s=
ins.

Visiting living saints is a great opportunity. They never care about =

anything in the earth and don't judge them by their appearance too.
