Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Thank you for that wonderful explanation. I have ne=
ver done anything of that sort, neither do I plan to do. I was just curious=
 since a lot of people when the hear that I pray to Bhairava, assume by def=
ault that I use alcohol. 
What you said makes perfect sense.

Namaste,

Taamasik stuff like alcohol, meat, chillies etc should never b=
e put in homam 
fire.

The type of fire used in homam is jaatavedas (omnisc=
ient) or havyavaaha (one 
who carries offerings to various gods). That fire=
 can carry various 
auspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT =
like to carry stuff 
like alcohol and meat, even if a deity is willing to r=
eceive the offering. 
If you want to offer alcohol to a deity such as Bhair=
ava, call the deity in 
an idol or a kalasha (pot) or in an animal and then=
 make the offering of 
alcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offer=
ing.

Another type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha (c=
arrier 
of impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restrictions.=
 However, 
this fire is not used in homam.

A few deities such as Smashaana=
 Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped 
on a funeral pyre with any m=
aterials. However, such rituals are not 
appropriate for 99.99999999% peopl=
e. Those are only for people who already 
have a very high level of detachm=
ent and a very low level of distinction 
between the polarities of duality,=
 i.e. people who have a very low level of 
mental distinction between thing=
s normally considered highly pure and things 
normally considered highly im=
pure and see all as One. As a result of their 
worship on funeral pyre, the=
y may get results that are normally considered 
good or results that are no=
rmally considered terrible, but again their 
mental distinction between goo=
d and bad results is very low and they accept 
all results with an equal vi=
sion. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are 
aimed at honing their detachme=
nt and non-distinction to further perfection.

Such aghora practices are no=
t to be done out of "fascination" or because 
they seem or sound "cool". Th=
at is a formula for failure and disaster. For 
the majority of us who are s=
till deeply affected by the polarities of 
duality and cannot see all thing=
s equally, worship of any deity in funeral 
pyre is a strict no-no. Stick t=
o regular homam and maintain basic purity, no 
matter which deity you worsh=
ip in the fire. In that case, throwing chillies, 
meat and alcohol in fire =
is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people do 
not realize it and throw =
these things in their homam fire. This is a 
terrible thing to do.

People =
in this age foolishly mix up principles of duality and non-duality. 
Princi=
ples of non-duality like "all is god" are applicable only if you can 
see g=
od in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and 
pain=
 are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the other, then 
y=
ou are immersed in duality and follow the principles of duality without 
mi=
xing up non-dual principles and pretending "all is god". All is NOT god 
fo=
r you then.

Offering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrib=
le results to 
one. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience =
the results 
immediately, but most people do not experience right away. As =
a result, they 
do not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My hum=
ble request to 
everybody who performs homam is to stay away from using suc=
h taamasik 
materials.

Best regards,
Narasimha
