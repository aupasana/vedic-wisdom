Utpalji, thank you very much. You have given me clear thought. I was also o=
f the same openion that these Stotras should not be compulsory. If we have =
time and if we wish to do it with joy, it is ok, but some weak minded or go=
dfearing devotees will surely think that=C2=A0if=C2=A0they do not do it, so=
mething bad will happen.=C2=A0The entire book reading with all stotras invo=
lve much time so sometime we do not do this Chandi Path on regular basis.=
=C2=A0=C2=A0

Namaste Ashw=
in Bhai,

The head priest of Kali Temple in Chennai, when met me, asked abo=
ut 
how i am reciting chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati). I told him that i 
t=
ry to follow conventional instructions given in the book i.e 13 
chapters w=
ith Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi & Ratri Sukta, Nyas, 3 
rasyas and Kshma Prar=
thana at the end.

He told me that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa etc... at th=
e begining 
and then continues reciting 13 chapters every day. THE IMPORTAN=
T 
thing here is that He only indicated me his way of recitation, he 
NEVER=
 asked me to do the same way or change the conventional way.

I need to giv=
e one background. for many years i wonder about 
*Mahatmya* in many fo our =
spiriual books. take for instance Gita. it 
is indicated that Gita Mahatmya=
 must be recited whenever Gita is 
recited and without that it'll not be co=
mplete. Ganapati 
Atharvashirsh also has added protion of the same. Durga S=
aptashati 
also says that if you don't recite this, this & this then the wh=
ole 
chandi paath is like fruitless.

i am not able to reconcile with all t=
hese. IT gives a impression of 
injecting Fear. It is simply Dogmatic. If y=
ou don't do this then 
your efforts are wasted but if you do this along wit=
h the main thing 
then it'll bring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoyment of Swar=
ga and even 
liberation.

I am at loss to understand these extra things. it=
 seems to me that 
it is a Ancient days Marketing gimmick added NOT by the =
original 
author but some others at later stages. it is quite possible that=
 it 
was introduced everywhere out of good intentions to make people 
recit=
e it and get benefited. BUT these things have a danger of 
creating religio=
us Fanatics.

Due to the above written feelings, i welcomed the way of the =
head 
priest and now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Paath since 
la=
st few recitation. my intentions are to avoid all the added things 
which g=
lorifies the Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or 
Intimadate with bad re=
sults)

i think it was off the track.

before i finish, must say that the s=
ounds with which i do are Aim, 
Hreem, Kleem 

Yours,

utpal

the correct choice, as many people in addition to 
Narayan are able to do h=
omam using the manual now! I and many other 
people have benefited (and wil=

concerned, all this started for Nar=

Narayan to start doing homam, many people acros=

with him. What a fortunate soul..

also hurried more. Because the only

 I took my sweet time, arrived 
at the correct balance and also wrote it do=

really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, =

it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would

decided to spend a whole 
day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the com=

inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched=
 on to it. 
When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I =

started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 
breaks of=
 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch 
and another 10 m=

day.

Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). I=

auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sa=

is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I=
 had not 
noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was =

excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days 
later=
, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell 
you because=
 knowing it would've distracted you. You would have been 
excited at doing =
the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement 
would've changed the m=

sadhana."
> 
> He was absolute=
ly right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a 
sadhana. The ego and prid=
e brought rajas and limited the mental 
focus on the mantra. If I was aware=
 that I was doing this sadhana on 
a powerful day, it would've increased th=
e pride and excitement, 
brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on=
 mantra further. 
Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes exce=
llent 
progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing 
M=

food!

astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual

 etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities 
and find True=
 Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you 
really need yet anot=

what he said may very well=

 Durga Saptashati <BR>also say=

paath is like fruitless.<BR><BR>i am not able to reconcile with all these. =

ppeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata <BR>Chandi ho=
mam, to spread the practice of regular homam around the <BR>world. However,=
 Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much <BR>later. All he tol=
d me at that time was that Narayan really needed to <BR>do homam everyday a=
nd that I should teach a simple procedure to him.<BR>> <BR>> I experi=
mented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked <BR>it. I started d=
oing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily <BR>for a few months,=
 I finally got down to the original task - teaching <BR>Narayan. I chose to=
 write a detailed manual for that purpose. In <BR>hindsight, I made the cor=
rect choice, as many people in addition to <BR>Narayan are able to do homam=
 using the manual now! I and
 many other <BR>people have benefited (and wil=
l benefit). However, as far as my mind <BR>concerned, all this started for =
Narayan! When it was time for <BR>Narayan to start doing homam, many people=
 across the world started <BR>with him. What a fortunate soul..<BR>> <BR=
>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> It was probably for a reason that Manish did n=
ot tell me at the <BR>onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My atti=
tude and mental <BR>state would've been different while working on the manu=
al. I <BR>would've been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the on=
ly <BR>thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived=
 <BR>at the correct balance and also wrote it down without many <BR>pretens=
ions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I <BR>really benefi=
ted from the exercise. If I had known the full story, <BR>it would have had=
 more rajas given my mental state then and I would <BR>not have had made th=
e same progress I
 made, while preparing myself <BR>to teach homam to Naray=
an.<BR>> <BR>> Manish told me the full story only when I was better p=
repared to <BR>handle the information and, of course, I added it to the pre=
face of <BR>the manual as asked by him then.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>>=
 <BR>> A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that <=
BR>can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole <BR>=
day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The <BR>inspi=
ration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. <BR>When I t=
old Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I <BR>started before s=
unrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 <BR>breaks of 2 min, a 20 m=
in break at noon for bath and a small lunch <BR>and another 10 min break fo=
r another bath at dusk, I was basically <BR>sitting in the same place and m=
editating
 with Gayatri mantra. It was <BR>a very good experience. I was in=
 a very nice state at the end of the <BR>day.<BR>> <BR>> I noticed on=
 the next day that the previous day was Akshaya <BR>Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukl=
a Triteeya). It is considered a very <BR>auspicious day and it is believed =
that spiritual sadhana on that day <BR>is 1000 times more powerful than on =
other days. Though I had not <BR>noticed it before, I picked a perfect day =
for the sadhana. I was <BR>excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with ex=
citement a few days <BR>later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. Bu=
t I did not tell <BR>you because knowing it would've distracted you. You wo=
uld have been <BR>excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that=
 excitement <BR>would've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas in=
to the <BR>sadhana."<BR>> <BR>> He was absolutely right. As such, I w=
as "proud" of doing such a <BR>sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and=

 limited the mental <BR>focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doi=
ng this sadhana on <BR>a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and =
excitement, <BR>brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra f=
urther. <BR>Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent =
<BR>progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing <BR>M=
anish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive <BR>and=
 kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious <BR>food!<=
BR>> <BR>> Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell the=
m what <BR>is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have=
 a <BR>guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and =
<BR>point it out, so that they can weed it out through further <BR>introspe=
ction and weaken it through conscious effort.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>>=
; <BR>> I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata
 chandi <=
BR>homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha <BR>(=
a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the <BR>name=
 of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and <BR>that I =
would do some important work in this birth.<BR>> <BR>> When I saw Man=
ish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He <BR>immediately became seri=
ous and said "Narasimha, do you need one more <BR>identity? Your ego is alr=
eady strong with the identity <BR>of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Na=
rasimha, the <BR>astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the sp=
iritual <BR>seeker' etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identi=
ties <BR>and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you=
 <BR>really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, <B=
R>what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your <BR>=
progress. You have to rise above all identities."<BR>>
 <BR>> How tru=
e and wise!<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Just as a fat and might=
y dog may win over a lean and weak dog and <BR>get all the food given by th=
e master, ahamkara (ego or the sense <BR>of "I") within us wins over the sp=
irit of detachment and gets all <BR>the energy possible. Just as a good mas=
ter may chain the fat dog and <BR>feed the lean dog specially, we too must =
consciously try to restrain <BR>ego and increase detachment.<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple <BR>points =
he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my <BR>spiritual=
 evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific <BR>mantra to me,=
 like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of <BR>knowledge in my heart=
. He would say the lamp and light were already <BR>there and he simply wipe=
d the dust on the lamp that was blocking the <BR>light. That is what a good=
 guru does. He/She wipes off the thick <BR>layer of
 dirt (conditioning by =
gunas) on the glass (ego) that <BR>encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in =
the heart. Sometimes, we may <BR>be too caught up to notice that dirt ourse=
lves..<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Homam and other spiritual sa=
dhana tools are very helpful. But one <BR>should also try to introspect and=
 change one's thinking, on an <BR>ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. Fo=
r most people, this does <BR>not take just a single moment or day or month =
or year. It CAN take a <BR>long time. As Narayan indicated, one should star=
t walking on the <BR>path and not worry about the progress and the distance=
 left. One who <BR>keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.<=
BR>> <BR>> The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals=
 (like <BR>homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) shoul=
d go <BR>hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them an=
d <BR>they will start to work together very
 effectively.<BR>> <BR>> =
