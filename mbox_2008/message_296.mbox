7 May 2008 10:19:28 -0400Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Akshaya Triteeya and Rishi=
 Panchami



Namaste friends,
 
Today is Akshaya Triteeya - the 3rd tithi (=
lunar day) in the sukla paksha (waxing fortnight) of the lunar month of Vai=
sakha. This is supposed to be the day when Ganga came to earth. This is the=
 day when Parasurama was born. This is the day when Treta yuga started. Tod=
ay is supposed to be a very auspicious day.
 
Any prayer or meditation or h=
omam or spiritual practice performed today is supposed to be many times mor=
e powerful than on any normal day. Akshaya literally means "imperishable", =
i.e. in large supply. The fruits of spiritual karmas of today will be very =
large and that is why the name "akshaya".
 
In fact, the next 12 days are v=
ery auspicious for spiritual practices. It is believed that some divine ene=
rgy hovers above earth during this time and prayers can yield results faste=
r. The 5th tithi (panchami), which starts tomorrow afternoon and goes into =
Thursday, is known as Rishi Panchami and is a good day.
 
I am sharing the =
information so anybody interested may take advantage of Akshaya Triteeya 
 =
