Namaste Dear Members,

   Wonderful greetings on the occasion of Dussehra,=
 and may we all
receive her divine grace to help us in progress of our sadh=
ana.

    During these navaratris I got a chance to prepare Devi Shaptashat=
i
with Translation in PDF format and I completed the same yesterday and
upl=
oaded the file to the groups files area, most of this material is
available=
 on internet what all I have done is to get the sacred
scripture at one pla=
ce with Translation and Transliteration in a easily
readable format.

   Pl=
ease forgive for any mistakes and expecting suggestions for
improvement.
