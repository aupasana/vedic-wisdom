Dear Members,

Following is the Inner Meaning of Devi Mahatmya explained by=
 Shri 
Devadatta Kali. It really worth to go thro' the complete article. 
v=
ery good one.

Spiritually Yours,

THE MESSAGE OF THE CHANDI 
B=
y Devadatta Kali 

This month's reading is from a lecture given at the Veda=
nta temple 
in Hollywood, on November 10th 2002. Devadatta Kali has been cl=
osely 
associated with the Vedanta Society since 1966. A regular 
contribut=
or to Vedanta journals throughout the world, the author's 
book Chandi, In =
Praise of the Goddess: The Devimahatmya and Its 
Meaning, is due to be publ=
ished by Nicholas-Hays in December, 2003.



In The Gospel of Sri Ramakrish=
na, M[ahendranath Gupta] records a 
Sunday afternoon with some visitors to =
Dakshineswar in the winter of 
1883. One of the visitors was well versed in=
 the shastras [the 
sacred Hindu scriptures], and the conversation caused M=
. to fall 
into a pensive mood. Having some knowledge of Vedanta, he later =

asked Sri Ramakrishna, "Is the world unreal?"

"Why should it be unreal?" =
Sri Ramakrishna responded. "What you are 
asking is a matter for philosophi=
cal discussion." Later that evening 
Ramakrishna returned to M.'s question =
and asked him again, "Why 
should the universe be unreal?" He continued, "T=
he Divine Mother 
revealed to me in the Kali temple that it was She who had=
 become 
everything. She showed me that everything was full of Consciousnes=
s. 
The image =85, the altar =85, the water-vessels =85, the door-sill =85,=
 the 
marble floor =85=97all was Consciousness.

"I found everything inside=
 the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss=97the 
Bliss of Satchidananda. I saw=
 a wicked man in front of the Kali 
temple, but in him I also saw the Power=
 of the Divine Mother 
vibrating. "That is why I fed a cat with the food th=
at was to be 
offered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived that the Di=
vine 
Mother Herself had become everything (M., 345-346)."

On many other o=
ccasions, M. recorded similar teachings, and on one 
point Sri Ramakrishna =
was particularly emphatic. "=85 Brahman and 
Shakti are identical. If you a=
ccept one, you must accept the other. 
=85 You cannot conceive of the sun's=
 rays without the sun, nor can you 
conceive of the sun without its rays. =
=85 One cannot think of the 
Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relat=
ive without the 
Absolute (M., 134)."

Another time Sri Ramakrishna said: "=
That which is Brahman is also 
Kali, the Mother, the Primal Energy. When in=
active It is called 
Brahman. Again, when creating, preserving and destroyi=
ng, It is 
called Shakti. Still water is an illustration of Brahman. The sa=
me 
water, moving in waves, may be compared to Shakti, Kali (M., 634-
635).=
" "Water is water, whether it moves or is still (M., 835)." 

These are con=
sistent teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, spoken from his 
own experience, but =
they are not the teachings of Sankara's Vedanta. 
Without question, Ramakri=
shna was well versed in Vedantic teaching. 
We know that toward the end of =
1865, he took initiation from an 
austere monk named Tota Puri, practiced t=
he disciplines of Sankara's 
Advaita Vedanta and in a short while attained =
nirvikalpa samadhi, 
the realization of nondual consciousness. But four yea=
rs earlier 
Ramakrishna had undergone an intensive course of Tantric sadhan=
a, 
taught to him by an itinerant holy woman known as the Bhairavi. She 
wa=
s a Shakta, a worshiper of the Divine Mother. 

Nor was this Sri Ramakrishn=
a's first exposure to Shakta teachings. 
Earlier still, at the age of 19, w=
hen the young Ramakrishna agreed 
to be employed as a priest at the Dakshin=
eswar Kali temple, he was 
trained by his older brother Ramkumar in the Mot=
her's worship and in 
the recitation of the Chandi, the great scripture on =
the Divine 
Mother (Saradananda, 133-134). 

The Chandi declares that the M=
other is the supreme reality and that 
she herself has become this universe=
. We do not know who composed 
the Chandi, only that its author or authors =
created the most widely 
known and most sacred of all Shakta texts about si=
xteen hundred 
years ago. Some of the traditions preserved in the Chandi ar=
e 
inconceivably older. We know from the evidence of archeology that 
some =
of the Chandi's ideas on the Motherhood of God go back six 
thousand years =
or more. Votive statues that survive from neolithic 
India and Pakistan por=
tray a goddess in two different aspects: 
either as a nurturing mother with=
 hand held to breast, or as a 
hooded, deathlike figure. 

This dual distin=
ction of the Divine Mother in auspicious and 
terrible forms is an enduring=
 feature throughout the history of 
Indian religion and survives to this ve=
ry day. Throughout the ages 
the tribal cultures and high civilizations tha=
t rose and fell on 
Indian soil left their mark on the 13 chapters of the C=
handi. 
Prominent among the many and diverse influences is the Devisukta, a=
 
hymn of eight verses found in the most ancient Hindu sacred text, 
the Ri=
g Veda. 

The Devisukta (RV 10.125) declares that the Goddess is the power =

expressed through all the gods, that they are united in her who 
shines wi=
th consciousness, that her presence is all-pervading, that 
she supports al=
l of creation, that she is the source of 
righteousness and the revealer of=
 truth, that she is the source of 
all worlds, yet that she shines transcen=
dent beyond them. Among 
Shaktas this Vedic hymn is held in high esteem and=
 is considered to 
be the source from which the entire Chandi sprang. Later=
, the Chandi 
itself was elaborated upon in the Puranas and Tantras. Still =
later 
its imagery inspired the Bengali mystics, Ramprasad and Kamalakanta,=
 
whose devotional songs so often evoked ecstatic moods in Sri 
Ramakrishna=
. 

The Chandi goes by two other names. The most common and widely 
recogni=
zed is Devimahatmya [The Glory of the Goddess]. The other is 
Sri Durga Sap=
tashati [Seven Hundred Verses to Sri Durga]. In reality 
the Chandi contain=
s fewer than 700 verses, and the number 700 is 
arrived at only through cre=
ative means, such as counting a half 
verse as full or a full verse as thre=
e. There must be a good reason 
for this, and indeed there is. 

The author=
 or authors of the Chandi were Shaktas, devotees of the 
Mother, and they w=
anted their work to be recognized as comparable to 
the Vaishnavas' great s=
cripture, the Bhagavad Gita, which consists 
of 700 verses. They wanted to =
show that their view of God as Mother 
was as valid as the Vaishnava view o=
f Krishna as the supreme God. Of 
course, both texts represent ancient trad=
itions, and even the oldest 
Hindu scripture, the Rig Veda, proclaims: ekam=
 sat vipra bahuda 
vadanti=97"Truth is One, the wise call it by various nam=
es." Many 
centuries later, Sri Ramakrishna taught the same when he 
said: =
"Krishna is none other than Satchidananda, the Indivisible 
Brahman. =85 Th=
at which is Brahman is also Kali. =85 He who is Krishna 
is the same as Kal=
i (M., 1012)." 

In drawing comparison to the Bhagavad Gita, the authors of=
 the 
Chandi wanted specifically to emphasize the Divine Mother's role, 
li=
ke Krishna's, in upholding the moral order of the universe and in 
leading =
humankind to liberation through the highest knowledge of the 
Self. The Cha=
ndi and the Gita have much else in common. Each is an 
independent text emb=
edded in a larger work. The Gita belongs to the 
Mahabharata; the Chandi is=
 an interpolation in the Markandeya 
Purana. Each is a synthesis of spiritu=
al and philosophical knowledge 
drawn from diverse sources. Each begins wit=
h the story of one or 
more human beings in crisis, who will learn from a t=
eacher in human 
form the way beyond all suffering. And each involves the b=
attlefield 
as a metaphor for the field of human consciousness. 

The Bhaga=
vad Gita begins on the battlefield, with Arjuna surveying 
the armies of hi=
s kinsmen on both sides, arrayed for battle. Plunged 
into despair at the t=
hought of killing his friends and relatives, he 
turns to his charioteer, K=
rishna, who is none other than God in 
human form. Krishna then delivers on=
e of the world's great spiritual 
messages. The Chandi begins with King Sur=
atha, likewise plunged into 
an existential crisis after losing his kingdom=
 in battle. 

A wise and just ruler, Suratha discovers that even his truste=
d 
ministers have turned against him, and on the pretext of going 
hunting,=
 he mounts his horse and flees for his life. After riding 
for some time in=
to a dense forest, he comes to the ashram of a holy 
man named Medhas. This=
 forest retreat is a place of great calm and 
natural beauty, where even th=
e ordinarily ferocious tiger abides 
peacefully with the gentle deer. Yet S=
uratha knows no peace. His 
mind churns in agony at the thought of everythi=
ng he has lost: his 
kingdom with its riches and privilege, the loyalty of =
his subjects, 
the glory of power. These thoughts torment him ceaselessly. =


One day another visitor arrives. His name is Samadhi, and he is 
every bi=
t as despondent as the king. Once a prosperous merchant, he 
has been cast =
out by his wife and sons, who seized his wealth out of 
greed. He is deeply=
 hurt by their betrayal and cannot understand it, 
being himself a man of g=
ood character. Most of all, he cannot 
understand why he still feels love f=
or those who caused his deep 
humiliation and pain. And so, the king and th=
e merchant approach 
Medhas the seer and ask why they are so miserable. Sur=
ely, as men of 
knowledge they ought to know better, but they are deeply pe=
rplexed. 

"You say you are men of knowledge," Medhas remarks. "Do you know=
 
what knowledge is?" He explains that what the king means by 
knowledge is=
 only the experience of the objective world. Through the 
senses, men, bird=
s and beasts alike share such a knowledge, each 
species according to its o=
wn capacity. Such knowledge is relative. 
In every way, the knowledge gaine=
d through the senses is conditioned 
by time and space, and we are constant=
ly deceived. Medhas explains 
further that animals act out of instinct; but=
 humans have the added 
capacity to reason and make choices, although such =
choices are most 
often driven by self-interest and the expectation of resu=
lts. 

If even our simple sense perceptions are so misleading, how much 
mo=
re confounded are we by the added factors of reason, will, memory, 
emotion=
 and expectation? The operative principle here is that 
nothing in this wor=
ld is as it seems to be. Not only are the king 
and the merchant perplexed,=
 Medhas explains, everyone is, because 
even the wise are thrown into the w=
hirlpool of delusion by the 
blessed goddess Mahamaya. "Who is this Mahamay=
a?" the king 
asks. "Whatever there is to know about her, all that I wish t=
o 
learn." 

And so we arrive at the heart of the Chandi. The story of the =
king, 
the merchant and the seer acts as a frame that encloses three 
addit=
ional stories which Medhas relates to instruct his two 
disciples. Each sto=
ry is a mythical account of the Divine Mother's 
fierce, bloody battles wit=
h demons. Now, we must not dismiss a myth 
as a piece of fiction merely bec=
ause it does not describe a 
historical event or the world as we know it. I=
nstead, a myth takes 
us beyond the realm of fact and into the realm of mea=
ning. Through 
symbols, it plumbs our deeper levels of understanding and br=
ings to 
light elusive truths that are difficult to convey by ordinary mean=
s. 

The Platonic philosopher Synesius of Cyrene summed it up in a single 
=
sentence: "Myths are things that never happened, but always are 
(Greer, 45=
)." The Chandi is an allegory. Its battlegrounds represent 
our own human c=
onsciousness, and its events symbolize our own 
experiences. The demons rep=
resent all the evils in the world and all 
that is wrong within our minds a=
nd hearts. The Divine Mother is our 
own true being, and her clashes with t=
he demons symbolize the 
outward and inward struggles we face daily. 

Beca=
use there are three myths, the Chandi naturally falls into three 
parts, an=
d they can be related to the three gunas, the basic 
universal energies or =
qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. The 
first part tells about the Divin=
e Mother in her dark, deluding 
aspect that ensnares humankind in the bonds=
 of ignorance and 
attachment. It teaches us about the nature of reality an=
d asks us to 
question: what are divinity, the universe and humankind? 

Th=
e second part presents the Mother as the fiery and active power 
that vanqu=
ishes evil and upholds the moral order of the universe. It 
teaches us how =
to live in this world, where we are torn between good 
and evil, right and =
wrong, enjoyment and suffering. 

The third part reveals the luminous, bene=
volent form through which 
the Mother grants enlightenment and liberation. =
It shows us how to 
transcend the world through the higher knowledge of the=
 spirit. Side 
by side with grisly narratives of bloodshed and slaughter, t=
he 
Chandi integrates four hymns that are rich in philosophical and 
theolo=
gical content. Of surpassing beauty, these hymns are sublime 
outpourings o=
f devotion. The variety of material in the Chandi is a 
convenient reminder=
 that overall this text can be approached in more 
than one way. Its storie=
s can be taken as allegories relating to our 
own behavior and circumstance=
s. Its hymns inspire us to devotion for 
the personal forms of God as Mothe=
r; and its deeper, philosophical 
and esoteric interpretation leads us to t=
he realization of God as 
the impersonal supreme reality. 

Medhas's first =
myth is short and to the point. During a period of 
cosmic dissolution, Vis=
hnu lies sleeping on the thousand-headed 
serpent Shesha, who drifts on the=
 waters of the undifferentiated 
ocean. Sitting on a lotus that grows from =
Vishnu's navel, Brahma, 
the Lord of Creation, surveys the four directions.=
 Suddenly two 
demons, named Madhu and Kaitabha, spring forth from the wax =
in 
Vishnu's ears and attempt to kill Brahma. Frantically he tries to 
awak=
en Vishnu, but the god is held in the power of Mahamaya, who is 
settled ov=
er his eyes as his blessed sleep. 

And so Brahma praises Mahamaya with a h=
ymn. She allows Vishnu to 
awaken, and he battles with the demons for 5000 =
years, but without 
victory. At this point Mahamaya intervenes again. She c=
onfounds 
Madhu and Kaitabha with delusions of their own might and grandeur=
. 
Look at us, the demons think. Not even Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, can 
co=
nquer us. Because he has fought so well, let us offer him a boon. 
These bi=
g, lumbering demons are comical in their stupidity, and at 
this point we c=
an almost hear them gasp, "Oops! Did we make a 
mistake?" 

Of course they =
did, because Vishnu replies, "There is only one boon 
to ask: that I destro=
y the two of you here and now." In a last-ditch 
effort to save themselves,=
 Madhu and Kaitabha look around and see 
only the endless cosmic ocean. "Ve=
ry well," they say, "but on one 
condition: slay us where water does not co=
ver the earth." The 
outcome of this story hinges on a pun, because the San=
skrit words 
for "earth" and "thigh" are almost the same. And so, Vishnu li=
fts 
the two demons to his thighs and cuts off their heads. It is said 
tha=
t a pun is the lowest form of humor, and this is fitting, because 
Madhu an=
d Kaitabha represent the lowest form of human awareness, 
densely shrouded =
in ignorance. Their unprovoked attack on Brahma 
reminds us of the senseles=
s violence in our own world, where members 
of one religious or political o=
r ethnic group attack people of other 
groups only because they are differe=
nt. 

Madhu and Kaitabha, in their near-bestial state, recognize no higher =

reality; they are violent, ugly creatures intent on gratifying their 
base=
 instincts, often expressed through the thrill of intimidation 
or brute fo=
rce. In their physical strength they grow exceedingly 
vainglorious. But of=
 course pride goes before a fall, and their own 
arrogance becomes their un=
doing. Through the hymn that Brahma 
addresses to Mahamaya, the universal d=
eluder, we learn much about 
the universe we inhabit. This hymn, the Brahma=
stuti, is composed in 
highly symbolic language that is often difficult to =
interpret, but 
it reveals profound insight into the nature of the cosmos. =
Although 
the ideas are expressed in devotional terms, the concepts are 
sc=
ientific even by today's standards. 

The Brahmastuti tells us that creatio=
n is a process of manifestation 
that flows from the One to the many. The D=
ivine Mother is the 
infinite, nondual consciousness as well as its dynamic=
 creative 
power; and she is ever present throughout all of creation. Befor=
e 
manifestation, she is the bindu, the dimensionless, nonlocalized 
point =
of concentrated shakti that contains within itself all 
possibilities. This=
 sounds very much like the Big Bang theory and 
especially like a recent re=
finement of it, known as the Cosmic 
Inflation theory. This proposes that t=
he entire universe popped out 
of a dimensionless, contentless point and im=
mediately expanded to 
cosmic size in a miraculous way, suggesting the agen=
cy of a higher 
power. 

Let us not forget that the Sanskrit word for "powe=
r" is shakti. 
According to Brahma's hymn, the Divine Mother gives birth to=
 the 
universe, supports it and draws it back into herself in an ever-
repe=
ating cycle, because creation is without an absolute beginning 
or an absol=
ute end. In this process, she who is nondual 
consciousness veils her radia=
nt boundlessness with the limitations 
of time and space, name and form, ca=
use and effect. Through these 
limitations she projects the finite world of=
 our experience=97a world 
that is both dark and dazzling, terrifying and e=
nchanting. 

The Divine Mother is the all-encompassing source of good and e=
vil 
alike, who expresses herself in every form. Yet beyond this apparent 
=
multiplicity, everything=97be it spirit, mind or matter=97is ultimately 
on=
e. Philosophically, the Chandi agrees with Sri Ramakrishna's 
answer to M.'=
s question, "Is the world unreal?" But when Ramakrishna 
first replied that=
 it was a matter for philosophical discussion, he 
recognized that among th=
emselves Hindus hold more than a single 
opinion. A follower of Sankara's A=
dvaita Vedanta would answer, "The 
world seems real as long as we experienc=
e it, but once we attain 
knowledge of Brahman, the phenomenal world vanish=
es. We think we see 
a snake in the semi-darkness, but when the light revea=
ls it to be a 
rope, the perception of the snake vanishes." 

According to =
the Vedantin, the world is no more real than the 
misperceived snake. This =
position is called vivartavada, the 
doctrine of appearance, because the ph=
enomenal world is thought to 
be a mere appearance superimposed upon the tr=
anscendental unity of 
Brahman. The Shakta philosophy takes a different pos=
ition. When 
thread is woven into cloth, it undergoes a change of form but =
not of 
substance. In becoming cloth, thread takes on the additional 
quali=
ties of cloth, but in substance it is still thread. In the same 
way, the D=
ivine Mother, who is pure energy and consciousness, 
assumes all the names =
and forms and characteristics of the creation, 
even while remaining the pu=
re energy and consciousness that is her 
true nature. This view is called p=
arinamavada, the doctrine of 
transformation. 

We find it in the Chandi, w=
here Medhas says of the Divine 
Mother: "She is eternal, having the world a=
s her form (DM 1.64)." 
And also in Sri Ramakrishna's reply to M.: "The Div=
ine Mother 
revealed to me in the Kali temple that it was She who had becom=
e 
everything (M., 345)." There is one more point: whichever way we 
choose=
 to view the world, we still have to live in it. And that is 
what the seco=
nd part of the Chandi is all about. 

Medhas's second story is intended esp=
ecially for the king. Suratha, 
like Arjuna in the Gita, belongs to the rul=
ing and warrior caste, 
whose duty is to uphold the moral order of the worl=
d. In the story 
that Medhas relates, an ill-tempered buffalo demon, named =

Mahishasura, wages war against heaven, casts out the gods, and 
usurps Ind=
ra's throne. When the dispossessed gods seek Vishnu's and 
Shiva's help, th=
e Divine Mother herself comes to the rescue. 

First from Vishnu's brow, th=
en from the bodies of all the other 
gods, a great radiance shines forth an=
d coalesces into the beautiful 
form of Durga. The gods bow to her, recogni=
zing that their own 
individual powers are only aspects of her supreme powe=
r. After Durga 
has slain Mahishasura's forces, she stands on the blood-soa=
ked 
battleground facing the buffalo demon himself. Mahishasura, 
bellowing=
 in confrontation, represents willfulness and monumental 
rage. Under his f=
renzied wheeling, the trampled earth breaks apart, 
his blasting breath tos=
ses mountains into the air, his lashing tail 
causes the oceans to overflow=
, and overhead his mighty horns tear 
the gently floating clouds to shreds.=
 

Consider the symbolism: the power of human anger and greed threatens 
to=
 destroy everything it touches: the goodness of the nurturing 
earth, the s=
tability of the mountains, the expansive beauty of the 
oceans, the innocen=
ce of the gentle clouds. Under Durga's attacks 
Mahisha changes form=97from=
 buffalo to lion to man to elephant, every 
time eluding her deathblows. Bu=
t she resolves to slay him, and when 
Mahisha returns to his mighty buffalo=
 form, she pins him beneath her 
foot and thrusts her spear into his side. =
Instantly Mahisha reveals 
his true demon form, and Durga beheads him with =
her great sword. 

Like Mahisha, we go through life dissatisfied, often agi=
tated, 
sometimes full of rage; and the causes of our misery change over 
t=
ime. One day it's this, the next day it's something else, and so it 
goes. =
Until we can pin down the root cause, our discontent cannot be 
overcome, a=
nd like Mahishasura that cause is loath to reveal itself. 
Mahisha represen=
ts more than monumental rage. His anger is one of 
six passions that afflic=
t our human awareness. The others are lust, 
greed, pride, jealousy and del=
usion. Let's analyze them. Lust, or 
desire in general, is a longing for gr=
atification. We want 
something. Why? Because we feel something is lacking.=
 We feel 
deficient, limited or separated in some way. When we fail to sati=
sfy 
a desire, a common response is anger. Or when a desire is satisfied, 
=
a common response is greed: we want more. And so we're caught in an 
ongoin=
g cycle. To make matters worse, we can add pride and jealousy 
to the mix. =


Let's define pride as a false sense of superiority designed to 
convince =
us we're not deficient after all, but in fact better than 
anyone else. And=
 so we think=97until someone else comes along whom we 
see as richer, more =
powerful, more attractive or happier than we 
are. Then we fall prey to jea=
lousy=97an apprehensive resentment of 
someone else's better condition in l=
ife. All this adds up to 
delusion: we are caught up in a misreading of who=
 and what we really 
are. The Sanskrit word for delusion, moha, comes from =
a root 
meaning "to lose consciousness," and herein lies the key to 
unders=
tanding. 

The Divine Mother is infinite consciousness. When she projects 
=
herself as the universe of name and form, that consciousness appears 
divid=
ed among all beings. This apparent fragmentation creates the 
sense of indi=
viduality. Each individual self experiences its 
existence in terms of "I, =
me and mine," as well as "not-I, not-me 
and not-mine." And so the trouble =
begins. The root cause of our 
inner existential discontent and our outward=
 conflicts is the 
feeling deep down inside that we are limited, separated =
and 
incomplete. We mistakenly identify with the limited ego, when in 
fact=
 we are the limitless atman. That atman, abiding in every 
person, is the t=
rue Self=97the one, undivided reality whose essence is 
pure being-consciou=
sness-bliss. 

Just as Mahishasura is about to be beheaded by Durga's sword=
 of 
knowledge, his glance meets hers, and he gets a fleeting glimpse of 
t=
hat truth=97that his true identity lies dispassionate and blissful 
beyond =
the raging whirlpool of his passions. After he is slain, the 
gods celebrat=
e Durga's triumph over Mahishasura in the longest and 
most eloquent of the=
 Chandi's four hymns. Known as the Shakradistuti 
[Praise by Indra and the =
host of gods], it invites us to reflect on 
the themes of good and evil, fa=
te and free will, karma and divine 
grace. 

The hymn praises Durga as "goo=
d fortune in the dwellings of the 
virtuous and misfortune in the abodes of=
 the wicked (DM 4.5)." On 
the surface, this verse implies reward and punis=
hment by a personal 
deity. The deeper, philosophical meaning points to an =
impersonal 
balancing principle at work in the universe, the law of karma. =

Either way the message is the same: our deeds have consequences. A 
centra=
l theme of the hymn is the question of good and evil. A 
working definition=
 might go like this: good is that which takes us 
toward the Divine=97towar=
d harmony, love and unity; evil is that which 
distances us from the Divine=
 and creates hatred, injury and disunity 
in our lives. 

Additionally, ref=
erring to the fierce battle that has just taken 
place, the hymn asks how M=
ahisha, even though enraged, could be 
moved to strike the Mother's gently =
smiling face. From this we can 
add another dimension to our definition of =
evil: that it is 
intentionally profaning. In the world around us we witnes=
s continual 
assaults on all we hold sacred. War, terrorism, genocide, the =

corruption of the innocent, the logging of irreplaceable forests, 
and the=
 remorseless pollution of the air, water and earth that 
support our very e=
xistence=97what evil moves humans to commit such 
terrible acts? 

Whether =
we are talking about destructive actions, hate-filled 
speech, malevolent t=
houghts or even uncaring passivity, let these be 
a sobering reminder that =
our collective and individual evil is the 
human face of Mahishasura's rage=
. Yet the hymn proclaims that even 
toward evildoers the Mother's intention=
s are most gracious. Her 
nature is to subdue the misconduct of the wicked.=
 Through her 
inconceivable grace, even wrongdoers who have committed enoug=
h evil 
to keep them long in torment are purified in battle by the touch of=
 
her weapons and are brought to beatitude. 

We are reminded once again of=
 the Bhagavadgita. Sri Krishna declares 
that whenever righteousness declin=
es and evil spreads, he is born 
into the world to protect the good, to des=
troy wickedness, and to re-
establish virtue (BG 4.6-8). On the theme of un=
conditional grace, he 
says: "I am alike to all beings; to me none are hate=
ful or dear. =85 
If even an evil-doer worships me with utter devotion, he =
should be 
regarded as good, for he is rightly resolved. Quickly he becomes=
 
righteous and attains eternal peace (BG 9.29-31)." 

The story of Madhu a=
nd Kaitabha was concerned with the power of 
tamas: how in our ordinary sta=
te of being, we all walk around dazed 
and confused. In the story of Durga =
and Mahishasura, the power of 
rajas predominates. Mahishasura's rajasic en=
ergy controls him and 
impels him to destructive acts, but Durga controls h=
er own fiery 
splendor. Her rajas is protective of her devotees and intent =
on 
destroying evil. Through this story Medhas teaches that through 
active=
 struggle, we can overcome enslavement to our passions and 
live virtuously=
, in harmony with the world. 

According to Hindu teaching, life has four l=
egitimate aims. These 
are dharma, artha, kama and moksha=97virtuous conduc=
t, material 
comfort, enjoyment and liberation. The first three form a cate=
gory 
called bhukti, concerned with life in the world. Bhukti is the 
king'=
s immediate concern. Having fled to the forest after his 
defeat, he has fa=
iled to fulfill his moral responsibility, and he 
still feels attraction fo=
r the privileges of kingship. In other 
words, he has unfinished business i=
n the world. 

How different is the merchant Samadhi. World-weary and ready=
 to 
renounce the pursuits of dharma, artha and kama, he is ready for 
moks=
ha, spiritual liberation. For his sake, Medhas tells his third 
and final s=
tory, one that points toward realizing our inner 
perfection beyond the wor=
ld. The story has a familiar beginning. Two 
demons, named Shumbha and Nish=
umbha, have dispossessed the gods, 
stripped them of their powers and appro=
priated their wealth and 
privilege. This time the cast of characters is mu=
ch larger, and the 
demons seem more like us than the ones we've met previo=
usly. 

The complex scenario passes through three phases as we move 
progre=
ssively inward. The Mother's successive victories over a 
colorful cast of =
demons symbolize our own efforts at purifying our 
consciousness of every i=
mperfection and misconceived notion. First 
the myth turns the mirror on ou=
r behavior and motivations. Next we 
are drawn in deeper to observe the min=
d and its workings, and 
finally we face the fundamental question of who or=
 what we are. 

We first meet Shumbha sitting in his palace amid his glitte=
ring 
hoard of stolen treasure. The sickening excess of it all reminds us 
=
of our own materialism run amok. Soon the two fawning servants, 
Chanda and=
 Munda, enter with news that they've seen a young woman of 
captivating bea=
uty dwelling in the Himalayas. Playing upon Shumbha's 
vanity, they suggest=
 that he who is all-wealthy and all-powerful 
surely must also possess this=
 jewel among women. Little do they know 
that she is the Devi, the Divine M=
other herself, in her sattvic 
aspect. In the same way, we are drawn to the=
 world's enchantments 
but forget that they are expressions of the Divine. =
Shumbha, his 
lust aroused, wants to claim her as his own, just as we want =
to 
possess all that we find attractive and desirable. And just like us, 
i=
f one way fails, Shumbha will try another, and another, with 
growing frust=
ration. 

When his smooth-talking messenger, Sugriva, delivers a marriage 
=
proposal, we recognize in him our own lack of complete truthfulness. 
At fi=
rst the Devi plays along with delicious irony, but after she 
refuses the m=
arriage proposal, Sugriva's honeyed words turn 
threatening. If cajoling an=
d deceit don't work, how about force? 
Next, Shumbha sends a dim- witted th=
ug named Dhumralochana to fetch 
the Devi, kicking and screaming if need be=
. In other words, when we 
set our mind to something, how it affects others=
 is not necessarily 
our concern. 

When Dhumralochana's brute force fails,=
 Shumbha loses all reason and 
sends Chanda and Munda with a huge army to b=
ring back "that vile 
woman" in any way or in any condition whatever. Notic=
e how in 
Shumbha's agitated mind "the jewel among women" is now "that vile=
 
woman." What was once so desirable is now the cause of his misery, 
and h=
is desire now is only for the triumph of his own will. Don't we 
also overr=
eact irrationally when circumstances frustrate our 
intentions? The struggl=
e escalates, and the gently smiling Devi 
Durga calls forth the terrifying,=
 emaciated form of Kali and eight 
other fierce goddesses to combat the dem=
on hordes. Each one of these 
shaktis is an aspect of her own immense power=
. Each represents a 
higher function of our own consciousness. 

When Chand=
a and Munda lie dead, a demon named Raktabija strides onto 
the battlefield=
. He possesses a unique power. Whenever a drop of his 
blood falls to earth=
, another demon of identical size and strength 
springs up. In the fighting=
, demons proliferate from his spilled 
blood, and utter terror seizes the g=
ods, until Durga merely smiles 
and tells Kali to roam the battlefield and =
lap up the drops of blood 
as they fall. The demons arising from it soon pe=
rish between her 
gnashing teeth; and Raktabija, drained of blood, falls de=
ad. 

This scene bridges two levels of reality. On one level the 
glistenin=
g red drops of Raktabija's blood represent the overwhelming 
power of desir=
e. Like a seed, every desire that falls on the fertile 
soil of our mind gr=
ows to maturity and bursts with seeds for the 
next planting. Every desire =
produces the seeds of many more, and we 
find we are never satisfied. The g=
hastly image of Kali, in her red-
eyed, emaciated form known as Chamunda, a=
vidly licking up the drops 
of blood, tells us that desires are best conque=
red when nipped in 
the bud.

Another interpretation of the Raktabija episo=
de takes us deeper into 
the mind. Patanjali, whose Yoga Sutra systematized=
 the science of 
meditation more than two thousand years ago, wrote, "Yoga =
is the 
control of the thought-waves in the mind." Anyone who has ever sat =

to meditate knows how difficult this is. No matter how hard we try 
to con=
centrate, the mind wanders from here to there. One thought 
gives rise to a=
nother. Raktabija symbolizes this normal, unruly 
state of human consciousn=
ess, where mental energy is scattered and 
unfocused. Chamunda Kali is the =
power of concentrated awareness that 
subdues the thought-waves and takes u=
s to a calmer, purer state of 
consciousness. 

Finally, only two demons re=
main, the brothers Shumbha and Nishumbha. 
They are almost inseparable, and=
 the Chandi calls Nishumbha the 
younger brother who is dearer to Shumbha t=
han life itself. Shumbha 
represents the ego, and Nishumbha is the sense of=
 attachment, the 
tag-along sibling that accompanies him everywhere. Earlie=
r we spoke 
about the ego as a sense of separate selfhood. What we call ego=
 is a 
limiting function of consciousness that in Sanskrit is called 
ahamk=
ara, literally the "I- maker." It is both a process of 
consciousness and t=
he product of that process. Along with the sense 
of its own individuality,=
 this I-making principle has the power of 
self- appropriation that claims =
things as its own. 

Here is where Nishumbha comes in. The attachment he re=
presents is 
called mamatva, literally, "my-ness." In a sense it is the glu=
e that 
holds our identity together. We consciously attach our sense of sel=
f 
to things that are not the Self. We identify with our bodily 
characteri=
stics, such as sex, size, shape, color. We define 
ourselves by our likes a=
nd dislikes, by the people in our lives and 
our relationships to them, by =
our professions, leisure activities, 
religious or political affiliations a=
nd countless other factors that 
combine in ways to make each one of us uni=
que. We use our life's 
experiences=97what we do and what happens to us=97t=
o shape and reshape 
our identity. And so, our sense of self is constantly =
shifting. 

Sri Ramakrishna noted how a fine new garment or a new pair of b=
oots 
can change an ordinary man into a swaggering fool, or how money can 
=
make a humble man arrogant (M., 169). Is our sense of self so 
fragile that=
 a slight change of circumstance can cause us to 
reformulate ourselves? Ev=
ery factor we identify with is known in 
Sanskrit as an upadhi, a defining =
attribute. But upadhi also means a 
limiting adjunct. We go through life ac=
quiring upadhis, thinking 
they will make our identity bigger and better, b=
ut in reality we are 
merely adding to our limitations. Attachments to fame=
, influence, 
wealth and possessions only make our burden of personal ident=
ity 
heavier. The more we are reined in by our defining attributes, the 
mo=
re we lose sight of our larger sense of self. 

When we allow our happiness=
 and misery to be dictated by things 
outside of and foreign to our true na=
ture, we lose our autonomy. 
Let's consider the third meaning of upadhi: a =
substitute, anything 
that may be taken for something else, an appearance m=
istaken for 
reality. Our defining upadhis are components of a false sense =
of our 
own identity. In the end, they are no more than worthless tokens of=
 
our separation from the infinite Self. But how we hold on to them! 
When =
the Divine Mother finally slays Nishumbha, we get a graphic 
image of the f=
erocity of the struggle. Just when she has the demon 
cornered, he sprouts =
ten thousand arms with ten thousand grasping 
hands. This picture of ugly d=
esperation illustrates just how 
desperate we are not to let go. 

Even wit=
h Nishumbha out of the way, there remains the ego-sense 
itself, denuded of=
 all borrowed attributes. Now Shumbha, alone, 
stands face to face with the=
 Mother. He points to her companion 
goddesses and chides her for relying o=
n the strength of others in 
the fight. She answers, "I am alone here in th=
e world. =85 These are 
but projections of my own power=85 (DM 10.5). " To =
prove her point, 
the Shaktis vanish into her, and she then slays Shumbha. =
This final 
victory represents the realization of the true Self. 

There is=
 no way to describe this immediate, unmediated knowledge of 
the atman; but=
 that has not stopped mystics of every religious 
tradition throughout hist=
ory from trying to express the 
inexpressible experience of the Divine. In =
the Svetasvatara 
Upanishad, a text certainly known to whoever composed the=
 Chandi, 
the enlightened seer proclaims, "I have known the unchanging, 
pr=
imeval One, the indwelling Self of all, everywhere present and all-
pervadi=
ng, whom the wise declare to be free from birth and eternal 
(SU 3.21)." 

=
Medhas then relates how the gods again praised the Divine Mother in 
a four=
th and final hymn. Three of its verses (DM 11.10-12) are well 
known in Ved=
anta circles. They are sung every evening around the 
world in temples of t=
he Ramakrishna Order as the arati hymn "Om 
Sarva Mangala Mangalye." Then, =
Medhas sends his two disciples to the 
bank of a river, where they meditate=
 and worship the Mother 
devotedly. After three years she appears to them a=
nd offers each a 
boon. Suratha, who we remember has unfinished business, a=
sks for the 
return of his earthly kingdom, followed by an imperishable kin=
gdom 
in the next life. The merchant Samadhi, on the other hand, has grown =

wise and dispassionate. He asks for the knowledge that will dissolve 
the =
bondage of worldly existence.

Through the Mother's grace, each boon is gra=
nted, in keeping with 
the Chandi's teaching that the Divine Mother is 
bhu=
ktimuktipradayini, "the bestower of worldly enjoyment and 
liberation (DM11=
.7)." How conversant Sri Ramakrishna was with the 
teachings of the Chandi =
is made clear in a conversation he had with 
members of the Brahmo Samaj in=
 the autumn of 1882. In a single 
paragraph that summarizes the essential m=
essage of the Chandi, 
Ramakrishna said, "Bondage and liberation are both o=
f Her making. By 
her maya worldly people become entangled in `woman and go=
ld,' and 
again, through her grace they attain liberation. She is called th=
e 
Savior, and the Remover of the bondage that binds one to the world 
(M.,=
 136)." 

A short while later he added, "I tell you the truth: there is 
no=
thing wrong in your being in the world. But you must direct your 
mind towa=
rd God; otherwise you will not succeed. Do your duty with 
one hand and wit=
h the other hold to God. After the duty is over, you 
will hold to God with=
 both hands (M., 137-138)." On another occasion 
Sri Ramakrishna said, "Som=
etimes I find that the universe is 
saturated with the Consciousness of God=
, as the earth is soaked with 
water in the rainy season (M., 260)." This c=
alls to mind the 
Chandi's third hymn, known as the Aparajitastuti, [Hymn t=
o the 
Invincible Goddess]. 

Unlike the three other hymns, which are intim=
ately connected to the 
foregoing battle narratives, this one is an ecstati=
c celebration of 
the Divine Mother's presence in the world. It reminds us =
simply to 
see divinity everywhere around us, because the Mother abides in =
all 
beings as intelligence, order, forgiveness, modesty, peace, beauty, 
g=
ood fortune, compassion, contentment, and in countless other ways. 
We need=
 only to remember her presence; and as a sign of her grace, 
it is she hers=
elf who abides in us even in the form of memory. 

We conclude with two ver=
ses from this hymn: "To her who presides 
over the elements and the senses =
and is ever present in all beings, 
to the all-pervading Devi, salutations =
again and again. To her who 
pervades this entire world and abides in the f=
orm of consciousness, 
salutation to her, salutation to her, salutation to =
her, again and 
again (DM 5.77-80)."
