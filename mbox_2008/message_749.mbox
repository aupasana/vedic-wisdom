 Both are correct and work differently. However, those who try 
who pronoun=

misponounce them. The "g"=

when She appeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai=
 during 
Shata Chandi homam, to spread the practice of regular homam around=
 
the world. However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until

      I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and 
liked it. =
I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it 
daily for a few=
 months, I finally got down to the original task - 
teaching Narayan. I cho=
se to write a detailed manual for that 
purpose. In hindsight, I made the c=
orrect choice, as many people in 
addition to Narayan are able to do homam =
using the manual now! I and 
many other people have benefited (and will ben=
efit). However, as far 
as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan!=
 When it was time 
for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the=
 world 
started with him. What a fortunate soul..

>=
           It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me 
at the=
 onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and 
mental stat=
e would've been different while working on the manual. I 
would've been mor=
e egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only 
thing I was told was to=
 teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived 
at the correct balance and a=
lso wrote it down without many 
pretensions. The whole effort ended up bein=
g more saattwik and I 
really benefited from the exercise. If I had known t=

>=
 
>           One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to 
spend a=
 whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming 
weekend. The i=
nspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately 
latched on to it. When I =
told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead 
and do it". I started before sun=
rise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except 
for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min br=
eak at noon for bath and a small 
lunch and another 10 min break for anothe=
r bath at dusk, I was 
basically sitting in the same place and meditating w=
ith Gayatri 
mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice st=
ate at 
the end of the day.
> 
>           I noticed on the next day that t=
he previous day was 
Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is cons=
idered a very 
auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on =
that day 
is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not =

noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was 
excited.=
 When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days 
later, he said=
 calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell 
you because knowing =
it would've distracted you. You would have been 
excited at doing the sadha=
na on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement 
would've changed the mental foc=
us and brought more rajas into the 
sadhana."
> 
>           He was absolut=
ely right. As such, I was "proud" of doing 
such a sadhana. The ego and pri=
de brought rajas and limited the 
mental focus on the mantra. If I was awar=
e that I was doing this 
sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased t=
he pride and 
excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus o=
n mantra 
further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes 
ex=
cellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After 
hearing =
Manish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was 
still alive and k=
icking and that he was wise not to feed it with more 
delicious food!

          Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell

of 'Narasimha=
, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the 
astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engi=
