Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.

Although this is my first wr=
iting in this group but i have been
reading the threads for almost one year=
 now. And you people have
helped me a lot to find out the right path at man=
y times but now i
feel a bit lost again. 

As it can be seen from my chart =
details what brought me here( and to
spiritual path) like many others. I st=
ill remember the thread where
Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fe=
ar of Sani and now i have
realised what he meant.

I have learned a little =
bit of astrology from this thread and from
other  sources but with that i c=
an not really make any decisions of
the path i need to follow. As i have se=
en that there are many
enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group =
so if
someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and guide me i
w=
ill be very thankful. My birth details are given below:

Birth Date- 17/03/=
1979
Birth Time- 12:45 PM
Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India

Another th=
ing is that till now i have been reading some
Scriptures/Spiritual writings=
 from here and there and doing some
meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. =
I have really seen and
experienced the effect of all this but all this was =
random and
unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my spiri=
tual
progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of reading more to=

get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from where to
get t=
he books. 

Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a re=
gular
basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the homa kunda=
m
which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone tell me
what =
else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.

Although there a=
re so many other things i want to ask but if someone
can help me with only =
these i would be very thankful to him and i will
pray to Lord for him.

Tha=
nks in advance
Sanjeev
