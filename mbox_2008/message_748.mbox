Namaste,
 
1. The instruction was to spread homam and create a community of=
 sadhakas across the world who worship various deities in fire. It can be a=
ny deities.
 
2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sens=
e of discipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting =
before or after.
 
Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moo=
la mantra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and devi sookt=
am are recommended after.
 
However, in my humble opinion, nothing is reall=
y compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be very powerful afte=
r a while. I see nothing wrong in it.
 
3. Both are correct and work differ=
ently. However, those who try who pronounce the beeja mantras as "aing hree=
ng" invariably misponounce them. The "g" becomes explicit. Ideally, you sho=
uld start pronouncing as though you are going to say "aing" and abruptly st=
op just when you are about to say "g", without saying it. It is not easy to=
 pronounce this correctly.
 
Instead of trying "aing hreeng" and messing it=
 up, it is better to just say "aim hreem".
 
*        *        *
 
Internal=
 purity and lack (or minimization) of individualized ego is the key in any =
sadhana. Thousands of hours of sadhana without them is fruitless. One who i=
s pure and has a very limited ego achieves results quickly.
 
There is a lo=
t of misinformation and unfounded fears that are spread regarding Chandi pa=
th. Do not worry about them.
 
Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and de=
sserts before and after a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigest=
ion from it too. If the meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy =
it without appetizers or dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and posi=
tively to get the most energy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read wi=
th a sense of surrender and limited ego.
 
Instead of doing everything with=
 a lower focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focus.
 
=
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Nars=
imhaji
        1.Since I have joined this group before some couple of month=
s, some previous mails I have not read. You have mentioned somewhere that M=
anishji was inspired from Mother to start Homam daily. I would like to know=
 whether it was for Maha Ganapati Homam too or only Chandi Homam?,
        =
2.Please also guide me whether really we should read Chandi Path or Sapta S=
ati Stotra with Devi Kavacha, Argala, Kilak and Ratri Suktam before 13 Adhy=
ayas and Devi Sukta, etc in the end ? Suppose we recite only 13 Adhyayas on=
ly after Sankalpam-will it not be sufficient in daily routine worship? Or i=
t is compulsory?
        3. Can you guide me the proper uttering of Beej Ma=
ntras in Navarna Mantra? some say it is Aing, Hring, Kling.... and some say=
 it is Aim, Hrim, Klim......
        Thanks with respect.

          Namaste friends,

          Excellent and inspirational writeu=
p Narayan!

          * * *

          Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's in=
struction to Manish when She appeared in front of him at the temple in Chen=
nai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread the practice of regular homam arou=
nd the world. However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much=
 later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to do ho=
mam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.

          =
I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I start=
ed doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months,=
 I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to wri=
te a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct cho=
ice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the m=
anual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). Howev=
er, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was =
time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started=
 with him. What a fortunate soul..

          * * *

          It was proba=
bly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=
other asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would've been different=
 while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic and also hurrie=
d more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=
weet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=
ny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =
benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=
ad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =
same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.

  =
        Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to ha=
ndle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manua=
l as asked by him then.

          * * *

          A good guru protects a =
sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I re=
member another incident.

          One day in the spring of the same year,=
 I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the c=
oming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latche=
d on to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I =
started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2=
 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min =
break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place a=
nd meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in =
a very nice state at the end of the day.

          I noticed on the next d=
ay that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It=
 is considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadh=
ana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I ha=
d not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was exci=
ted. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he s=
aid calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowin=
g it would've distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadh=
ana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would've changed the mental foc=
us and brought more rajas into the sadhana."

          He was absolutely r=
ight. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=
ught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =
I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride=
 and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =
further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=
gress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's wor=
ds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and th=
at he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!

          Lucky ar=
e those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather t=
han what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who=
 can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can we=
ed it out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious eff=
ort.

          * * *

          I remember one more similar incident. Befo=
re the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me =
to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned=
 the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and th=
at I would do some important work in this birth.

          When I saw Mani=
sh later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious a=
nd said "Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already stro=
ng with the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the =
astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' e=
tc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Se=
lf. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another =
new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be c=
orrect. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all =
identities."

          How true and wise!

          * * *

          Just=
 as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the f=
ood given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins =
over the spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a g=
ood master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too mu=
st consciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.

          Mani=
sh has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points he made bro=
ught so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in t=
his life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritua=
l gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp=
 and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that=
 was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off th=
e thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that enclo=
ses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caug=
ht up to notice that dirt ourselves..

          * * *

          Homam and=
 other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to=
 introspect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no mag=
ic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or=
 month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should s=
tart walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance =
left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.

    =
      The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homa=
m) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in ha=
nd. After a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start t=
o work together very effectively.

          Best regards,
          Narasi=
mha

        Manishji was inspired from Mo=

        know whether it was for=
 Maha Ganapati Homam too or only Chandi 
        Homam?,</DIV>
        <DIV=

          <DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Excellent an=
d inspirational writeup 
          Narayan!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Earlier, I =
mentioned the Mother's 
          instruction to Manish when She appeared i=
n front of him at the temple 
          in Chennai during Shata Chandi homa=
m, to spread the practice of 
          regular homam around the world. How=
ever, Manish did not reveal that 
          incident to me until much later=
. All he told me at that time was that 
          Narayan really needed to =
do homam everyday and that I should teach a 
          simple procedure to =
him.<BR><BR>I experimented with homam, started 
          doing occasionall=
y and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure 
          everyday. Afte=
r doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to 
          the ori=
ginal task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed 
          manua=
l for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as 
          =
many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the 
        =
  manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). 
 =
         However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan=
! 
          When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people=
 across 
          the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..<BR><=
BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR>It was probably for a reason that Manish did not=
 tell me at 
          the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My=
 attitude and 
          mental state would've been different while working=
 on the manual. I 
          would've been more egoistic and also hurried m=
ore. Because the only 
          thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I t=
ook my sweet time, arrived 
          at the correct balance and also wrote=
 it down without many 
          pretensions. The whole effort ended up bei=
ng more saattwik and I 
          really benefited from the exercise. If I =
had known the full story, it 
          would have had more rajas given my =
mental state then and I would not 
          have had made the same progres=
s I made, while preparing myself to 
          teach homam to Narayan.<BR><=
BR>Manish told me the full story only when 
          I was better prepared=
 to handle the information and, of course, I 
          added it to the pre=
face of the manual as asked by him then.<BR><BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR>A g=
ood guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information 
          that can=
 wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another 
          incident.<BR><BR>O=
ne day in the spring of the same year, I decided to 
          spend a whol=
e day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming 
          weekend. =
The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched 
          on=
 to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". 
     =
     I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 
   =
       breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch a=
nd 
          another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basicall=
y sitting 
          in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =
It was a very 
          good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=
 end of the 
          day.<BR><BR>I noticed on the next day that the previ=
ous day was 
          Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is co=
nsidered a very 
          auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual=
 sadhana on that day 
          is 1000 times more powerful than on other d=
ays. Though I had not 
          noticed it before, I picked a perfect day =
for the sadhana. I was 
          excited. When I mentioned this to Manish =
with excitement a few days 
          later, he said calmly "I knew it earl=
ier itself. But I did not tell 
          you because knowing it would've d=
istracted you. You would have been 
          excited at doing the sadhana =
on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement 
          would've changed the men=
tal focus and brought more rajas into the 
          sadhana."<BR><BR>He wa=
s absolutely right. As such, I was "proud" of 
          doing such a sadha=
na. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the 
          mental focus=
 on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this 
          sadhana on =
a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and 
          excitement, =
brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra 
          furthe=
r. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes 
          excellen=
t progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After 
          hear=
ing Manish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still 
       =
   alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more 
       =
   delicious food!<BR><BR>Lucky are those who have a guru who can 
        =
  succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky 
 =
         are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the hear=
t of 
          their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it ou=
t through 
          further introspection and weaken it through conscious =
effort.<BR><BR>* 
          * *<BR><BR>I remember one more similar incident=
. Before the shata 
          chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respe=
ct a lot took me to a 
          Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When h=
e looked at me, he mentioned 
          the name of one of the saptarshis a=
nd said that I very close to him 
          and that I would do some import=
ant work in this birth.<BR><BR>When I 
          saw Manish later that day,=
 I mentioned this to him. He immediately 
          became serious and said=
 "Narasimha, do you need one more identity? 
          Your ego is already =
strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, the 
          Sanskrit scholar', '=
Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the 
          engineer', 'Narasimh=
a, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take great 
          effort to overc=
ome those identities and find True Self. As if that 
          challenge is=
 not sufficient, do you really need yet another new 
          identity to =
feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be 
          correc=
t. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise 
          abov=
e all identities."<BR><BR>How true and wise!<BR><BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR=
>Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog 
          a=
nd get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense 
      =
    of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the 
=
          energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and =
feed 
          the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to rest=
rain ego 
          and increase detachment.<BR><BR>Manish has a unique way=
 of looking at 
          things and some simple points he made brought so =
much clarity to my 
          thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution i=
n this life. Even without 
          giving any specific mantra to me, like=
 many spiritual gurus do, he lit 
          the lamp of knowledge in my hea=
rt. He would say the lamp and light 
          were already there and he si=
mply wiped the dust on the lamp that was 
          blocking the light. Tha=
t is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off 
          the thick layer of =
dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) 
          that encloses th=
e lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we 
          may be too=
 caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..<BR><BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR>H=
omam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But 
          one=
 should also try to introspect and change one's thinking, on an 
          =
ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not 
    =
      take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long=
 
          time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the pat=
h and 
          not worry about the progress and the distance left. One wh=
o keeps 
          walking without distractions will reach the goal.<BR><BR=
>The point I 
          want to emphasize is that the external rituals (lik=
e homam) and the 
          internal introspection (to change attitude) sho=

          After a while, there will be synergy betwee=
n them and they will start 
          to work together very effectively.<BR=

          really flimsy document, but nevertheless I to=
