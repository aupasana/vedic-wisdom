Namaste Lakshmi Bahen,

I wish to tell you my experience in this connection=
 as to how we can 
differentiate Real Spiritual person amongst the fake one=
.


Once I was reading 'Autobiography of a Yogi', the very much 
celebrated=
 book by Sri Paramhansa Yogananda. I was actually 
fascinated by the 'Kriya=
 Yoga' mentioned in the book and there arose 
a deep desire to learn this K=
riya yoga. I came to reading the 
chapter on 'Babaji' in the same book. In =
the very chapter, Yogananda 
has mentioned that Babaji is living since many=
 centuries and he is 
still present in physical form. Anybody who sincerely=
 asks for 
spiritual help, he/she will be helped by Babaji even today. Read=
ing 
the above, I instantly close my eyes and deeply prayed Babaji. I 
pray=
ed that if you are still there guiding spiritual people then 
please help m=
e for learning this Kriya yoga.
And to my pleasant surprise, within a month=
 I was introduced 
(accidentally/unplanned way) to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga of =
Art of 
Living organization by Sri Sri Ravishankar. Few more such inner 
ex=
periences happened which convinced me that Babaji is there and 
gave me eno=
ugh faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's 
greatness as real yogis.=


My strong opinion is that if one goes by media (Print or electronic 
or i=
nternet), there are all the chances that most people will be 
confused and =
would not be able to decide about somebody's character 
or caliber. Even Sw=
ami Vivekananda in his time was accused for many 
wrong practices in USA an=
d U.K. hence personally, I rely upon my own 
heart and own experiences. I a=
lways stay far away from Print as well 
as TV reports. Big NO NO. to News c=
hannels. Most of them are 
spreading nonsense. They have become script writ=
er rather than 
authentic news providers. Even, random and reckless opinion=
s of 
people in general is many a times misguiding/confusing.

  
Same way,=
 for my Beloved Thakur, I relied on the same ways. After I 
read Gospel, I =
was drawn in to events which ultimately took me to My 
Guru of this life (I=
t took 4 years). And it can not be a coincidence 
that my Guru is also very=
 very much attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I 
rate Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as =
the Best `darkness dispelling' book I 
read till date and now spiritual boo=
ks also doesn't interest me 
much. Enough of reading, now it's high time fo=
r *Doing*. 


Hence my input to all those serious spiritualist, who are als=
o 
seriously confusedÔÅå, that listen to you heart, Pray for the clari=
ty, 
Meditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe the chain of events 
happeni=
ng around you. Those are the best ways to get the clarity 
about any spirit=
ual person or future spiritual Guru rather than 
depending, more than requi=
red,  upon Media and such external inputs 
who have hardly any sincere spir=
itual interest.

I clarify here that I am an almost a novice who is struggl=
ing in the 
path of spirituality but still felt that my own inputs out of 
=
experience may help few.


Spiritually yours,
Utpal
