Hare Rama Krishna
Dear Narasimha,
These are my thoughts.Hope no one takes offense.
 The problem with "I ness" is that just by focusing on
it, one becomes more aware of sense of self.
The real cure for "I ness" is to serve others, focus
on others.
Serve God , be the servant of God , instead of
oneself.
Then.. the person is "self less" - which is the cure
for too much "I ness"
When one loves someone they spend all their mind and
heart thinking and serving that person. If a  person
is focusing constantly on the "I ness"  and on
themselves it is pretty self oriented , the opposite
of what is needed.. However sometimes, one has to
realize how much "I" is there.
When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord talks
to him personally,and that they are a direct vehicle
to serve the Lord.
that is good indication the person is suffering from a
certain level of delusion/maya. In fact the world is
full of people who are either deluding themselves or
trying to delude others. 
But it doesn't matter because the Supreme Lord knows
what is in everyones heart and has the perfect plan
for our purification and realizations.Of course there
are many paths to the same end.

Here is one verse/quote from Lord Caitanya-

"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a
humble state of mind,
 thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street;
 one should be more tolerant than a tree,
 devoid of all sense of false prestige, 
and should be ready to offer all respect to others.
 In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name
of the Lord constantly.
Best wishes
Lakshmi
