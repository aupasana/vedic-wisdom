Folks,
I came across 2 wonderful living jnanis through the web. 

Please ch=
eck the website below. Actually books were written in telugu. 
If you have =
time and you are in India, please don't miss these great 
jnanis. As I didn=
't go to India recently, I haven't yet met these great 
living yogis. Remem=
ber, Nowadays, it is very difficult to see a living 
jnani. So please don't=
 miss the opportunity to visit them.

I read a story from dhuniwala dada's =
life in one of the books I 
couldn't recall. 
Once a old lady begger came t=
o Dhuniwala's ashram. Then dada send her 
out with so much anger and hate. =
His pupil asked him why he was very 
angry on her. Then dada told them that=
 she killed a saint in her past 
life. So she has to has 7 more lifes(incar=
nations) like that. Just 
because she visited the ashram, some of her sins =
were burnt, and 6 more 
lifes would be enough to burn her sins.


Visiting =
living saints is a great opportunity. They never care about 
anything in th=
e earth and don't judge them by their appearance too.
