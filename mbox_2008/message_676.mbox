Dear Reemaji
=C2=A0
There are different stories from Purana regarding why l=
ord Shiva took the ferocious roopa of Bhairava. One of them from the Shiva =
Maha Puran states that Bhairava was created from the third eye of Shiva to =
cut off one of the heads of Brahma. Thus Bhairava became the first person t=
o commit the sin of Brahmahatya. Later he had to take a human skull as a be=
gging bowl and roamaround the earth untill finally when he reached Kasi, th=
e skull fell from his hand and Lord Bhairava was liberated from the sin of =
brahmahatya. Thus he became the protector of the lord city of Kasi. It is b=
elieved, anyone who goes to Kasi to visit Kasi Vishwanath, should also pay =
his/her respect to KalBhairav.
=C2=A0
Another story, the 51 shakti peethas,=
 where the body of Sati had fallen are guarded by Shiva in his Bhairava roo=
pa. 
=C2=A0
Bhairav is often refered to as the deity of the Samshan (Shiva =
in his sashan roopa) as well as Kshetrapala. Or protector of the field "ksh=
etra". That is why Vatuka Bhairava (Vatuka meaning small child) is often in=
voked for protection during many rituals in the samshan. 
On the esoteric l=
evel, the kshetra is the field, the body. That is where Durga/Kali resides =
in the form of the kundalini. And Shiva as Bhairava acts as the protector o=
f the fortress of the Goddess. Hence, in some tantrik traditions, Bhairava =
is also refered to as a son of Kali. Or in other words, one who has been in=
toxicated into God conscinousness by the Kundalini energy may act and behav=
e like Bhairava in appearence (nothing material will appeal to him anymore)=
. Therefore they say, one who can get the real=C2=A0grace of the divine mot=
her is not a sadhak ( a sadhak gets maybe one or two aspects of the Mother =
depending on the sadhana), but a=C2=A0son or=C2=A0daughter of the Mother. =
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
In Kashmiri traditions, Bhairav holds a very important place.=
 He is considered to be the all in all deity who creates, maintains and the=
n destroyes. He is the pure conscinousness where all duality is broken down=
 and hence is so fierce for ordinay mortals like us who are so accustomed t=
o existence within=C2=A0duality. The Rudrayamala tantra=C2=A0contains some=
=C2=A0very strong descriptions of Lord Bhairava, including his various roop=
s, his shaktis. There is a beautiful hymn of Kal Bhairava as composd by Adi=
 Shankarachrya. 
=C2=A0
All that I mentioned above is what I have understoo=
d from a=C2=A0theoritcal point of view regarding Lord Bhairava. I had been =
given a mantra of lord Bhairav through a strange set of events by a person,=
 and since then I had been praying to Him. Before that day, I had never eve=
n heard of the name Bhairava. He had told me one more thing, the key to doi=
ng any genuine sadhana of Bhairava entails facing and eventually losing onc=
e fears. 

Often people have strong misconceptions about Lord Bhairava cons=
idering Him to be=C2=A0one=C2=A0associated with black magik or such. All th=
ose are quite incorrect. 
=C2=A0
-Regards

|| Om Sri Gurubhyo Namah ||

Namaskaar Narasimha Ji,

Your ex=
planation of duality and non-duality by the way of example of the offerings=
 to the Homa is just excellent! I think I understood the basic guidelines, =
and now can contemplate further within this framework.

Namaskaar Rajarshi =
Ji,

I have heard about this rupa of Shiva a lot, but I have no idea of why=
 He takes this rupa, why people worship Him in this rupa, and why Devi wors=
hips Him in this rupa (Bhairava-poojini is one of the names of Mother in La=
lita Sahasranamam) . I would be so obliged to read you describe this rupa, =
since you are also a devotee.

With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Reema.
