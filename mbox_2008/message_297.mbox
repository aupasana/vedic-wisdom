Namaste Himanshu Mohan ji,

Kavacha means "protective shield". If one recit=
es a specific kavacha regularly, a protective shield of energy that is capa=
ble of preventing certain energy influences is formed around the subtle bod=
y of the person.

Namaste Ramakrishna garu,

Both are fine. Anahata chakra =
in the heart area is the centre of vaayu tattva in one's body. Vaayu (wind)=
 is expansive in nature and fills anything it has access to. It can be rest=
ricted to a balloon or fill even a room. Once there is an opening, it gets =
into the area and fills it. The process of creation is also like that. It i=
s expansive by nature and fills every part of Brahman it has access to.

On=
 the other hand, ajna chakra is beyond the five elements (mooladhara-visudd=
hi show five elements). It is the source of all elements.
 
Thus, both chak=
ras are suitable for imagining ishta devata. If you are primarily a dwaita =
siddhanta follower (clear duality), one may suggest imagining the ishta dev=
ata at anahata chakra. All the elements and duality continue to exist and t=
he ishta devata is seen as the master of all creation. If you are primarily=
 a visishtadwaita (special non-duality) or awaita (non-duality) follower, o=
ne may suggest imagining ishta devata at ajna chakra. All the elements and =
duality are withdrawn and ishta devata is the only thing that exists in the=
 universe. There is nothing else.

Bottomline is that both are acceptable, =
but one is conducive to a dwaitic experience and one is conducive to a visi=
shtadwaitic experience. You pick one based on your samskaras and vasanas.

=
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear PVR =
garu,



        Namaste.



        Can you also please clarify on where o=
ne should imagine the Ista devata during meditation ?



        Some peopl=

          Dear Narasimha,
          P=
ranam.

          Can we discuss some mantra issues here? For example, I am=
 interest in 
          knowing how Kavachas work as mantras and what resul=

          them; at what stage a particular kavacha is=

          Thanks & bes=
