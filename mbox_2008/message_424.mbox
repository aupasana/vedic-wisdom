Shri Uma Shankerji,
Namaskar!
Many thanks for your response, which is reall=
y off the mark!

You have not addressed even a single point raised by me in=
 my 
post "Vedic astrology--the greatest fraud on the Vedas" about "Vedic 
=
astrology" vis-a-vis the Hindu calendar! 

You have said
<Everybody has the=
 right not to believe things but please note that 
no human being has got t=
he right to degrade this science.>

Would you kindly enlighten me as to wha=
t right we have to call 
predictive gimmicks as Vedic astrology when there =
are no Mesha, 
Vrisha etc. rashis in the Vedas or the Vedanga Jyotisha or t=
he Yajur 
Jyotsiha or even the Atharva Jyotisha and Atharva Veda Parishisht=
a?

<You said there is no Sade Sathi, I know what Sade Sathi is because 
I =
have through it and those tortorous 7 years.  It is not that I am 
a dumb p=
erson and will take whatever comes to me , I am a very hard 
working person=
 but still the situation has arisen for me without my 
control and myself a=
nd soul has gone through those torterous years.>

You are talking a lot abo=
ut Sade sati of Shani devta!  Obviously, 
you have not read any of the Veda=
s since we do not find any traces 
of these most dreaded planets viz. Manga=
l and Shani in the Vedas or 
the Vedanga Jyotisha or the Yajur Jyotisha!  N=
aturally, if Shani 
Devta is tormenting somebody it must be because that so=
mebody is 
calling sade sati a Vedic phenomenon, when actually it is a crea=
tion 
of jyotishis themselves!

Here is a challenge to all the "Vedic" and =
"non-Vedic" and 
even "anti-Vedic" jyotihsis:  Let them quote even a single=
 mantra 
from any of the Vedas or a single shloka from any of the Puranas o=
r 
any other shastra which has advised us to consult some soothsayer 
befor=
e embarking on any plan!

All the shastras, on the other hand, advise us "k=
armnayeva 
adhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana"---"Do your duty but do not wo=
rry 
about the results" whereas "Vedic astrology" wants us to do 
some "Upa=
y" to gain something whether we deserve it or not!

"Vedic astrology" is th=
us a drag on the society since there is 
nothing on record to show that it =
has done any good to the country:

For example, has any jyotishi till date =
made any prediction as to 
when a flood or Tsuname or some other disaster w=
ill strike which 
part of the country?  Has any jyotihsi predicted about th=
e 
devastating floods of Bihar, Orissa and other parts of the country?  
Ha=
s any jyotishi predicted about terrorist attacks of Gujarat or 
Delhi or Ra=
jasthan?

No jyotishi had even the faintest idea about Messrs P V. Narasimh=
a 
Rao or Dewe Gawda or I. K . Gujral being crowned the Heads of the 
large=
st deemocracy of the world!  Same is the case with the present 
PM viz. Dr.=
 Manmohan Singh!  Of what use has "Vedic astrology" been 
about deciding th=
e course of events of the nation? 

Leave alone mundane affairs, the "great=
est Vedic astrologer of the 
twentieth century" had "planned astrologically=
" to speak 
on "Astrology as an aid in the diaganosis of Heart diseases" on=
 the 
third January of the ensuing year but passed away himself on 
Decembe=
r 20 of the year preceding the date of that talk and that 
also of a "heart=
 attack".  If he could not foresee his own death 
looming large, how can th=
ese jyotishis help others in doing any 
future planning?

It maybe news to =
you that "Vedic astrlogers" can make correct 
predictios only from incorrec=
t data---"Notable Horscopes" is the 
most glaring example!  None of the cha=
rts, including the horoscope 
of the "redoubtable" author himself in that b=
ook, has any correct 
astronomical data, but the author claims to have made=
 correct 
assessments!

The most tragic part of this farce known as "Vedic =
astrology" is that
we will be celebrating Pitra-amavasya on the day of actu=
al Dipavali 
which is September 28, 2008 as per all the shastras!  Is that =
what 
our forefatehrs have advised us to do?  Is that what the real 
Vamade=
vas wanted us to do in the name of "Vedic astrology", as is 
being claimed =
by "imported Vamadevas" these days?  Will 
any "imported Vamadeva" celebrat=
e his/her Christmas on any other day 
than December 25? No.  Then whey are =
they compelling us to celebrate 
our festivals on wrong days---Uttarayana o=
n January 15 instead of 
the shortest day of the year and so on?  Obviously=
, they have some 
axe to grind!

We are celebrating Dakshinayana on July 15=
 instead of the longest 
day of the year every year because "Vedic astrolog=
ers" and "Vedic 
panchangakars" advise us to do so!  Is that the real scien=
ce that is 
being advocated by "Vedic astrologers"?  Don't they know that t=
here 
cannot be any other Uttarayana except the shortest day of the year?  =


These "Vedic astrologers" want us to celebrate Vaishakhi on April 15 
whe=
n actually Vasanta Sampat means the day when day is equal to 
night!  What =
does it show?  That "Vedic astrologers" do not know 
even ABC of school lev=
el geogrpahy, leave alone astronomy!

Thus, I am against "Vedic astrology" =
because it is the only "branch 
of predictive gimmicks" that compels us to =
celebrate all our 
festivals and muhurtas on wrong days!  It is immaterial =
to me 
otherwise if somebody is making a fool of someone else in the name 
=
of "Vedic jyotish" so long as the other someone is willing to become 
a foo=
l!  

The earlier the entire Hindu community wakes to this situation the 
b=
etter, as otherwise India will become Babylon of yesteryears, which 
is kno=
wn as Iraq these days!  Maybe that is what the "imported 
Vamadevas" actual=
ly want and it looks that they are also succeeding 
in their efforts!
With =
regards,
A K Kaul
