Dear Prasad ji,
 
The restriction I mentioned is very conservative. I menti=
oned it to be on the safe side.
 
The nature of pitris is different from th=
at of devas. If pitri tarpanas are performed outside the living area, it el=
iminates the little risk that a vulnerable person may be affected negativel=
y by the departed soul receiving tarpana. Suppose a person with a weak mind=
 is sleeps next to the place of tarpana. There is some chance of the depart=
ed soul to influence his/her mind and cause some problems. Thus, it is advi=
sable to do this outside the living area, especially not in an area where p=
eople sleep. Please note that this is merely a precaution for something tha=
t may rarely happen.
 
The nature of pitris on certain days is different an=
d such a risk is not there. Apart from Amavasya and Sanskranthi days mentio=
ned in the document, the entire pitri paksha period is so auspicious for th=
is that you can do this anywhere.
 
It is fine to do on the terrace or balc=
ony or back yard or front yard of the house.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Hi Narasimha=
ji,
  A very good manual, I will start performing immediately, but please c=

  I would like to know, why tarpana cannot be performed in=

  Also, =
please tell me if we can do tarapana on terrace or we have to go outside ho=

c-astrology] Pitri Tarpana Manuals Available Now

  Namaste friends,

  Now=
 three detailed pitri tarpana manuals are available on the internet. They a=
re appropriate even for a novice and explain clearly the details of pitri t=
arpana. The mantras are simple, the materials needed are few and it does no=
t take too long.

  Homam (fire ritual) and pitri tarpanas (water ritual) a=
re two of the most important rituals of Hinduism and worth performing regul=
arly. They cleanse a person, remove various obstacles in material and spiri=
tual lives and speed up spiritual evolution. An aspirant desiring spiritual=
 progress should take advantage of them regularly. More about the philosoph=
y of pitri tarpana is explained below, where I reproduced an extract from t=
he manual.

  Please download the manuals from

  http://www.VedicAst rolog=
er.org/ tarpana

  There are three manuals - one with the regular procedure=
 (taking 30-45 min), one with a short procedure (taking 12-20 min) and one =
with a super-short procedure (taking 5-8 min).

  Please feel free to pass =
this word around to interested people. I hope this information reaches with=
 Her blessings as many interested souls as possible.

  By the way, there i=
s an important solar eclipse in a few hours. It is a great time to perform =
pitri tarpanas. Actually, it is a great time to perform many spiritual sadh=
anas.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

  External rituals are meant=
 to create the internal visualization needed to affect desirable internal c=
hanges in the long run. For example, one offers a full coconut into fire as=
 poornaahuti (complete offering) at the end of a homam (fire ritual). This =
is symbolic of surrendering one's head or ego (sense of I-ness) to god and =
burning it in the fire of wisdom and becoming free from ego. As one keeps e=
ngaging in this act again and again, the visualization becomes stronger and=
 stronger and ego is slowly reduced.

  One important ritual of Hinduism is=
 tarpana. Tarpana means "satisfying" or "satiating". One acknowledges the d=
ebt one has to devas (gods), rishis (sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) an=
d tries to satisfy them using this ritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire=
 in a homam, pitris are invoked in water in this ritual, then held in the p=
alm and released in a specific way conducive to freeing them.

  One owes a=
 lot to one's parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, one owes a=
ll of one's genetic characteristics to one's parents and ancestors. Each an=
cestor is actually present in the person as a genetic characteristic. In ka=
rmik terms, one inherits some karmas of one's parents and ancestors and eac=
h ancestor is actually present in the person as a kaarmik predisposition. T=
he latter approach obviously extends to multiple lives and some karmik pred=
isposition is inherited from the ancestors from a past life too, though the=
y may not be related to one in this life.

  By thinking of the deceased an=
cestors with gratitude and trying to give them an emancipation, one is actu=
ally trying to free oneself from various kaarmic predispositions that one h=
as as a result of the rina (karmik debt) with several people. One can view =
this as an external event of satisfying and emancipating an external entity=
 (a pitri). Alternately, one can view this as an internal event of satisfyi=
ng and releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ultimately, it is the =
latter. However, one needs to externalize first and perform external ritual=
s, while thinking of what it means internally. This builds up one's visuali=
zation and slowly brings about internal changes and eventually the desired =
internal change itself.

  Two external spiritual sadhanas are particularly=
 powerful, useful and recommended for every person desirous of fast spiritu=
al progress:

  1.. Homam (fire ritual): Gods are invoked in fire and satis=
fied with offerings with mantras. Please see the homam website at http://ww=
w.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam for more. In the long run, a regular practice=
 of this ritual increases the subtle fire burning inside one's subtle body,=
 burns various impediments to spiritual progress and gives clarity, focus a=
nd stability to the mind.

  b.. Tarpana (water ritual): Gods, sages and ma=
nes are invoked in water and satisfied with emancipation given to them. In =
the long run, a regular practice of this ritual increases the release of va=
rious kaarmik predispositions and weaknesses that are blocking one's spirit=
ual and material progress.

  This document describes the procedure of pitr=
i tarpana with the relevant mantras using a simple approach. This document =
is the regular procedure. There are also documents giving a short procedure=
 and a super-short procedure for the benefit of those with time constraints=
 or problem with Sanskrita language. Download them from http://www.VedicAst=
 rologer.org/ tarpana.
