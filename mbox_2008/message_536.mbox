Namaste 

though what you said about rina in this right 
but the point is h=
ow to find that rina

and if we leave thta thing to nature
then ,aqs far as=
 i remember,in AUTOBIGRAPHY OF A YOGI
Paramhansa Yogananga ji says that his=
GURU Swami Yukteshwar
even fought cases with the people who were eyeing the=
 land on which 
they built their ashram

So it makes a little bit of contra=
tdiction
Please clarify it a bit further

regards
jitender

Once one young man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched m=
y 
feet at the end to take blessings. Normally, when people to do that, 
I =
mentally say "sarvam Sri Krishnarpanamastu" and imagine that the 
obeisance=
 is going to Lord Krishna. But, this time, I could clearly 
feel some energ=
y leaving me. It was a very tangible feeling. This

 spots in the two feet with a specific mudra 
of the two hands.
