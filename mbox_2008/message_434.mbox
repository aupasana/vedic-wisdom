Shri Ravilochananji,
Namaskar!

<I concur with your views. NOwhere=
 is it said in our epics or 
Puranas that the Kings or Princes consulted as=
trologers before 
marriage. Neither did Lord Ram consult an astrologer befo=
re taking 
part in the bow contest nor did Lord Krishna went in search of 
=
astrologers before departing to carry away Devi Rukmini.>

The fad of kings=
 consulting jyotishis was started through his Brihat 
Samhita by Varahamihi=
ra  who was the greatest charlatan according to 
me since he could make "co=
rrect predictions from incorect data" viz. 
panchangas based on Maya the ml=
echha's Surya Sidhanta, the most 
monstrous astronomical work that could ev=
er have been produced by 
anybody!  No wonder, "Vedic astrologers" of today=
 vie with one 
another for being called  "Varahamihira" since they also can=
 make 
correct predictions ONLY from incorrect data!

Regarding "Patri Mela=
pak", what is most ironic is that no "jyotisha 
shastra" right from Sphujid=
waja's yavana Jatakam to the most 
notorious fake work viz. Brihat  Parasha=
ri has touched this topic 
even with a barge pole, but then today's "Vedic =
jyotishis" say that 
it was practised by  Vedic seers!  My personal view is=
 that if the 
seers had really indulged in such a non-sense (actually the m=
ost 
cunning!) fad, almost all of them would still have been looking for 
a=
 spouse whose Patri would match with theirs with at least 28 gunas!

<It is=
 high time that we gave up the ancient Greek notion of 
astrology and get b=
ack to proper astronomy.>

This "Vedic astrology" has had such a deleteriou=
s affect on the real 
Vedic culture that the words of the Gita are becoming=
 most 
meaningful these days:
"adharmam dharmam it ya manyate tamsa vrita
s=
arvarthan vipareetanshchai, budhih saa partha tamasi"
i.e.
"an intellect th=
at views adharma as dharma (and dharma as adharma)
besides viewing all the =
things upside down, is the real Tamasic 
intellect".

I find that almost ev=
ery Hindu is trying to defend "Vedic astrology" 
in spite of the fact that =
it has been made clear to them by now that 
it is because of that very fad =
that we are celebrating all our 
festivals and muhurtas on worng days, but =
their arguments are really 
tamasic---like "I do not know much about astron=
omy (and by 
implication it means that he/she knows everything about astrol=
ogy 
though!)" is the stock reply of most of them.  

All the Hindus are no=
w a days least bothered about celebrating Pitra-
Amavasya on the day of act=
ual Dipavali which is on September 28, 
2008, but they do not want to hear =
even a single word against "Vedic 
astrology"!  They celebrated marriages i=
n actual Pitrapaksha 
because "Vedic astrologes" had okayed those dates!  
=

What is surprising is that in spite of being well read, most of the 
Hindu=
s have lost all sense of basic Primary school level geography!
They have be=
come oblivious of the fact that Uttarayana cannot take 
place on any other =
day than the shortest day of the year or 
Dakshinayana except on the longes=
t day of the year!  But they have 
put wool into their ears for such phenom=
ena since "Vedic 
astrologers" want them to celebrate Uttarayana on January=
 15 and 
Dakshinayana on July 15 and so on!

In short, most of the Hindu so=
ciety appears to have become clones of 
Maya the mlechha just because of th=
eir fatal infatuation with "Vedic 
astrology"! And  that is the real Tamasi=
c Vriti that I am talking 
about!

However, since, AS IS EVIDENT FROM YOUR =
POST, Hindus are basically 
the offspring of real Vamadevas instead of "imp=
orted Vamadevas", 
sooner than later the genome of Vedic seers will revolt =
against this 
tyranny of "Vedic astrologers" and  thereby prevent the Hindu=
 
culture from having an akalamrityu, INSPITE OF "VEDIC ASTROLOGERS"!
With =
regards,
Avtar
