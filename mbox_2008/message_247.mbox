Dear All,
   
  
A small touching story mainly for professionals. ..


  A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his
5-year old son waiting for him at the door.




           SON:   "Daddy, may I ask you a question?"


          DAD:   "Yeah sure, what is it?" replied the man.



          SON:   "Daddy, how much do you make an hour?"


 DAD:   "That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?"

                        the man said angrily.


 SON:    "I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an

                               hour?"


         DAD:    "If you must know, I make Rs.100 an hour."


     SON:     "Oh," the little boy replied, with his head down.



             SON:   "Daddy, may I please borrow Rs.50?"




 The father was furious, "If the only reason you asked that is so you

 can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then
 you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about

  why you are being so selfish. I work hard everyday for such this
                         childish behavior."



     The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.


  The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little

  boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some
                               money?


 After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to

 think: Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that
 Rs.50 and he really didn't ask for money very often. The man went to

       the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.

                  "Are you asleep, son?" He asked.



               "No daddy, I'm awake," replied the boy.


 "I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier" said the

                                man.


 "It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you.. Here's the

                        Rs.50 you asked for."


 The little boy sat straight up, smiling. "Oh, thank you daddy!" He

                               yelled.


 Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.
  The man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry

 again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up
                           at his father.



  "Why do you want more money if you already have some?" the father
                              grumbled.



 "Because I didn't have enough, but now I do," the little boy replied.


     "Daddy, I have Rs.100 now. Can I buy an hour of your time?



  Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with
                                you."



 The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he
                     begged for his forgiveness.



 It's just a short reminder to all of you working so hard in life. We
 should not let time slip through our fingers without having spent some

 time with those who really matter to us, those close to our hearts.


Do remember to share that Rs.100 worth of your time with someone you love.

 If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily
                   replace us in a matter of days.

 But the family & friends we leave behind will feel the loss for the
 rest of their lives.  And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more
                    into work than to our family.
