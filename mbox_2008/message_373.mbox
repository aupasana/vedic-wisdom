Adarniya Guruji Namaskar,

I wanted to do the Ganapathi homa but haven't=

antras used. I can recite the Ganapathi Atharvahsirsham as I do=A0recite it=
=A0daily & have learned by constantly listening to the audio. Thus I kindly=
 request you to please, if you can spare some time out of your busy schedul=
e, to create MP3 of only the mantras used in the Homa excluding the comment=
ary. By constantly listening to the mantras it will be easier to learn & do=
 the Homa. I think this will be helpful to all those who have not done Homa=
 themselves (including me). Once the mantras are perfect that the procedure=
