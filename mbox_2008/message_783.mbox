Regarding Brahamcharya)


Namaste,

lped. although, i write

uggeling !!!

I am a beggar like others. But I try to help other beggars by=
 showing the 
houses where they can try their luck by begging.

Normally, o=
ne beggar may view another beggar as a competitor and not like 
too many pe=
ople to beg in the same area. However, this begging is different 
and there=
 is no competition between different beggars. The owner of the 
house has e=
nough to give to every beggar and does not mind giving to many 
beggars at =
the same time if they are worthy.

Actually, if one beggar gets something, =
it will be so much that he/she can 
share some of it with all around him/he=
r. If you go with 100 other beggars 
and beg, you are better off. If any on=
e of them is able to melt the heart of 
the owner of the house, all the hun=
dred will benefit from it to varying 
degrees!

When I tell people about ex=
ternal practices such as homam and internal 
practices such as surrender an=
d detachment in actions, all I am really doing 
is to take fellow beggars i=
n front of a house where a rich person lives. If 
they are able to melt the=
 heart of the owner of the house, their begging 
will be fruitful. That is =
completely in *their* hands.

I am only a beggar who can show a place where=
 other beggars can beg and I am 
not really "capable" of anything more. Ple=
ase do not treat me in any other 
way.

When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritu=
al son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and 
Thakur himself saw themselves as be=
ggars in front of the Mother, mama kim 
kathaa (what is my story).

* * *

=
In general, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to =

spiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not=
 
built in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built i=
n a 
day! Be patient.

I have seen people change from inside out in a short=
 span of time. There is 
no need to panic or give up hope.

* * *

Be patie=
nt. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as 
Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 
Sankaracharya, Raman=
ujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, 
Buddha, Mahavira, =
Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. 
Try to integrate s=
ome of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and 
your life style=
. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner 
transformation. Th=
e archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired 
writings.

Nobody ca=
n change you. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if you really 
want to=
. Introspect and go to the root of your problems. If you introspect 
and an=
alyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root of it 
all. W=
henever something in life seems fundamentally important, question why. 
I a=
m not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze 
wh=
y it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh 
introspec=
tion will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, 
attachment a=
nd pride that often color one's attitude.

Introspect on your attitude and =
motives and contemplate on the nature of 
god. Meditate.

In this age, ther=
e is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, 
saying "I surr=
ender to you. So give me x or y" is NOT total surrender. Total 
surrender m=
eans you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and 
expectations. =
If you can manage it, you are all set!

* * *

Homam or worship of deities =
in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis. 
I know from experience th=
at it burns blocking karmas and enables the inner 
transformation. It is a =
very useful spiritual practice. I know people who 
made (and are making) co=
nsiderable spiritual progress through regular 
practice of homam. It is the=
 most powerful method I know of and teaching it 
is one of my tasks for thi=
s life.

Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and star=
t doing 
Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should switc=
h to 
Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by then). =
THAT 
should help you find your way in your spiritual life and strike the r=
ight 
balance between spiritual life and material life.

The purpose of mat=
erial life on this earth is to perform actions to pay back 
debts without i=
ncurring new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes 
smoother. Without p=
aying certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth. 
However, without=
 some spiritual progress, actions in material life create 
new debts. In th=
e beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the two 
and use the act=
ions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true 
spiritual progre=
ss, most people cannot and should not run away from material 
life.

Vasish=
tha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that action and 
knowled=
ge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Self flies and 
becomes =
liberated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, promote 
ego and=
 binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without action 
does no=
t become complete because of the remaining debts and one is stuck. 
One nee=
ds to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become free.

Best regard=
s,
Narasimha

<BR></FONT><BR>
<DIV id=3Dygrp-text>
<P>Namaste,<BR><BR>> Have patience =
! Narasimha is one of the right persons capable of<BR>> guiding you. If =
you are sincere, you'll be helped. although, i write<BR>> much now a day=
s, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!<BR><BR>I am a beggar like o=
thers. But I try to help other beggars by showing the <BR>houses where they=
 can try their luck by begging.<BR><BR>Normally, one beggar may view anothe=
r beggar as a competitor and not like <BR>too many people to beg in the sam=
e area. However, this begging is different <BR>and there is no competition =
between different beggars. The owner of the <BR>house has enough to give to=
 every beggar and does not mind giving to many <BR>beggars at the same time=
 if they are worthy.<BR><BR>Actually, if one beggar gets something, it will=
 be so much that he/she can <BR>share some of it with all around him/her. I=
f you go with 100 other beggars <BR>and beg, you are better off. If any one=
 of them is able to melt the
 heart of <BR>the owner of the house, all the =
hundred will benefit from it to varying <BR>degrees!<BR><BR>When I tell peo=
ple about external practices such as homam and internal <BR>practices such =
as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am really doing <BR>is to tak=
e fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person lives. If <BR>they=
 are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their begging <BR>wi=
ll be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.<BR><BR>I am only a beg=
gar who can show a place where other beggars can beg and I am <BR>not reall=
y "capable" of anything more. Please do not treat me in any other <BR>way.<=
BR><BR>When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
, and <BR>Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mother, =
mama kim <BR>kathaa (what is my story).<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>In general, to =
those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to <BR>spiritual p=
rogress and getting
 frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not <BR>built =
in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built in a <BR>=
day! Be patient.<BR><BR>I have seen people change from inside out in a shor=
t span of time. There is <BR>no need to panic or give up hope.<BR><BR>* * *=
<BR><BR>Be patient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis suc=
h as <BR>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, <B=
R>Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Chris=
t, <BR>Buddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are sa=
ying. <BR>Try to integrate some of it into your common sense, your way of t=
hinking and <BR>your life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practic=
es is inner <BR>transformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have s=
ome inspired <BR>writings.<BR><BR>Nobody can change you. You yourself can d=
o it. You CAN do it, if you really <BR>want to. Introspect and go to the ro=
ot of your
 problems. If you introspect <BR>and analyze each big problem, y=
ou will realize that ego is the root of it <BR>all. Whenever something in l=
ife seems fundamentally important, question why. <BR>I am not saying to lea=
ve it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze <BR>why it is importan=
t and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh <BR>introspection will eve=
ntually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, <BR>attachment and pride t=
hat often color one's attitude.<BR><BR>Introspect on your attitude and moti=
ves and contemplate on the nature of <BR>god. Meditate.<BR><BR>In this age,=
 there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, <BR>saying=
 "I surrender to you. So give me x or y" is NOT total surrender. Total <BR>=
surrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and <BR>=
expectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Ho=
mam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis.
=
 <BR>I know from experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables the i=
nner <BR>transformation. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know peo=
ple who <BR>made (and are making) considerable spiritual progress through r=
egular <BR>practice of homam. It is the most powerful method I know of and =
teaching it <BR>is one of my tasks for this life.<BR><BR>Dear Rajesh, try t=
o make some time in your daily schedule and start doing <BR>Mahaganapathi h=
omam everyday. After a few months, you should switch to <BR>Vishnu sahasra =
naama homam (I will put it up on my website by then). THAT <BR>should help =
you find your way in your spiritual life and strike the right <BR>balance b=
etween spiritual life and material life.<BR><BR>The purpose of material lif=
e on this earth is to perform actions to pay back <BR>debts without incurri=
ng new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes <BR>smoother. Without payi=
ng certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth. <BR>However,
 withou=
t some spiritual progress, actions in material life create <BR>new debts. I=
n the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the two <BR>and use =
the actions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true <BR>spirit=
ual progress, most people cannot and should not run away from material <BR>=
life.<BR><BR>Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that =
action and <BR>knowledge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Se=
lf flies and <BR>becomes liberated. Action without correct knowledge create=
s pride, promote <BR>ego and binds one further instead of liberating. Knowl=
edge without action <BR>does not become complete because of the remaining d=
ebts and one is stuck. <BR>One needs to have true knowledge and perform act=
ions, to become free.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ ---=
