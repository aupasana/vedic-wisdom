Dear Narasimha ji

Many of us will take the opportunity to do the Ganapati =
homam on the
coming vinayaka chathurthi. Do you have any additional advice =
to
follow on this occasion? Particularly, we need your advice for an
auspic=
ious moment to start the homam. Since many of us are living in
different ti=
me zone some hints of combination of planetary positions
will be helpful.

=
Best regards,
Swadhin
P.S. The following day will be Risi panchami for peop=
le to do a guru puja.
