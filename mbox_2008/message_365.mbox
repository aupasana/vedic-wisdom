Adarniya PVR Narasimha Guruji Namaskar,
=A0
Your explaination=A0was really =
excellent & enlightening & definitely can be given only by a person of your=
 calibre. 
=A0
I have a doubt since long which I request you=A0 please shed=
 some light on. I was curious to know about vedas & thus purchased the book=
s on vedas. It is said that VEDA contains all the knowledge & there are six=
 body's of vedas of which Jyotish is the eye of vedas. When I
looked at the=
 pages in the Veda book I find that there are Praises to Agni & other gods =
but do not find jyotish or other knowledge in it. Could you please elaborat=
e the content of the four vedas & say jyotish is part of which veda(Rig/Sam=
a/Yajur).
=A0
Regards

Namaste Sir,
=A0
Th=
ere is no need for either Sri or Ji in addressing me.
=A0
Hoping you won't =
mind, I am sending this reply to some yahoogroups that may have some intere=
sted people. When I was meditating before replying to you, a really beautif=
ul and meaningful analogy came to me and I think it is worth sharing with m=
ore people than just you. To ensure your anonymity, I removed references in=
 the quoted mail below that may help one identify you.

 in detail, because that can automatically answer other questions.

=A0
When people say what is =
in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. They are only fooling t=
hemselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or mastering a celebrated comme=
ntary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, understanding each single=
 verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is=
 neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingal=
a nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowing in Sus=
humna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but only with =
*revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expression, direct knowle=
dge.
=A0
When one meditates long enough on a verse, the verse may simply be=
 revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Vedic verse. Fo=
r most people, it is not possible to decipher even a single verse in an ent=
ire life, let alone a passage.
=A0
Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understand=
s Veda today. What are considered "pure vaidika rituals" are merely another=
 variety of rituals created by someone at some point of time. From the poin=
t of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no difference betwee=
n them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly believe otherwis=
e.

=A0
A simple analog=
y may help clarify a lot of things related to this complicated issue a litt=
le. What the thing in the analogy represents is shown here and there in squ=
are brackets [].
=A0
Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Br=
ahman/Aatman] . They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and=A0s=
ound of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice =
cryptic poems [Veda].
=A0
As people started living a little away from the s=
ea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruction=
s on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the ins=
tructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [ritu=
als].
=A0
People started moving further and further inland and started livi=
ng in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never =
seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performe=
d the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated en=
dlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and fo=
rmed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found=
 a tree or a building or some interesting object=A0and even became satisfie=
d that that was sea!
=A0
Then came some great person, whose instincts led h=
im to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use =
of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together ne=
wer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagam=
as].
=A0
People performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but t=
hen this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path =
and different from the "pure" sea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. By now, pe=
ople did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book o=
f sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure=
" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the=
 original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the =
newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew wher=
e they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!
=A0
Slowly man=
y new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and m=
any new paths to the sea were=A0outlined=A0instead of just instructing peop=
le to walk towards east=A0[evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].
=A0
One pa=
rticular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric =
paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine=A0etc]. Though the distance to =
sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and onl=
y the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wil=
d animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travell=
ing to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territ=
ory well=A0came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from tr=
ying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfu=
lly make it in that path desisted from it.
=A0
As time progressed, people s=
tarted fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, =
not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-calle=
d "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the =
changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly=
, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reachi=
ng the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought th=
ey were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no nee=
d to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condem=
ned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions f=
or their place and=A0time, for violating tradition.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
In case the analogy is not clear, here is =
a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes=
 various aspects of=A0the state of self-realization. That is why it is cons=
idered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on pos=
sible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on =
the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can b=
e made on how to reach it. The path depends on one's current position!
=A0
=
Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it=
, came, experienced that state, understood the current state of people arou=
nd them=A0and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from th=
e current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. =
Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.
=A0
Pleas=
e re-read the story and try to understand what each part of the story repre=
sents. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the mea=
ningless nature of so many debates that people waste time with!

=A0
He did condem=
n some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, al=
cohol, meat etc.
=A0
However, please go back to my analogy. A great man may=
 condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild a=
nimals and=A0dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost th=
eir lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means th=
at too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of lat=
e and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.
=A0
If the same =
great man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he h=
as a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path an=
d instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!
=A0
The words of =
great masters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaal=
a and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth=
.

> 3. What is va=
machara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,
> why must it be =
practiced at all?
=A0
Suppose one's house is close to the market and the ma=
rket noise reaches one's house. Suppose that noise=A0is disturbing one's me=
ditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are =
two approaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of =
solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right ther=
e and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. g=
et mastery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnera=
ble to this disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the probl=
em - the problem is the *inability* of one's mind to turn off that sensory =
input. By controlling one's mind, one can focus attention on god irrespecti=
ve of what is happening outside.
=A0
Approach (1) is not bad. If one is wea=
k-minded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approac=
h (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind a=
nd can succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one's progress.
=
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Vaamaachaara is als=
o like that, but a more extreme form of testing one's self-control by risin=
g to the challenge.
=A0
Please realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not abo=
ut the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to te=
st oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one's self-control. Self-r=
ealization comes when self-control is perfect and one's mind can always be =
focussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either att=
racted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization=
.
=A0
However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara.=
 One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure y=
ogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind eve=
n when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly e=
mbracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. Bu=
t, if that is going to=A0tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a p=
hysical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does =
not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude a=
nd hone one's self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the=
 focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, m=
eat and sex should stay away from those.
=A0

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
In my analogy before, the short jungle path to the=
 sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaacha=
ara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill th=
e wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, o=
ne who wants self-realization using this path will fall if one does not hav=
e perfect self-control. If one takes this path because it sounds cool or ex=
citing, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.
=A0
=
If there is ANY weakness in one's self-control, one can NOT follow this pat=
h. Just as there are many paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, t=
here are many paths to self-realization. One should follow the path that is=
 appropriate for one based on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.=

=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
> Is it not a fact=
 that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 
=A0
:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine Mother=
) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All knowledge,=
 all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different manifestat=
ions.
=A0
If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=A0sits naked =
with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his mind f=
ully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all different =
manifestations of the Divine Mother only.
=A0
As a matter of fact, even if =
one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires an=
d actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Moth=
er gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of respons=
ibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She tak=
es the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are a=
ctually Her manifestations only.
=A0
However, those who are more comfortabl=
e with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will lo=
ok at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in =
duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is =
that She is All.
=A0
I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a=
 few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yahoogrou=
ps or to me privately.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mant=

2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemne=

There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on one's current position!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Please re-read the story and try to understand what each part of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people waste time with!</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> Sri Adi Sankara condemn? </FONT></DIV></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>He did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>However, please go back to my analogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild animals and dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> why must it be practiced at all?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Suppose one's house is close to the market and the market noise reaches one's house. Suppose that noise is disturbing one's meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of one's mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one's mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one's progress.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>*        *        *</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing one's self-control by rising to the challenge.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Please realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one's self-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is perfect and one's mind can always be focussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one's self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from those.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>*        *        *</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>In my analogy before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>If there is ANY weakness in one's self-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>> Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different manifestations.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As a matter of fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are actually Her manifestations only.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>However, those who are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is that She is All.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yahoogroups or to me privately.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Namaskarams. Hope you remember me. I am a friend of <deleted> of <deleted> temple, brother of <deleted>. We met a couple of years ago in <deleted> temple.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have a few doubts. I would like to hear your opinion on the same.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras (people explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas, but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc, why must it be practiced at all? Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I am a little (totally) confused. Hope your reply takes me out of the well to ask you more questions</FONT></DIV>
