Dear Utpal,

I misunderstood the mail in which you simply shared a quote. I realized it 
after sending the mail below.

BTW, the fact that Ramakrishna mentioned this to Sarada Mata and Lakshmi and 
the fact that Sarada Mata thought it fit to recount this to others means 
that there is some purpose behind this revelation.

In any case, if those people indeed come back to earth to take part in 
another play, it should be good for sanatana dharma.

Best regards,
Narasimha
