Namaste Utpal,

My best wishes to all on the occasion of Ksheeraabdhi Dwaadashi!

One of the two saints could be Thakur. It is also possible that neither is 
Thakur.

Bottomline is that it does not really matter!

If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit from them. Beings 
like Thakur are born out of free volition and out of compassion for other 
beings. They are the playmates of the Mother and are reborn as a part of Her 
plan. They are born to show the path to others. However, there are many 
paths. In each life, they may take up a different mission and demonstrate 
different paths to people through their teachings and deeds. If you like the 
teachings of such a being in a specific birth, due to some rina with the 
path taught in that birth, follow the teachings of that birth. Who else the 
same being was in other births is not that relevant or useful.

If you are attracted to the teachings of any saint - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa 
or Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yogeshwar ji or Ramana Maharshi or Aurobindo or 
Srila Prabhupada or Akkalkot Maharaj or Sai Baba or Kabir or Samartha 
Ramadas or Jnaneshwar Maharaj or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or Ramanujacharya or 
Raghavedra Swami or Gautama Buddha or Jesus Christ or whoever, follow the 
teachings of that saint and benefit from them. Other speculative things 
about them may be interesting, but can turn out to be a mere distraction.

Find the teachings and path that attracts you the most. Read the teachings. 
More importantly, try to *walk* the path. Imbibe the teachings in your 
thinking and in your common sense. Your actions and thoughts should reflect 
the teachings. Focus on the teachings of the saint, digest them fully and 
base your thoughts and actions on them.

*        *        *

Regarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent to which he 
imbibed the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, the depth of 
his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute lack of personal ego 
in him are the real miracles to me. Other miracles are useful to instill 
faith and confidence in some people. But they do not do justice to his 
personality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscious of possibly 
limiting Thakur's personality to a bunch of miracles and was concerned if 
books on him would be able to do justice to his personality.

If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters into spiritual 
giants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila Prabhupada 
transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who changed the world, 
it was possible because of their *total* surrender to the Lord and the 
zeroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true miracle.

I do not want to downplay the discussion of other tangible miracles. But I 
do not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.

Ramakrishna could do miracles because he had no ego and surrendered fully to 
Her. *She* did everything for him.

As I said earlier, a person with normal ego can do some things; a person 
with very little personal ego can do tremendous things; and, a person with 
*no* personal ego can do *any* thing. Our goal should be to eradicate 
personal ego through constant vigilance and total surrender.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste,

one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma
Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.

Another as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that
Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about
his past life and he also indirectly indicated in his biography that
he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous birth.

Yours,

Utpal
