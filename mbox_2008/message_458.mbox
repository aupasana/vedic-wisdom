is because of that very fad that =
we are celebrating all our festivals

 arguments are really tamasic---
like "I do not know much about astronomy (=
and by implication it means 
that he/she knows everything about astrology t=
hough!)" is the stock 
reply of most of them. All the Hindus are now a days=
 least bothered 
about celebrating Pitra-Amavasya on the day of actual Dipa=
vali which 
is on September 28, 2008, but they do not want to hear even a s=
ingle 
word against "Vedic astrology"! They celebrated marriages in actual =

Pitrapaksha because "Vedic astrologes" had okayed those dates! What is 
su=
rprising is that in spite of being well read, most of the Hindus

 all sense of basic Primary school level geography!They have 
become oblivi=

Uttarayana on January 15 and Daks=
hinayana on July 15 and so on!In

to have become clones of Maya 
the mlechha just because of their fatal infa=
