Namaste Utpal ji,

Ramayana and Mahabharata are collectively referred as it=
ihAsa in our
tradition. The word itihAsa translates literally to "so it hap=
pened".

Also, please refer to the numerous close attempts at astronomicall=
y
dating the Mahabharata by Shri Narahari Achar
<http://sarasvati96.googlep=
ages.com/reclaimingthechronologyofbharatam%3A\
narahariachar%28july2006%29>=
  , Shri P V Vartak
<http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/mahabhar=
at/mahab_vartak.h\
tml>   etc. that confirms the time period according to i=
nternal
references within the epic.

And my brief responses to your questio=
ns are as follows

1) Mahatma Gandhi, the Great Soul he indeed was, wasn't =
a scholar in
Indic traditions and studies (religious, historical etc). He h=
ad other
nobler tasks to concentrate his energies on. So we need not rely o=
n his
judgement/opinions on these matters

2) The original names were 'suyO=
dhan, sushAsan' etc. The 'du' prefix was
substituted after the fact to indi=
cate the negative side of ethics and
morality these people were.

3) This l=
ooks just an opinion with no substantiation and hence I'll
leave this.

4) =
Shri Raman's reasoning is valid but not sufficient (if that is all he
state=
d and not any more)

5) Very true. By extendsion and generalization, if vyA=
sa was a con
artist, what does he have to benefit from painting a character=
 as God?

6) I don't think there is any dispute about whether Rama or Krish=
na were
born. True that there are disputes on their era, divinity etc. but =
I did
not come across any disputes about their very existence many millenia=

ago.

To establish any Truth conclusively, it is not possible by relying o=
n
others but by genuinely embarking on the search ourselves and employing
a=
ll our faculties towards that. Otherwise, it just remains our
prejudiced ch=
oice of which scholar's opinion to value over other.

Regards,
-Prasad
