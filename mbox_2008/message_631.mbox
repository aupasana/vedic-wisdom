Does it matter at all who is w=
hose reincarnation? And anyway, how will
you distinguish when *those* very =
folks have gone beyond the meaning
of "I"? What you can only do (well, at l=
east, IMHO) is consider
yourself blessed to read about or be part of their =
lives...
One part of me is skeptical whenever someone claims to be a
reinca=
rnation of someone else, on the other hand we are all a part of
Divinity, s=
o why bother arguing over trivial things.

What the Learned say is to pick =
one, and surrender yourself totally.
Me, I cant figure out who to pick to s=
urrender to... :-) Just my
opinion, I could be wrong, and I say it with all=
 due respect...
Best,
./Dinesh
