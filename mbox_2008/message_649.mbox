Dear Ramakrishnaji
=C2=A0
I had once met a very genuine sadhak for whom I h=
ave a huge amount of respect. This person was telling me about the 64 kalas=
. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but let me=
 try and reproduce whatever I could understand.
=C2=A0
He showed me an old =
diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like a=
 whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 kal=
as. Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" placed at various places on the=
 circle. At the centre was atmavidya. 
He said these 64 represent 64 differ=
ent kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in this phs=
yical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. =
It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physical body=
. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purna avatar.
=
=C2=A0
Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of o=
ne more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going into other s=
ubtle realms. 
=C2=A0
For an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I me=
an perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptional=
 feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.
=C2=A0
Now t=
his 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all aspects of=C2=
=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughl=
y 1/4th. 
=C2=A0
While talking about this, he was also trying to explain to=
 me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree=
 should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him to be able=
 to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking m=
ostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which a=C2=A0 rea=
lly spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whether he had =
use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross "asudha tattwas" of this physi=
cal plane of existence. 
=C2=A0
Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbl=
ed up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of un=
derstanding.

-Regards

Namaste Dinesh,

> One part of me is skeptical whenever som=
eone claims to be a

Your skepticism is ju=
stified.

The duality is infinite and impossible to master. Even great jnaa=
nis are 
occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested=
 non-dual 
Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully =
ever. She is 
capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong id=
ea as soon as 
one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anyt=
hing*. What She 
does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The =
only way to deal 
with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.

> on the =
other hand we are all a part of Divinity

BTW, though we are all part of th=
e same Divinity, we are all not the same. 
In the non-dual field, we are al=
l the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
have differences due to previ=
ous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what 
and how much we can do with=
in the dual world. When a being like Krishna is 
born with 16 kalas, He can=
 do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. 
When a being like Sai B=
aba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of 
things in the dual world=
 that are impossible for others.

Realizing the non-dual Self is something =
that is possible for anyone, but 
there are limits imposed on what things o=
ne can do in the dual world, based 
on the force of previous conditioning. =
Thus, all are the same at one 
(non-dual) level and all are different at an=
other (dual) level.

But it is tough to know for sure what one's caliber is=
. Thus, your basic 
point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are no=
t indeed the same. We 
should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not =
because all are the 
same, but because we have no surefire way to know who =
is what.

Best regards,
Narasimha

 duality is infinite and impossible to master. Even great jnaanis are <BR>o=
ccasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual =
<BR>Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever. S=
he is <BR>capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea a=
s soon as <BR>one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anyth=
ing*. What She <BR>does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. Th=
e only way to deal <BR>with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.<BR><B=

e are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. <BR>In the no=
n-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we <BR>hav=
e differences due to previous vasanas
 (conditioning) , which decide what <=
BR>and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna =
is <BR>born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dua=
l world. <BR>When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can d=
o a lot of <BR>things in the dual world that are impossible for others.<BR>=
<BR>Realizing the non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, b=
ut <BR>there are limits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world=
, based <BR>on the force of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same a=
t one <BR>(non-dual) level and all are different at another (dual) level.<B=
R><BR>But it is tough to know for sure what one's caliber is. Thus, your ba=
sic <BR>point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the=
 same. We <BR>should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because a=
ll are the <BR>same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is wha=
