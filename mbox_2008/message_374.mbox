Namaste Tijana,
 
Thank you for a nice exposition. What you wrote is well-t=
aken.

That is absolute=
ly correct. Brahmacharya and control of one's sexual thoughts is quite need=
ed to make spiritual progress.
 
If anybody maintains brahmacharya for one =
year while performing a 45 minute homam everyday or meditating with Gayatri=
 mantra (or some other mantra) for 3 hours everyday, definitely he/she will=
 cross some important hurdles and make some good progress.

Chastity=
 and brahmacharya are *equally important* for men and women to make spiritu=
al progress. But the level of difficulty one experiences in controlling the=
 mind depends on various factors such as gender and, more importantly, ment=
al conditioning acquired from previous lives.
 
> At least, Somannath dreka=
na should be checked for the period of poojas

t celibacy vow that is usually required in

m is spiritual elevation. 
 
Well, two relevant points:
 
(1) The astrology=
 we know and understand is imperfect without a doubt. Even knowledge taught=
 unambiguously by Maharshi Parasara is so misunderstood in this age. Then w=
hat to speak of knowledge not found in the available teachings of Parasara =
and available in the "secrets" of various paramparas? It is quite prone to =
corruptions and misunderstanding. Can we *rely* on it?
 
(2) Astrology, eve=
n when understood perfectly, only predicts the predisposition at a given ti=
me due to the dynamics of *previous* actions (karmas). The dynamics of prev=
ious actions decides under what kind of circumstances one has to operate no=
w. Those circumstances can place *limitations* on what actions can be perfo=
rmed *now*. Depending on the seriousness of previous actions deciding the c=
urrent circumstances, the limitations can be either mere challenges or seri=
ous handicaps. But, in most cases, there are multiple actions possible curr=
ently. Horoscope only decides the situations faced now. The actions perform=
ed *now* are based on *free will* exerted now, which is NOT captured by the=
 horoscope.
 
If there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual pr=
ogress is definitely *the* thing. One should push one's free will to the ex=
treme when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth it! Forget somanatha=
 drekkana and other tenets of astrology. When the inspiration comes from wi=
thin, just boldly take a vow, pray to god and your guru (if you have no gur=
u, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish Pandit) and do your best to keep the vo=
w.
 
*        *        *
 
Even if one cannot keep brahmacharya, one can st=
ill do spiritual practices like homam and japam. It will atleast keep one f=
loating (i.e. not sinking). Basically, one will keep accumulating shakti (p=
urity) and keep consuming it. So purification is slow. But atleast there is=
 no further impurification. With brahmacharya, one can actually start accum=
ulating shakti and purify oneself much faster.
 
*        *        *
 
Rega=
rding women doing sadhanas:
 
A great Vedic scholar known as Upasani mahara=
j lived at the time of Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 years back. He was learne=
d in several Vedas and Upanishads and did tremendous sadhana. Once he reali=
zed Self, he threw away his orthodoxy and went against the customs of the t=
ime boldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untouchables colony), swept t=
he floors there and forced the Brahmins from Brahmanawada (Brahmins colony)=
 who revered him highly to come *there* if they wanted to see him! He opene=
d a Vedic school for women and taught them chanting Vedic mantras and perfo=
rming traditional yajnas. He gave women of all births sacred thread and ini=
tiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.
 
When Shridi Sai Baba saw him o=
neday, he said "Upasani is God Himself. Today we will do pooja to Upasani!"=
 and made his disciples do a pooja to Upasani maharaj.
 
A temple run by wo=
men stands in the place of Upasani maharaj, a few miles away from Shirdi. I=
f anyone goes to Shirdi, it is a good idea to go to that temple. Though it =
has no rush, it has very nice energy. It is a great place to meditate.
 
Al=
so, Krishna temple at Alandi near Pune where Sant Jnaneshwar Maharaj went i=
nto underground samadhi 700 years back (believed to be there even now) has =
a tremendous level of spiritual energy. It is also a great place for produc=
tive meditation.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
