Namaste,
 
Well, if you read it loud, others can hear you! That is not a ba=
d thing after all.
 
In general, chanting in the mind without sound is bett=
er.
 
When doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended. Even if there =
is some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that is enough. Tha=
t is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration of air). When y=
ou rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (sound) forms a =
connection between you and fire. You use that fire then to create powerful =
subtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can generate.
 
When doi=
ng japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal cords having any movement=
 is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better that way. When relying on t=
he internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound is not needed and avoid=
ing it can help focus the energy and generate stronger subtle vibrations.
 =

*        *        *
 
You were earlier asking about skipping some things v=
s doing everything fully, in Chandipath. An interesting experience happened=
 in my daily Chandi homam in the very morning after I replied to you. I thi=
nk it was a Chaturdasi morning. I finished the homam and was about to offer=
 poornaahuti. There are a few Vedic mantras that I normally read before poo=
rnaahuti. The fire was burning very bright. I closed my eyes, kept the poor=
naahuti on my head and started to chant the mantras. But suddenly I got thi=
s palpable feeling that the Mother was standing in front of me in the fire =
and asking me to hurry up. It felt very strongly like she was saying "enoug=
h with those mantras. They do not matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti,=
 NOW." I did not think much. I surrendered fully to Her as manifested in my=
 mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, but I surrendered to Her a=
s She existed in my mind at that time. I left the standard mantras and just=
 said "om aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vaushat" and offered the dr=
y coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With eyes closed still, I went in=
to meditation immediately. I had a really nice meditation session.
 
Best r=
egards,
Narasimha

        In my journey of 60 years, somebody guided me like this with aut=

        It is also stat=

          =EF=BB=BF 
          Namaste,

         =
 1. The instruction was to spread homam and create a community of sadhakas =
across the world who worship various deities in fire. It can be any deities=
.

          2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sense=
 of discipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting b=
efore or after.

          Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas=
 and moola mantra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and de=
vi sooktam are recommended after.

          However, in my humble opinion,=
 nothing is really compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be v=
ery powerful after a while. I see nothing wrong in it.

          3. Both a=
re correct and work differently. However, those who try who pronounce the b=
eeja mantras as "aing hreeng" invariably misponounce them. The "g" becomes =
explicit. Ideally, you should start pronouncing as though you are going to =
say "aing" and abruptly stop just when you are about to say "g", without sa=
ying it. It is not easy to pronounce this correctly.

          Instead of =
trying "aing hreeng" and messing it up, it is better to just say "aim hreem=
".

          *        *        *

          Internal purity and lack (or m=
inimization) of individualized ego is the key in any sadhana. Thousands of =
hours of sadhana without them is fruitless. One who is pure and has a very =
limited ego achieves results quickly.

          There is a lot of misinfor=
mation and unfounded fears that are spread regarding Chandi path. Do not wo=
rry about them.

          Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desser=
ts before and after a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion =
from it too. If the meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy it w=
ithout appetizers or dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and positive=
ly to get the most energy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read with a=
 sense of surrender and limited ego.

          Instead of doing everything=
 with a lower focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focu=
s.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

                  2.Please also gu=
ide me whether really we should read Chandi Path or Sapta Sati Stotra with =

                  3. Can you guide me the proper uttering of Beej Mantras =

                    Namaste friends,

                    Excellent=
 and inspirational writeup Narayan!

                    * * *

           =
         Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She a=
ppeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam,=
 to spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish =
did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that=
 time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should=
 teach a simple procedure to him.

                    I experimented with =
homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick pro=
cedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down =
to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual=
 for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people =
in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and man=
y other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my min=
d concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to =
start doing homam, many people across the world started with him. What a fo=
rtunate soul..

                    * * *

                    It was proba=
bly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=
other asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would've been different=
 while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic and also hurrie=
d more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=
weet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=
ny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =
benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=
ad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =
same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.

  =
                  Manish told me the full story only when I was better prep=
ared to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of=
 the manual as asked by him then.

                    * * *

             =
       A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can =
wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.

                   =
 One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day med=
itating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came=
 out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he =
only said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before sunrise and went on =
till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for ba=
th and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I w=
as basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =
It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the=
 day.

                    I noticed on the next day that the previous day =
was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very aus=
picious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 t=
imes more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, =
I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned thi=
s to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew it ear=
lier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would've distracted =
you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya a=
nd that excitement would've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas=
 into the sadhana."

                    He was absolutely right. As such, =
I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and =
limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing thi=
s sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and excitement=
, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is=
 a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can s=
uddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's words, I introspec=
ted and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise =
not to feed it with more delicious food!

                    Lucky are tho=
se who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than w=
hat sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can =
go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it=
 out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.
=

                    * * *

                    I remember one more similar=
 incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect=
 a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at m=
e, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very clos=
e to him and that I would do some important work in this birth.

          =
          When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He imm=
ediately became serious and said "Narasimha, do you need one more identity?=
 Your ego is already strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit s=
cholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha=
, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take great effort to overcome those id=
entities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you=
 really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what h=
e said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. Yo=
u have to rise above all identities."

                    How true and wis=
e!

                    * * *

                    Just as a fat and mighty=
 dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the mas=
ter, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over the spirit of d=
etachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain=
 the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try t=
o restrain ego and increase detachment.

                    Manish has a u=
nique way of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so mu=
ch clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. =
Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do=
, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light=
 were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was block=
ing the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick la=
yer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the la=
mp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to n=
otice that dirt ourselves..

                    * * *

                   =
 Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should a=
lso try to introspect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There=
 is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment=
 or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, on=
e should start walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the=
 distance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the g=
oal.

                    The point I want to emphasize is that the externa=
l rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) =
should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them a=
nd they will start to work together very effectively.

                    =

<DIV>You were earlier asking about skipping=
 some things vs doing everything 
fully, in Chandipath. An interesting expe=
rience happened in my daily Chandi 
homam in the very morning after I repli=
ed to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi 
morning. I finished the homam and w=
as about to offer poornaahuti. There are a 
few Vedic mantras that I normal=
ly read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning 
very bright. I closed my =
eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to 
chant the mantras. Bu=
t suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mother was 
standing in fro=
nt of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It felt very 
strongly like=
 she was saying "enough with those mantras. They do not matter now. 
Just g=
ive me the poornaahuti, NOW." I did not think much. I surrendered fully to =

Her as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, bu=
t I 
surrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that time. I left the =
standard 
mantras and just said "om aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche v=
aushat" and 
offered the dry coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With e=
yes closed still, 
I went into meditation immediately. I had a really nice =
meditation 
session.</DIV>

addition to Narayan are able to do homam 
                    using the man=

                 =

               probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the

                    and mental state would've been different while workin=

                    Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the=
 correct

      =
              of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told 
 =
                   Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I start=
ed 
                    before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for=
 3-4 
                    breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath =
and a small 
                    lunch and another 10 min break for another=
 bath at dusk, I 
                    was basically sitting in the same pla=
ce and meditating with 
                    Gayatri mantra. It was a very g=
ood experience. I was in a 
                    very nice state at the end =
of the day.<BR><BR>I noticed on 
                    the next day that the =
previous day was Akshaya Triteeya 
                    (Vaisakha Sukla Trit=
eeya). It is considered a very 
                    auspicious day and it i=
s believed that spiritual sadhana on 
                    that day is 1000 =
times more powerful than on other days. 
                    Though I had n=
ot noticed it before, I picked a perfect day 
                    for the s=
adhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to

 with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I

                    =
knowing it would've distracted you. You would have been

  excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that 
              =
      excitement would've changed the mental focus and brought 
           =
         more rajas into the sadhana."<BR><BR>He was absolutely 
          =
          right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The 
     =
               ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on =

                    the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadha=
na on 
                    a powerful day, it would've increased the pride =
and 
                    excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saatt=
wik focus 
                    on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous e=

                    after one makes excellent progress, it can=
 suddenly return 
                    and pull one down! After hearing Mani=
