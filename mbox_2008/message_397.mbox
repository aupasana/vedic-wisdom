Dear Swadhin ji and others,

It is a great day for worshipping Mahaganapathi or starting a new sadhana.

One possibility is Virgo lagna, an hour or so after sunrise. Lagna would be 
powerful with 1st, 9th (dharma and bhagya) and 10th (karma) lords and also 
the 8th lord (tapascharya).

Jupiter in lagna is great for sadhana. Thus, Sagittarius lagna is great. 
That may not work out for several people, as it is in the early afternoon.

Also, Pisces lagna would be good. Lagna lord Jupiter in 10th, Sun and Saturn 
in 6th and Rahu in 11th would be well-placed. Aries lagna would have a 
powerful 6th house of siddhi and 9th house of dharma and bhagya.

Best regards,
Narasimha
