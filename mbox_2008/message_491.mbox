Dear Narasimhaji

I had a question I wanted to get clarified regarding homa=
s. It was in 
2006 that I had been doing the japa of a certain mantra for a=
lmost the 
whole year. I had come across the mantra in a strange way, but n=
one 
the less I kept chanting the mantra. The deity is Lord Bhairav. 

At t=
he end of that year suddenly due to some events I got an chance to 
visit t=
he kumb mela as well as the Kal Bhairav and Vatuk Bhairav 
temples in Kasi.=
 After I came back from there, I wanted to learn how 
to do a homa, but I c=
ould not find anyone to teach me the same. So one 
day I decided on doing a=
 homa in my own way, which I realized after 
reading your homa manuals, was=
 ridden with innumerable mistakes. 

The basic procedure I followed was dra=
wing the yantra of the deity in 
the homa kunda, then praying to my deity, =
Lord Ganapati and the Divine 
Mother to forgive all mistakes. And next I wo=
uld straight away start 
off with the main mantra and its ahuti in fire. Th=
at used to me the 
major part of the homa. And I loved watching the peculia=
r behaviour of 
the fire in the homa kunda. 

I had done this kind of (comp=
letely wrong) homa at least ten/fifteen 
times in the last one year.. 

Aft=
er reading the homa manuals I have understood the innumerable 
mistakes tha=
t I had done in the name of doing a homa. But somehow I 
liked the experine=
ces very much. 

I wanted to ask you, can I continue the way I was doing or=
 is there 
something I need to do to rectify all the mistakes that I have 
=
commited till now.. Waiting for your guidance..

-Regards
 Rajarshi
