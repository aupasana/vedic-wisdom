Dear Prasad Bhai,
namaste !!!

Thank you very much your very nice response.=


yes, i belive that krishna was a realiry, with in my heart that is 
witho=
ut doubt. It is just, the *head* comes in questioning when some 
skeptics q=
uestion about the very existence of Mahabhaarat or 
Raamaayan. some time it=
 is a sincere query also. some time you think 
yourself also about it.


ye=
s it is 'Iti Haas'. 'it Happened' and not epic.

in case of mahatma Gandhi,=
 I just gave opinion of him but i don't 
endorse his view in this matter.

=
Su-Yodhan and Su Shaasan - its a revealation for me.i never new 
this. Than=
ks but can you give me reference about that and who 
changed the names? - t=
his will be very good point which has bothered 
me.

Regarding, prooving th=
e Mahaabhaarat events with astronomical 
combination, can hardly be taken a=
s proof because while writing his 
creation, Maharshi Vyaasa would have tak=
en combination of those 
times. - this is just another argument by Logical =
view.

Swami Vivekananda, in his work 'Shri Krishna & Bhagvad Gita' 
mentio=
ns That whether Shri Kishna was a reality or Not, gita's 
message is great.=
 it gives eternal knowledge.

I've made argument with some people in the pa=
st that "if modern 
History has not recorded the world events does not mean=
 that the 
existance of human beings was not there on the earth. in other w=
ords 
modern history can never be the only 'Pramaan' for judging reality 
o=
f ancient events and personalities.  

Finally it seems, that it might rema=
in, matter of our heart and 
beliefs.

Best Regards,

Utpal
