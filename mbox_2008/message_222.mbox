Namaste learned friends,
 
Thank you for sharing this with us. This informa=
tion is very valuable.
 
I want to make a critical comment on an astrologic=
al factor mentioned below. Please forgive me if this is out of line.
 
> It=
 is even more interesting that this Ashtami falls on the star
> Swati. The =
ruling planet of the stars Tiruvadirai, Swati and
> Sadayam is Rahu. The Go=
ddess who rules over Rahu is the
> all-powerful Goddess Durga Parameswari.
=
 
It is simplistic to use planetary associations of nakshatras like this. T=
hough a lot of people say things like this, such thinking is incorrect and =
relatively modern. Rahu owns Swathi only as per the Vimsottari dasa scheme.=
 Maharshi Parasara taught tens of dasa schemes, though people ignore all th=
ose now. For example, the ruling planet of Swathi nakshatra is Mars as per =
Ashtottari dasa, Venus as per Shodasottari dasa, Sun as per Yogini dasa, Me=
rcury as per Shat-trimsa sama dasa, Sun as per Chaturaseeti sama dasa, Moon=
 as per Sataabdika dasa and so on. Then why take Rahu only?
 
Ruling planet=
s of nakshatras based on specific dasa schemes like Vimsottari are not of m=
uch importance. Ruling deities of nakshatras taught by rishis in nakshatra =
sooktam are far more important.
 
For example, Sravana nakshatra is conside=
red auspicious for Vishnu pooja. It is not because Moon is the ruling plane=
t of Sravanam. It is because Vishnu is the ruling deity of Sravanam as per =
nakshatra sooktam. Suryopanishat says "yo hastaaditye japati sa mahaamrityu=
m tarati" (whoever chants this when Sun is in Hasta nakshatra crosses death=
). As per Vimsottari ruling planets, Hasta is owned by Moon. However, that =
is immaterial. The actual reason is that Hasta is ruled by Savita (a form o=
f Sun) as per nakshatra sooktam. That is why it is important for Sun's wors=
hip. Though the ruling planet of both Asresha and Revati is Mercury, the fo=
rmer is considered very inauspicious for most activities and the latter is =
auspicious. It is because its ruling deity of the former is Sarpa (snake) a=
nd the latter is Pooshan as per nakshatra sooktam.
 
We should get out of t=
he habit of paying attention to the Vimsottari dasa ruling planets of naksh=
atras and instead pay attention to the nakshatra sookta ruling deities. The=
 former is of no significance.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ys and Phalas - English Translation


  Namaskar.

            This is the =
English translation of Weekly Vrata Days/Phalas by Shri Shanmukha Sivachary=
ar on Sun TV every Sunday. Shri Deepa has taken lots of pains to make this =
available for us. Also we will be attaching this as a word document in our =
files section.

  28 Jan 2008, Monday. Krishna Pak=
sha Shashti Vratam



  This day falls on the 14th day of the Tamil month T=
hai, on a Monday. On this day, one must observe the Krishna Paksha Shashti =
Vratam. As we've seen already, Krishna Paksha is the waning fortnight.  Sha=
shti means the sixth day.



  Monday, called Soma vaara, is significant be=
cause it is a day when the all-powerful Lord Shiva is one with his Shakti U=
ma. It is "Sa + Uma" vaara, hence Soma Vaara. 



  If you remember, we alr=
eady realized that out of the six faces of Lord Muruga, five faces are Lord=
 Shiva's and one face is the face of Ambal. He thus signifies the union of =
Shiva and Shakti.



  Thus, the day of Lord Muruga on Shashti, coinciding =
with a Soma Vaara is especially auspicious.



  They say, "Sattiyil irundh=
aal thaan agappaiyil varum" - It actually means that if one observes the vr=
atam on Shashti, the Grace of Lord Muruga will bless her with progeny. We a=
lso believe that a family gets every prosperity and Sowbhagya by worshippin=
g Lord Muruga. 





  30 Jan 2008, Wednesday. Ashtami Vratam



  This day=
 falls on the 16th day of the Tamil month Thai, on a Wednesday. On this day=
, one must observe the Ashtami Vratam.  We saw earlier that Ashtami means t=
he eighth day. This day is especially auspicious for the propitiation of Go=
ddess Durga, Lord Muruga and Lord Bhairava. Also, Ashtami and Chaturdashi t=
ithis are said to be the best days for the performance of abhisheka to Lord=
 Shiva.



  It is even more interesting that this Ashtami falls on the sta=
r Swati. The ruling planet of the stars Tiruvadirai, Swati and Sadayam is R=
ahu. The Goddess who rules over Rahu is the all-powerful Goddess Durga Para=
meswari. One must make an effort to visit any neighbouring temple and offer=
 prayers to Goddess Durga on this doubly significant day. 



  `Durgam' me=
ans grief or kashtam. By propitiating Goddess Durga Parameswari, it is our =
belief that we will be freed from all misery and grief, and be blessed with=
 every prosperity and happiness.










   

  02 Feb 2008, Saturday. Sa=
rva Ekadashi



  This day falls on the 19th day of the Tamil month Thai, o=
n a Wednesday. On this day, one must observe the Sarva Ekadashi Vratam.  It=
 is significant that this Ekadashi falls on a Saturday. This Ekadashi is ca=
lled Saphala Ekadashi. What does `Saphala' mean? `Phala' means fruit - ever=
y action that we do is directed towards achieving an objective. The shastra=
s say, "Nakuryaat nishphalam karma," which means, do not do that action tha=
t does not result in any fruit. 



  Yes, Lord Krishna says, do not `expec=
t' the fruits of your action. This is different from the action not resulti=
ng in any fruit at all. The shastra here says that every action should be p=
erformed in order to achieve some end result, which is the phalam or fruit =
of that action. Lord Krishna says we must not claim ownership of this actio=
n. 



  For e.g., gossiping about someone unnecessarily, banging the table=
 without purpose, sitting idly, etc. are actions that are fruitless. If you=
 entrust an activity with someone, and he does not do justice to it, will y=
ou trust him again with the same activity?  No. Similarly, the time on eart=
h has been given to us for a reason. The Lord has blessed us with this life=
 so we may lead a rich and fulfilling life and we must do justice to this t=
ime given to us.



  The Saphala Ekadashi bestows upon us all the fruits r=
equired to lead a fulfilling life. Since it also falls on a Saturday, which=
 we have seen is the Stithikarakan and the day of Lord Vishnu, the very Lor=
d whom we pray to on this day, it is our belief that He will grant every bl=
essing required for our lives on this day.  














   

  04 Feb 20=
08, Monday. Soma Maha Pradosham



  This day falls on the 21st day of the =
Tamil month Thai, on a Monday. On this day, one must observe the Soma Maha =
Pradosha Vratam.  Pradosha, as seen earlier, is "Pra + dosha" - a time when=
 even the most wicked evil can be removed. This is even more powerful as it=
 falls on a Monday. 



  This is called Yogam. A zero next to one, makes i=
t ten. If you add another zero next to it, it now becomes hundred. Things g=
et value by what they are associated with. Similarly, when pradosham is ass=
ociated with a Monday, it becomes even more significant. 



  Shivam itsel=
f means mangalam, all goodness personified. It is our belief that we will a=
ttain every kind of mangalam in our lives, by offering prayers at a neighbo=
uring Shiva temple on this day. 



  06 Feb 2008, Wednesday. Thai Amavasya=
, Sravana Vratam



  This day falls on the 23rd day of the Tamil month Tha=
i, on a Wednesday. On this day, one must observe the Thai Amavasya Vratam. =
 "Vratam" means to control. It is something that disciplines us. Why is it =
significant on an Amavasya? Amavasya is a day for our Pitru - ancestors. Wh=
ether one worships the Lord or visits the temples, it does not matter - one=
 must worship one's parents while they are alive. 



  What does worship m=
ean? Making them sit and offering flowers? No, that's not the only meaning =
of worship. It also means to care for them in the best possible way. But fo=
r them, we wouldn't be here - be it a millionaire or a pauper, we all need =
parents to enter this world. Our parents are verily, the Lord Incarnate. Th=
e Vedas say, "Matru Devo Bhava; Pitru Devo Bhava." It exhorts us to see our=
 mother and our father as the very God in flesh and blood. This is echoed b=
y the Tamil saying we are all familiar with since childhood,  "Annaiyum Pit=
havum Munnari Deivam."  Our parents are the first Gods we are aware of. 

 =
 So we must take good care of them while they are alive. 



  Then, when t=
hey pass away, they are given this posting called "Pitru" or ancestors.  Am=
avasya is the day when we can worship these ancestors. It is absolutely ess=
ential to offer this worship according to each one's customs. Some people o=
ffer `tarpana' on this tithi. Some people offer `Annam Padayal,' offering o=
f food in front of the pictures of the ancestors and then offering it to ot=
hers. One must follow whichever custom one is familiar with but observe the=
 Amavasya Vratam in order that our own progeny may lead a prosperous and ha=
ppy life.



  The other significant thing about this day is that it is als=
o the day of Sravana Vratam. It falls on the Druva star, and worshipping th=
e Lord Vishnu on this day is sure to grant us every prosperity.



  08 Feb=
 2008, Friday. Chandra Darshanam



  This day falls on the 25th day of the=
 Tamil month Thai, on a Friday. On this day, one must have a darshan of Cha=
ndra, or the Moon.  The Moon, who is Soma Deva, carries several names, such=
 as "Pirai," "Chandran", "Nishakaran" and so on. His house of Kataka is the=
 House of the Mother. He is called Matru karakan and Buddhi karakan. If our=
 mind is to work properly, we need the grace of Lord Chandra. Fickle-minded=
ness is the main reason why we are sometimes unable to accomplish what we s=
et out to do. It is a disease of the mind - a lack of clarity and focus. Fo=
r e.g., one may set out to wear a yellow shirt, then may think that the red=
 shirt would look better and pick up the red shirt, change his mind and wea=
r a black shirt and continue to wonder if he should probably have worn a wh=
ite shirt. Look at the lack of clarity in his mind. If this is the state of=
 the mind, one cannot succeed in any profession. It could be temple worship=
, or computers, or driving - we must first make up our mind - and then set =
out to do that. If your destination is Kumbakonam, you must not keep changi=
ng track on the way - else, you'll reach nowhere. 



  Who grants us this =
clarity of mind? It is the Lord Chandra. We can get his grace by observing =
the Chandra Vratam. It is one of the easiest of Vratams to observe. Anyone =
can look up and see the moon. You don't have to go to a temple and stand in=
 a queue for darshan, you don't have to alter your daily schedule and do an=
ything extra, you can even work a night shift - all you have to do is proba=
bly walk upto the terrace, see the moon and chant "Om Chandraya Namah." It =
is our belief that the Lord Chandra will bless us with sharpness of the min=
d, and clarity.
