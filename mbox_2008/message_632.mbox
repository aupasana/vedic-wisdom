Dear Utpal,

> is really making good progress?

One person may be seeing visions of deities, experiencing mystical things 
and another person may not be experiencing any such "extraordinary" things. 
Yet, the latter may realize Self first. It IS possible.

Believe me, all it takes for Her is a split second to turn a fool into a 
self-realized person.

You will do yourself a big favor if you take the thoughts of "extraordinary 
experiences" off your mind. These expectations are a big obstacle.

If you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticizes you badly 
and you are now able to feel normal in that situation, isn't that a 
"tangible" sign of progress? If you normally feel elated when someone 
praises you to the sky and you are now able to feel normal in that 
situation, isn't that a "tangible" sign of progress?

Instead of focusing your senses outward and looking for some miracle or an 
"extraordinaty experience", focus your senses inward, watch your thoughts 
and instincts closely and refine them. Try to reach a state where criticism 
and praise are the same for you.

That will put you in a good stead. THAT is real progress. If you make real 
progress and do not bother about any "extraordinary experiences", you may 
indeed have an extraordinary experience oneday! Not the one that gets you 
stuck with a sense of possessiveness or entitlement, but the one that frees 
you.

One can get stuck in some expectations that are unknowingly formed in the 
mind based on what one read or heard.

One can get stuck in possessiveness or a sense of entitlement over an 
"extraordinary experience" that actually happened to him.

One can get stuck in many ways.

If you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have no sense of 
ownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not because it will give X 
or Y or Z, but because everything is really Hers. Keep looking at yourself 
and your own actions/thoughts and refine them to make the sense of surrender 
fuller and fuller. And expect to get nothing from Her in return for that 
surrender. That is a surefire way to succeed in one's spiritual pursuit.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste Garu,

I am inspired by many saints and Thakur being the most prominent of
them. Sri Sri Ravishankar is the one who i know to be a really great
spiritual teacher, however i found my guru in you.

I highly appreciate your clarity of thoughts and found many
simmilarity in our attitude and thoughts over years, however i know
for sure that there is a big gulf between our level of consciousness.

through some of your messages on list as well as personla mails, i am
completely convinced about one thing which is mentioned below

- Barometer of spiritual growth is the reduction of I ness (limited
ego) viz-a-viz increase of surrender. the feeling of being an
instrument in the hand of Mother/god/nature increases

what i am still not convinced about is that the possibility of not
experiencing any *tangiable* extraordinary expereinces but still one
is really making good progress?

If i think rationally and take the experiences of others than it is
quite clear that the spiritual growth invariably comes along with
some out of the world and tangiable experiences. this some times
temporarily disappoints me.

i feel that i'll never be convinced unless i get the concrete proof
of the subtle world.

Yours,

utpal
