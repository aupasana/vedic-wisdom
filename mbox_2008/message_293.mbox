From: "The Art of W=
isdom: Affirmations for Boundless Living".
Released April 23, 2008.

"The a=
cquisition of wisdom is not merely an intellectual or
theoretical enterpris=
e. Rather, true wisdom is the consequent result
of the uniting of knowledge=
 with immediate spiritual realization via
the practice of God-centered medi=
tation. It is in devotional
meditative absorption upon the Absolute that bo=
th factual knowledge
and the faculty of discernment itself finally bare spi=
ritual fruit in
the form of direct non-mediated perception of Truth. When w=
e achieve
such an experience, transcendent Truth itself then becomes a livi=
ng
presence within us, nurturing us in the light of God's grace. To have
wi=
sdom means to surrender to Truth itself, and to presence that Truth
in our =
everyday lives in everything we do, think, and say." (pg. 31)
