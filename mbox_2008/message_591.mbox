Namaste Garu,

in Mahalskhmi, ShriKrishna & Shani Homam, you have specifica=
lly 
recommended to recite any one of the Mantra and stick to it rather 
th=
an doing several mantra/stotra during homam.

should the same guideline be =
assumed for MahaGanapati Homam Document?

I mean is it better to stick to A=
NY ONE mantra (root or vaidic or 
Atharvashirsh) instead of performing all =
the three with selected 
counts?

hope not irritating you.

yours,

utpal
