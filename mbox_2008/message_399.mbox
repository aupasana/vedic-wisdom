Dear Friends,

Following Message was found on one of the Site on Swami Vive=
kananda. 
It is attributed to Thakur Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.

Utpal
=

[
	This is the message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world. 
Care not f=
or doctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All 
these count for=
 but little compared with that essence of existence 
which is in each one, =
and called 'spirituality'.  The more this 
develops in a man, the more powe=
rful is he for good.  He who has 
most of it can do good most to his fellow=
 man. First, then, acquire 
that.  Only those who have seen it will underst=
and this; but such 
spirituality can be given to others, even though they b=
e unconscious 
of the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are =
amongst 
the great teachers of mankind.  They are the powers of light. Then=
 
be you this!  The more of such men any country produces, the higher  
tha=
t country is raised.  That land where no such men exist is 
doomed. Nothing=
 can save it. Therefore, my Master's message to the 
world is, `Be ye all s=
piritual! Get ye first realization!'  And to 
the young and strong of every=
 country he would cry that the time is 
come for renunciation.  'Renounce f=
or the sake of humanity! You have 
talked of the love of man till the thing=
 is in danger of becoming 
words alone. The time is come to act.  The call =
is now.  Do! Leap 
into the breach and save the world!
