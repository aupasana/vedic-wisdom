Dear Kumar,
   
  Yes "I am that" is a wonderful book. Wwonderful. I bought it some months back and it is so beautiful. I have read "Who am I", and I still keep reading it whenever I can. Its feels so purifying just to read these books..
   
  I wonder what amount of terrific good karma those people must have done who were lucky to have been born near these supersouls and recognized the divinity in them. They are truely blessed. I wish someone could have told me how many mantras japas or what sadhanas or  karmas need to be done so that I can have the good fortune of being born close to one of these people in some lifetime.
   
  -Regards
   Rajarshi

          Rajashri Ji,
I read the biography of Ganapathi Muni, an extraordinary saint, and a 
staunch devotee of Lord Ganesh. I think you must have heard about two 
gems "Who Am I" and "Be As you are" books by ramana ashram.

If you want to know more about this "I-ness", there is an 
extraordinary book called "I am That" by nisargadatta maharaj. Please 
read it. 
Thanks and Regards,
Kumar Ghanta
