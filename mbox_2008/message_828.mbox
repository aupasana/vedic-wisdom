Namaste,
 
Yes, as you noted in the pictures of Siva-Parvati and Sita-Rama,=
 wife should be on the left of husband. As I said, when you consider them t=
ogether as one unit, wife is the lunar nadi and husband is the solar nadi o=
f that unit.
 
However, there are other traditions in India. Some people do=
 the opposite. They say that the main wife should be on the right hand side=
 of the husband and the other wife (if any) on the left. Because the right =
hand is considered auspicious, the main wife is on that side. This is the o=
ther view.
 
People may feel free to do as *their* tradition teaches. If on=
e wants my recommendation, it is that wife should sit on the left of husban=
d.
 
But, as I keep saying, these technicalities are secondary and tertiary=
. Primary thing is having sincerity, devotion and surrender.
 
Best regards=
,
Narasimha

  Namaskaar Narasimha Ji,

ogether as one person, she is 
  > the left, i.e. lunar nadi (Ida), and you=

  Should this be the case for a=
ll rituals, or only for Homam? I always sit on the right hand side of my hu=
sband during the Poojas. But now that I read your directions, I realize tha=
t in the pictures of the devatas, the devi always stands/sits on the left h=
and side of the deva (ref. Sri Rama Darbara, or Sri Siva and Mother Parvati=
). So perhaps, then, the wife should stand/sit on the left of the husband f=
or all religious worships/practices (including lighting of deepam and aarti=
)?

  Thank you.

  With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
  Reema.

 It is also possible to time share the same homa kundam, i.e. do at differe=
