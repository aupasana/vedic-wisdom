Dear Members,

Does any body know any english book by Madhavacharya? I am a=
ctually looking for something into Dwaita Vedanta. 
Having looked into Adva=
ita, I am thinking of having an idea of Dwaita. It will be great if anyone =
could post some good books

 
Thanks & Regards,

ubject: [vedic-wisdom] Beggar helping beggar (Re: Regarding Brahamcharya)

=

Namaste,

> Have patience ! Narasimha is one of the right persons capable =
of
> guiding you. If you are sincere, you'll be helped. although, i write
>=
 much now a days, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!

I am a begg=
ar like others. But I try to help other beggars by showing the 
houses wher=
e they can try their luck by begging.

Normally, one beggar may view anothe=
r beggar as a competitor and not like 
too many people to beg in the same a=
rea. However, this begging is different 
and there is no competition betwee=
n different beggars. The owner of the 
house has enough to give to every be=
ggar and does not mind giving to many 
beggars at the same time if they are=
 worthy.

Actually, if one beggar gets something, it will be so much that h=
e/she can 
share some of it with all around him/her. If you go with 100 oth=
er beggars 
and beg, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt=
 the heart of 
the owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it=
 to varying 
degrees!

When I tell people about external practices such as =
homam and internal 
practices such as surrender and detachment in actions, =
all I am really doing 
is to take fellow beggars in front of a house where =
a rich person lives. If 
they are able to melt the heart of the owner of th=
e house, their begging 
will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* han=
ds.

I am only a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg an=
d I am 
not really "capable" of anything more. Please do not treat me in an=
y other 
way.

When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Par=
amahamsa, and 
Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mot=
her, mama kim 
kathaa (what is my story)..

*        *        *

In general=
, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to 
spiritual=
 progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not 
built in=
 a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built in a 
day! =
Be patient.

I have seen people change from inside out in a short span of t=
ime. There is 
no need to panic or give up hope.

*        *        *

Be p=
atient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as 
Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 
Sankaracharya, R=
amanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, 
Buddha, Mahavi=
ra, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. 
Try to integra=
te some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and 
your life s=
tyle. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner 
transformation=
. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired 
writings.

Nobod=
y can change you. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if you really 
wan=
t to. Introspect and go to the root of your problems. If you introspect 
an=
d analyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root of it 
al=
l. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, question why. =

I am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze=
 
why it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh 
intro=
spection will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, 
attachme=
nt and pride that often color one's attitude.

Introspect on your attitude =
and motives and contemplate on the nature of 
god. Meditate.

In this age, =
there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, 
saying "I =
surrender to you. So give me x or y" is NOT total surrender. Total 
surrend=
er means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and 
expectatio=
ns. If you can manage it, you are all set!

*        *        *

Homam or w=
orship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis. 
I know =
from experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables the inner 
transf=
ormation. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know people who 
made (=
and are making) considerable spiritual progress through regular 
practice o=
f homam. It is the most powerful method I know of and teaching it 
is one o=
f my tasks for this life.

Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily=
 schedule and start doing 
Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months=
, you should switch to 
Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my =
website by then). THAT 
should help you find your way in your spiritual lif=
e and strike the right 
balance between spiritual life and material life.

=
The purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pay bac=
k 
debts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes 
s=
moother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth.=
 
However, without some spiritual progress, actions in material life create=
 
new debts. In the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the tw=
o 
and use the actions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true=
 
spiritual progress, most people cannot and should not run away from mater=
ial 
life.

Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that a=
ction and 
knowledge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Self f=
lies and 
becomes liberated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride=
, promote 
ego and binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge witho=
ut action 
does not become complete because of the remaining debts and one =
is stuck. 
One needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become =
free.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<br>
I am a beggar like others. But I =
try to help other beggars by showing the <br>
houses where they can try the=
ir luck by begging.<br>
<br>
Normally, one beggar may view another beggar a=
s a competitor and not like <br>
too many people to beg in the same area. H=
owever, this begging is different <br>
and there is no competition between =
different beggars. The owner of the <br>
house has enough to give to every =
beggar and does not mind giving to many <br>
beggars at the same time if th=
ey are worthy.<br>
<br>
Actually, if one beggar gets something, it will be =
so much that he/she can <br>
share some of it with all around him/her. If y=
ou go with 100 other beggars <br>
and beg, you are better off. If any one o=
f them is able to melt the heart of <br>
the owner of the house, all the hu=
ndred will benefit from it to varying <br>
degrees!<br>
<br>
When I tell pe=
ople about external practices such as homam and internal <br>
practices suc=
h as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am really doing <br>
is to =
take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person lives. If <br>
=
they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their begging <b=
r>
will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.<br>
<br>
I am onl=
y a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg and I am <br>
n=
ot really "capable" of anything more. Please do not treat me in any other <=
br>
way.<br>
<br>
When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna =
Paramahamsa, and <br>
Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of =
the Mother, mama kim <br>
kathaa (what is my story).<br>
<br>
*        *   =
     *<br>
<br>
In general, to those who are struggling with internal confl=
icts related to <br>
spiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a fe=
w words. Rome is not <br>
built in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protoco=
l of Rome is not built in a <br>
day! Be patient.<br>
<br>
I have seen peop=
le change from inside out in a short span of time. There is <br>
no need to=
 panic or give up hope.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
Be patient. R=
ead scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as <br>
Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, <br>
Sankaracharya, Ra=
manujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, <br>
Buddha, Mah=
avira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. <br>
Try to =
integrate some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and <br>
=
your life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner <br>=

transformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired <b=
r>
writings.<br>
<br>
Nobody can change you. You yourself can do it. You CA=
N do it, if you really <br>
want to. Introspect and go to the root of your =
problems. If you introspect <br>
and analyze each big problem, you will rea=
lize that ego is the root of it <br>
all. Whenever something in life seems =
fundamentally important, question why. <br>
I am not saying to leave it. Do=
 what you normally do. But, atleast analyze <br>
why it is important and tr=
y to understand your inner motives. Scuh <br>
introspection will eventually=
 lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, <br>
attachment and pride that of=
ten color one's attitude.<br>
<br>
Introspect on your attitude and motives =
and contemplate on the nature of <br>
god. Meditate.<br>
<br>
In this age, =
there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, <br>
saying=
 "I surrender to you. So give me x or y" is NOT total surrender. Total <br>=

surrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and <br=
>
expectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!<br>
<br>
*        * =
       *<br>
<br>
Homam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practic=
e taught by rishis. <br>
I know from experience that it burns blocking karm=
as and enables the inner <br>
transformation. It is a very useful spiritual=
 practice. I know people who <br>
made (and are making) considerable spirit=
ual progress through regular <br>
practice of homam. It is the most powerfu=
l method I know of and teaching it <br>
is one of my tasks for this life.<b=
r>
<br>
Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and start=
 doing <br>
Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should sw=
itch to <br>
Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by =
then). THAT <br>
should help you find your way in your spiritual life and s=
trike the right <br>
balance between spiritual life and material life.<br>
=
<br>
The purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pa=
y back <br>
debts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress b=
ecomes <br>
smoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot b=
ecome smooth. <br>
However, without some spiritual progress, actions in mat=
erial life create <br>
new debts.. In the beginning, one needs to create a =
synergy between the two <br>
and use the actions in material life to promot=
e spiritual life. For true <br>
spiritual progress, most people cannot and =
should not run away from material <br>
life.<br>
<br>
Vasishtha said in the=
 very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that action and <br>
knowledge are two =
wings with which the bird of manifested Self flies and <br>
becomes liberat=
ed. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, promote <br>
ego and bi=
nds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without action <br>
does n=
ot become complete because of the remaining debts and one is stuck. <br>
On=
e needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become free.<br>
<br=
>
Best regards,<br>
Narasimha<br>
