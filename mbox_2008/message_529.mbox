Namaste Hari,

Please don't add JI for MEE :0

In my opinion, for Sanskrit =
Text(Devanagari), Durga-Saptashati by 
Geeta Press (Gorakhpur) is one of th=
e best. you may think of 
refering that book. In that, even the 'Paathantar=
s' are given at 
various places. I found it as a very reliable and availabl=
e with 
Translation in mnay languages.



Best Regards,

Utpal
