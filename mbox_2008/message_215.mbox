namaste,

Shivaratri is "Phalguna Krishna Chaturdashi Nishita-vyapini"

Divide the night (sunset to sunrise) into 5 parts. When chaturdasi
prevails during the middle part (when midnight occurs), that is the
night during which shivarati is to be observed. Many priests are
simply following the dates used in India. So be it. Those who know the
details can try to be more careful.

Incidentally, it is not clearcut even in India. For example, some
members have posted to other e-mail lists conveying that Sringeri is
celebrating it on the 5th, as per the word of the pontiff there.

Even in the US, festivals may occasionally vary by one day between the
east & west coasts.

bhavadIyaH,

       ajit
