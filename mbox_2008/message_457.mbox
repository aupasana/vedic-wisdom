Shri Anil Kurnoolji,
Namaskar!
<Is today Diwali???>
Yes, Septe=
mber 28, 2008, was the real Dipavali as per following 
details:

1. Accordi=
ng to the Report of Saha Calendar Reform Committee, page 
104, "Kali-puja (=
Nishitha Vyapini), Dipavali or Diwali (Pradosha, 
Mahalakshmipuja (Pradosha=
), Kethar Gauri Vrata (S. India), Mahavira 
nirvana (Jain)" ---all these fe=
stivals are to be celebrated on 
Ashvina (Mukhyamana---i.e. Amanta) Krishna=
 Amavasya".

2. Same is the criterion as per Dharma-sindu, Nirnaya-sindhu, =

Hemadri and even Swami Kannu Pillai's Ephemeris.

Now the question arises =
as to when the real "Ashvina Krishna 
(Mukhyamana) Amavasya" took place.

3=
. The Vedanga Jyotisha---the ancient-most indigenous astronomical 
work by =
Acharya Lagadha, tells us that the start of Uttarayana---the 
shortest day =
of the year viz. Witner Solstice---is also the start of 
the month of Tapah=
 cum-(solar)- Magha. This happens these days 
around December 21/22.  That =
very ingress is known as Makara 
Sankranti as per the Bhagavata, Visnhnu Pu=
rana, Shva Purana etc. 
etc.---in fact all the eighteen puranas, nay even a=
ll the sidhantas, 
inlcuding the Surya Sidhanta by Maya the mlechha. The fi=
rst New Moon 
following the same is the start of lunar Magha Shukla. 
 
The=
 month of Tapasya and solar Phalguna start simultaneously after 
about 30/3=
1 days of Uttarayana.  That very ingress is known as 
Kumbha Sankranti as p=
er all the Puranas and sidhantas.  The first 
New Moon after that is the st=
art of Lunar Phalgua Shukla and so on. 
 
These are the criteria of the rea=
l Vedic solar and lunar months as 
per all the Vedas and Puranas and other =
shastras---nay even the 
sidhantas including the Surya Sidhanta!

As per th=
e same criterion, the Vedic month of Isha-cum-solar Ashvina 
started on Aug=
ust 22/23, 2008.  That very ingress is also known 
Kanya Snakrnati as per a=
ll the Puranas and sidhantas.
The first New Moon (Amanta) after that was on=
 August 31, 2008.  THAT 
WAS THUS THE DATE OF START OF ASHVINA SHUKLA PAKSH=
A!  THAT WAS THUS 
THE ACTUAL STARTING DATE OF SHARADIYA NAVRATRAS!

The Am=
avasya at Pradosha and nisheetha after that Ashvina (Navratra)
New Moon was=
 on September 28, 2008! THAT WAS THUS THE ASHVINA 
KRISHNA AMAVASYA (MUKHYA=
 MANA) AS PER ALL THE SHASTRAS, INLCUING THE 
VEDAS AND PURANAS!
Hence the =
real Dipavali cum Kali-Puja cum Lakshmi-puja was on 
September 28, 2008.  
=

Since Amavasya at sunrise is today i.e. September 29, 2008, hence 
the rea=
l Mahavira Jayanti (Jains) is today i.e. September 29, 2008.

The Navratras=
 and Dipavalis etc. or even Mahavira Jayanti that you 
and other Hindus/Jai=
ns etc. are/will be celebrating are thus NOT AS 
PER THE SHASTRAS but as pe=
r the frauds who call themselves Vedic 
astrologers, since they do not know=
n actually even ABC of the Vedas 
so much so so that they confuse "Vedanga =
Jyotisha" as a work of 
predictive gimmicks/astrology---when that work does=
 not talk of 
either Mesha,Vrisha etc. Rashis or Mangal,Shani etc. planets =
even by 
mistake.
With regards,
A K Kaul
