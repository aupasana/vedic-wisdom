Dear All,
Namaskar.

Yes, indeed.
I=C2=A0had a doubt that I wanted to ask N=
arasimha garu. I recited Sree Hanumathbadabanala stotram some time back. I =
had an unusual experience of 'being on fire',=C2=A0during the initial stage=
s. It was as if I was engulfed in a ball of fire, which slowly receded over=
 time. I had a similar experience during the Navaratri puja when reciting
D=
evi kavacham. I still have that feeling of an=C2=A0aura of fire around me a=
nd feel extremely hot and sweat=C2=A0even in the cold weather. This stays o=
n for a time. I also had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' t=
hat matter to me and there is a steady deterioration, almost as if a=C2=A0h=
eavy veil has been torn asunder. 
I=C2=A0vaguely remember Narasimha ji tell=
ing us in some forum that there might be some ramifications relating to kar=
ma that could manifest when/ after sadhana/worship.
Could you please clarif=
y, Narasimha garu?

Regards
Nalini
=C2=A0

Guys,

I am glad everything is sorted out. But, in =
general, let us be less 
defensive and instead focus on subject. Knowing Aj=
it's nature, I knew 
exactly what he meant. However, even if Ajit or someon=
e actually said 
something negative about me, it is not a big deal. One is =
who one is and 
words, good or bad, do not change that, for better or worse=
. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

Ajit, you are certainly qualified in co=
mmenting. I always knew that you have 
tremendous scholarship, great humili=
ty and sincerity. People far less 
qualified than you talk/write so much in=
 today's world. Please do write 
more.

The imagery thrown up by the Purani=
c story mentioned by you is really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman is one who=
 fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
self-control.

Lord =
Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hrishika + isha =3D 
lord=
 of senses). He can be worshipped for control over senses.

Mother Kaali gi=
ves dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be 
worshipped for ge=
tting rid of desires.

Several things are possible. But, for most people in=
 today's times, it is 
not going to be one magic bullet that does it, but a=
 combination of various 
practices. Patience is needed.

Try to increase th=
e understanding of what is permanent and what is 
transient.

Best regards,=

Narasimha
