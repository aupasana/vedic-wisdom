Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Another wonderful mail. Everyday when I open my mai=
lbox in the morning, I keep searching for your mails. Each one is an inspir=
ation.
=C2=A0
One more point I would like to add, I had read some books on =
Thakur in Bengali and in one there was the description of an indicident. On=
ce Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he could no=
t handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji delib=
erately put a note under Thakur's pillow when Thakur was not in the room. L=
ater when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up as if in pai=
n and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was used to be ther=
e, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But Thakur never=
 got offended with these things.
=C2=A0
Infact in one instance, when one of=
 his disciples had come to him for the first time, Thakur asked him to stay=
 over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple woke up and saw that Thakur w=
as leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciples mind, he thought maybe T=
hakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada Ma used to stay.=
 So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is going, after al=
l it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secretly etc etc.. he was =
genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room following Thakur at a distan=
ce, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitting down for meditation an=
d there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur came back, he told that pers=
on, who later became his disciple, that he had done very good to test Thaku=
r. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Guru without testing. And to=
 see and judge a person's sprittuality he has to be observed when he is pub=
lic and when he is alone. There
 should be no diference in his words and ac=
tions. Etc etc.
=C2=A0
Every incident in Thakur's life is like an illustrat=
ion of a deeper point for ordianry people like us.
=C2=A0

Dear Lakshmi,
=C2=A0
This is Ka=
li yuga. While=C2=A0a really spiritual person must continuously try to dest=
roy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us with bloated egos whic=
h are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly excited at sycophanc=
y. Such gurus are not of much use.
=C2=A0
But how do separate the grains fr=
om the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are just a few grains i=
n the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is useful but not that much.=
 Astrologer's mind, which makes the final judgments, works based on his/her=
 prejudices and secret beliefs.

=C2=A0
In the past,=
 many great souls used intellectual discrimination and intuition to judge o=
ne's guru for a long time before whole-heartedly embracing one's guru. In m=
any traditions within Hinduism, this is encouraged. You do not accept a gur=
u in an impulse. You "test" your guru and take your time to accept him. But=
, once you accept a person as your guru, you follow him faithfully.

If you take Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) , the celebr=
ated disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he was a highly rational and skep=
tical young man. Though Ramakrishna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by me=
re touch in their second meeting itself, it was not enough to convince Nare=
ndra of Ramakrishna' s ability and purity. He thought the whole experience =
could just have been a hallucination/ hypnotism and did not jump to any con=
clusion. As he visited Ramakrishna continuously, received love and knowledg=
e from him and saw that Ramakrishna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to j=
ust talking the talk), he was slowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishna=
. He then became a tireless soldier who dedicated his life to carrying out =
the mission of his guru!
=C2=A0
During the early stages, he even told Ramak=
rishna bluntly about the latter's visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, "Sir,=
 they could all just be your imaginations or hallucinations" . Narendra did=
 not even believe in god with a form and believed only in the formless. Ram=
akrishna was never offended at these comments.
=C2=A0
Other sishyas like Jo=
ginder (Swami Yogananda) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested=
 him for a duration. These young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren't bli=
nd men led by a blind man. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, wh=
o were reborn together for a purpose.
=C2=A0
They observed Ramakrishna for =
a while, confirmed that he practiced what he preached and realized that the=
re was a valuable lesson in each action and word=C2=A0of his. They took a w=
hile to realize his purity and divinity, but once they realized they became=
 faithful sishyas. He accepted them, loved them and taught them even before=
 they realized his true nature and accepted him fully as their guru. He kne=
w they were skeptical and testing him, but he was never offended (what good=
 is a guru who cannot recognize a worthy student and what good is a guru wh=
ose ego is insulted at someone's skepticism). Once they accepted him and be=
came faithful sishyas, each one of them was also transformed into a really =
pure person who takes the entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in =
every thought and action. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in =
spiritual purity.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0=C2=A0
One whose rinas draw=
 one towards a fake guru gets such a guru because that is what his karmas e=
ntitle him to. The circumstances we have to face are based on the previous =
actions. But the current action (freewill) is in our hands. If one can trul=
y believe from the deepest cores of heart that one's guru is pure and like =
Shiva himself, follows guru blindly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, tha=
t WILL pay off oneday. Nature WILL bring light into that person's spiritual=
 life. It is just a matter of time.
=C2=A0
Thus, I will not be judgmental a=
bout other gurus and their sishyas. If a sishya believes in his/her guru fu=
lly, so be it. It is not our business.
=C2=A0
But, if one were to find a gu=
ru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Sril=
a Prabhupada, it is one's immense luck. However, the point I want to make i=
s that having a great guru is not a guarantee of success and also having a =
fake guru is not a guarantee of failure!
=C2=A0
At the end of the day, the =
measure of success in any sadhana is the purity generated by that sadhana. =
The measure of the purity is the effacement of ego. If ego is reduced compl=
etely or eliminated, one is making progress. This can happen inspite of who=
 is the guru, what one is doing etc.
=C2=A0
When the full grace of the Supr=
eme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficient to reflect that grace=
.

Hare Rama Krishna
Dear Narasimha.
Sorry I got my people and lineages all =
confused! Was reading about too many people lately.
=C2=A0
Also last night=
=C2=A0 I saw a =C2=A0documentary on religious leaders, cults etc.
People wa=

 claim to be special up on a pedestal.That happened with my ex , he got up =
there,felt it wasn't right and tried to climb down, but his"disciples" didn=
't want him to.
They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his purity, a=
nd all sorts of cover ups.
God and Jesus are living in some many places. So=
metimes there are several people simultaneously claiming to be Jesus in any=
 psych unit across the world/
Its amazing where and to within whom people s=
ee "God".
Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living like a mortal in all capaci=
ties while telling others how to find realization sort of hypocritical and =
bizarre?
=C2=A0
There is one fellow who used to be a heroin addict and now =
he says he is Jesus and has a huge following. they are willing to do whatev=
er he says and they give him money and all sorts of things.
Yesterday I wen=

I=
N the USA I cant begin to tell you the number of religious leaders that wer=
e revered as "God" or some other incarnation.
India is no different, perhap=
s worse because people have a natural respect for sadhus , yogis etc and mo=
re yogis can get away with pretending to be a renunciate.
I believe God app=
ears in different forms in different places and times to attract people who=
 are looking for him and to associate with his devotees..
Now that Document=
ary TV program and your posts got my mind swimming.
What are principles of =
religion? What is dharma, What is the purpose?
Now if there were no laws or=
 rules, social or religious and everyone did what they felt like, we would =
be living in a hell. At least in Kali Yuga.
What was the point of Jesus? Se=
ems he got a lot of uncivilized people to work on basic codes of conduct...=
 thou shalt not steal,lie, commit adultery etc.
Whose to say one person is =
a saint?.. some people(his faithful followers)=C2=A0couldn't understand tha=
t Charles Manson was a mad man not a prophet.
There are other "yogis" who c=
ame to USA, smoking pot, taking drugs,
and other ones advised having sex to=
 find self realization and acquiring tons of cars and 
helping many people =
trade STDs.
Some people ADVOCate mandatory forced =C2=A0marriage of young g=
irls AT puberty, usually to older men.. and its ok for their fathers to tea=
ch them a thing or two, before being handed off.
One "saint" makes gold, bu=

In itself, being =
able to perform siddhis or mystic things doesn't make one elevated=C2=A0 re=
ally. Maybe they have just accumulated the power to manipulate physical mat=
ter.
Unless a person is pure- it is hard to see who else is pure.
And even =
then, well intentioned=C2=A0people are deceived all the time.
=C2=A0
People=
 have given up everything they owned and moved into under ground tunnels be=
cause their leader( an incarnation of this or that) said the world was endi=

Or, time and time again, some swami turns out to molest kids, and or do=
 all sorts of things when no one is looking..
"The Do as I say , don't do a=
s=C2=A0 I do"...
"He is so pure he doesn't have to obey the rules like ever=
yone else."
Whose to say who is pure?
I think someone who is 100% serving t=
heir GOD day and night, at all times and practicing what they preach has go=
t to be pure....
Self realization after much thought and years meditating/c=
hanting is simple i found... its the realization ,the complete understandin=

But then by the time I die , I'm sure=
 I'll have even more realizations.
There was a big article in TIME magazine=

There have been=
 many great yogis, babas, saints and swamis in the last few thousand years =
of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in one way. He is one =
master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga=
, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krish=
na, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa samadh=
i, where there is no "experience" . He was in sahaja samadhi always. He was=
 able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch or mere look. Ye=
t he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why he could do all =
that!!!).
=C2=A0
Many "gurus" force their dharma on their sishyas and have =
no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sishya. They for=
ce sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form they worship an=
d walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight into the true natur=
e of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He taught totally differen=
t mantras, totally different forms and totally different paths to different=
 sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to different sishyas. When on=
e sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up somebody for=
 insulting his guru, he scolded "shame on you. With your attitude, you did =
not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should learn to be calm=
 and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in a good stead and not=
 your aggression". When another sishya who needed to mend his soft demeanor=
 ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came away silently, he s=
colded him
 "shame on you. Shastras say that you should kill one who insult=

 piece of your mind."
=C2=A0
Spiritual sadhana does not mean just chanting =
a mantra=C2=A0or repeating a procedure everyday for a certain period of tim=
e. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms onesel=
f from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action and every th=
ought=C2=A0becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for introspection an=
d transformation of=C2=A0internal attitude.
=C2=A0
Anyway, coming back to t=

N=
amaste,

As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Krishna clearly sa=
ys in 
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow so=
meone 
else's dharma".

Following the path of dharma basically means engagi=
ng in the right 
action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, fr=
om time to time 
and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature ex=
pects from you, 
which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, w=
hat actions you 
did in the past while identifying with the action, who you=
 affected in the 
past (and how) with the actions that you identified with,=
 what debts you 
created in the process, and what mental tendencies you acc=
umulated until 
now.

If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic debts=
, nature wants a person 
to kill evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. I=
f, based on one's mental 
tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a perso=
n to spread the message of 
uniformity of all religions, that becomes one's=
 dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=
ts a person to spread the 
ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one's=
 dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=
ts a person to make a lot of 
money and construct a temple, that becomes on=
e's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a being may change from one life to anoth=
er.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gur=
us, 
elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much w=
eight 
on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Trem=
endous 
destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great=
 extent, 
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a grea=
t warrior, 
it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lov=
ed and 
respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them=
.

When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of 
Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a 
previo=
us life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this 
new =
time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his 
aristocr=
atic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire 
generations=
 to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to 
others. When=
 he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna 
said), his dha=
rma based on the time and place may be something else.

* * *

The tricky q=
uestion is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?

Some people have int=
erpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharma 
and not someone el=
se's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept 
of caste (varna) =
has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of 
caste mobility =
was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
killing birds. He b=
ecame a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a 
kshatrita and a p=
owerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi 
later. Basically var=
na shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna 
of father, because =
that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one 
develops in life, one =
gets one's own varna based on what one does.

Thus, the misinterpretation o=
f Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
dharma from your caste is w=
rong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
the world. Each person has=
 individual dharma.

Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficu=
lt. If one is pure 
enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of u=
s have a part of our 
mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surr=
ounded by a lot of 
noise from other parts of our minds which tell other th=
ings. Thus, we get 
confused.

We should make the best judgment combining d=
iscrimination and intuition and 
decide what is our dharma and follow it si=
ncerely. We may be err, but doing 
the best we can is all that we can do!

=
More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in 
a=
ctions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not 
accumu=
lating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build 
too m=
uch attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best 
possible=
 actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given 
situa=
tion is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the 
actio=
n as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result 
to =
god. We should not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it 
work=
" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through 
untached =
action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. 
As we b=
ecome purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. 
There=
 is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our 
dharma=
 clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, 
but=
 not as difficult as people think.

The bottomline is: Even if one is not f=
ollowing one's dharma, one's sense of 
"this is my dharma" gets refined wit=
h time if one engages in action with 
little attachment.

* * *

In decidin=
g one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the inputs. 
Another exte=
rnal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can 
derive one'=
s dharma from them. A special place is given to one's spiritual 
master. If=
 one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of 
the maste=
r to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerely.

When Arjuna was confu=
sed about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus 
and relatives was =
not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his 
dharma. When Narend=
ranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma 
and wanted to ren=
ounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, 
Ramakrishna Para=
mahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material 
world and do =
the work of Mother for him.

One who is not in tune with nature and does no=
t know who one is, what one's 
debts are and what nature expects from one c=
an err in the judgment of what 
one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevat=
ed soul with a clear insight into 
one's inner core, such a guru can give p=
erfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a=
 set of principles and 
declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from=
 person to person, from 
time to time and from place to place. Also, there =
are no thumbrules to find 
out what one's dharma is. But, one can refine on=
e's understanding of one's 
dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing =
various kinds of spiritual 
sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in=
 actions without much 
attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine=
 one's understanding of 
one's individual dharma.

Narasimha

<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>Another wonderful mail. Everyday when I open my mailbox in the mornin=
g, I keep searching for your mails. Each one is an inspiration.</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>One more point I would like to add, I had read some books=
 on Thakur in Bengali and in one there was the description of an indicident=
. Once Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he coul=
d not handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji d=
eliberately put a note under Thakur's pillow when Thakur was not in the roo=
m. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up as if in=
 pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was used to be =
there, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But Thakur n=
ever got offended with these things.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Infact in=
 one instance, when one of his disciples had come to him for the first time=
, Thakur asked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple wok=
e up and saw that Thakur was leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciple=
s mind, he thought maybe Thakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where S=
ri Sarada Ma used to stay. So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see w=
here he is going, after all it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat =
secretly etc etc.. he was genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room fo=
llowing Thakur at a distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitt=
ing down for meditation and there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur ca=
me back, he told that person, who later became his disciple, that he had do=
ne very good to test Thakur. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Gu=
ru without testing. And to see and judge a person's sprittuality he has to =
be observed when he is public and when he is alone.
 There should be no dif=
erence in his words and actions. Etc etc.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ever=
y incident in Thakur's life is like an illustration of a deeper point for o=
rdianry people like us.</DIV>

<DIV>Its amazing where and=

<DIV>Isnt a spiritual master, guru,=
 living like a mortal in all capacities while telling others how to find re=

<DIV>Yesterday I went on the Internet, and looked at some many so c=

<DIV>IN the USA I cant begin to tell you t=

<DIV>India is no different, perhaps worse because people ha=

<DIV>I believe God appears in differ=

<DIV>Now that Documentary=

<DIV>What are princi=

<DIV>Now if th=

<DIV>Dear Narasimha,</DIV>
<DIV>Ive read several =
apparently derogatory things about Paramahamsa Yogananda- that he ate meat,=
 drank and had women at different times. Some accounts seem very authoratat=
ive so I am inclined to believe where there is smoke there is fire.</DIV>
<=

 in some many other worldly things.?</DIV>

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>As Vimalananda says, dha=
rma is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in <BR>Bhagavad Geeta "Follow =
your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone <BR>else's dharma".<BR><=
BR>Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right <BR>a=
ction/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time <B=
R>and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,=
 <BR>which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions =
you <BR>did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected=
 in the <BR>past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what =
debts you <BR>created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumu=
lated until <BR>now.<BR><BR>If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic=
 debts, nature wants a person <BR>to kill evil persons, that becomes one's =
dharma. If, based on one's mental <BR>tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=
ants a person to spread
 the message of <BR>uniformity of all religions, th=
at becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's <BR>mental tendencies and karmi=
c debts, nature wants a person to spread the <BR>ritual of homam in the wor=
ld, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's <BR>mental tendencies and=
 karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of <BR>money and constru=
ct a temple, that becomes one's dharma.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The dharma of a=
 being may change from one life to another.<BR><BR>At the time of Mahabhara=
ta war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, <BR>elders and relatives.=
 The time then was such that there was too much weight <BR>on earth and nat=
ure wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous <BR>destruction =
was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, <BR>to welc=
ome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, <BR>it=
 was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and <BR>res=
pected were on
 the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.<BR><BR>W=
hen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of <BR>Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a <BR>prev=
ious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this <BR=
>new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his <BR>=
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire <BR>=
generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to <B=
R>others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna <=
BR>said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.<BR>=
<BR>* * *<BR><BR>The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's =
dharma?<BR><BR>Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow =
your own dharma <BR>and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism.=
 Though the concept <BR>of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a l=
ong
 time, the concept of <BR>caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki w=
as a shudra who lived by <BR>killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maha=
rshi later. Vishwamitra was a <BR>kshatrita and a powerful king. He became =
a brahmana and and a maharshi <BR>later. Basically varna shows one's aptitu=
de. One starts off with the varna <BR>of father, because that is what one i=
s exposed to in childhood. As one <BR>develops in life, one gets one's own =
varna based on what one does.<BR><BR>Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna=
's words which tells you to know your <BR>dharma from your caste is wrong. =
Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in <BR>the world. Each person has in=
dividual dharma.<BR><BR>Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very diff=
icult. If one is pure <BR>enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, al=
l of us have a part of our <BR>mind that tells us what our dharma is, but i=
t is surrounded by a lot of <BR>noise from other parts of our minds
 which =
tell other things. Thus, we get <BR>confused.<BR><BR>We should make the bes=
t judgment combining discrimination and intuition and <BR>decide what is ou=
r dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing <BR>the best we =
can is all that we can do!<BR><BR>More than following dharma, what is of ut=
most importance is to engage in <BR>actions without identification. *That* =
alone ensures that we are not <BR>accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increas=
ing the load. We should not build <BR>too much attachment to what we are do=
ing. We should engage in the best <BR>possible actions (based on our best j=
udgment on what our dharma in the given <BR>situation is), with as little a=
ttachment and self-identification with the <BR>action as possible. When the=
 action is finished, we should leave the result <BR>to god. We should not t=
hink "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it <BR>work" etc. Such adher=
ence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through <BR>untached
 action) will =
simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. <BR>As we become pure=
r, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. <BR>There is a p=
ositive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our <BR>dh
