Namaste Friends,

Some ramblings ...

Regarding fire getting extinguished (=
or anything similar to it), it
happens with all beginners and its only prac=
tice which makes one
perfect. Most of us assume that this is only applicabl=
e in mundane
matters. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I=
 know
there are people who think that any affair/process related to God mus=
t
be done perfectly. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is
impossibl=
e and only repeated and sincere attempts makes one an adept.

Reminds me of=
 the great Kalidasa who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for
nine lives and he w=
as born a dunce in his tenth and she appeared to
him in his 10th lifetime, =
when his sadhana was complete and he banged
his head out of sheer frustrati=
on. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with
Homa, surrendering to ones chosen de=
ity is the best path for most. 

Let me share one incident, when Narasimha'=
s spiritual Guru whom I also
consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Ch=
ennai for Shata Chandi
Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was =
really joking!
When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded m=
e. It then
occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started searchi=
ng on
the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took=

it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied.  Manishji then
reminded =
me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely
in Samskrit a=
nd illiterate that I am, I couldn't distinguish between
an instruction and =
sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally
performed a longer versi=
on of the homam and I particpated in it, but
never could grasp it. I then a=
sked Narasimha to guide me, which he
did, but still it did not get through =
my really dense brains :). I
felt really helpless, but the stars were such =
that I never gave up,
instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that=
 If he really
intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show m=
e the
way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided
=
to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt
believe =
my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his
grace. Well ... =
its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking
baby-steps and making pro=
gress everyday.

I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces =
for helping
me progress.

My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it =
no matter what. We
are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got pe=
rfect the very
first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous=
 lives.
Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ..=
.
plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen
ove=
rnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that should be
the pri=
mary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you
get or dont=
 get anything. Slowly we'll progress in our Sadhana and
move on to higher t=
hings. I wish all the best. We should really thank
our stars that people li=
ke Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding
us ... what would be life with=
out them!

Thanks for listening.
Regards
-Narayan-
