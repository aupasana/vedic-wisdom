Rajashri Ji,
I read the biography of Ganapathi Muni, an extraordinary saint=
, and a 
staunch devotee of Lord Ganesh. I think you must have heard about =
two 
gems "Who Am I" and "Be As you are" books by ramana ashram.
   
      =
   If you want to know more about this "I-ness", there is an 
extraordinary=
 book called "I am That" by nisargadatta maharaj. Please 
read it.  
      =
                            Thanks and Regards,
                           =
        Kumar Ghanta
