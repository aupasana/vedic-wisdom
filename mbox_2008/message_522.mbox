Om Brihaspataye Namah

Namaste dear Narasimhaji and other enlightened membe=
rs,

I have come across some interesting information about Harish Johari, 
=
being an enlightened soul. 

I have been reading his "Leela" book based on =
the Gyan Chaupad and it 
is very interesting and it resonates with my perso=
nal beliefs (that 
the ultimate goal of life is to reach Vaikuntha Loka and=
 serve the 
Lord)

However, I have read some reviews about his book, "Tools=
 for Tantra" 
with some people saying it is a dangerous book to read.
I am =
now feeling anxious because I wanted to read it, but now I am 
scared that =
maybe it is too esoteric to read. 

I have read other occult books before, =
but mostly by western authors 
on subjects such as summoning spirits etc- a=
nd nothing freaky or 
weird happened to me when reading those books.  

Any=
 advice?
