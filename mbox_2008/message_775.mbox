Rajgor Bhai,

Kem Chho?

> 1. Supressing desire cannot be termed as a brahm=
acharya..right?

The connection between'Desire & Supression' needs to be un=
derstood 
properly, once and for ever so as to understand Control & 
Annihi=
lation/overcome/rising above

Let us take a practical case of day to day li=
fe of a common person. 
Take an Individual 'Z' has a desire for copulation =
with his wife. He 
*Satisfies* his desire one day and becomes very satsfied=
 with it. 
now THAT perticular desire seems to be gone. few days passes on =
and 
mr. Z finds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again satsfies 
t=
he same with the same action. these cycle keeps going on & on for 
many yea=
rs. Mr. Z feels like most in the world that this desire to 
have sexual rel=
ationship is 'Natural'.

Now let's analysie the above case. Though mr.Z sat=
sfies the want of 
copulation, it comes back again & again. it means that t=
he desire 
has never been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.
**=
*
Our spiritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is lost 
duri=
ng copulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which if 
restrained=
, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and can 
help immensly in=
 the path of Spiritual journey.
***
consider that our Mr. Z some how got to=
 read the above paragraph and 
started seriously thinking about it. He tell=
s himself that he would 
refrain from intercourse for 3 months. The earlier=
 frequency was 2/3 
days, now he suddenly finds that desire has completely =
overtaken 
him. after 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in to his ever=
y 
pour and every thought and he gives up and succumbs to that gigantic 
fo=
rce of Kaam Vaasana. This may be called suppression initially 
which failed=
 the effort. The person again analyses what went wrong 
and again tries to =
do the same and again fails. he keeps on trying 
and keeps on failing. duri=
ng this battles, he is also exploring and 
gathering knowledge of experienc=
ed people and knowledge from 
spiritual books. he understands that if he ne=
eds to win the Final 
WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do l=
ot of things 
simultaneously and he then resorts to the help from many quar=
ters. 
He starts taking cold water bath, starts reading spiritual books, 
s=
tops reading film magazine, stops watching Films and TV Shows, 
Reduces eat=
ing Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan, Meditation 
and so on and so=
 forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on batteling 
with the *Natural Desir=
e* and still keeps on loosing. but the good 
news is that his days of batte=
ling before loosing has increased. 
started from 10 days, he has now reache=
d the struggeling capacity of 
90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE=
 IS FULLY COOPERATIVE OF 
HIS THEATRICS). He is still unhappy about his loo=
sing, although he 
is able to keep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 month=
s. some how 
he realises that God's grace is the most important thing espec=
ially 
for this perticular matter and he now starts Praying to his 
favouri=
te Deity every day. he cries and cries and requests the God 
to save him fr=
om this loss. he keeps on trying every thing possible, 
keeps on praying si=
ncerely and severly, keeps on doing various 
spiritual sadhanas but still k=
eeps on loosing at as well. over a 
period of some 8/10 years, the desired =
change is visible. he has 
conquered his desire. Now Sexual Desire which wa=
s his *Natural* for 
him has been replaced by Brahmacharya.

'Supression' w=
hen combined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped with 
every possible prep=
aration and will power to try untiringly again & 
again finally results in =
to annihilation.

***
> 2. To control desire is also not brahmacharya?

If =
a person who has gained perfect self control but indulges in to 
the act of=
 copulation only because to satisfy the desire of spouse 
or to have childr=
en, in my opinion, still maintains Brahmacharya.
actually brahmacharya is a=
 Nature, It can not be done but it Dawns.

***

in the same case, if the wi=
fe of Mr.Z is demanding then Z would have 
fight the one more big battle of=
 either convincing Wife by 
explainging her, slowly moulding her nature and=
 at the same time 
surrendering to the Lord. i mean praying lord to change =
her wife's 
nature so that she also starts thinking in the same line. as Na=
lini 
Bahen has said, accepting everything as Mother's wishes. Brahmachrya =

or No Brahmacharya.
 
***
friends, please forgive me. i think it was too m=
uch...but still i 
couldn't write many things going across my mind.
