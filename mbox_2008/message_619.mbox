Dear Sir, 
Thanks for prompt answer and good clarification. I am really an =
admirer of your spiritual articles and I have started Homam too after readi=
ng your experiences. No doubt, I am a moody person so not doing Homam regul=
arly.( I believe that to continue the rituals without break and to stick to=
 any disciplin, Saturn must be in the Asc. or with Moon or Saturn's strong =
aspect on Asc. is must.- sorry for astrology, please excuse me here). 
=C2=
=A0
I am satisfied with your answer now. I will write my other experiences =
in near future. All are unique, when I think today.

Namaste Ashwin ji,
=C2=A0
Well, I=
 am truly sorry that I disappointed you.
=C2=A0
Thakur isn't an ordinary be=
ing. Giving samadhi to a highly logical person (logical mind is a great obs=
tacle)=C2=A0like Naren just by a mere touch is no ordinary feat.=C2=A0He no=
t only experienced sahaja samadhi himself, which is off limits for even gre=
at siddhas, but induced it in Naren for a few days by the power of his thou=
ght. All these are signs of a being of the highest class.
=C2=A0
Knowing wh=
at kind a being Ramakrishna is, I am not too surprised or excited by what y=
ou said. I am really and genuinely sorry that you expected a different reac=
tion from me. But I don't feign a reaction that I do not really feel. I am =
really sorry.
=C2=A0
What you described IS a miracle. I do not doubt it at =
all. I am sorry if I gave that impression.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Hon=
estly, when I read several of the miraculous deeds of Ramakrishna, I do not=
 feel much excitement or emotion. I don't know why. On the other hand, simp=
le episodes like how he cried and begged Vivekananda not to leave make me w=
eep. He transformed Naren from an overly logical young boy to a mature man =
with the highest vairagya and he gave Naren many tremendous spiritual exper=
iences. Later Vivekananda said that the "mad brahmin" transformed him and m=
ade him who he was. He said Ramakrishna could have=C2=A0created 100 Vivekan=
andas from dirt!=C2=A0Yet, Ramakrishna did not feel any entitlement or owne=
rship and, instead, he cried and begged his disciple to=C2=A0not leave=C2=
=A0and do the Mother's work. What a pure and sattwik soul! When I think of =
his attitude, I get goosebumps.
=C2=A0
When I read how he simply left the p=
remises when told by a representative of Mathur that he was dismissed and h=
ad to leave the temple and how he came back as if nothing happned when Math=
ur came and fell at his feet and how he behaved the same way as if nothing =
happened in both cases is a practical demonstration of what Krishna taught =
in Gita. When I read about that, I melt in emotion.
=C2=A0
Thus, simple epi=
sodes bringing out the attitude of Thakur and illustrate how a sthita prajn=
a described by Krishna in Gita behaves excite me.
=C2=A0
The things about R=
amakrishna that excite me, make me weep and make me emotional=C2=A0may be a=
 little different from some other people.
=C2=A0
Bottomline is that Thakur =
exictes both of us. Perhaps there are different aspects of Thakur that we a=
re attached to and attracted to. But the good thing is that we are both att=
racted to him.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Suppose what he said to Sarad=
a Mata was only a "desire" and it did not happen. Suppose he is reborn afte=
r 150 years and has not yet come back. My point is that even then some peop=
le may have experiences of seeing his old embodied form, even as he exists =
on earth in a different body.
=C2=A0

Dear Narsimhaji,
I have joined this group for=
 last one year. I have read your valuable articles on this site. I also kne=
w that you are the lover and follower of Shri Shri Thakur. This was the rea=
son I wrote this mail on Thakur. I have narrated this incident to very few =
people who are loving Thakur and when I told this incident they all were we=
eping. But I am sorry that your mail disappointed me. You have given analys=
is of this incident on intellectual level or it=C2=A0was more logical and l=
ess devotional. I was expecting the excitement in your mail but you just ju=
stified that it is possible as our faith is working...!! !
Dear Sir, for yo=
ur information I would write that when this incident happened I was not kno=
wing Thakur, nor was any devotion towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I ha=
d just taken the decision to accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the=
 morning after discussion with my wife and started thinking that my decisio=
n was hasty. I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can =
test Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his words that=
 morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should co=
me to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come to my p=
lace within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him the way to my home. 
You ha=
ve written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 years. I think=C2=
=A0this was his desire and not necessary he is already born now.It is His w=
ill to take 100 years or 150 years for re-birth. I am now strongly believe =
that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another incidents are also l=
eading me to believe that He is coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was experie=
ncing him very offen. 
It was a miracle and whenever I remember this day I =
am excited. I am not his staunch devotee even today but still He is with me=
, He loves me rather. Oh, what to say !

=EF=BB=BF 
Dear Ashwin ji,
=
=C2=A0
It is a very interesting episode you have narrated! Thank you for sh=
aring it.
=C2=A0
After Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw him in=
 embodied form.
=C2=A0
That is entirely possible. When someone who did not =
identify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bod=
y and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom =
and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and =
he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in =
that body. It is not that he is "alive" or "dead". It is just that he is in=
 every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realized=
 the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiza=
tion was intact even while leaving that body.
=C2=A0
According to Sarada Ma=
ta, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years =
and that all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 ye=
ars. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that =
does not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at t=
he lower level form may still be able to access his previous form.
=C2=A0
E=
ven after the form of Rama left this=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krishn=
a was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be ab=
le to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
 was almost certainly an avatara.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sir, I=
 would like to share one of my great Devine experience about shri Ramkrishn=
adev. This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have not added =
anything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I am=
 going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are in=
 religious mood. 



I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office=
 near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allo=
wance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post =
office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone =
operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was wor=
king as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkri=
shnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur=
. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called=
 SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping w=
hile singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters =
were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years=
 old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 p=
m after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur. 

One day when we we=
re at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have co=
me to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few minu=
tes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise hi=
s 8 years old son came to call him. 

At one another incident he told me th=
at there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very =
much impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day I had to go =
to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be pun=
ctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was p=
unctured on the way. This was surprising. 

This all incidents made me to b=
elieve that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worsh=
ip only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also b=
e disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surr=
endered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture=
. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow=
 his grace. 

Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morn=
ing while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up=
 at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shr=
i Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a=
 lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrish=
na Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint b=
ut our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc=
. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gay=
atri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. 

Her arguments were right at her place as people i=
n general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I =
have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- 

But I =
remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their disciples=
 to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immedia=
tely told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to o=
ur home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am livin=
g. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would =
you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- 

She laugh=
ed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=
=80=9D-- 

I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my=
 decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even=
 today.=E2=80=99 

To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30=
 in the morning with angry mood. What he told? 

=E2=80=98 How dare you tes=
t Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty a=
nd I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep fo=
r 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=
=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to t=
est me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D 

I immediately rushed to your h=
ome. Thakur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. What y=
ou want? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such a sil=
ly things?=E2=80=99 

We both were so excited and surprised that we had no =
words that Morning. 

I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in =
my life. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I wi=
ll write it sometime. 

Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still=
 alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to =
exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us.

</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DVerdana>I have joined this group for last o=
ne year. I have read your valuable articles on this site. I also knew that =
you are the lover and follower of Shri Shri Thakur. This was the reason I w=
rote this mail on Thakur. I have narrated this incident to very few people =
who are loving Thakur and when I told this incident they all were weeping. =
But I am sorry that your mail disappointed me. You have given analysis of t=
his incident on intellectual level or it was more logical and less dev=
otional. I was expecting the <STRONG>excitement</STRONG> in your mail but y=
ou just justified that it is possible as our faith is working...!! !</FONT>=
</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DVerdana>Dear Sir, for your information I would wri=
te that when this incident happened I was not knowing Thakur, nor was any d=
evotion towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I had just taken the decision =
to accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the morning after discussion =
with my wife and started thinking that my decision was hasty. I just taken =
a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can test Thakur before you acc=
ept him as your Guru. I remembered his words that morning and told my wife =
that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should come to my house. I was not =
knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come to my place within 10 minutes and=
 Thakur will show him the way to my home. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DV=
erdana>You have written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 year=
s. I think this was his desire and not necessary he is already born no=
w.It is His will to take 100 years or 150 years for re-birth. I am now stro=
ngly believe that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another inciden=
ts are also leading me to believe that He is coming to this earth. Mr. Pate=
l was experiencing him very offen. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DVerdana>=
It was a miracle and whenever I remember this day I am excited. I am not hi=
s staunch devotee even today but still He is with me, He loves me rather. O=

son in that body. It is not that he is "alive" or "dead". It is just that h=
