Dear Utpal ji,
It looks like only first 7 chapters are available in English=
. However 
I am very lucky to know about this great humble and practical sa=
int. 
I really like autobiographies(first hand experiences) of the great 
s=
aints. One of the most impressive things is he just didn't recollect 
his m=
emories to write his autobiography, rather he used the diary 
which he has =
maintained throughout his life to record his 
experiences. 

I will try to =
get the information about that book soon from the 
website owner. Translati=
on also looks very good.  
               Thanks and Regards,
             =
   kumar Ghanta
