The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita

In =
the beginning the creator created human beings together with
selfless servi=
ce (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By serving each other you
shall prosper and =
the sacrificial service shall fulfill all your
desires. (3.10)

Nourish the=
 celestial controllers with selfless service, and they will
nourish you. Th=
us nourishing one another you shall attain the Supreme
goal. (3.11)

The ce=
lestial controllers, served by selfless service, will give you
all desired =
objects. One who enjoys the gift of celestial controllers
without sharing w=
ith others is, indeed, a thief. (3.12)

The righteous who eat after feeding=
 others are freed from all sins,
but the impious who cook food only for the=
mselves - without first
offering to God, or sharing with others - verily ea=
t sin. (3.13)

The living beings are born from food grains, grains are prod=
uced by
sacrificial work or duty performed by farmers and other field worke=
rs.
Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. Scriptures (such as the Vedas,
th=
e Holy Bible, the Holy Koran) come from the Supreme Being. Thus the
all-per=
vading Supreme Being or God is ever present in selfless
service. (3.14-15)
=

The one who does not help to keep the wheel of creation in motion by
sacri=
ficial duty (Seva), and rejoices sense pleasures, that sinful
person lives =
in vain. (3.16)

The one who rejoices the Supreme Being, who is delighted w=
ith the
Supreme Being, and who is content with the Supreme Being alone, for=

such a Self-realized person there is no duty. Such a person has no
interes=
t, whatsoever, in what is done or what is not done. A
Self-realized person =
does not depend on anybody, except God, for
anything. (3.17-18)

In 2005, Dr. Frank Morales wrote a long philosophical es=

destined to become one of the most widely read, groundbreaking=
, and
influential works ever written in the history of Hinduism. In the
las=
t two years since its initial publication, Dr. Morales' work
on "Radical Un=

periodicals, appeared on hund=
reds of websites, and changed the way
the world views Sanatana Dharma forev=
er!

Now a new, expanded edition of this work has been published in India
b=
y the Voice of India publishing company. With a powerful forward by
Dr. Dav=
id Frawley, and endorsements by dozens of the world's most
important Hindu =
leaders, this new book edition of Dr. Morales' work
is destined to reach an=
 even broader audience.

"Few have the backg=
round and fewer still the courage to speak boldly
about the unfortunate asc=
ension in modern times of Hindu universalism.
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya=
 has both, and wields them in this book
to trenchant purpose. Anyone seekin=
g to comprehend the origins and
intellectual dangers of an "all religions a=
re the same" mind-set need
look no further. It's all flayed open here, logi=
cally and compellingly."

Paramacharya Palaniswami
Editor-in-Chief

 Today Magazine


"Radical Universalism" by Dr. Frank Morales is an importa=
nt essay that
dispels many misconceptions about the Hindu tradition. Sanata=
na Dharma
emphatically speaks of the difference between the asuric and the
=
daivika currents of reality and the need to choose the latter if one
wishes=
 to obtain knowledge and understanding. Dr Morales is right to
stress that =
the slogan that "all religions are the same" is
antithetical to the spirit =
of the Vedas. Progress, at the personal and
the societal levels, comes only=
 through a process of churning. I
recommend this book very strongly."

Prof=
essor Subhash Kak
Author of "The Prajna Sutra, The Astronomical Code of the=
 Rgveda", and
many other books.


"In this book, Dharma teacher Sri Dharma =
Pravartaka Acharya
(American-born Dr. Frank Morales) develops a cogent argu=
ment against
the universalistic fallacy. He traces its origins in the colon=
ial
condition, when prominent Hindus interiorized this novel European
idea,=
 and documents its lightning career through divergent sections of
Hindu soc=
iety including such seeming antagonists as Gandhism and Hindu
nationalism. =
He draws attention to the odd sense of superiority which
some preachers der=
ive from the allegedly Hindu teaching that "unlike
other religions, Hinduis=
m doesn't claim to be unlike other religions".
Then he proceeds to deconstr=
uct this fashionable rhetoric about the
equal truth of all religions. With =
compelling logic, he shows its
contradictions as well as its undesirable et=
hical implications. Not
least, he proves that it is deeply un-Hindu, for Hi=
nduism values truth
over syrupy and futile attempts to please everyone."

The Rishi Phenomenon
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya
(Dr. Frank=
 Morales, Ph.D.)

(The following is an excerpt from Dr. Frank Morales' fort=
hcoming book
"Whisperings of the Divine: How God is Known in the Vedic Trad=
ition.")


The rishi phenomenon is an instance of a human being who, throug=
h the
allied processes of yoga, tapas (vows of austerity), sadhanas
(system=
atic spiritual disciplines), intense meditation (dhyana), and
other esoteri=
c means of systematic self-purification, has achieved
absolute transcendenc=
e over the non-atman (non-spiritual) aspects of
herself. Having gained comp=
lete control over the body, mind, speech,
and senses, the rishi becomes tra=
nsformed into a being who is
thoroughly absorbed in the spiritual reality. =
Being thus absorbed,
she has a direct and unmediated experiential connectio=
n with the
truth. In the terminology of Yoga philosophy, such a state is kn=
own
as samadhi, or perfect meditative absorption.

The samadhi state is one=
 of enstasy, in which the individual undergoes
the experience of standing w=
ithin her true self and tasting the bliss
of her own inner reality. From th=
is trans-material perspective within
the samadhi state, the yogi and the Ab=
solute - the subjective
experiencer and the transcendent object of the expe=
rience - become
intimately reunited. "Experience is synonymous with reality=
", says
Mahanamabrata, "which is to be analyzed, synthesized and plunged in=
to,
so that its ultimate nature may be immediately apprehended." (3) There
=
are two different levels of samadhi that the yogi undergoes in her
attempt =
to realize the ultimate truth. The first of these is
savikalpa-samadhi, in =
which the yogi begins to identify with the
essence of the Absolute. At the =
highest stage of savikalpa-samadhi,
one is able to attain the realization o=
f one's own primal substratum,
which is composed of saccidananda (sat, cit =
and ananda), or
unadulterated consciousness qualified by the attributive qu=
alities of
never-ending being, cognizance and bliss. In the second stage of=

samadhi, known as nirvikalpa-samadhi, the yogi achieves complete
identific=
ation with her true self, atman, and has direct praesentia
dei perception o=
f Parabrahman, the Supreme Absolute. This is an
experience that is describe=
d as being situated beyond the delimiting
modes of time and space, thus utt=
erly transcendental in content. In
the immediate aftermath of this radical =
ontological shift in the
yogi's subjective locus, a complete transformation=
 of her
consciousness subsequently ensues. The externally observable
ramifi=
cations of the samadhi phenomenon on the subject (the yogi
/rishi) are two-=
fold. One is psychological in nature, the other
epistemological.

The psych=
ological and cognitive impact of the samadhi phenomenon is
radically transf=
ormative in nature. This transformation that occurs
within the yogi (soon t=
o be rishi) affects her on a variety of levels,
including intellectual, men=
tal, emotional, nervous, and ethical. For
the sake of remaining firmly situ=
ated within the epistemic bounds of
the present work, however, we will focu=
s primarily on the cognitive
modification that takes place in the psyche of=
 the rishi (seer).
Because the rishi has conquered the demands of the ego, =
she is no
longer subject to the four imperfections of bhrama (the tendency
=
toward illusion), pramada (inattentiveness), vipralasa (the desire to
cheat=
) and karanapatava (insufficiency of the senses) put forth by
Hindu philoso=
phers in their critique of pratyaksha and anumana. The
Bhagavad-gita explai=
ns this state in the following manner.


"He whose mind is not affected in =
sorrow
and is free from desire in pleasure
and who is without attachment, f=
ear, or anger -
he is called a sage of steady insight (sthita-dhi)."


Sinc=
e her knowledge of the truth is derived via direct, non-mediated
transmissi=
on - from Brahman (God) to atman (soul) - completely
bypassing the customar=
y intermediary routes of the senses, mind,
intellect and ego, karanapatava =
(insufficiency of the senses) is
averted. Empirical and rational instrument=
s simply are no longer
employed in this instance. Therefore, their perfecti=
on, or lack
thereof, is rendered a thorough non-issue. Additionally, becaus=
e she
is no longer under the illusion that her self-interest is of any
supe=
rior value to the ultimate spiritual interest of all other beings,
the defe=
ct of vipralasa (the desire to cheat), also, no longer
applies. The ultimat=
e interest of all other living beings is now her
supreme interest. Thus the=
 apta (reliable person) is a perfectly
moral being, acting from and in good=
ness, not due to a mere sense of
necessitating duty, but out of her own int=
rinsic atmic (spiritual)
nature. Having attained a state of dharana, or per=
fect concentration,
she is not subject to pramada (inattentiveness). Being =
thoroughly
absorbed in the loving contemplation (upasana) of Brahman, her
a=
ttention is perfectly and effortlessly alert, never diverted and
ever-focus=
ed. Finally, having transcended the firm grip of maya
(illusion) altogether=
, the tendency of bhrama (the tendency toward
illusion) is nothing more tha=
n a faint memory for the rishi.

Having thus risen above all the defective =
tendencies of the mundane
cognitive processes, the rishi is seen, by the va=
st majority of
philosophers within the Sad-darshana (seven schools of Sanat=
ana Dharma
philosophy) tradition, as the most indisputable source of knowle=
dge.
The rishi is not merely an intellectual who attempts to grasp the
trut=
h, captures it, and then mechanically teaches it to others.
Rather, she is =
a transparent via medium through which transcendent
truth is seen and direc=
tly experienced first-hand. She is a breathing
example of truth in living, =
caring motion. In a poem created by Ren=E9
Dumal, we find a beautiful descr=
iption of the profound experience that
the rishi has:


"You cannot stay on=
 the summit forever;
You have to come down again.
So why bother in the firs=
t place? Just this:
What is above knows what is below,
But what is below do=
es not know what is above.
One climbs, one sees.
One descends, one sees no =
longer, but one has seen.
There is an art of conducting oneself in the lowe=
r regions.
When one can no longer see, one can at least still know."


For =
Sanatana Dharma, the rishi is no less than a living testament to
the existe=
nce, nature, and power of God. It is for this reason that
the rishis are te=
rmed aptah, or "perfectly reliable authorities."
