Namaste,

Yes, I use drigdasa taught by Maharshi Parasara for timing spiritual 
progress astrologically. This dasa applies to all people's charts.

As I said earlier, I am a little hesitant to teach Chandi homam publicly, 
unlike Mahaganapathi homam. If She inspires me in future to do so, I may.

Chandi homam is quite powerful. If one with strong desires performs it well 
for a period of time, one can fulfil most desires. Thus, there is scope for 
abuse. Of course, the abuse cannot take place unless She wills it. It may be 
Her will to make someone use this in a particular way and some negative 
karma to be generated. However, the law of "equal reaction to actions" is 
unbreakable and one will have to experience the fruits of the karma 
incurred. To a self-realized person, no karma sticks and hence no fruit of a 
karma sticks. When someone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi 
gets throat cancer for example, they may remain unaffected by it and see the 
suffering of the body in the same way a physical pleasure is seen. But, 
someone who is not there yet and someone who experiences fruits of different 
karmas differently still (instead of looking at them the same way), needs to 
be careful in choosing which karmas to undertake and which to avoid.

On the other extreme, if one performs Chandi homam well for a period of time 
without much desire, She can put one on the fast track and give a high level 
of detachment and very quick spiritual progresss. It can sometimes be too 
quick for the person.

Chandi is the union of Mahakaali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati - three root 
energies behind the creation, sustenance and destruction of this universe. 
She is the primordial energy of this universe. She is too powerful.

Best regards,
Narasimha
