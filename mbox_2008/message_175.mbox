namaste,

The mantra comes from the rudra-prashna of the taittiriya samhita. The
style of this prashna is such that namaH is said only once for each
pair of two names. eg. "namaH somAya ca rudrAya ca". So also, the
relevant snippet is "namaH shivAya ca shivatarAya ca". namaH applies
both to shiva and shivarata. In the rudra trishati (where namah is
added to each name), the same mantra is said as "namaH shivAya ca
namaH".

bhavadIyaH,

        ajit
