Namaste,
 
Yes, you can. Take a sankalpa for Ucchishta Ganapathi homam and =
Sri Lakshmi homam. Invoke Ucchishta Ganapathi in fire, do panchopachara poo=
ja, offer the chosen mantra of his as many times as you want and then offer=
 him some naivedyam/food (fruit piece or something). Then invoke Lakshmi in=
 the same fire, do a panchopachara pooja, offer her chosen mantra as many t=
imes as you want and offer her some naivedyam/food. Then do uttarangam and =
poornahuti. At the time of poornahuti, you can say the main mantras of both=
 devatas and offer poornaahuti.
 
I have seen some priests actually take sa=
nkalpam for only one homam and make offerings to other deities also, withou=
t a formal invocation. In other words, you take sankalpam for Ganapathi onl=
y and, after finishing his mantra, you simply pour ahutis in fire for Laksh=
mi (or other deities). That is also fine.
 
When you receive a VIP at your =
house, you may follow a protocol (e.g. greet him at the door, walk him insi=
de, make him sit down in a sofa, offer some refreshments, chat for a while,=
 serve some food, send off formally etc). When you receive two VIPs togethe=
r, you can treat them together or separately and use different level of for=
mality with them. The level of formality and protocol to be followed really=
 depends on how comfortable you are with them and how well you know them. T=
hus, some shortcuts resorted to be some priests may be somewhat inappropria=
te for normal people in the beginning. Thus, it is a good idea to formally =
invoke each deity. If you want to offer a specific mantra for a very small =
count, it is perhaps ok to offer without an invocation.
 
*        *       =
 *
 
Some priests give multiple poornaahutis. After finishing Ganapathi man=
tra, they give one poornaahuti and they give one more after finishing Laksh=
mi mantra and give one final "Maha Poornahuti" at the very end. As poornaah=
uti means "complete surrender" and it is like a river going and merging in =
an ocean, I think multiple poornaahutis are not really needed. When you giv=
e one poornaahuti at the end, gods are not going to be confused who it is m=
eant for and fight over it. They know that it is for the underlying one god=
 within them. What is important is to instill a true sense of complete surr=
ender at poornaahuti time and meditate deeply.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

            Namaste,

 =
           Choosing the right deity for sadhana is important. If you do not=
 know the 
            right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely b=
etter than waiting. Pick 
            whatever deity seems natural to you a=
nd do sadhana.

            Please remember that sadhana for spiritual prog=
ress is different from 
            sadhana for specific material benefits.=
 No matter which deity you worship, 
            sadhana performed for spir=
itual progress never goes waste. However, 
            sometimes it may be =
necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas 
            before =
some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a 
    =
        basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you=
 to do 
            serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the =
bottom or middle of 
            the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose =
god decides to give you the fruits 
            of those auspicious karmas.=
 Imagine him reaching into the pile and 
            retrieving those karma=
s. In the process, some other karmas may spill over 
            and give t=
heir fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had 
         =
   to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!

            A serious =
sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly 
            undesi=
rable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.

       =
     One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good 
     =
       priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days=
, he was 
            laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He c=
ontinued his sadhana 
            and used the break to go on an extended t=
rip to India and make a pilgrimage 
            to some nice places. He par=
ticipated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted 
            at the Kaalik=
ambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got 
            =
the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house =

            of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact wi=
th my guru 
            very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a =
vision of the Mother on 
            2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She t=
old him to start the work on spreading 
            homam in the world, thi=
s gentleman was present there. Though he could not 
            see the Mot=
her, he actually smelled something out of the world and was 
            ba=
ffled. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple 
 =
           was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the o=
nly people 
            on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even thou=
gh he could not see the 
            Mother, it was most fortunate of him t=
o be present there at *that* crucial 
            moment. That is enough to=
 mould the rest of his life.

            You never know how, when and wher=
e the grace of god falls on you. 
            Calculations and logic are us=
eless when it comes to the grace of god. Just 
            surrender and ke=
ep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs 
            fine-tuning,=
 somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that 
            ha=
ppen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
  =
          some debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some=
 really 
            auspicious karmas.

            As Shirdi Sai Baba say=
s, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have devotion 
            and pat=
ience. There is no limit to what you can get then.

            Best regard=
s,
            Narasimha

off formally etc). When you receive two =
VIPs together, you can treat them 
together or separately and use different=
 level of formality with them. The level 
of formality and protocol to be f=
ollowed really depends on how comfortable you 
are with them and how well y=

some priests may be some=

Thus, it is a good =

            the time and my guru and this ge=

            Leaving astro=
logy aside and those who do not have a guru<BR>> how 
            can th=
ey chooose a particular form of GOD<BR>> bcoz in second 
            par=
t of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity<BR>> is very 
        =
    important, as the analogy he gave of a person<BR>> who is greedy 
  =
          and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed<BR>><BR>> One=
 
            thing more<BR>> we have so many deities that on diwali i w=
ould 
            like to worship<BR>> Lakshmi and Kali<BR>> in navar=
atri 
            (nowadays) we would worship Durga<BR>> on janmashtami =
we would 
            fast for KRISHNA<BR>> an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHI=

            this<BR>> with hte change in festival the d=

            changes<BR>><BR>> though everybody knows GOD is ONE=
 but it 
            becomes difficult to get<BR>> out of this<BR>> m=
