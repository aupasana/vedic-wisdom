  2)Gotra - How to find it in the chart and have you see=

    Namaste,

    There are really two different th=
ings here.

    Some people are born with an amsa (part) of a rishi's consc=
iousness. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that Narendranath (Swam=
i Vivekananda) was one of the seven great rishis. Many people did meet him.=
 Thus, meeting the physical manifestation of an amsa of a rishi is not that=
 difficult (though that also requires some punya).

    The second thing is=
 to meet the physical manifestation of the entire consciousness of a rishi.=
 *That* is very very very difficult. As Vimalananda said, that may require =
a terrific amount of tapascharya (unless you are one of that rishi's people=
 who came to do some work on earth and have already done a terrific amount =
of tapascharya in past lives).

    *        *        *

    One may wonder=
: If rishis are so great, why do they not get moksha and why do they remain=
 in physical manifestation?

    Though the following is essentially like a=
 kindergartener explaining Einstein's theory of general relativity to fello=
w kindergarteners, I will nevertheless try to explain it.

    All that our=
 senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the power of duality=
. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and all is ONE un=
iform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or Brahman or =
Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness is know=
n as "unmanifested Brahman". The world of duality, where there are many dif=
ferent objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went throug=
h some modification and manifestation. It is known as "manifested Brahman".=
 Both are Brahman only.

    Normally, living in the domain of duality with=
out being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near to impossi=
ble. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the underlying on=
eness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality without ex=
periencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of duality is almo=
st impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness w=
ith unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no obje=
ctification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advait=
ic experience of "nirvikalpa samadhi" and what happens in "moksha".

    Ho=
wever, maharshis have described higher states. It is possible to be in onen=
ess with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It i=
s possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of dual=
ity, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all=
 obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repul=
sion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is=
 not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find =
some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state where th=
ere is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.

    Su=
ch a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shir=
di Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experienc=
ed it.

    Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are=
 always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of=
 duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcome=
s attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much =
do anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, =
it means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for p=
ersonal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implem=
ents the wish of nature through one's actions, which are performed without =
any attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can d=
o limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. On=
e who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are de=
sired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the co=
urse of history of nations and planets.

    A rishi in this state may enga=
ge in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no =
attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.=


    If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested B=
rahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision =
of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus,=
 he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of=
 such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a proces=
s running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed=
 task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and=
 early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc =
again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process o=
f overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekanan=
da is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and =
overcome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa=
 of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.

    Thus=
, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with=
 the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nat=
ure performing actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego =
driving those actions.

    *        *        *

    Worshipping the rishi =
of one's gotra and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, g=
etting the blessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of on=
e's gotra is relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connectio=
n with a specific rishi (apart from the rishi of one's gotra), one can wors=
hip that rishi. However, it is not easy to know that.

    Suppose several =
mantras you find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific =
Maharshi as the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. Y=
ou can try praying to him.

    Best regards,
    Narasimha

          Dear Prasad,

              I do not know any specific mantra. I =
know many mantras for which Kashyapa is rishi, but no mantra to pray to Kas=
hyapa himself.

              There are many mantras for Prajapati in gener=
al ("prajaapate na tvadetaanyanyo. .."), but I don't know a mantra specific=
ally to worship Kashyapa.

              If you perform a homam, you can ad=
d the following line after the poorvaangam (initial five aahutis) and befor=
e the uttarangam.

              Om kashyapaaya swaahaa. kashyapaayedam na =
mama.

              Say it and make an offering of ghee for Kashyapa.

   =
           Another way to worship a rishi is to take section of Veda for wh=
ich he is the rishi and try to experience that section. You can simply pick=
 one rik for which Kashyapa is rishi and keep meditating on that rik. You c=
an close your eyes, keep back straight and repeat the rik mentally with swa=
ram without moving and do that everyday for a certain amount of time. Oneda=
y the rishi may be pleased with you and you may experience something.

re are signs on their body.And that only 
            some who has done ter=
rific amount of tapashya is eligible to meet a 
            Rishi. And also=
 that praying to Rishi of ones gotra can help to
