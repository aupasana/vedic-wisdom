 The astrological angle I criticized in another mail today is only
one aspe=

people from progr=

done away with, when the=

However, there are also right ways to do so many things. =
Let me give

ends, the *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether you

spiritual sadhana, it=

Dear Sir,
This art=
icle has given me a lot of hope.
Sir I learned trancendental meditation  wh=
en i was in 8th class.I
practised it for some time.During college years i r=
ead the Mahabharat
and many other religious texts.I always did daily puja w=
ith a lot of
bhakti.
Three years ago, i met Vashisthji in Gondia--He is a r=
etired officer
of the irrigation department--He thaught me the basics .
of =
astrology.He also guided me to do jaap.During navrati i did jaap of
devi's =
navarn mantra.Then during saawan month i did jaap of shiva's
panchakshari m=
antra.Last chaitra navratri i did gayatri jaap and again
this shravan i did=
 Shiva's jaap.
 But all this was done without any nyas or any of the other =
things
that you have mentioned.I always wondered whether what i was doing w=
as
right, but still went ahead thinking that taking Gods name cannot be
wro=
ng.Also all these jaap were done without asking for anything in
return.Am i=
 right ?I dont know sanskrit so though i have so many books
i am unable to =
learn from them.
  Also from sometime i have been thinking that it might be=
 better if i
stuck to one mantra rather than doing so many different ones.I=
 would
be greatfull to you.Please help me.
My dob is 28 nov. 1967;pob is mu=
mbai;and tob is 8.20am.
sorry about the lenth of this mail,but quite frankl=
y i could go on and on.
Thank you and waiting for your reply.
             =
                Sunita.
