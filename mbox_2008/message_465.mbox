Earlier, I was exerting discretion in sharing personal accounts, but She has
been making me drop guard of late, for whatever reason. I will continue in
the same vein for a little more time.

I had a dream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the dream,
there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were sitting in
front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in the
dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not recognize.
It was not anybody I had seen before.

I mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First he said he
did not know who the other person was and said he would've probably known if
I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it there.
However, when we talked in the next weekend, he referred to my dream and
said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to search on
the internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in my dream.
It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before him). Though
he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this lineage and
did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and found a
photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw in my
dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dream looked like a
slightly younger version of that photo.

When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and said, "Narasimha, there
are so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now."

Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the lineage of
Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from Dattatreya. We
have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his lineage and got
a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from them. We do
not have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda. But,
Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he guessed
who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he guessed
correctly. That should count for something!

I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle connections between
several lineages that seem disjoint today.

By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of Sri
Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad) and
imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.

*        *        *

An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted me within a
few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa Yogananda were
co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the keeper of
some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar Maharaj.
He visited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a day at my
house. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative of that
lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may have been
there...

*        *        *

I want to make one thing clear.

Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my guru has
some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he always
downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He says,
"Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and capable of
nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every entity in
this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument sometimes
and do something using me. I have no special abilities of any kind. Any
coincidences you find are just Her grace and not due to me."

I realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego is not
fake. I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to do things
that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many great
saints in the past were like this. Several magical things happened through
them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained their humility
and sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and believed that god
was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.

The day you also start believing that, not for the sake of lecturing or
posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana will bear
fruit.

Best regards,
Narasimha

For what it is worth, you can read more about Paramahamsa Yogananda in
his free+online autobiography,
here http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi

There were interesting links between Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and
Paramahamsa Yogananda:-
For example, one of the top disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was
Mahendranath Gupta (not sure if he was one of the 16 monastic
disciples that Narasimhaji refers to) aka Master Mahasaya, who wrote
"The Gospel of Ramakrishna"
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendranath_Gupta), and was the
sanskrit tutor to Paramahamsa Yogananda as well; the latter devoted an
entire chapter to him in his
book : http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_9

Elsewhere in his autobiography Paramhamsa Yogananda also mentions an
anecdote of a disciple to whom he gifted a silver cup, who as a young
man was told by Swami Vivekandana that the Guru in his life would
present him with a silver cup in the future.
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_47

Makes you wonder about the Divine connection between all these
supremely elevated souls!

Best.
