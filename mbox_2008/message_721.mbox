Dear Narayanji
=C2=A0
Thanks a lot for your advice. I remember you had advi=
sed me about this previously and I follow your advise of completing the hom=
a always till teh end.

What I was curious about is that, does it indicate =
bad things or something asubha? As Narasimhajhi mentions in his mail that i=
t is not a good thing for the fire to get extinguished..
=C2=A0
Thanks once=
 again for you reply.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


The upsurge (of cons=
ciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Dear R=
ajarshi,

This has happened to me a couple of times early on when I started=

doing Homa. The best thing is as you did, lit it back and continue
with it=
. This is also a reason why I keep lots of camphor handy with
me. When face=
d with such a scenario, I usually crush the camphor and
offer it to the emb=
ers, which then slowly ignites.

Also, when you want to prevent a fire from=
 extinguishing, dont blow
direcly into the fire in the homa kundam. Blow it=
 on your hands and
direct it towards the agni in the kundam.

Hope this hel=
ps.

Regards
-Narayan-
