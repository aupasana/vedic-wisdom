|| Om Sri Gurubhyo Namah ||

Namaskaar Narasimha Ji,

Your explanation of d=
uality and non-duality by the way of example of the
offerings to the Homa i=
s just excellent! I think I understood the basic
guidelines, and now can co=
ntemplate further within this framework.

Namaskaar Rajarshi Ji,

I have he=
ard about this rupa of Shiva a lot, but I have no idea of why
He takes this=
 rupa, why people worship Him in this rupa, and why Devi
worships Him in th=
is rupa (Bhairava-poojini is one of the names of
Mother in Lalita Sahasrana=
mam). I would be so obliged to read you
describe this rupa, since you are a=
lso a devotee.

With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Reema.
