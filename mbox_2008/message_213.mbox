Dear Kasim,
 
Please check "Notable Horoscopes" by Dr B.V. Raman. He discus=
sed Akbar's chart.
 
I am not actively working on the Tithi Pravesha book r=
ight now. It is not really in my hand. But I can sense that the time to wra=
p it up is coming soon.
 
But, before that book, I will probably be sharing=
 a second homam manual.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Akbar (Re: Boycott 'Jodhaa Akbar' | Participate in awareness drive)


    N=
amaskaram anna,

    I saw this movie and I cannot help responding.

    It=
 is true that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffered badly at the hands of Mus=
lim invaders (and other invaders), but it is wrong to take out that anger o=
n Akbar. Some people cannot see beyond a man's name and religion and hence =
cannot recognize when a great celestial being is born in a different religi=
on.

    Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the "Aghora" serie=
s books, is somebody who achieved the highest states of consciousness. He r=
eceived a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Accordinging to him, =
Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Rajput King Prithvi=
raj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim invaders at the bord=
er of India. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of =
them and put breaks on their aggression and changed their ways.

    In tha=
t age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temples, libraries a=
nd other relics of native religion and culture. They beheaded Hindus who re=
fused to convert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded defeated kings. =
They just tried to wipe out the native religion and culture and replace wit=
h theirs. Akbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and promoted toler=
ance and integration. He stopped the forced conversions, rapes and beheadin=
gs of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples and libraries. He talke=
d about respecting other religions while following one's own religion. He e=
ven took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a special tax on Hi=
ndus based on religion. He was a man of great character, conviction and pri=
nciples and was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs and was even =
born in a Rajput family and spent early years there. He displayed the samsk=
aras and instincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mu=
ghal kig - he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-=
brother Adham.

    He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and then=
 participate in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to our homam) =
and then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unheard of from=
 any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!). Towards the=
 end of his life, he even started his own religion, which was based on his =
realization and is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated soul. Irrespe=
ctive of the religion one follows, one deserves our respect and admiration =
if one embodies the spirit of sanatana dharma in one's thoughts and actions=
.

    Akbar was a true hero - a being who came down from a higher loka to =
fulfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. His contribution to =
the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what harm his f=
ellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to be judge=
d from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not=
 come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much m=
ore than it did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent =
somebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate that =
those who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cannot see th=
e goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.

    It is unfortunate =
that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric Musli=
m kings. Who should be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as an en=
emy and being shot down. Instead, we should promote his story and inspire m=
ore people to be like him. He was a great inspirational figure then and sho=
uld be now too.

    The epic movie "Jodha Albar" is a very good movie abou=
t one of the greatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director and =
actor did justice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad abou=
t the mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please do=
 not assassinate the character of Akbar.

    If you want, please make movi=
es of the same caliber and cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such =
as Chatrapati Shivaji, Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka=
, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ra=
makrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no ne=
ed to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.

    These are my 2 cents on th=
e fire over Jodha Akbar.

    Best regards,
    Narasimha

    =
  The movie Jodhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by a mischi=
evous producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick bucks by deni=
grating and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people. Sonia's (Antonia Maino) Co=

Akbar was a true hero - a being who came down 
    from a higher loka to fu=
lfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. 
    His contribution =
to the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be judged 
    from what ha=
rm his fellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His 
    contribution i=
s to be judged from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he 
    helped *avo=
id*. If he had not come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma 
    would ha=
ve suffered much much more than it did. That was not the wish of 
    rishi=
s and that is why they sent somebody to alter the course and minimize 
    =
the harm. It is unfortunate that those who see the goodness of emperor 
   =
 Ashoka and king Shivaji cannot see the goodness of Akbar simply because he=
 
    was a Muslim.</FONT></DIV>

    <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>It is unfortunate that =
some Hindus are equating 
    Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric Musli=

    friend of Hindus is being portrayed as =
an enemy and being shot 
    down. Instead, we should promote his stor=

    be like him. He was a great inspirational=

The epic movie "Jodha Albar" is a very good 
    movie about one of the gre=
atest and most dharmik emperors of India. The 
    director and actor did j=
ustice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I 
    am sad about the =
mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. 
    Please do =
not assassinate the character of Akbar.</FONT></DIV>
