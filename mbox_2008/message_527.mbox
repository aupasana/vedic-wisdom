Namaste Utpalji, Hariji, Naliniji,



   Thank you all a lot for the encou=
ragement and appreciation shown, I am
working on getting the pre-amble and =
post-amble as suggested by Hariji.



Utpalji,

    Thank you for pointing =
out the mistake, I have checked it 3-4 times
before uploading it, but yes I=
 will check more times thoroughly to see
if the mistakes can be reduced.  M=
y main reference was from
http://sanskrit.safire.com/pdf/DURGA700.pdf
<http=
://sanskrit.safire.com/pdf/DURGA700.pdf>    and it shows the last
word of d=
hyanam in first chapter as Madhum-kautabam (=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=81=E0=
=A4=82
=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8C=E0=A4=9F=E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=8D), but I verif=
ied the same today by listening
on Raaga (http://www.raaga.com/getclip.asp?=
id=3D999999077103
<http://www.raaga.com/getclip.asp?id=3D999999077103> ) an=
d it is
Madhum-kaitabham (=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=95=E0=
=A5=88=E0=A4=9F=E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=8D)



Thank you all,

Hari Sarma.
