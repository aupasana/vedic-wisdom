Namaste,
 
Abstinence is not brahmacharya, but it is a good start towards i=
t.
 
To have the mind established in god and not have any desires spring in=
 it is brahmacharya.
 
But, as long as we keep fulfilling desires, more and=
 more of them keep springing up. The process of overcoming the springing up=
 of new desires often starts with suppressing (and not fulfilling) old desi=
res and take the mind away from it.
 
But, that is the beginning and not th=
e end.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding being married and not fulfilling t=
he desire of spouse:
 
One's karmik debts may require one to fulfil the sex=
ual desire of another person. But, the problem is that we incur new debts w=
hile paying off old debts in this matter, like in many other matters. In ge=
neral, if one engages in an action with a detached mind that finds the acti=
on neither attractive nor repulsive, one is not committing a new karma and =
creating new debts to be settled later. One is merely settling old debts wi=
th such detached actions. But, if one engages in an action with an attached=
 mind that finds the action either attractive or repulsive, one IS committi=
ng a new karma and creating new debts to be settled later. This becomes an =
endless cycle! 
 
Sex is a highly physical action. While engaging in it, it=
 is nearly impossible to detach the mind from body and focus on god. Mind i=
nvariably gets attached to the body and its experience. Thus, one is not on=
ly settling old debts by giving pleasure, but one also creates a new debt b=
y deriving pleasure again. This is an endless cycle.
 
*        *        *
=
 
Scriptures cover a lot of ground and they say a lot of things that may co=
ntradict one another. Yes, one who marries and begets children is needed fo=
r the continuation of human race and smooth running of society. But, dharma=
 and moksha are different. Performing your duties sincerely is good and tak=
es you to heaven for a while and then brings you back here. For liberation =
from the cycle, one has to overcome the weaknesses and desires.
 
Do not co=
mpare with gods like Rama and Krishna. Our minds are totally different from=
 those of gods and rishis. Krishna was the Ishwara of Yogis, whose mind was=
 eternally in yoga with the Absolute. Actually, his mind may be taken as th=
e definition of Absolute. His mind is not anything like ours.
 
Best regard=
s,
Narasimha

 Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya


        Namaste,

        =
I have read the contents of utpal.. that had raised few questions in to my =
mind.. i would be happy if utpal can answer me..

        1. Supressing des=
ire cannot be termed as a brahmacharya..right?
        2. To control desire=
 is also not brahmacharya? 

        In our vedic books also, it is specifi=
cally mentioned that DHANYO GRUHASTHASHARAM. Lord rama was also married and=
 had kids..still he was called Maryada purushottam...Lord Krishna has 8 pat=
ranis and 16000 gopia.. well does it mean that Lord krishna had physical re=
lationship with all of them.. or he had not? that is all together different=
 issue..But lord krishna was shringar priya  and  it seems that he had enjo=
yed physical realtionship.. (???)  still he was called brahmachari.. how? i=
 am bit confused.. 

        I personally feel that to have sexual desire a=
nd not fulfilling it,  cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is like cheati=
ng yourself... and if you are married and if you donot fulfill desire of yo=
ur spouse is also not good.. Please advise.

        Thanks

        Rajesh=

Namaste,

          Let me put some thoughts and i'll continue writng as it=
 keeps on 
          occuring to me...

          1) Thakur's marraige was =
never a marriage in physical sense

          2) The author of 'Autobiograp=
hy of a Yogi', Paramhamsa Yogananda has 
          mentioned in the same bo=
ok that his parents lived like a Husband & 
          wife only once a year=
 to biget child.

          3) I've read some where that our ancient Rishis=
 though married, 
          lived extremely restarined married life and tha=
t too only to beget 
          children.

          4) Adi Shankaracharya, =
Swami Vivekananda and all monastic disciples 
          of Thakur, Swami Si=
vanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri 
          Ravishankar and=
 countless known realised souls never married (We 
          assume that th=
ey maintained perfect brahmacharya) .

          5) Many saints such as Tuk=
aaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Jalaaram, 
          Rishis of yore, Ekanaat=
h, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other saints 
          were married. but i =
am confident that at some stage in their life 
          they would have en=
ded, forever, the physical relationship with their 
          spouses.

   =
       6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical & Mental. physical 
       =
   brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not just the 
  =
        procreative organs.

          There are many things looks contradi=
ctory in above but if one see 
          deeper then there is a wonderful s=
ynergy. there is a common truth. 
          what i've started believing fro=
m the above written thoughts as well 
          as many unwritten thoughts =
is that Brahmachrya is one of the most 
          important vertue for real=
isation. but it seems that even married 
          people will also start m=
aintaining that, knowingly or unknowingly 
          before final realisati=
on. actually, it seems that Like realisation, 
          Brahmachrya aslo D=
AWNS !!!

          Warm Regards,

          Utpal
