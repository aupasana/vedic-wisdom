Dear Anna,
 
I am glad you asked this.
 
I was not being politically correc=
t in saying that a total ban makes no sense. On the contrary, I almost deci=
ded to unequivocally assert that everybody interested in spiritual progress=
 can do homam. Period. But I wanted to be cautious and not take on traditio=
nal orthodoxy head-on. Instead of dismissing fully, I was trying to put the=
 fundamental reasons in perspective and say that a total ban makes no sense=
 and push back the responsibility of decision to individuals. I am sure I w=
ill gain confidence with time and be more assertive. I just need to become =
ready to take on some karmas in corner cases. Then I can make that assertio=
n.
 
In the old days, men did so much spiritual sadhana, so many rituals an=
d so much tapascharya that women did not need to do anything. Just run the =
house, get groceries, cook, serve food and your husband builds enough spiri=
tual bank balance for both of you. But things are not the same anymore! Mos=
t men today are worldly people and don't do enough spiritual sadhana for th=
emselves, let alone for their wives!
 
Given this situation, women cannot r=
ely on husbands for spiritual progress. I believe that women should be allo=
wed to perform rituals like homam, tarpanam etc for their own spiritual evo=
lution. I know some ladies who are performing Mahaganapathi homam using the=
 manual on my website now and enjoying it.
 
The risks I mentioned are only=
 for rare cases and most people need not worry. The issue about Kundalini r=
ising, getting stuck in Swadhishthana and tough testing in that area applie=
s to both men and women. In any case, fire worship with complete surrender =
to a deity is quite likely to help one skip over this. The risk about pregn=
ancy also affects very rare cases. In general, one need not worry. To be ex=
tra-cautious, one can skip serious sadhanas like homam during pregnancy. Al=
so, women doing homam should stop during the monthly periods time.
 
After =
doing homam a few times, most people will only experience an indescribable =
calmness and pleasure coming from the cleansing of various nadis and chakra=
s and resultant extra flow of praana vaayu in the sookshma sareera. Things =
like Kundalini awakening and rise do not happen in most people. Actually, m=
ost people talking about Kundalini flow actually mistake smoother praana va=
ayu flow for Kundalini flow. Most yogis do not ever experience the latter. =
So most of what I wrote is inapplicable to most people anyway. Let me not t=
rivialize it though - little bit of praana flowing better itself is a great=
 experience and one should try for it.
 
When several women contacted me fo=
r further clarifications and asked whether they could do Mahaganapathi homa=
m, I always encouraged them. The feedback from all of them was very positiv=
e.
 
The assertion that men and women are different only at the sthoola sar=
eera level and the sooksha sareera and kaarana sareera have no sex is absol=
utely correct. By the way, men may be reborn as women and vice versa.
 
Tha=
nks for the kind words. The "resourcefulness" and time are not really mine.=
 When a king and his minister decide to distribute some of king's money to =
people, the minister will summon a servant to do the work and the servant w=
ill take the money to people and distribute it. But it does not makes him t=
he owner of anything. He is merely fortunate to be picked for that good kar=
ma. Of course, even the minister will actually say that he too is a servant=
 only and will say that king is responsible for this action and the money i=
s really king's.
 
That analogy is perfect here. Of course, if it is not cl=
ear, the Divine Mother is the king, my guru is the minister, I am the serva=
nt and the manuals, writings and private talks I share are the king's money=
 being distributed. I am not being humble or politically correct. This is a=
bsolutely the only truth. Anything else would merely be an ignorant fool's =
delusion.
 
Regarding the practical usefulness of homam, there is no doubt.=
 I have seen its transformational power with real people in front of my own=
 eyes.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
