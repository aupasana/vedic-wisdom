Namaste to all

i loved the article on Importance of brahamcharya
and simil=
arly i loved these topics in book AGHORA

but i have one serious question

=
there too much strenghth is given on Guru
but somebody please tell me what =
one should do 
if he doesn;t have a Guru

Ok i may not have done some good =
work in my past life
that i should a guru quickly
bcoz untill i don't becom=
e pure no Guru would accept me
and untill i get a guru, i ll never become p=
ure
so.its a vicious circle

and when i hear be patient you ll find your Gu=
ru when time will
come i wonder if chang dev maharaj had to wait for so man=
y 
years to get his guru and though he was a capable person 
who could live=
 for so many years evading death(i think 1400 years)
 what if i forget abou=
t spirituality in the next 
10-15 years(or something wierd happens to my th=
inking style),
 leave about forgetting it in next births

and i m not an ad=
vanced Jyotishi and 
i have no confidence on my calculations
and i cant fin=
d out my ishta devata 
 
so in the end its too confusing
(may be that MOTHE=
R wants me too struggle at present)

but yes i liked th line written by nar=
simha ji
""If there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual
progr=
ess is definitely *the* thing. One should push one's free will
to the extre=
me when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth it!""

So, bearing with=
 my confusions please ignore it
if you find it disturbing

regards
