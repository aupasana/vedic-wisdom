|| Om Sri Gurubhyo Namah ||

Namaskaar,

I believe that Arya Samaj provides=
 iron Homa Kunda. In fact, I got one
such Kunda from them, and performed my=
 very first Homa in this kunda. It
was an iron kunda with some paint job do=
ne on it. Later I received a
copper one, which I currently use. But I do no=
t think that iron havan
kunda should be a problem. so long as it is in the =
Havan pyramid shape.
However, I will let Narasimha Ji give the final word.
=

With the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
Reema.
