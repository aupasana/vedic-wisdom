Dear Narasimhaji:
Please accept my deep gratitude for the wonderful manuals=
 that you are
publishing on conducting Homams, we are all indeed blessed.

=
One of the points that you strongly emphasize or warn against in the
manual=
s is to avoid making offerings of spicy food, meat etc into the
fire; all o=
f which makes a lot of sense, at least to me. These
directions though remin=
d me of the strong discomfort I feel on
encountering the mention of certain=
 Homams/Yagnas in the classics that
involve animal sacrifice; e.g. the Ashw=
amedha Yagna conducted by
Yudhisthira where a horse was sacrificed. The log=
ic behind such acts
are definitely beyond my comprehension, so I was wonder=
ing whether you
could shed some light on it?

Many Thanks,
Best,
./Dinesh
