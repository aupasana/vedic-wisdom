Dear Narasimha, 
I don't know if you missed my earlier message regarding L=
ord Caitanya philosophy which inconceivably combines the dual and non-dual =
conceptions. 
 
"Historically, within Hinduism there are two conflicting ph=
ilosophies regarding the relationship between living beings (Jiva or Atma) =
and God (Ishvara, Brahman or Bhagavan). Advaita schools assert the monistic=
 view that the individual soul and God are one and the same[7], whereas Dva=
ita schools give the dualistic argument that the individual soul and God ar=
e eternally separate[8]. The philosophy of Achintya-bheda-abheda includes e=
lements of both viewpoints. The living soul is intrinsically linked with th=
e Supreme Lord, and yet at the same time is not the same as God - the exact=
 nature of this relationship being inconceivable to the human mind."
 
In y=
our spiritual studies have you ever come across this concept of Achintya Bh=
eda Abheda? Here are some quick links:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achintya=
_Bheda_Abheda http://www.harekrsna.com/philosophy/bmgs/caitanya/tattva.htm =
 For some years I have really wanted to ask your thoughts on this... Best w=
ishes Kasim

ty (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today)


Namaste Reema ji,
 
Dualit=
y refers to a state where there are polarities and opposites. Some objects =
appear "beautiful" and some "ugly". Some objects and experiences give "happ=
iness" and some "sadness". Some words are seen as "praise" and some as "cri=
ticism". Some experiences cause "pleasure" and some "pain". Some objects an=
d experiences are seen as "desirable" and some as "undesirable". And so on.=

 
Non-duality is a state where there are no such distinctions. There is ju=
st a Brahman in that state.
 
The state of non-duality is reached by people=
 who reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Most of the time, what most people experienc=
e is the state of duality. The field of duality is the play of Shakti.

<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Duality refers to a state where there are polar=

 some as "undesirable". And so on.</FONT></DIV>
