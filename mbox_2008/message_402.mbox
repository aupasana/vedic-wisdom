Namaste friends,
 
I recently saw the chart of a person who is in some trou=
bles. He is troubled by some professional rivals. A priest recommended Prat=
yangira homam and performed it for him. Some people mistakenly believe that=
 Pratyangira homam gives relief from this kind of petty troubles.
 
Inspite=
 of the risk of offending some elders, I want to put my foot down and asser=
t one thing strongly and bluntly, for whatever it is worth. More learned on=
es who disagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
Pratyangira is a very very powerful deity and very very few peopl=
e know today how to worship her properly. I am talking about all kinds of w=
orship here - worshipping Her in an external fire and worshipping Her in on=
e's own internal fire and Kundalini shakti.
 
I do not want to emphasize th=
e necessity to learn to worship Her properly, because very very few people =
are actually *ready* for worshipping this form today. Many other forms are =
far more suitable for most people.
 
*        *        *
 
Pratyangira is a=
n astra devata (astra=3Dweapon). A powerful automatic gun may be used to sh=
oot a specific object at a large distance when an expert uses it. If one is=
 not an expert, the gun may not fire at all or may hit some other object. O=
ne is better off staying away from the gun in that case.
 
I can give an al=
legory for today's situation w.r.t. Pratyangira.
 
One's Mother had a very =
powerful automatic gun. She was a high official in military and used the gu=
n in some important wars she participated in. Once upon a time, one of her =
sons learnt how to use the gun and knew how to knock down powerful enemies =
in a combat using that gun.
 
Many years later, a small young boy of the la=
dy was being troubled by a bully at school. He wanted to solve the problem.=
 A friend at school, who was known in his circle as a smart person, suggest=
ed using his mother's gun. They messed around with mother's gun, but nothin=
g happened because they did not know how to use it. But that was good, beca=
use there could have been an accident and one of them could have been hurt =
in the exercise! Luckily, his mother put a locking mechanism on the gun bec=
ause she had young children at home. Another time, a smart frind who knew h=
ow to unlock it but not knowing fully how to use the gun, unlocked it and s=
hot it. He ended up unintentionally hurting the young boy.
 
In today's dee=
pening age of Kali, "locking mechanism" is put on astra vidyas such as Prat=
yangira, Bala, Atibala, Mahabala, Paashupata etc. Going back to my allegory=
, because the home (world of sadhana) now includes a lot of young boys (mos=
t of us with half-knowledge and incomplete spiritual maturity), mother has =
placed locking mechanism on dangerous weapons that are risky in the hands o=
f young children. She did not want automatic guns, assault rifles, missile =
launchers etc to be used for getting back at a school bully. When one is br=
ave enough, decides that one does not fear the possibility of death and wan=
ts to go and fight the enemies of the nation in a war, then those big weapo=
ns are useful. They are not meant for standing up to a school bully.
 
If s=
omeone helps us unlock the weapons, it is still a bad idea to try using the=
m. It is very risky. The best thing a child can do when a school bully is t=
roubling is to tell his mother about it and let her handle it. Taking mothe=
r's weapons and trying to handle it oneself is a very bad idea.
 
Simialrly=
, performing Pratyangira homam to overcome the obstacles caused by an enemy=
 or a rival or take care of some such material troubles is unwise and risky=
. When one is very pure and saattwik and battle with a tamasik force has ag=
itated a highly pure one, she is to be used as a weapon to bring down that =
agitation and restore sattwa. Her purpose is a really high one and inapplic=
able to most people.
 
*        *        *
 
Some temples perform Pratyangi=
ra homam regularly. I see it as an obedient son taking the automatic gun of=
 his mother, dusting it off, cleaning it, lubricating it and putting back w=
here it belongs. The son may do this service on a regular basis, without ex=
pecting any result and out of love for mother. That is fine.
 
The problem =
comes only when a son tries to use the weapon against his enemies or rivals=
.
 
*        *        *
 
If you look at Pratyangira's story, she came into=
 being to pacify Lord Narasimha, who drank the blood of the demon he killed=
. The guna caused in him by the demon's blood created big problems for the =
universe and Pratyangira pacified Lord Narasimha and filled him with pure s=
attwa again.
 
If a goddess could pacify a deeply agitated and angry incarn=
ation of Narayana himself and restore sattwa in him, you can imagine what t=
hat goddess must be like. She is the ultimate power to restore saattwa and =
remove all kind of disturbance from one's consciousness. Such a high deity =
of purity, equanimity and sattwa restoration has been converted to one who =
ruins one's enemies and rivals and gives material success and several peopl=
e perform Pratyangira homam with dried red chillies etc for petty purposes.=

 
Just as a young boy is better off approaching one's mother when harassed=
 by a school bully instead of trying to use his mother's machine gun, we ar=
e better off approaching the Mother and asking for help rather than trying =
to use Pratyangira shakti. Chandi homam, saptashati chanting, lalita sahasr=
a nama chanting etc can be used instead of Pratyangira vidya. Surrender to =
the Mother and chant her prayers, instead of trying to use her sophisticate=
d astra shakti directly.
 
Next time somebody suggests a Pratyangira homam =
for material problems, please think of what I wrote.
 
As I have already sa=
id, more learned ones who disagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore=
 me.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
