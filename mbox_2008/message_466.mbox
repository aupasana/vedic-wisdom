Namaskaar to All,

on this topic, i'll also add my conviction.

As i descri=
bed in earlier post, when i wanted to learn 'Kriya Yoga', 
The inspiration =
 came from ParamHansa Yoganands's book. I prayed to 
Babaji for that and I =
got it from Sri Sri Ravishankar.

First came Thakur in my life thro' Gospel=
, then came Autobiography of 
a Yogi, Babaji, SJC and Art of Living and Fin=
ally came my Spiritual 
Guru, Shri Narasimha.

What i need to convey is tha=
t I didn't join Ramakrishna Mission after 
Thakur took my hold as Black Cob=
ra grasps an ignorant frog.
Babaji didn't take me to 'Self Realisation Soci=
ety of Yoagananda for 
parting the knowledge of Kriya yoga to me instead he=
 made 
arrangements with Sri Sri Ravishankar of Art of Living. Now this 
am=
ply clears that Kriya Yoga taught by Babaji and Sudarshan Kriya 
Yoga by AO=
L is no different though apprently taught by two different 
spiritually ori=
ented organisation. Thakur introduced me to SJC   
and i met very worthy an=
d very knowledgeable scholars like Shri 
Sanjay Rath, Narasimha, Ramanaraya=
n, Visti and so many others. but i 
couldn't join formally the Organisation=
 as it seemed to me that 
Jyotish shastra has done its job for me and there=
 was not much 
enthusiasm left for astrology (Very Surprising as i was hype=
r for 
astrology for last 12 years or so). I can not fool myself and others=
 
by joining and doing nothing worthwile for it. I waited & waited and 
fin=
ally i was fortunate enough to get My Guru in Narasimha.

My above experien=
ces in the last 4 years tells me some real truths.

1) All the spiritual li=
ghts are connected to each other hence one 
must not feel that my lineage i=
s the best and criticise others.

2) i Developed respect for All Saints, Sa=
kshaatkaris and Mumukshus 
whatever lineage, religion or path they come fro=
m

3) One will finally reach to the Guru, to whom one is destined to go 
an=
d that doesn't always mean that Guru comes from a very highly 
celebrated o=
rganisation or is a ccelebrated persobnality. That also 
doesn't mean that =
a very famous person revered as Guru by Millions is 
a fake one. (Sri Sri R=
avishankar is criticised by many but i have no 
doubt that he is a spiritua=
l Giant) but one must be sincere in 
his/her aspiration and should take the=
 responsibility of doing 
Sadhanas.

4) Blind faith is not healthy unless a=
ll the doubts are dispelled and 
concrete revelation is experienced.

5) In=
fluence of Thakur expanded my horizon of Tolerance. from the 
childhood i b=
elieved that all the different religion are true. i was 
never a fanatic an=
d Thakur Reassured it. I can go to church, Mosque 
or any other religious T=
emple of different faith and always be a 
Hindu by heart. I can pray to All=
ah, Jesus. but if somebody points a 
AK47 at me and asks me to convert, i'l=
l die but never change. this is 
how i feel. i believe. NOW THE TIME has co=
me for everybody and i 
stress EVERYBODY that we must NOT ONLY RESPECT but =
truly belive that 
all the different paths and ideology are true as long as=
 Spiritual 
destination is the prime mover thought behind them. A truly spi=
ritual 
person will ask a Muslim to offer Namaz, remebmer Allah and lead a =

pious life but will NOT influence him to become Hindu and forget 
Islaam. =
Same way for Christens, Buddhist and vice versa.
 
Forgive me for writing l=
ot of personal incidents and also going off 
the track but i don't know how=
 to convey this without mentioning own 
life events.

thanks for baring me.=


Best Regards,

spiritually yours,

Utpal
