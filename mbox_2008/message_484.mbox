With all due respect (and emphasizing again that there is no
disrespect int=
ended), there are numerous claimants to the Babaji
title. Some folks have c=
oncluded that he was born as "Nagraj" in
Southern India around 200AD (to th=
e extent that the author of the book
that makes this claim goes so far as t=
o also claim to have uncovered
the temple where he was born 1800 years ago)=
, few others claim
Hariakhan Baba was actually the Babaji referred to in Pa=
ramahamsa
Yogananda's book etc; and plenty of others make similar claims ab=
out
who Babaji was/is that I will skip for the sake of brevity.

Paramahams=
a Yogananda unequivocally states in his "Autobiography of a
Yogi"; and I qu=
ote
"That there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise us.
=
The great guru has never openly appeared in any century; the
misinterpretin=
g glare of publicity has no place in his millennial plans"
<...><followed b=
y>
"No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the
anna=
list's heart, have ever been discovered. "

It would be rather surprising t=
o find out that the Divine Master chose
not to reveal his history for centu=
ries to anyone, including the
Spiritual Masters of his lineage; and later o=
n chose to "come out", so
to speak, in a public manner.

Another point to n=
ote is that there is no mention by anyone of such a
remarkable Divine perso=
n in any text *prior* to the revelation by
Paramahamsa Yogananda in his boo=
k, followed by numerous revelations by
a multitude of people till date, inc=
luding folks today who claim to be
"direct" disciples of the Master.

That =
said, it hardly matters who He was in regular life, instead lets
agree that=
 we are talking about a Divine Master indeed. Also, that a
lot of the highl=
y spiritually evolved souls since then have met or
received blessings/visio=
ns of the Deathless Guru is a given; after
all, there is some amount of Bab=
aji in them in the form of Divinity, no?


Best,
