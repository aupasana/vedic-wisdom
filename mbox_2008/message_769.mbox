Namaste,

Let me put some thoughts and i'll=
 continue writng as it keeps on 
occuring to me...

1) Thakur's marraige wa=
s never a marriage in physical sense

2) The author of 'Autobiography of a =
Yogi', Paramhamsa Yogananda has 
mentioned in the same book that his parent=
s lived like a Husband & 
wife only once a year to biget child.

3) I've re=
ad some where that our ancient Rishis though married, 
lived extremely rest=
arined married life and that too only to beget 
children.

4) Adi Shankarac=
harya, Swami Vivekananda and all monastic disciples 
of Thakur, Swami Sivan=
ada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri 
Ravishankar and countless kn=
own realised souls never married (We 
assume that they maintained perfect b=
rahmacharya) .

5) Many saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Ja=
laaram, 
Rishis of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other saints=
 
were married. but i am confident that at some stage in their life 
they w=
ould have ended, forever, the physical relationship with their 
spouses.

6=
)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical & Mental. physical 
brahmacharya in=
cludes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not just the 
procreative organs.
=

There are many things looks contradictory in above but if one see 
deeper =
then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a common truth. 
what i've star=
ted believing from the above written thoughts as well 
as many unwritten th=
oughts is that Brahmachrya is one of the most 
important vertue for realisa=
tion. but it seems that even married 
people will also start maintaining th=
at, knowingly or unknowingly 
before final realisation. actually, it seems =
that Like realisation, 
Brahmachrya aslo DAWNS !!!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
