Namaste

Dear all

I would like to create a list of highly realized saints =
in India and 
other parts of the world who are alive today and are guiding =

aspirants. This list should also include saints from sufism and
other reli=
gions
We have a good history and books to refer too but we donot have a 
li=
st of top 50 or so of living saints.

So I request you all to contribute if=
 you know and are impressed with 
them.

This would be a good thing to have=
 so that many of us can seek 
darshan and also seek guidance in future.

Th=
e idea here is about quality and not so much about quantity meaning
very re=
puted saints with thousands of disciple are already wellknown,
I would not =
mind having them in the list but more important is
realized saints who have=
 chosen to remain hidden or have shun
publicity.


To Start of I shall star=
t with a very realized saint shri Ganapathy
Sacchianand Swamiji of Mysore, =
a living Datta Avatar. He is the 
miracle man. I have had his darshan in US=
 a few times.

Once while I was on a pilgrimage to Pushkar about 8 years ag=
o, I did 
visit a saint known as bengali baba, a very realzied saint in his=
 
90s. He is still alive and has built a very unique hanuman temple in 
Pus=
hkar Rajasthan.

It was a very interesting meeting. He spoke bengali only a=
nd I
spoke hindi. He spoke for an hour. he understood all of what I said 
a=
nd asked and answered very sincerely in bengali in a very passionate 
way, =
however I could only understand 10% when the translator was able 
to keep u=
p with him.
My idea  here is to find great saints in India who are also not=
 
wellknown as they may have chosen not to publize themselves too.

I thoug=
ht about this because while growing up, I missed a lot of 
oppurtunities to=
 meet and seek darshan of many well known saints that 
I am finding out now=
 about their greatness. I feel like I missed many 
boats and still remain o=
n the same shore and waiting to cross the 
ocean.

Hope to get this list go=
ing

Best Regards
Mitesh
