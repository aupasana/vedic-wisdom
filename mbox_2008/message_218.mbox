Dear Ajit,

Thank you for your responses. That certainly does clarify things for me (at least some of them). I will celebrate Shivratri on March 5. You mention,
 "Generally, the tithi at sunrise is followed when one does not know the rule.." Is there any book/books that mention that or is it just tradition that may have been started at a time when using watches were not the norm and it may simply have been more convenient to follow the tithi prevailing at sunrise...

regards,
Chandraprakash

Generally, the tithi at sunrise is followed when one does not know the
rule. In the
case of shivaratri, the rule I specified earlier is agreed upon by the
following texts.
The only difference is when the rule is satisfied two days in a row. I
have not come
across a text that gives sUryodaya as a criteria.

The texts that agree on the rule are:

vaidyanAtha- diikShitiiyam
parva-nirNayaH
vrata-rAjaH
kalpa-chintAmaNIH

bhavadIyaH,

ajit
