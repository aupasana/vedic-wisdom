Dear Jyotishas & Spiritualists,
   
  One intresting thing i came to know about 'Mahatma Gandhi'. I was reading the autobiography of a Yogi whose name is 'Yogeshwar'. he has witten his biography in Gujarati language. name of the book is "Prakash na panthe"
   
  He has mentioned in the book that once he was meditating. his consciousness left the body and travelled to a place where there was a small hut at the bank of a river. one person was singing, in a very beautiful voice. and suddenly Shri yogeshwar heard a loud voice which revealed that "Narsinha Mehta had taken rebirth as Mahatma Gandhi".
   
  to give a little background, Narsinha Mehta was a very revered Saint of Gujarat who had a great Bhakti for Lord Krishna. it is said that Krishna had taken complete responsibility of his Yogakshem and had came to his rescue for 52 times.
   
  Narsinh Mehta has composed many Bhakti Git which is called 'Prabhatiya' and his most famous one is "Vaishnav jan to tene re kahiye...." which, intrestingly became famous worldwide becuase of Mahatma Gandhi.
   
  thought of sharing this information with you all.
   
  Best Regards,
   
  Utpal
