Nalini Bahen, Rajarshi & other members,

I normally don't praise Narasimha =
much because esle i have to write 
words of praise always. Each & every mes=
sage of his is outstanding 
which clears one or other doubt of us.

I actua=
lly *love* him that is how i would summerise my feelings.

following are ve=
ry emotional words extracted from one of the recent 
messages of Shri Naray=
an, which aptly tells how i and am sure many 
others would be feeling for h=
im
  
"We should really thank
our stars that people like Manishji and Naras=
imhaji are here guiding
us ... what would be life without them!"

I am in L=
ove with this beloved bagger !!!

Emotional Regards,

Utpal
