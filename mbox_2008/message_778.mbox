Another classic mail from you! Yes I understand=
 what you are saying. Who can really know the mind of a Saint like Swami Br=
ahmananda. 
=C2=A0
Just to add one more fact to the incident I mentioned, l=
ater that individual to whom Rakhal Maharaj had made that statement, was gr=
anted the blessings of Brahamacharya along with Sanyas diksha. But it was m=
any years later.
=C2=A0
Infact there was one more interesting thing I read =
which I would love to share with all. Initially Swami Brahmananda was very =
resevred in blessing anyone with Brahmacharya or any spiritual blessing. He=
 used to observe the signs in the person, then use his own yogic powers to =
confirm whether the person was really fit and ONLY then grant a blessing.
=
=C2=A0
One day he went to see a play on the life of one of the famous Saint=
s. There was an incident which was portrayed which showed once the saint wa=
s given a mantra by his Guru which could lead to Moksha, but he was also in=
structed not to reveal the mantra to anyone, because that woyuld lead him (=
the saint) to hell. Upon hearing this, immediately the saint went off into =
the crowded marketplace and called out loud to everyone saying. "Here is a =
mantra for everyone which my guru has given me, anyone who chants this will=
 attain moksha"..
=C2=A0
See this, Rakhal Maharaj was overwhelmed with emot=
ions and love and he decided from then on to bless anyone who comes to him,=
 irrespective of any signs.
=C2=A0
What a great great Mahatma!

Namaste Rajarshi,

S=
wami Brahmananda was not a normal soul. Thakur said he was one of Lord 
Kri=
shna's eternal playmates.

Words and actions of great masters like Swami Br=
ahmananada are not always 
easy to understand. He may have had some subtle =
motivations when he said 
that.

There are many people who are prone to pri=
de and do not realize god despite 
abstinence and other wonderful ascetic p=
ractices. They let those ascetic 
practices fill them with pride and never =
reach the final goal. If he wanted 
to subtly remind such people the final =
goal and remove the mental focus on 
intermediate steps, he may say somethi=
ng like that.

If he wanted someone to ponder over whether someone else can=
 give one god or 
one has to do sadhana and individual effort, then also he=
 may something like 
that.

If he wanted to dismiss the notion that his ble=
ssings would remove lust from 
people, with hidden and subtle sircasm that =
he was quite capable of, then 
also he may have said that. It is subtler th=
an sircastically saying "while 
we are at it, why not ask for god? I may as=
 well grant you god". He may have 
wanted to make the person understand the=
 need of individual effort as 
opposed to getting something (say, brahmacha=
rya) with his blessings.

* * *

Brahmacharya and other practices give high=
er and higher control over self. 
When the control over self is *perfect*, =
one may find god.

Another person may find god due to the grace of a guru a=
nd brahmacharya and 
other practices may come to one in a perfect form *alo=
ng with* that. That is 
also possible. It is not necessary to engage in a c=
ertain practice for a 
long duration to realize god. If one is already very=
 pure from all previous 
life efforts and the impurities of this life exist=
 only on the surface, it 
may be possible for a sadguru to free such a pers=
on in a moment and make him 
realize god.

However, one should start climbi=
ng the mountain when there is no certainty 
that one will suddenly disappea=
r at the base and find oneself on the peak in 
a blessed moment, though tha=
t is possible!

* * *

When Swami Brahmananda was doing several penances in=
 Vrindavan, Vijaykrishna 
Goswami, who had know him for a long time in Calc=
utta, asked "The Master 
gave you all that is covetable in spiritual life: =
visions and samadhi. Why 
then do you still practise so much austerity?" Br=
ahmananda humbly answered: 
"The experiences and visions I got by his grace=
, I am now trying to attain 
as my permanent possession."

Despite visions =
of gods and samadhi, he know that his realization was not 
perfect and ther=
e was more to be perfected!

Observing his hardship, rigorous disciplines, =
and long meditation and 
prayer, Swami Subodhananda once told him "The Mast=
er looked upon you as his 
son. You are the veritable son of the Lord. It d=
oes not befit you to sit 
like a beggar seeking his grace." Brahmananda rep=
lied: "What you say, 
brother, is true. The Master loved us so dearly that =
he gave us everything 
he had to give. Still we have not attained peace. Th=
is shows that it now 
lies with us to do the rest for the fulfillment of li=
fe's objective. Uddhava 
was Krishna's dear friend, you Krishna said to him=
: 'If you want to properly 
realize any spiritual truth, you must go to som=
e solitary place and practise 
austerity. I can grant you some miraculous v=
isions, if you like. But that 
won't be enough. It is much greater to conce=
ntrate and meditate on Him.' 
Indeed, without meditation and contemplation =
none can know anything about 
God."

Some may climb a small hill, think it =
is Mt Everest and start calling 
themselves realized. But the disciples of =
Ramakrishna like Swami Brahmananda 
were different.

In order to understand=
 the motivation behind specific words, you have to 
understand him better.
=

* * *

Most sishyas of Ramakrishna did not marry. Some married, but never =
had 
sexual relations with wives (e.g. Swami Yogananda, who married forcefu=
lly, 
and Swami Shivananda). Swami Brahmananda was one who not only married=
 but 
had a child too! He was at one stage troubled by lust and found it ve=
ry 
difficult to conquer it. Thakur placed his hand on his heart and chante=
d a 
mantra. Swami Brahmananda revealed that he never felt lust after that.=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya<BR><BR>> Dear Members=
<BR>><BR>> I was re reading this thread on the light of something I h=
ad come<BR>> across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. =
I was<BR>> reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to=
 him as<BR>> observed by other saints and his brother disciples.<BR>>=
<BR>> Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of Thaku=
r.<BR>> And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say h=
e<BR>> was one of Sri Krishna's eternal playmates who had reincarnated o=
n<BR>> this plane.<BR>><BR>> During his stay in various monastarie=
s of the Ramakrishna Mission,<BR>> often other monks used to send new in=
itiates to Rakhal Maharaj for<BR>> hios blessings. It was a generally ac=
cepted idea among the disciples<BR>> of Thakur that any one who is
 bles=
sed by Rakhal Maharaj will never<BR>> again be troubled by problems of l=
ack of Brahmacharya.<BR>><BR>> One day an individual came to Rakhal M=
aharaj asking for his<BR>> blessings and said "Maharaj, please give me b=
rahmacharya as a<BR>> blessing". Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj sa=
id, "Why do you<BR>> people always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was doe=
s not any one<BR>> come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn't God t=
he final aim of<BR>> everything.. "<BR>><BR>> Is it possible for s=
omeone who cannot maintain brahmacharya to reach<BR>> God? I am puzzled.=
