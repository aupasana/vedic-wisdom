Dear Narsimhaji,

Certain Mantras are ending with Namah

Certain ending wi=
th Swaha

Certain with Vashat, some with Vaushat, some with Hum and some wi=
th
Fatt.

Sir, I would like to know in details as to what is the real meani=
ng of
each word.  What they indicate? When they should be uttered?

It is g=
eneral belief that Swaha is used only for Homam. But it is not so
as certai=
n Mantras are ending with Swaha.   e.g. --Aum Hram Hrim Hraum
Sah Suryaya S=
waha.-- Even in Tarpanam we are using Swaha. - Aum
Tarpayami Swaha, Gam Tar=
payami Swaha, Glaum Tarpayami Swaha and like.

Your valuable comments will =
enrich our knowledge.

Dr. Ashwin Rawal
