Eight Americans Welcomed into the Sanatana Dharma Tradition

June 1, 2008
O=
maha, NE, USA

In a historic religious event that occurred on Saturday, May=
 31, 2008,
eight Americans were formally welcomed into the ancient traditio=
n of
Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism) in a sacred initiation (diksha) ceremony at=

the Hindu Temple of Nebraska.  

The ceremony was overseen by Sri Dharma P=
ravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank
Morales, Ph.D.), the Resident Acharya (Spiritu=
al Preceptor) of the
temple, and Professor Alekha Dash, who conducted the t=
raditional fire
ceremony (yagya) central to any authentic Hindu initiation =
rite.  

Though Hinduism is not a religion that overtly seeks converts, man=
y
Americans and Europeans have nonetheless enthusiastically embraced the
tr=
adition in the past.  This represents the first time in history,
however, t=
hat such a large number of Americans have been welcomed into
the tradition =
at one time.  

In accepting Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya as their guru (s=
piritual
teacher), these newly committed American Hindus vowed to devote
th=
emselves to living a Dharma lifestyle, to meditate upon God each
day, and t=
o express compassion toward all they encounter.  

Included among the new i=
nitiates were: two professors, a practicing
psychiatrist, a retired lawyer,=
 and a nurse, among others.  


First Non-Indian Women Awarded with Brahman=
a Thread

In a related historical development, Ms. Heather "Tulasi" Mortens=
en
was awarded brahmana initiation during the same ceremony, and awarded
wi=
th a sacred thread.  Though traditionally Hindu women were known to
have be=
en given sacred threads during Vedic times, this practice came
to a stop at=
 some point in the history of Hinduism.  Thus, this
thread-giving ceremony =
(known as upavita-samskara in Sanskrit)
represents the very first time in w=
orld history that a non-Indian
woman has been awarded such a sacred thread.=
  Sri Acharyaji stated to
the large audience observing this event that "I k=
now that this
historic precedent is only the beginning of the reclamation o=
f an
ancient and important Vedic tradition.  My hope is that this
represent=
s only the first of many thousands of women who I will see
awarded the sacr=
ed thread in my lifetime."

The two hour event was followed by a celebratio=
n dinner in the
temple's auditorium.
