Namaste Rajarshiji,

The implications could be many. One of it could be ind=
icative of the
strength of the performers Bhuta Agni level. But, let's not =
read too
much between the lines. After all, practice makes/takes us closer =
to
perfection. As a child (which we all are) all these are OK and when
such=
 things happen, apologize mentally and carry on :)

Enjoy!
-Narayan-
