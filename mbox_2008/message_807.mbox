Namaste,
 
Please check "Ramakrishna as we saw him" by Swami Chetanananda. Several people who knew Ramakishna well reminisced about their encounters with him and Swami Chetanananda chronicled those in that book.
 
Read the chapter on Sarada Devi. In that chapter, Sarada Mata remembers Ramakrishna. One of the accounts mentions the rebirth prediction.
 
Ramakrishna told Sarada Mata pointing at the northwest that he would be back after 100 years. Sarada Mata told him she would not come back. His niece Lakshmi Devi also said she definitely did not want to come back. Ramakrishna then laughed and said "how can you people not come back? Our karmas are intertwined. Just as the whole kalmi plant on the water surface of a pond comes off when you pull ONE stem, all of you WILL have to come back when I come back."
 
Thus, not only did Ramakrishna pedict that he would come back after about 100 years, but he also predicted that key people around him would be back. It is possible that Sarada Mata, his sishyas, Mathur, Ramkumar, Rani Rasmani, Girish etc all will/have come back.

Utpal asked how to identify him. Well, you cannot. And you need not!
 
Take another example. Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are incarnations of the same being (Vishnu). But each is unique and not replacable by another. Similarly, Ramakrishna is unique. Those who like him will get knowledge and spiritual progress through him. The reborn version may again be unique and have a new lila - a new play. Those who like him may get knowledge and spiritual progress through him.
 
Bottomline is this Utpal: Those who find Ramakrishna useful need not find his reborn version useful. Also, to those who find his reborn version to be useful, it may not matter that he is the rebirth of Ramakrishna. Those who are attached to Lord Narasimha may not be attracted to Lord Rama. And, to those who worship Lord Rama, it may not matter that he is the rebirth of Lord Narasimha.

There are different classes of beings. While some beings merge in Brahman and do not come back, some beings are ever-free and yet engage in the game from time to time. Gods like Vishnu, Shiva etc and rishis are free and yet participate in the game of duality from time to time. Though they are free, they do not merge back in Brahman for a long time. Such beings keep taking birth on earth from time to time. I believe that Ramakrishna, Sarada Mata, Vivekananda, Brahmananda etc are such beings.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
