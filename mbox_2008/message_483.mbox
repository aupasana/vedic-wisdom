Namaste

Recently I saw some postings and thought I would share some 
infor=
mation about Paramhans Yogananda's lineage.

Many already know that Swamiji=
's ( Paramahans Yogaanda) was a direct 
disciple of Shri Yukteshwar Maharaj=
 a disciple of Shri Lahiri 
Mahashaya.

As per his book Lahiri Mahashaya wa=
s a disciple of Babaji.
Babaji lived in India in physical body till 1973. H=
e took
Maha samadhi in Bombay and his Samadhi is located in Phuskar 
Rajast=
han.

Babaji is also know as Ranchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of Chirtakut =

and some more names too. He was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin by 
birth a=
nd was born in Gwailor district in MP.

Ranchod Dasji Maharaj name was give=
n to him by his disciples in 
Gujarat.

He may have lived for 700 plus year=
s.

He ran away from home at a very tender age and was taken up a 
disciple=
 by Bala Krishna Dasji also known as Paihari Baba.
Paihari baba was also ve=
ry releaized, he only drank milk and so the 
name. Paihari Baba was Gujarat=
i by birth but spoke in Hindi.

Paihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time,=
 than in Pushkar, he was 
in Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved=
 from Mathura to 
Rajasthan. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Kris=
hna in 
Pushkar. 
After that he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. =

Babaji also lived in Galtaji for about 12 years and he had the vision 
of =
Lord Rama in the same cave, that exists today too.

It is located a few mil=
es from Jaipur, there are a few temples there 
near the cave. I have visite=
d this cave too.

>From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than to Kas=
hmir where 
he lived in a place called "Rasayani Gufa".

Paihari Baba also =
may have lived for 500 plus years too.

While at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsid=
as maharaj had visited Paihari 
Baba and give a hand written manuscipt of R=
amayana.

They belong to the Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and Godd=
ess 
Sita devi as ishta devata. Ramanandi Sampardaya came as an offshot of =

Ramanuja Sampradaya.

Babaji or Ranchod Dasji Maharaj lived for many years=
 in Bengal, 
Chitrakot and Also visited Gujarat. He also stayed in Kashmir.=

One of the kings of Kashmir was a devout disciple of Paihari Baba.

Both B=
abaji and Paihari Baba were adept in "kaya kalpa" and they also 
had strong=
 connection with saints located in Tibet.

Paihari Baba used to remain in s=
amadhi at a stretch for 2 to 3 years.
Paihari Baba as a young brahamchari s=
erved also Swami Ramananda in 
Kashi.

Ranchoddasji Maharaj has samadhi in =
Pushkar, A trust in Rajkot, 
Gujarat and also in Chitakut too. At these pla=
ces they do charitable 
activities.

Ranchoddasji Maharaj had many disciple=
s but he never made anybody his 
sucessor.

A lot of books have been writte=
n by one or two lady disciples of 
Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this inform=
ation written here is coming 
from those books. these books are avialable i=
n his ashrams. They are 
written in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.

These book=
s describe Ranchoddasji Maharaj's teachings, his view on 
many things, his =
short speeches and kind of like biography.

These are very good books, they=
 describe many aspects of spirtuality 
in simple laymans language.

Babaji =
indicated that Lahiri Mahashaya was his disciple for 5 births
and in this b=
irth with kriya yoga he cleared all his impressions and 
was given authorit=
y to guide people and initiate in kriya yoga after 
relalizing his true nat=
ure. Like him he had another disciple in 
Bengal too known as "Din bandhu" =
but I do not have any information on 
him.

Babaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar =
Maharaj a few times.

He also indicated that many advanced saints from the =
Nath Sampradaya 
also took birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to e=
xperiance 
more bliss.

My intent here is to share information and not star=
t any 
controversies.

If anyone needs the names of these books and also th=
e address of 
ashrams, I am very happy to provide that too.

If there is in=
terest in more information than I shall try to write 
more about the lineag=
e and the prominent saints of the lineage too.

I also have many pictures o=
f Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not sure 
how to load them up for you all to=
 see.

Happy Navratri

Best Regards
Mitesh
