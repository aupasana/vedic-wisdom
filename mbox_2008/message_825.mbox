Namaste Ashwin Bhai,

Though you question was to Narasimha, I would give my=
 2 cent here as 
similar thinking has crossed my mind many times in the pas=
t.


- I have observed that Reciting in Sanskrit is what really gives 
one =
'rhythm'. Each Shloka gives you great feeling because it 
generates a kind =
of rhythm combined with devotion. it generates 
energy.

- It is very true =
that most people immediately will not know the 
meaning of the verses. Take=
 for instance my case. I can claim that i 
am considerably fluent in reciti=
ng Sanskrit Shlokas (Devanagari 
Script) but i hardly know grammar and many=
 other things in the 
language. During my initial recitation, the whole rec=
itation was 
just like reading with little or no understanding of the Story=
. Then 
i got a book in which, on every page, Verses were given in the top =

and at the bottom there was the Translation for the same verses. 
What i d=
id was that i started reciting one or two verses above and 
then used to se=
e the meaning given below in the same page. Thus over 
a period of time, it=
 became ease to understand the meaning of the 
verses *immediately* while r=
eciting because the meaning was already 
registered in the back of the mind=
. i am continuing the same process.
Sanskrit is supposed to be the basis of=
 all our Indian Languages. My 
knowledge of Gujarati, Marathi & Hindi was h=
andy to understand many 
of the words of Sanskrit immediately and didn't ne=
ed to struggle 
much. Same way, for the people of India, there are many com=
mon 
words, i suppose, between Sanskrit and any regional language.

The poi=
nt i wish to make here is that it is best to recite in 
Sanskrit verses, ev=
en if one doesn't understand the meaning. To 
solve the issue of devotion a=
nd understanding of the story, one can 
take a book which gives verses as w=
ell as translation. By practicing 
to read verses as well as the translatio=
n of the same, over a period 
of time, one will reach the point where the *=
literal* meaning of the 
verses will be *instantly* known without need to f=
all back on 
translation. Our memory and brain has such great faculties. On=
e can 
also go though the whole translation part in free time. The 
repetit=
ion of which, will create understanding of literal meaning of 
the verses.
=

but final aim should be recitation in Sanskrit and off-course 
Devotion wh=
ich should be the prime mover.

Hope i could really explain it effectively.=


Spiritually yours,

Utpal
