For what it is worth, you can rea=
d more about Paramahamsa Yogananda in
his free+online autobiography,
here h=
ttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi

There were interestin=
g links between Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and
Paramahamsa Yogananda:-
For exa=
mple, one of the top disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was
Mahendranath =
Gupta (not sure if he was one of the 16 monastic
disciples that Narasimhaji=
 refers to) aka Master Mahasaya, who wrote
"The Gospel of Ramakrishna"
(htt=
p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendranath_Gupta), and was the
sanskrit tutor t=
o Paramahamsa Yogananda as well; the latter devoted an
entire chapter to hi=
m in his 
book : http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chap=
ter_9

Elsewhere in his autobiography Paramhamsa Yogananda also mentions an=

anecdote of a disciple to whom he gifted a silver cup, who as a young
man =
was told by Swami Vivekandana that the Guru in his life would
present him w=
ith a silver cup in the future.
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography=
_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_47

Makes you wonder about the Divine connection between=
 all these
supremely elevated souls!

Best.
