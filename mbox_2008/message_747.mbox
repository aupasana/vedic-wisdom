Dear Utpal Bhai,
Namaskar.

Very wisely said indeed!!! The Mother would lov=
e Her children to call=C2=A0Her with as many names, as many times and would=
 never take offence. At most we would not get the phala siddhi as you right=
ly said. But what does ot matter, it is ultimately Her Grace that is utmost=
 important,

regards
Nalini
=C2=A0

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ma=
ha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam


Namaste Ashwin Bhai,

The head priest of K=
ali Temple in Chennai, when met me, asked about 
how i am reciting chandi P=
aath (Durga Saptashati). I told him that i 
try to follow conventional inst=
ructions given in the book i.e 13 
chapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi =
& Ratri Sukta, Nyas, 3 
rasyas and Kshma Prarthana at the end.

He told me =
that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa etc... at the begining 
and then continues=
 reciting 13 chapters every day. THE IMPORTANT 
thing here is that He only =
indicated me his way of recitation, he 
NEVER asked me to do the same way o=
r change the conventional way.

I need to give one background. for many yea=
rs i wonder about 
*Mahatmya* in many fo our spiriual books. take for insta=
nce Gita. it 
is indicated that Gita Mahatmya must be recited whenever Gita=
 is 
recited and without that it'll not be complete. Ganapati 
Atharvashirs=
h also has added protion of the same. Durga Saptashati 
also says that if y=
ou don't recite this, this & this then the whole 
chandi paath is like frui=
tless.

i am not able to reconcile with all these. IT gives a impression of=
 
injecting Fear. It is simply Dogmatic. If you don't do this then 
your ef=
forts are wasted but if you do this along with the main thing 
then it'll b=
ring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoyment of Swarga and even 
liberation.

I am=
 at loss to understand these extra things. it seems to me that 
it is a Anc=
ient days Marketing gimmick added NOT by the original 
author but some othe=
rs at later stages. it is quite possible that it 
was introduced everywhere=
 out of good intentions to make people 
recite it and get benefited. BUT th=
ese things have a danger of 
creating religious Fanatics.

Due to the above=
 written feelings, i welcomed the way of the head 
priest and now i too rec=
ite the 13 chapters of Chandi Paath since 
last few recitation. my intentio=
ns are to avoid all the added things 
which glorifies the Fruits (Tempts us=
 with Great Fruits or 
Intimadate with bad results)

i think it was off the=
 track.

before i finish, must say that the sounds with which i do are Aim,=
 
Hreem, Kleem 

Yours,

utpal

with him=

at the correct balance and also wrote it down without many

>=
 
> One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole 
day=
 meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The 
inspiration=
 came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. 
When I told Manis=
h, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I 
started before sunrise and w=
ent on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 
breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noo=

and another 10 min break for another bath at =
dusk, I was basically 
sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatr=
i mantra. It was 
a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=
 end of the 
day.
> 
> I noticed on the next day that the previous day was =
Akshaya 
Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very 
auspi=
cious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day 
is 1000 ti=
mes more powerful than on other days. Though I had not 
noticed it before, =
I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was 
excited. When I mentioned th=
is to Manish with excitement a few days 
later, he said calmly "I knew it e=
arlier itself. But I did not tell 
you because knowing it would've distract=
ed you. You would have been 
excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Tritee=
ya and that excitement 
would've changed the mental focus and brought more =
rajas into the 
sadhana."
> 
> He was absolutely right. As such, I was "pro=
ud" of doing such a 
sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited t=
he mental 
focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhan=
a on 
a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and excitement, 
brou=
ght in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. 
Ego is a ve=
ry dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent 
progress, it can sudde=
nly return and pull one down! After hearing 
Manish's words, I introspected=
 and found that my ego was still alive 
and kicking and that he was wise no=
t to feed it with more delicious 
food!

 Lucky are those who have a 
guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart=
 of their problem and 
point it out, so that they can weed it out through f=
urther 
introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.

homam in =
early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha 
(a perfected/adv=

name of one of the sap=
tarshis and said that I very close to him and 
that I would do some importa=

of 'Nara=
simha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the 
astrologer', 'Narasimha, the=
 engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual 
seeker' etc. It will take great effo=
rt to overcome those identities 
and find True Self. As if that challenge i=
s not sufficient, do you 
really need yet another new identity to feed your=
 ego further? See, 
what he said may very well be correct. But it is not us=
eful for your 
progress. You have to rise above all identities."

<P>Namaste Ashwin Bhai,<BR><BR>The head priest of Kali Temple in Chenn=
ai, when met me, asked about <BR>how i am reciting chandi Paath (Durga Sapt=
ashati). I told him that i <BR>try to follow conventional instructions give=
n in the book i.e 13 <BR>chapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi & Ratr=
i Sukta, Nyas, 3 <BR>rasyas and Kshma Prarthana at the end.<BR><BR>He told =
me that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa etc... at the begining <BR>and then con=
tinues reciting 13 chapters every day. THE IMPORTANT <BR>thing here is that=
 He only indicated me his way of recitation, he <BR>NEVER asked me to do th=
e same way or change the conventional way.<BR><BR>I need to give one backgr=
ound. for many years i wonder about <BR>*Mahatmya* in many fo our spiriual =
books. take for instance Gita. it <BR>is indicated that Gita Mahatmya must =
be recited whenever Gita is <BR>recited and without that it'll not be compl=
ete. Ganapati <BR>Atharvashirsh also has added protion of the same. Durga
 =
Saptashati <BR>also says that if you don't recite this, this & this the=
n the whole <BR>chandi paath is like fruitless.<BR><BR>i am not able to rec=
oncile with all these. IT gives a impression of <BR>injecting Fear. It is s=
imply Dogmatic. If you don't do this then <BR>your efforts are wasted but i=
f you do this along with the main thing <BR>then it'll bring Laddu, Peda, L=
uxuries, enjoyment of Swarga and even <BR>liberation.<BR><BR>I am at loss t=
o understand these extra things. it seems to me that <BR>it is a Ancient da=
ys Marketing gimmick added NOT by the original <BR>author but some others a=
t later stages. it is quite possible that it <BR>was introduced everywhere =
out of good intentions to make people <BR>recite it and get benefited. BUT =
these things have a danger of <BR>creating religious Fanatics.<BR><BR>Due t=
o the above written feelings, i welcomed the way of the head <BR>priest and=
 now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Paath since <BR>last
 few recit=
ation. my intentions are to avoid all the added things <BR>which glorifies =
the Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or <BR>Intimadate with bad results)=
<BR><BR>i think it was off the track.<BR><BR>before i finish, must say that=

eup Narayan!<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Earlier, I mentioned t=
he Mother's instruction to Manish when She <BR>appeared in front of him at =
the temple in Chennai during Shata <BR>Chandi homam, to spread the practice=
 of regular homam around the <BR>world. However, Manish did not reveal that=
 incident to me until much <BR>later. All he told me at that time was that =
Narayan really needed to <BR>do homam everyday and that I should teach a si=
mple procedure to him.<BR>> <BR>> I experimented with homam, started =
doing occasionally and liked <BR>it. I started doing a quick procedure ever=
yday. After doing it daily <BR>for a few months, I finally got down to the =
original task - teaching <BR>Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual fo=
r that purpose. In <BR>hindsight, I made the correct choice, as
 many peopl=
e in addition to <BR>Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I a=
nd many other <BR>people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far=
 as my mind <BR>concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time f=
or <BR>Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started <=
BR>with him. What a fortunate soul..<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>>=
; It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the <BR>onset=
 itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental <BR>state w=
ould've been different while working on the manual. I <BR>would've been mor=
e egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only <BR>thing I was told was=
 to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived <BR>at the correct balance=
 and also wrote it down without many <BR>pretensions. The whole effort ende=
d up being more saattwik and I <BR>really benefited from the exercise. If I=
 had known the full story, <BR>it would have had more
 rajas given my menta=
l state then and I would <BR>not have had made the same progress I made, wh=
ile preparing myself <BR>to teach homam to Narayan.<BR>> <BR>> Manish=
 told me the full story only when I was better prepared to <BR>handle the i=
nformation and, of course, I added it to the preface of <BR>the manual as a=
sked by him then.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> A good guru prote=
cts a sishya from unnecessary information that <BR>can wreak havoc with the=
 ego. I remember another incident.<BR>> <BR>> One day in the spring o=
f the same year, I decided to spend a whole <BR>day meditating with Gayatri=
 mantra during the coming weekend. The <BR>inspiration came out of nowhere =
and I immediately latched on to it. <BR>When I told Manish, he only said "g=
ood, go ahead and do it". I <BR>started before sunrise and went on till 9:3=
0 pm. Except for 3-4 <BR>breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath a=
nd a small lunch <BR>and another 10 min break
 for another bath at dusk, I =
was basically <BR>sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri man=
tra. It was <BR>a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the e=
nd of the <BR>day.<BR>> <BR>> I noticed on the next day that the prev=
ious day was Akshaya <BR>Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is consider=
ed a very <BR>auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on t=
hat day <BR>is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had no=
t <BR>noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was <BR>=
excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days <BR>lat=
er, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell <BR>you be=
cause knowing it would've distracted you. You would have been <BR>excited a=
t doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement <BR>would've ch=
anged the mental focus and brought more rajas into the <BR>sadhana."<BR>>=
; <BR>> He was absolutely right. As
 such, I was "proud" of doing such a=
 <BR>sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental <BR>fo=
cus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on <BR>a po=
werful day, it would've increased the pride and excitement, <BR>brought in =
rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. <BR>Ego is a very d=
angerous entity. Even after one makes excellent <BR>progress, it can sudden=
ly return and pull one down! After hearing <BR>Manish's words, I introspect=
ed and found that my ego was still alive <BR>and kicking and that he was wi=
se not to feed it with more delicious <BR>food!<BR>> <BR>> Lucky are =
those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what <BR>is useful rather=
 than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a <BR>guru (or someone els=
e) who can go to the heart of their problem and <BR>point it out, so that t=
hey can weed it out through further <BR>introspection and weaken it through=
 conscious effort.<BR>>
 <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> I remember one =
more similar incident. Before the shata chandi <BR>homam in early 2006, a p=
riest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha <BR>(a perfected/advanced soul).=
 When he looked at me, he mentioned the <BR>name of one of the saptarshis a=
nd said that I very close to him and <BR>that I would do some important wor=
k in this birth.<BR>> <BR>> When I saw Manish later that day, I menti=
oned this to him. He <BR>immediately became serious and said "Narasimha, do=
 you need one more <BR>identity? Your ego is already strong with the identi=
ty <BR>of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the <BR>astrologer=
', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual <BR>seeker' etc. It=
 will take great effort to overcome those identities <BR>and find True Self=
. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you <BR>really need yet anothe=
r new identity to feed your ego further? See, <BR>what he said may very wel=
l be correct. But it
 is not useful for your <BR>progress. You have to rise=
 above all identities."<BR>> <BR>> How true and wise!<BR>> <BR>>=
; * * *<BR>> <BR>> Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean a=
nd weak dog and <BR>get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or =
the sense <BR>of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets=
 all <BR>the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog a=
nd <BR>feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain=
 <BR>ego and increase detachment.<BR>> <BR>> Manish has a unique way =
of looking at things and some simple <BR>points he made brought so much cla=
rity to my thinking and sped up my <BR>spiritual evolution in this life. Ev=
en without giving any specific <BR>mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus =
do, he lit the lamp of <BR>knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and=
 light were already <BR>there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that=
 was blocking
 the <BR>light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes o=
ff the thick <BR>layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) t=
hat <BR>encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we ma=
y <BR>be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..<BR>> <BR>> * *=
 *<BR>> <BR>> Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpfu=
l. But one <BR>should also try to introspect and change one's thinking, on =
an <BR>ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does <B=
R>not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a <BR>=
long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the <BR>path a=
nd not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who <BR>keeps wa=
lking without distractions will reach the goal.<BR>> <BR>> The point =
I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like <BR>homam) and the i=
nternal introspection (to change attitude) should go <BR>hand in hand. Afte=
r a
 while, there will be synergy between them and <BR>they will start to w=
