Namaste,

Aluminum is a modern metal and my hunch is that it does not have the right 
gunas. I suggest sticking to gold, silver, copper, bronze, brass, clay etc. 
But if one has access only to an aluminum or iron havan kunda (or tray), one 
may do in it.

Wrapping the copper havan kund with aluminum foil so that the havan kund 
remains "clean" is also not a great idea. A bit of aluminum mixes with the 
fire slowly and that is not a great idea. Fire should come in contact with 
auspicious materials only.

Quick burning logs containing artificial materials are also not a good idea. 
Plain firewood is better. Many people are doing homam with mainly dry 
coconut.

Brahma is invoked in a small silver bowl with water with darbhas placed on 
it and a small pooja is done to him and the bowl is placed on the south. 
Varuna is also invoked in another bowl. The procedure I give in the manuals 
gets rid of some steps to simplify. Things like Brahma pooja, Varuna pooja, 
Aajya suddhi, punyaaha vaachana etc are all skipped. There are many steps 
given in tradition and different priests pick different sets of those steps. 
There are different procedures in vogue, having some common features and 
some differences. Doing all the steps makes it long. Not every step is 
equally important. If the main homam is 3 hours, having an overhead of 45 
min may be ok. But, if the main homam is 20 min, overhead has to be 5 min. 
And, a 20-30 min homam done everyday or every week is far more effective 
than a 3-4 hour homam done rarely.

Tarpana is not necessary for all deities. You can skip it for Mahaganapathi 
homam also. When you do tarpana, you can do it with milk or just water (in 
which a few akshatas were added).

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Aluminium trays and some need some clarifications 
for related stuff for homans


Namaste

In the US a lot of priest do use aluminium trays for conducting homams
In fact when I started doing homans I also used aluminium trays till
I got a copper kunda. We had in the past done a couple of homans in
the home and both times the priest(different) used aluminium trays
and inthat they poured first sand and then on top of sand they used
dry coconut and in the US we also get something called quick burning
fire logs I suppose they contain some wood and the same material they
use to make candles, Oops I forgot the name of this material and some
other things.

So I also when I started did use initially aluminium trays and also
quick burning log along with coconut.

Further more I have actually wrapped the copper kunda with aluminium
foil so that the kunda remains clean. May be I should remove the
aluminium foil.

Any conclusive guidance about wrapping haven kunda with aluminium foil
and usage of quick burning log in the homa is appreciated.

Further I think there are few other things that are also needed, I am
note sure or understand their usage

Suchi, srava, proksani and pranita and sphya. I have no understanding
of these items as to how to use them. again any more information very
much appreciated

Further I read somewhere that one needs to also invoke brahma for the
entire time from start till poornahuti is done and is to be seated on
the south side, I am not sure how to do it.

Tarpana in the Ganapati homan, there is tarpana details but others
like laxmi or krishna or saani homan manuals do not seem to have or I
missed it. Do we need to do tarpana always with milk for all homans.
I suppose so. Again some clarification would go long way

Best Regards
Mitesh
