Dear Mr Narasimha,

Was going through some older posts in this community wh=
en I came 
across this mail. This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar=
 
Giris calculations of the yugas.

Firstly let me clarify that I personall=
y am no vedic scholar, nor 
can I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea o=
f what or who is 
right. But I had the good fortune of reading the book "Th=
e Holy 
Science" where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must =

have read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had 
inst=
ructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he 
could meet th=
e Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri 
Maharaj had completed his=
 book, that very day he met the Mahamauni 
who was sitting under a tree wit=
h his disciples. Infact the incident 
goes this way that as the Mahamauni h=
ad promised Yukteshwar Giri 
that he would meet him once the book get writt=
en. So as Sri 
Yukteshwar Giri was passing by in the morning to take a bath=
 
suddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And 
the=
 first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to 
to bring p=
erfection in his vision by increasing his meditation 
because had he done s=
o he should have been able to see Him(the 
Mahamauni) and his disciple insi=
de the sunlight. Anyway that is 
beside the point.
What I was wondering is =
that, if the calculation of yugas as given 
by Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then=
 that means even the Mahamauni Babaji 
blessing the book and meeting him in=
 kumb and again later is also 
wrong. I mean all these people are way way w=
ay way ahead of me, but 
even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadh=
aka or a yogi. He 
is the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy."=
budhe babai 
kisun hai".. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe b=
aba. 
And Kisun was Krishna. To think that, THAT supersoul specifically 
bl=
essing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong 
calcuation b=
ecomes a little difficult to comprehend. 
I of my own have no knowledge or =
learning to be able to decide what 
is right and what is not. I just voiced=
 a concern of mine from the 
point of view of an ordinary individual who co=
nsiders the Mahamauni 
to be one with God himself. If He is can make such a=
 mistake, then 
God is not really that omnipotent I guess.

-Regards
 Rajar=
shi
