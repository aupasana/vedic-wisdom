Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great Devine experience about shr=
i Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have=
 not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my=
 life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when=
 you are in religious mood.
=C2=A0
I was working as telegraphist at Okha Po=
rt Post office near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting=
 late fee allowance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opp=
osite to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with s=
ome Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. =
Patel) was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking ab=
out shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at =
his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him an=
d was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to=
 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I wa=
s then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seasho=
re daily at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur.
One d=
ay when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some =
guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come =
in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with m=
y surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. 
At one another incident h=
e told me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened.=
 I was very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day =
I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire=
 will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwa=
rka as was punctured on the way. This was surprising.
This all incidents ma=
de me to believe that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrisha=
ndev worship only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I sho=
uld also be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7=
 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thak=
ur picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower =
and bestow his grace. 
Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at =
6.10 morning while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was =
waking up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have acc=
epted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued =
with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision?=
 Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a grea=
t Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra=
 etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are =
doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.
Her arguments were right at her place as p=
eople in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought--=
 yes I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --
B=
ut I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their disc=
iples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I im=
mediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come=
 to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am =
living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, w=
ould you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D--
She la=
ughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=
=E2=80=9D--
I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify m=
y decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence eve=
n today.=E2=80=99
To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 =
in the morning with angry mood. What he told?
=E2=80=98 How dare you test T=
hakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and =
I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1=
 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C G=
o to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test m=
e. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D
I immediately rushed to your home. Th=
akur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. What you want=
? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such a silly thin=
gs?=E2=80=99
We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words tha=
t Morning. 
I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. T=
here were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write i=
t sometime.
Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on th=
e earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=
=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us.
Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad
