Dear Prasad,
 
Suppose you are doing Mahaganapathi homam and viewing Mahaga=
napathi as the supreme cosmic being as described in Atharva Seersham. It sa=
ys "tvam brahmaa tvam vishnustvam rudrastvam" etc, which means that Brahma,=
 Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya, Chandra etc are all various forms=
/parts of Mahaganapathi. If you have called THAT Mahaganapathi in fire and =
made offerings to him, you can also make offerings to the other deities who=
 are his own forms/parts.
 
If you invoke Vishnu, Mahalakshmi, Krishna, Shi=
va, Chandi or Mahaganapathi in fire, you can view them as supreme cosmic be=
ing (or the energy of supreme cosmic being) and make offerings to all deiti=
es through them.
 
Regarding the second question, I am not really dogmatic =
about how people view the relationship between themselves and the supreme c=
osmic being. Irrespective of one's views in that matter, one can do sadhana=
 and make progress. Let me use a simple analogy to clarify my stand.
 
Whet=
her the final goal of one's travel is accepted as Haridwar or Amarnath or M=
ount Kailas, one living in Kanya Kumari has to start traveling north. I am =
showing them paths that go north and to Himalayas and creating manuals for =
those travels. They can decide for themselves whether they go to Haridwar o=
r Amarnath or Mount Kailas. I do not want to impose on them. My manual only=
 covers the initial travel in the northern direction.
 
However, when I put=
 together a travel manual for one attached to Haridwar, I do not want to ca=
use confusion by talking about Mount Kailas. So I talk about how traveling =
north to Himalayas can make one reach Haridwar and focus on Haridwar alone =
in that manual. 
 
Bottomlime is that I will be equally happy whether one r=
eaches Haridwar or Amarnath or Mount Kailas using the travel manual I made.=
 And all are great places and difficult to reach.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=

ond mantra offered in homam


  Namaste Narasimhaji,
  I am bit confused ab=
out 2nd mantra offered in homam. After offering the pradhan mantra in homam=
. If we offer mantra of some other deity, does the offering reach that deit=
y or the deity invoked in the fire?
  I have one more question after going =
through Sri-Krishna manual. In that you have mentioned that all offerring a=
re reaching via Lord Vishnu i.e. Vishnu actually runs the universe. I was t=
hinking Advait vedanta is most widely acceptable, but reading your guide, I=
 think dwiata vedanta is also worthwhile to study(which mentions Vishnu as =
the highest form of god and of course many other things). How would you com=
ment on this?

  Please answer my above 2 questions

  Thanks & Regards, 
 =
 Prasad A. Pole
