Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
I have a question about Homa. In the middle of the =
homa, during the homa if the fire goes out, like there is no body of the fi=
re in the kunda then but only the red embers, which sometimes inspite of dr=
opping ghee does not light up again but goes only creating heavy smoke. Wha=
t should one do in such a situation. Light the fire again from the lamp? Or=
 leave the homa incomplete.
Also is this some kind of an inauspicious sign?=
 
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,

(1) No. Any food offered as =
bali (as opposed to "naivedyam" to a deity) is 
usually not consumed. It is=
 thrown away. If you live in woods, throw it away 
in the open so animals c=
an eat it. Otheriwse, throw it in garbage.

On the other hand, "naivedyam" =
offered to god can be consumed by people as 
prasad.

(2) Either is fine. T=
hey symbolize the path of shakti moving from you to the 
fire and vice vers=
a.

(3) Either is fine.

(4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas u=
sed in a pooja, everything 
has a purpose and it has to go when its purpose=
 is served. That's the nature 
of life. While the flowers and akshatas are =
used in homam, they are 
sacrosanct and should be handled with care, love a=
nd respect. After they 
serve their purpose, they have to be disposed of ho=
wever one can. Throwing 
in garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way is t=
o collect them in a bag 
until you accumulate a good amount and burn them o=
neday. If you have a local 
temple, you can go and see if you can throw the=
m wherever they throw the 
flowers etc they use at the temple.

The ashes f=
rom the homam are considered sacred. They contain *some* of the 
energy gen=
erated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes is to 
throw them =
into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean). This 
ensures that th=
e energy is not localized to one place and is distributed 
back to the Natu=
re. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep pit in the 
yard and bury=
 the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and not a 
great idea. Ple=
ase remember that the energy in the ashes is only a *part* of 
the energy g=
enerated. Some energy is also within the person performing homam 
and helps=
 to purify the person. Giving some part back to the nature is a 
very good =
idea.

Best regards,
Narasimha
