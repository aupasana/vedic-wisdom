and forms a self-identity and entertains an illusion that there is 
an "I=

by various=
 names such as Sadashiva, Narayana, Krishna, 
Mahaganapathi, Savita etc).
>=

beings and other objects in this universe because of the =
spell of 
delusion that he/she is under. When one realizes the delusionary =

nature of this spell, one can break free from it.

 is not aware of all this. One's senses simply 
perceive so many different =
objects and one entertains various 
notions with respect to those objects. =
All these notions become very 
firmly established in one's consciousness af=
ter many births and it 
is difficult to overcome those notions. Some object=

repulsive, some are considered good and some bad. And so on. The 
field t=

happen. However, 
they are not real events. It is just fake and manipulated=
. The 
characters in the movie are not real. However, some people take the =

events on the screen seriously and react strongly. Good happenings 
on the=
 screen make them elated and scary moments on the screen shake 
them up. Th=
ere may be someone with an intellectual understanding 
that the movie is no=
t real and yet one specific scene that may get 
him/her. For example, one m=
ay shiver with shock in a scene despite 
the intellectual understanding tha=
t it is not real. Intellectual 
understanding does not give full control ov=

> Similarly, one with only an intellectual understanding t=
hat all is 
Brahman does not have full control over the mind. The instincts=

sense organs and various aspects of mind sometimes run like a mad 
monke=

feel happy a=

attracted to some thi=
ngs and become repelled by some things. A 
perfect, permanent and unshakabl=
e understanding that all is Brahman 
is much more difficult to obtain than =
a mere intellectual 
understanding.

analysis.

quite formidable.

> 
> All is Brahman and all the duality is ari=
sing from the Supreme 
Being. All of one's actions are actually occurring d=
ue to the will 
of Supreme Being only. The results/fruits (good or bad) of =
one's 
actions may be viewed as the reactions by Nature to one's actions 
a=
nd they too are due to the will of Supreme Being. Thus, everything 
that ha=
ppens is due to the will of Supreme Being. If one person 
remains in ignora=
nce, keeps on taking a rebirth and keeps going 
through good and terrible e=
xperiences, it is all the will of Supreme 
Being. If one says "it is all th=
e will of Supreme Being. I am doing 
nothing" just for the heck of it and y=
et continues to have an 
egotism (self-identication with a body or name or =
personality or 
some object), continues various actions through that ego an=
d 
continues to receive their fruits and becomes elated by some and 
depres=
sed by some, it is all through the will of Supreme Being. 
Though the perso=
n is saying "Supreme Being does all", he continues 
to think of an "I" and =
thinks deeply that "I am doing". That is why 
Supreme Being wills the perso=
ns to receive the appropriate fruits of 
that action. If another person tru=
ly understands that Supreme Being 
knows, wills and does all things, kills =
"I" completely at the mental 
level, then that person may seem to engage in=
 various actions, but 
he does not really perform any actions. When there i=
s no "I", there 
is action and no reaction. Despite moving in the material =
world and 
doing various actions, that person's mind is always established =
in 
bliss. Again, this person has no "I-ness" and hence Supreme Being 
will=
s the person to be in supreme bliss always.
> 
> The subtle lesson I am try=
ing to drive at is: As long as there is 
an "I-ness" to a person, actions t=
ake place and their reactions 
happen. "All is Brahman. I do not do anythin=
g" is for one who has 
killed "I-ness" completely. It is not an excuse to d=
o anything and 
get away. Until one completely kills "I-ness", one has to w=
atch 
one's actions to produce good reactions that are conducive to making =

more progress.

> T=
he teachings of maharshis in Veda and allied subjects like 
Vedangas and Ve=
danta cover essentially two types of knowledge:
> 
> (1) Understanding the =
rules of engagement of the field of duality 
(maayaa)
> (2) Understanding h=
ow the field of duality is delusionary and how 
all is Brahman only
> 
> Kn=
owledge of type (2) is essential because eventually the goal of 
each being=
 is to overcome the delusionary nature of the field of 
duality and see Bra=
hman in all. However, the problem with 2 is that 
this knowledge is only re=
alized and not imparted in a step-by-step 
process. One may read reams abou=
t how all is Brahman and seemingly 
different objects of this universe are =
a delusion and one may even 
understand and appreciate it to some extent in=
tellectually. But it 
is of not much use! Until the realization comes from =
within and 
experienced, one continues to be deluded by duality. One may kn=
ow 
all the theory, but the mind continues to be deluded and swayed by 
dua=
lity. When somebody praises one, one may feel elated. When 
somebody attack=
s one, one may feel unhappy. When one finds something 
nice, one may be att=
racted. When one finds something disgusting, one 
may be repelled. And so o=
n. Please see my previous analogy of a 
movie.
> 
> While knowledge of type=
 (2) elaborates why the above behavior is 
silly and describes the thinking=
 and approach of a liberated soul, 
it is very very difficult to imbibe suc=
h thinking and attitude and 
become liberated. Even reading works imparting=
 knowledge of type 2 
for a long time does not guarantee liberation.
> 
> V=
edangas such as Jyotisha belong to type (1). When one does not 
realize tha=
t the field of duality is a delusion and is swayed by the 
opposites, then =
one needs tools to navigate the ocean of opposites. 
Jyotish is one such to=
ol. When one's mind is deeply stuck in duality 
and has unsurmountable "I-n=
ess" and "other-ness" deeply imprinted on 
it, "all is Brahman. Parama Puru=
sha knows, wills and does all" is a 
useless concept. From the perspective =
of that person, one's "I-ness" 
does all actions and begets the fruits of t=
hose actions based on 
order set by Parama Purusha. This gives happiness an=
d sadness of 
great proportions. This cycle of actions and fruits may go on=
 
forever, until one's "I-ness" is killed completely.
> 
> Some spiritual s=
adhana is necessary to kill the "I-ness". This 
spiritual sadhana is happen=
ing within the field of duality where the 
mind has a clear "I-ness" and "o=
ther-ness". Thus, the rules of 
engagement in the field duality apply. Subj=
ects like Jyotisha throw 
light on these rules and they can be helpful. For=
 example, one may 
start sadhana at a particular time and make swift progre=
ss. One may 
start sadhana at a particular time and encounter many obstacle=
s and 
stop the sadhana without much progress. One may find the right 
sadh=
ana based on previous samskaras and vasanas from the horoscope. 
One may fi=
nd out that impending material problem (e.g. job loss or 
loss of a close r=
elative or a divorce etc) may derail one's sadhana 
and take some measures =
to stop it and reduce its magnitude. Thus, 
Jyotisha can be used to manipul=
ate the field of duality to one's 
advantage, as one wades it trying to kil=
l one's "I-ness" and 
individual will.
> 
> *        *         *
> 
> One's=
 Will vs Other's Will
> 
> When a scripture says that everything that happe=
ns is God's will, 
it is essentially referring to the supreme being (Parama=
 Purusha) 
mentioned earlier as the God. This Being is the first Being aris=
ing 
from non-dual Brahman and the one who conjures up the entire 
duality.=
 Thus, we are at the border of non-duality and duality.
> 
> Deities who op=
erate completely within duality have their own wills 
which may clash with =
each other and clash with our will. For 
example, the will of Yamadharmaraj=
a (yama=3Ddisplicine, dharma =3D 
righteousness, raja =3D ruler) compelled =
him to kill Markandeya and 
collided with the will of Markandeyaq who wante=
d to remain alive and 
the will of Lord Shiva who wanted to save Markendeya=
. There are many 
stories where the will of one deity/being clashed with an=
other's.
> 
> Of course, all these deities are different forms of the same =

Brahman (or, loosely speaking, of Parama purusha). The will of 
Parama Pur=
usha is that one deity's will should compel the deity to 
do X and another =
deity's will should compel that deity to do Y and 
something should happen =
as a result. Everything is indeed the leelaa 
(play) of the will of Parama =
Purusha. But we are not at the stage of 
fathoming the play of Parama Purus=
ha (and his Shakti). All we can 
say is that Parama Purusha's will is a com=
plex thing. It is in fact 
the sum total of the individual wills of all bei=
ngs of this universe!
> 
> As long as there is "I-ness" and individual self=
-identity left in 
the mind, there is an individual will. As long as that i=
s the case, 
one is not liberated. One's individual will facilitates variou=
s 
actions that clash with the wills of various other beings. It causes 
va=
rious probelms. Basically one acting based on "individual will" is 
in tune=
 with only a small subset of "God's will". That person is not 
in tune with=
 the *entire* God's will.
> 
> Thus saying "all is God's will. I need to do=
 nothing" is not 
conducive to liberation. It continues bondage. Directed e=
ffort to 
kill "I-ness" makes one truly understand that "all is God's will"=
 
and drop off one's individual will.
> 
> Only when "I-ness" is killed and=
 "individual will" is completely 
evaporated can one be in tune with the en=
tire "God's will" (as 
opposed to a small subset). Then alone can one remai=
n in constant 
bliss, as an unbound observer of the play of this universe w=
ithout 
any individual agenda or will. THAT is liberation. Such a liberated=
 
soul may seem to engage in various actions, but the mind is stable, 
has =
no "I-ness" or individual will and is established in constant 
bliss. Like =
a fan may continue to turn for a while after the

 previous flow, but without any 
egotism (supply of electricity in the anal=
