Namaste

Hi All

I am looking to find the correct form of Narashima mantra.=
 The two 
variations that I have run into are as follows:

1)

>From a web s=
ite http://www.salagram.net/narasimha-mantras2.html

"ugram viram maha visn=
um jvalantam sarvatomukham 
nrisimham bhisanam bhadram mrtyu mrtyum namamy =
aham" 

'May my head be protected by the mooncoloured one, who is the 
grea=
test among humans. 
My obeisances unto the ferocious and powerful, the grea=
t Visnu, the 
fiery one, who's faces 
are on all sides, the fearful one, Nr=
simha, who causes the death of 
even death 
personified, (or who can overco=
me death)'. 

2)
>From Sharada Tilakam book
ugram viram maha visnum jvalanta=
m sarvatomukham 
nrisimham bhisanam rudram mrtyu mrtyum namamy aham 


The =
difference is between word "Bhadram" and "Rudram"

Which one is appropriate=
?

Does anyone have other more reliable source, On a couple of web sites 
I=
 saw "Bhadram", these all seem to be vaishava web sites, However the 
Shard=
a Tilakam book mentions it as "Rudram"

By the way this is very powerful ma=
ntra, people inscribe this in an 
amulet and put it on in india.

A lot of =
lord krishna devotees first worship Lord Narashima so that 
he takes away a=
ll the negativity and after that only one get to reach 
lord krishna.

It i=
s also very interestig that most of the temples of various forms 
of lord n=
arashima are located in andra pradesh in India.
Can some learned soul shed =
light on this.

Best Regards
Mitesh
