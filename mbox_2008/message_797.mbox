Narasimha Garu & Members,

There is a long pending question with me and tha=
t is Historical 
reality or otherwise of our many revered personalities/eve=
nts.

Take for instance, 'Mahabhaarat' & 'Shri Krishna'.

I would try to gi=
ve some view points gathered from all these years 
from various sources and=
 my own thinking as well-

1) Mahatma Gandhi didn't belive that Mahabhaarat=
 was a reality.he 
thought that it was 'epic'-creation of a poet. he seems =
to be unable 
to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...

2) How c=
an parents name their children as 'DURYodhan', 'Du:Shasan' 
etc.. i am not =
sure about the meaning of the names but it implies 
something perverted. kn=
woledgable person in sanskrit can shed some 
light on this.

3) Mahabhaarat=
 was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent author, 
Maharshi Vyaas and =
hence Gita was also his own creation and krsihna 
was just a 'imaginary' ce=
ntral character of his grand work.

!.....!.....!

1) Dr. Raman, in Notable=
 Horoscopes has strongly written that Shri 
Krishna was a historically real=
ity. His reasoning was that an 
*Imaginery creation* of some poet can never=
 Inspire & attract 
millions of people for thousans of years.

2) If Mahars=
hi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to 
satisfy his poetic =
genious then how come he himself features in the 
story? if let's consider =
even that as a possibility but then WHY 
he'll write another book just on S=
hri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why 
he'll himself Worship his own 'Kaalpanik =
Paatra'.

3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many Saints o=
f 
yesteryears, saw his form.
One can argue that becuase of their intense w=
orship of that 
perticular Form, they could see the same form of the suprem=
e 
reality...the supreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.
The solid =
counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and 
Maharshi Aurobindo, it =
seems, never were a Devotee of that form of 
Shri Krishna, then how come in=
 their case, without devotion & desire 
they got to see the form of Shri Kr=
ushna?

!....!....!

Any thoughts about this? How to conclusively establish=
 the Truth in 
this case?


Warm Regards,

Utpal
