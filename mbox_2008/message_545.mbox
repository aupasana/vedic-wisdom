Dear Narasimhaji

When we offer services to the deity invoked in the fire, =
why is the 
order first prithivi tattwa then akash, then vayu, then agni an=
d then 
jal tattwa.

This may sound like a very silly question to ask, but =
it suddenly 
entered my mind and I could find no answer for this.

-Regards=

 Rajarshi
