Namaste friends,
 
Today is Akshaya Triteeya - the 3rd tithi (lunar day) in=
 the sukla paksha (waxing fortnight) of the lunar month of Vaisakha. This i=
s supposed to be the day when Ganga came to earth. This is the day when Par=
asurama was born. This is the day when Treta yuga started. Today is suppose=
d to be a very auspicious day.
 
Any prayer or meditation or homam or spiri=
tual practice performed today is supposed to be many times more powerful th=
an on any normal day. Akshaya literally means "imperishable", i.e. in large=
 supply. The fruits of spiritual karmas of today will be very large and tha=
t is why the name "akshaya".
 
In fact, the next 12 days are very auspiciou=
s for spiritual practices. It is believed that some divine energy hovers ab=
ove earth during this time and prayers can yield results faster. The 5th ti=
thi (panchami), which starts tomorrow afternoon and goes into Thursday, is =
known as Rishi Panchami and is a good day.
 
I am sharing the information s=
o anybody interested may take advantage of Akshaya Triteeya 
 
Best regards=
,
Narasimha
