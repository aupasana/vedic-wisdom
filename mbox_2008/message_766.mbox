Dear Members

I was re reading this thread on the light of something I had =
come 
across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was 
rea=
ding a book on his life and various incidents connected to him as 
observed=
 by other saints and his brother disciples.

Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Ma=
haraj was the spiritual son of Thakur. 
And no doubt a great spiritual supe=
r giant. Thakur used to say he 
was one of Sri Krishna's eternal playmates =
who had reincarnated on 
this plane.

During his stay in various monastarie=
s of the Ramakrishna Mission, 
often other monks used to send new initiates=
 to Rakhal Maharaj for 
hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea am=
ong the disciples 
of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj =
will never 
again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. 

One da=
y an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his 
blessings and said "=
Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a 
blessing". Hearing this suddenly=
 Rakhal Maharaj said, "Why do you 
people always come asking for Brahmachar=
ya? Was does not any one 
come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn't G=
od the final aim of 
everything.. "

Is it possible for someone who cannot =
maintain brahmacharya to reach 
God? I am puzzled...

-Regards
 Rajarshi
