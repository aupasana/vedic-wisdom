Hari OM

Namaste Narasimha Ji 

First of all I would like to thank you for =
the illustrative and quick
 reply. I really dont have the words to express =
my gratitude.

First of all with Homam Kundam I have ordered it online from=
 an Indian
 store, I am expecting it in few weeks time after which I will s=
tart
doing Homam.

Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces fro=
m March 2008
to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is=
 from
March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if you
c=
an explain me which one is correct.

As you mentioned it is correct that I =
have been a devotee of Shri
Krishna since childhood.

Next thing is about m=
editation, can you please advise me any good
meditation postures or any boo=
k where I can learn some.

Like I said before there are so many other quest=
ions which come up in
my mind. Although you will find that most of them are=
 silly questions
but if you can answer them in brief it will increase my fa=
ith in
scriptures and clear my doubts.

-When did Lord Ramchandra appear. S=
ome say He appeared few thousand
years before Lord Krishna, Is that true?

=
-As most of the people believe these days that the Vedas were
written/revea=
led 7-8000 yrs ago, if this is true then what was the
source of knowledge b=
efore that?

-Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, was=
nt there
any philosophy before that?

-What is the divison of the ages(yuga=
s). Again there is a lot of
confusion here as some say they are thousands o=
f years long but others
say millions of years long. Can you please explain =
it.

-You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu's boar incarnation).
Ca=
n you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real story
and is=
 there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation. Also
can you pleas=
e illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.

-I am getting married in O=
ct this year, can u please tell me how is it
going to affect my spiritual l=
ife. My fiancee's Birth Details- 02 Oct
1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.


I =
do not want to waste too much of your precious time but I feel only
you can=
 clear my doubts as there is no one else whom I can ask. 

Thank you
Sanjee=
v
