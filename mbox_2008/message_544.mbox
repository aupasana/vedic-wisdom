Om Brihaspataye Namah

Dear PS Ramanarayanan
Namaste

While I agree with yo=
u that our goal should be to transcend the 
platform of mechanics, I still =
think that Their Lordships Holy Names 
should always be on our lips- in wha=
tever we do. 

For who truly knows when death will come knocking on our doo=
r? 

Do you know the story of Ajamila?  

Jaya Radha Damodhara
