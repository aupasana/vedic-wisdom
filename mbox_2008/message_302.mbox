Dear Narasimha,
Pranam.

I agree fully with your viewpoint. Still I feel th=
e need to further 
endorse it adding my 2 cents...

"The purity & bliss wit=
hin must be realised and maintained like a 
lotus lives in the water, immer=
sed but not wet."

Best regards,
Himanshu Mohan

He/she will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the other =

univ=
erse as the same Self and sees no reason to either be attracted 
to or repe=

not based on th=

based on the previous f=
low.

true mental renunciation. Renouncing external objects can promote 
mental =
renunciation, but not guarantee it. On the other hand, one can 
remain in t=

objects and yet have a=
 perfectly stable, peaceful and blissful mind 
that is not attracted to or =

and adulation, may be more detached at the me=

yogis in Himalayas. It is probably true in the case o=

agai=
n or not is a questionmark. On the other hand, to be in contact 
with the o=
