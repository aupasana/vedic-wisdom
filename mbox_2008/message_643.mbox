Namaste

I was talking about the same book in my prevoius email
the web sit=
e is http://www.swargarohan.org/

It also has many of sri yogeshwar's lectu=
re in audio and also some
bhajans to. They are also very good too.

Since U=
tpalBhai has already uploaded the book so one can download from
the file se=
ction too. Thanks to him.


Best Regards
Mitesh
