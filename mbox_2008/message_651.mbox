Dear Sir,
I am going to write here second miracle in my life abou=
t Shri Thakur. This was also happened at Okha Port soon after my first mira=
culous experience. The first was on 5th April 74 whereas this was in the mi=
d of May 1974, the date I do not remember.
As I have written in my previous=
 mail my duty was as a Telegraphist at Okha Post Office and my duty hours w=
ere from 7 am to 12 pm and from 4 pm to 7 pm. I was coming to my home at 12=
 pm and cooking my food daily as my wife was at her parent's home at Ahmeda=
bad then. I was alone there. I was eating my food at 1 pm around and taking=
 rest for 2 hours. I was awaking between 3 to 3.30 pm and preparing my tea =
before going to office. This was a daily routine. 
I was receiving 30 to 40=
 telegrams daily before 12 pm and was giving them to Mr. Babaubhai Pandya, =
a delivery postman of 50 years age to deliver these telegrams to Banks, Nav=
y, Fisheries and Shipping agents, as Okha is a big port. Babubhai was deliv=
ering telegrams and coming back to Post office at 4 pm daily.
I was then re=
citing Shri Ramkrishnadev Mantra given by Mr. Patel to me whole day and rea=
ding Shri Ramkrishna Kathamritam daily after taking my food at noon before =
rest. One day I was reading Kathamritam after my food, I slept while readin=
g the book. It was a long sleep but I heard=C2=A0 somebody is knocking my d=
oor and I was awake. I opened the door and he was Babubhai, my deliveryman.=
 
"Are you still sleeping Rawalbhai? See your watch, it is already 3.45"
"O=
h, thanks Babubhai, today I am really late. Let us drink tea together today=
 as you are never coming to my home"
And I immediately prepared the tea. We=
 both took the tea and talked some general talk then. 
" Ok, now I am going=
 to deliver these 2 telegrams to Banks and coming to office within 10 to 15=
 minutes." 
" Ok," I said and Babubhai went to office. 
After 5 minutes tim=
e I also went to office and reached my office at 4.10 hours. I saw Babubhai=
 there, waiting for me. 
"Why late Rawalbhai?" he said.
" You know Babubhai=
, you have awakened me today otherwise I might be still sleeping. Today how=
 you came to my house?=C2=A0 You are never coming to that area generally."
=
"But I have not come to your house Rawalbhai, why should I come at this tim=
e? My route is different, as you know. I have just come from market. I don'=
t understand what you are telling." He exclaimed.
I was thrilled again with=
 excitement. Who was He who came to my house? It was not a dream. We had ta=
ken tea together and 2 cups of tea I had washed.
I did not reply to Babubha=
i but I still search the Answer as to Who was He to my home on that day? Th=
akur=E2=80=A6..???
