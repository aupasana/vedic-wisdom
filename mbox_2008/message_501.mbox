Namaste Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
Thank you sir. You are an inspiration! I will d=
o it this time as per your instructions. May Bhairav Baba protect and bless=
 you with the finest spiritual experiences.
=C2=A0
I remember an experience=
 that had happened to me once, during one of my homas. I was doing the homa=
 at home, I was living alone. So no one else was at home. It was around the=
 time when the sun was about to set..a little fading light. As I was in the=
 middle of the homa i suddenly heard very soft footsteps behind me in the r=
oom. As if someone was walking barefeet. First I thought it was the fire th=
at was making the sound. Then I tried to listen carefully as I was offering=
 the ahuti in the fire, and I realised it was not the fire, but distinct fo=
otsteps right behind where I was seating! And I was living alone, the main =
door was bolted from inside, no chance any one could come into the house an=
d even impossible for anyone to be in that room where I was doing the homa.=
.I got VERY scared. 
=C2=A0
Then I debated with myself whether to turn arou=
nd to see what/who was there, but immediately the sound stopped, again as I=
 resumed the ahutis of the manytra in the fire it started again...clear foo=
tsteps.... this time my fear become even greater, then I contemplated in my=
 mind I have two options, one is to get up and leave immediately or sit and=
 continue.. I mentally started praying to Bhairav Baba saying whatever it i=
s, you are the one who should make sure nothing bad happens and I can compl=
ete the homa peacefully...I dont know anything, I am too ignorant and let m=
e complete the homa.. then I continued with the ahutis, after another fifte=
en minutes the sound stopped and everything ended peacefully, infact i felt=
 very happy with the homa, the fire was energizing, everything ended well..=
. Aafter getting up from my seat I turned round and inspected the whole hou=
se, of course I could not see a thing...
=C2=A0
I still wonder what it migh=
t have been,=C2=A0 but anyway Bhairav Baba protected me..
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,

Obviously, there are some previous samskaras that pulle=
d you in this 
direction. That is good. This is what Vimalananda alluded to=
, when he said 
those who have the desire have no knowledge and those who h=
ave the knowledge 
have no desire in this age. He also said, "if you have a=
 deep desire to 
learn something, nature will find a way to teach you that"=
.

If you see the super-short method, you will see that it is very similar =
to 
yours. Just add the ahutis to Prajapati, Agni etc at the beginning and =
at 
the end. Before you call Bhairava, call Ganesha in fire and make 8 aahu=
ties 
with a simple mantra ("Om Gam Ganapataye Namah" is fine). Then call B=
hairava 
in fire. Make the offerings. After the ahutis to Agni, Vaayu etc, =
give 
Poornaahuti. Basically follow the super-short procedure. It is also o=
k to 
not do panchopachara pooja etc. You can be informal with someone you =
know 
reasonably well.

Of course, you can continue the way you were doing =
also, but the additions I 
am suggeting (ahutis at start/end and Ganesha) a=
re small and worthwhile. As 
(if) you make additions, do it with a positive=
 frame of mind and do NOT 
worry about past. There is a reason for everythi=
ng. Just leave the past and 
don't worry that you did some "mistake". It is=
 never a mistake to worship 
god in the way you know. God is always happy i=
f you do the best job you can, 
with what you know. But, as god gives you m=
ore knowledge, he may raise the 
bar for you. :-)

For invoking Ganapathi o=
r Bhairava in fire, thinking of the form in the mind 
and requesting him me=
ntally to come into the fire is sufficient.

Best regards,
Narasimha
