Namaste Sir,

This is an absolutely brilliant exposition. Thank you for posting it. Swami 
Bhaskarananda Saraswati is undoubtedly a profound scholar and a great yogi. 
There are those who are highly scholarly and there are those who have 
experienced. Those with scholarship and experience are so rare.

Whenever I think of Swami Bhaskarananda, I am reminded of a small episode 
involving Swami Akhandananda. He was one of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's 16 
direct disciples. He wandered all over India and met many saints. When in 
Varanasi, he met Trilinga Swami and took his blessings. Then he went and met 
Swami Bhaskarananda. Bhaskarananda was impressed with the young man and 
wanted to teach Vedas to him. Swami Akhandananda (he was only known as 
Gangadhar then - not renounced yet) politely refused saying, "The power of 
sight which I would use for attaining knowledge by reading books, please 
turn it inward, so that I can experience Atman". Bhaskarananda was not 
offended. Instead, he marvelled at the young man and remarked, "I see you 
are a yogi."

There is much to learn from this small episode...

Best regards,
Narasimha
