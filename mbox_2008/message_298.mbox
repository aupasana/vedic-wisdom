Namaste Pramod ji and others,

My best wishes for a pleasant Rishi Panchami=
!

<<<I have few questions in mind which I am not able to find a satisfacto=
ry answers from anyone. 
There is saying in Sanskrit "Tena vina truanam api=
 na chalati"  means " A blade of grass doesn't move without his will". In p=
urusha suktam also it mentions God alone is Prabhu(lord) of bhoot(past) and=
 bhavya(future)..
So with these statements in mind can't we conclude that e=
verybody's destiny is fixed by God according to his karmas? Now if my desti=
ny is fixed why should I bother if a particular day is auspicious or not, o=
r the girl will be my perfect match or no. 
Can't I just concentrate on my =
Karmas and leave the rest to God?  What is the relevance of Jyotish Shastra=
 in this point view? Why should I bother about Jyotish at all?
I am convinc=
ed that you are the best person to answer these questions. Please find for =
me some time in your busy schedule to answer this burning question of mine.=
>>>

This is a good question. It is a loaded philosophical question and one=
 that many may have. Though I addressed such questions in the past, I sense=
 that I may be able to give an inspired answer on this auspicious day. I wi=
ll hence spend a little time trying to put my thoughts into elaborate words=
 and cover various aspects related to this question. At the end, I may not =
answer your question fully or satisfactorily, but I will hopefully have pen=
ned some useful thoughts. Hoping you won't mind, I am cc'ing this mail to a=
 few yahoogroups related to Jyotisha and spirituality.

This mail is a litt=
le long, as I will cover a few different things and try to put them in pers=
pective.

*        *        *

Brief Answer

First let me give the brief an=
swer. If you can indeed concentrate on your Karmas (actions) and leave the =
rest to God and if you can accept with an equal vision any results (fruits)=
 that your karmas may bring, then you are a liberated soul. Jyotisha shastr=
a is indeed irrelavent to you. But there are very few people who are like t=
hat. For others, it is still relevant.

Now let me give the long-winded ans=
wer.

*        *        *

Nature of Self

When someone has a dream, one ma=
y experience many objects of various attributes and qualities in the dream.=
 Do those objects exist in reality? No. All those objects and various inter=
actions between those objects are unreal - they exist fictionally within th=
e mind. Only the mind exists in reality and no other objects. Still, during=
 the course of a dream, the mind is under the illusion that all these objec=
ts exist outside of it. All those objects obey the rules conjured by the mi=
nd that is dreaming.

This whole creation is basically like that. All being=
s are but Brahman. Upanishads and vedanta teach that there is Brahman and n=
othing or nobody else in this universe. There is no "self" and "other". All=
 is self. However, a part of Brahman becomes deluded and forms a self-ident=
ity and entertains an illusion that there is an "I" and the "other". This f=
irst being is the supreme being (known by various names such as Sadashiva, =
Narayana, Krishna, Mahaganapathi, Savita etc).

When the supreme being imag=
ines the existence of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc to play various roles in th=
is universe and imagines various beings that make this universe up, all tho=
se beings come into being (just like the objects in someone's dream). Just =
as the objects in a dream obey the rules conjured up by the dreamer in his =
dream, the beings of this universe obey the rules of the game imagined by t=
he supreme being. Each being experiences various other beings and other obj=
ects in this universe because of the spell of delusion that he/she is under=
. When one realizes the delusionary nature of this spell, one can break fre=
e from it.

But a normal person is not aware of all this. One's senses simp=
ly perceive so many different objects and one entertains various notions wi=
th respect to those objects. All these notions become very firmly establish=
ed in one's consciousness after many births and it is difficult to overcome=
 those notions. Some objects give pleasure and some give pain, some are fou=
nd attractive and some are repulsive, some are considered good and some bad=
. And so on. The field that is experienced by one, i.e. the field in which =
all these objects of opposite qualities exist, is known as the "field of du=
ality" or "maayaa" (delusion).

*        *        *

Overcoming the Delusio=
n

Overcoming this delusion and rising above the limited perception of the =
senses and realizing that all the beings that seem to exist are like dream =
objects imagined by the supreme being, i.e. that there is nothing but the s=
upreme being in this universe, is not easy.

Saying "all is Brahman and the=
 objects we perceive are all Brahman only" is easy. Even understanding it a=
t an intellectual level may be easy. But a perfect and unshakable understan=
ding of it is not difficult.

Let us see an analogy. Suppose one goes to a =
movie. Some events unfold on the movie screen and they seem to really happe=
n. However, they are not real events. It is just fake and manipulated. The =
characters in the movie are not real. However, some people take the events =
on the screen seriously and react strongly. Good happenings on the screen m=
ake them elated and scary moments on the screen shake them up. There may be=
 someone with an intellectual understanding that the movie is not real and =
yet one specific scene that may get him/her. For example, one may shiver wi=
th shock in a scene despite the intellectual understanding that it is not r=
eal. Intellectual understanding does not give full control over instincts.
=

Similarly, one with only an intellectual understanding that all is Brahman=
 does not have full control over the mind. The instincts, sense organs and =
various aspects of mind sometimes run like a mad monkey, away from the unde=
rstanding that "all is Brahman". One may feel happy about some things, feel=
 sad about some things, become attracted to some things and become repelled=
 by some things. A perfect, permanent and unshakable understanding that all=
 is Brahman is much more difficult to obtain than a mere intellectual under=
standing.

It requires dismantling the formidable fort of delusion made of =
the walls of mental conditioning formed by the bricks of sense experiences =
that are joined by the cement of logic and analysis. These walls are fortif=
ied over many many lives and make the fort quite formidable.

This is a lon=
g process involving many steps. There are different practices designed to f=
acilitate this in different religious/spiritual paths. There is no foolproo=
f algorithm to ensure this process. There are only guidelines.

All is Brah=
man and all the duality is arising from the Supreme Being. All of one's act=
ions are actually occurring due to the will of Supreme Being only. The resu=
lts/fruits (good or bad) of one's actions may be viewed as the reactions by=
 Nature to one's actions and they too are due to the will of Supreme Being.=
 Thus, everything that happens is due to the will of Supreme Being. If one =
person remains in ignorance, keeps on taking a rebirth and keeps going thro=
ugh good and terrible experiences, it is all the will of Supreme Being. If =
one says "it is all the will of Supreme Being. I am doing nothing" just for=
 the heck of it and yet continues to have an egotism (self-identication wit=
h a body or name or personality or some object), continues various actions =
through that ego and continues to receive their fruits and becomes elated b=
y some and depressed by some, it is all through the will of Supreme Being. =
Though the person is saying "Supreme Being does all", he continues to think=
 of an "I" and thinks deeply that "I am doing". That is why Supreme Being w=
ills the persons to receive the appropriate fruits of that action. If anoth=
er person truly understands that Supreme Being knows, wills and does all th=
ings, kills "I" completely at the mental level, then that person may seem t=
o engage in various actions, but he does not really perform any actions. Wh=
en there is no "I", there is action and no reaction. Despite moving in the =
material world and doing various actions, that person's mind is always esta=
blished in bliss. Again, this person has no "I-ness" and hence Supreme Bein=
g wills the person to be in supreme bliss always.

The subtle lesson I am t=
rying to drive at is: As long as there is an "I-ness" to a person, actions =
take place and their reactions happen. "All is Brahman. I do not do anythin=
g" is for one who has killed "I-ness" completely. It is not an excuse to do=
 anything and get away. Until one completely kills "I-ness", one has to wat=
ch one's actions to produce good reactions that are conducive to making mor=
e progress.

*        *        *

Two Types of Knowledge

The teachings of =
maharshis in Veda and allied subjects like Vedangas and Vedanta cover essen=
tially two types of knowledge:

(1) Understanding the rules of engagement o=
f the field of duality (maayaa)
(2) Understanding how the field of duality =
is delusionary and how all is Brahman only

Knowledge of type (2) is essent=
ial because eventually the goal of each being is to overcome the delusionar=
y nature of the field of duality and see Brahman in all. However, the probl=
em with 2 is that this knowledge is only realized and not imparted in a ste=
p-by-step process. One may read reams about how all is Brahman and seemingl=
y different objects of this universe are a delusion and one may even unders=
tand and appreciate it to some extent intellectually. But it is of not much=
 use! Until the realization comes from within and experienced, one continue=
s to be deluded by duality. One may know all the theory, but the mind conti=
nues to be deluded and swayed by duality. When somebody praises one, one ma=
y feel elated. When somebody attacks one, one may feel unhappy. When one fi=
nds something nice, one may be attracted. When one finds something disgusti=
ng, one may be repelled. And so on. Please see my previous analogy of a mov=
ie.

While knowledge of type (2) elaborates why the above behavior is silly=
 and describes the thinking and approach of a liberated soul, it is very ve=
ry difficult to imbibe such thinking and attitude and become liberated. Eve=
n reading works imparting knowledge of type 2 for a long time does not guar=
antee liberation.

Vedangas such as Jyotisha belong to type (1). When one d=
oes not realize that the field of duality is a delusion and is swayed by th=
e opposites, then one needs tools to navigate the ocean of opposites. Jyoti=
sh is one such tool. When one's mind is deeply stuck in duality and has uns=
urmountable "I-ness" and "other-ness" deeply imprinted on it, "all is Brahm=
an. Parama Purusha knows, wills and does all" is a useless concept. From th=
e perspective of that person, one's "I-ness" does all actions and begets th=
e fruits of those actions based on order set by Parama Purusha. This gives =
happiness and sadness of great proportions. This cycle of actions and fruit=
s may go on forever, until one's "I-ness" is killed completely.

Some spiri=
tual sadhana is necessary to kill the "I-ness". This spiritual sadhana is h=
appening within the field of duality where the mind has a clear "I-ness" an=
d "other-ness". Thus, the rules of engagement in the field duality apply. S=
ubjects like Jyotisha throw light on these rules and they can be helpful. F=
or example, one may start sadhana at a particular time and make swift progr=
ess. One may start sadhana at a particular time and encounter many obstacle=
s and stop the sadhana without much progress. One may find the right sadhan=
a based on previous samskaras and vasanas from the horoscope. One may find =
out that impending material problem (e.g. job loss or loss of a close relat=
ive or a divorce etc) may derail one's sadhana and take some measures to st=
op it and reduce its magnitude. Thus, Jyotisha can be used to manipulate th=
e field of duality to one's advantage, as one wades it trying to kill one's=
 "I-ness" and individual will.

*        *         *

One's Will vs Other's=
 Will

When a scripture says that everything that happens is God's will, it=
 is essentially referring to the supreme being (Parama Purusha) mentioned e=
arlier as the God. This Being is the first Being arising from non-dual Brah=
man and the one who conjures up the entire duality. Thus, we are at the bor=
der of non-duality and duality.

Deities who operate completely within dual=
ity have their own wills which may clash with each other and clash with our=
 will. For example, the will of Yamadharmaraja (yama=3Ddisplicine, dharma =
=3D righteousness, raja =3D ruler) compelled him to kill Markandeya and col=
lided with the will of Markandeyaq who wanted to remain alive and the will =
of Lord Shiva who wanted to save Markendeya. There are many stories where t=
he will of one deity/being clashed with another's.

Of course, all these de=
ities are different forms of the same Brahman (or, loosely speaking, of Par=
ama purusha). The will of Parama Purusha is that one deity's will should co=
mpel the deity to do X and another deity's will should compel that deity to=
 do Y and something should happen as a result. Everything is indeed the lee=
laa (play) of the will of Parama Purusha. But we are not at the stage of fa=
thoming the play of Parama Purusha (and his Shakti). All we can say is that=
 Parama Purusha's will is a complex thing. It is in fact the sum total of t=
he individual wills of all beings of this universe!

As long as there is "I=
-ness" and individual self-identity left in the mind, there is an individua=
l will. As long as that is the case, one is not liberated. One's individual=
 will facilitates various actions that clash with the wills of various othe=
r beings. It causes various probelms. Basically one acting based on "indivi=
dual will" is in tune with only a small subset of "God's will". That person=
 is not in tune with the *entire* God's will.

Thus saying "all is God's wi=
ll. I need to do nothing" is not conducive to liberation. It continues bond=
age. Directed effort to kill "I-ness" makes one truly understand that "all =
is God's will" and drop off one's individual will.

Only when "I-ness" is k=
illed and "individual will" is completely evaporated can one be in tune wit=
h the entire "God's will" (as opposed to a small subset). Then alone can on=
e remain in constant bliss, as an unbound observer of the play of this univ=
erse without any individual agenda or will. THAT is liberation. Such a libe=
rated soul may seem to engage in various actions, but the mind is stable, h=
as no "I-ness" or individual will and is established in constant bliss. Lik=
e a fan may continue to turn for a while after the electricity supply is st=
opped, such a liberated soul may continue to engage in actions based on the=
 previous flow, but without any egotism (supply of electricity in the analo=
gy).
 
*        *        *
 
I wanted to write a little bit, but ended up w=
riting too much. I will sign off for now. Again, a pleasant Rishi Panchami =
to all of you!

Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear PVR Narasimha Rao sir,

  I recentl=
y came across your software which was shown to me by my maternal uncle. I a=
m completely ignorant of Jyotish Shastra. 
  But I am avid reader of spirit=
uality and religion from very early age.  I have seen many a places like Ra=
mayana, Mahabharata where God himself has made references to Jyotish for au=
spicious day calculation.

  I have few questions in mind which I am not ab=
le to find a satisfactory answers from anyone. 

  There is saying in Sansk=
rit "Tena vina truanam api na chalati"  means " A blade of grass doesn't mo=
ve without his will". In purusha suktam also it mentions God alone is Prabh=
u(lord) of bhoot(past) and bhavya(future)..

  So with these statements in =
mind can't we conclude that everybody's destiny is fixed by God according t=
o his karmas? Now if my destiny is fixed why should I bother if a particula=
r day is auspicious or not, or the girl will be my perfect match or no. 

 =
 Can't I just concentrate on my Karmas and leave the rest to God?  What is =
the relevance of Jyotish Shastra in this point view? Why should I bother ab=
out Jyotish at all?

  I am convinced that you are the best person to answe=
r these questions. Please find for me some time in your busy schedule to an=
swer this burning question of mine.


  Thanks.

  Best Regards,
  Pramod.

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial si=
ze=3D2>All is Brahman and all the duality is arising from 
the Supreme Bein=
g. All of one's actions are actually occurring due to the will 
of Supreme =
Being only. The results/fruits (good or bad) of one's actions may be 
viewe=
d as the reactions by Nature to one's actions and they too are due to the 
=
will of Supreme Being. Thus, everything that happens is due to the will of =

Supreme Being. If one person remains in ignorance, keeps on taking a rebir=
th and 
keeps going through good and terrible experiences, it is all the wi=
ll of Supreme 
Being. If one says "it is all the will of Supreme Being. I a=
m doing nothing" 
just for the heck of it and yet continues to have an 
ego=
tism (self-identication with a body or name or personality or some 
ob=
ject), continues various actions through that ego and continues to receive =

their fruits and becomes elated by some and depressed by some, it is all t=
hrough 
the will of Supreme Being. Though the person is saying "Supreme Bei=
ng does all", 
he continues to think of an "I" and thinks deeply that "I am=
 doing". That is why 
Supreme Being wills the persons to receive the approp=
riate fruits of that 
action. If another person truly understands that Supr=
eme Being knows, wills and 
does all things, kills "I" completely at the me=
ntal level, then that person may 
seem to engage in various actions, but he=
 does not really perform any actions. 
When there is no "I", there is actio=
n and no reaction. Despite moving in the 
material world and doing various =
actions, that person's mind is always

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>The subtle lesson I am trying to=

eventually the goal of each being i=
s to overcome the delusionary nature of the 
field of duality and see Brahm=
an in all. However, the problem with 2 is that 
this knowledge is only real=
ized and not imparted in a step-by-step process. One 
may read reams about =
how all is Brahman and seemingly different objects of this 
universe are a =
delusion and one may even understand and appreciate it to 
some extent=
 intellectually. But it is of not much use! Until the realization 
comes fr=
om within and experienced, one continues to be deluded by duality. One 
may=
 know all the theory, but the mind continues to be deluded and swayed by 
d=
uality. When somebody praises one, one may feel elated. When somebody attac=
ks 
one, one may feel unhappy. When one finds something nice, one may be at=
tracted. 
When one finds something disgusting, one may be repelled. And so =
on. Please see 
my previous analogy of a movie.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Whi=

not guarante=
e liberation.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </=
DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Vedangas such as Jyotisha belong to t=
ype (1). When 
one does not realize that the field of duality is a delusion=
 and is swayed by 
the opposites, then one needs tools to navigate the ocea=
n of opposites. Jyotish 
is one such tool. When one's mind is deeply stuck =
in duality and has 
unsurmountable "I-ness" and "other-ness" deeply imprint=
ed on it, "all is 
Brahman. Parama Purusha knows, wills and does all" is a =
useless concept. From 
the perspective of that person, one's "I-ness" does =
all actions and begets the 
fruits of those actions based on order set by P=
arama Purusha. This gives 
happiness and sadness of great proportions. This=
 cycle of actions and fruits may 
go on forever, until one's "I-ness" is ki=
lled completely.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> =
;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Some spiritual sadhana is necessar=
y to kill the 
"I-ness". This spiritual sadhana is happening within the fie=
ld of duality where 
the mind has a clear "I-ness" and "other-ness". Thus, =
the rules of engagement in 
the field duality apply. Subjects like Jyotisha=
 throw light on these rules and 
they can be helpful. For example, one may =
start sadhana at a particular time and 
make swift progress. One may start =
sadhana at a particular time and encounter 
many obstacles and stop the sad=
hana without much progress. One may find the 
right sadhana based on previo=
us samskaras and vasanas from the horoscope. One 
may find out that impendi=
ng material problem (e.g. job loss or loss of a close 
relative or a divorc=
e etc) may derail one's sadhana and take some measures to 
stop it and redu=
ce its magnitude. Thus, Jyotisha can be used to manipulate the 
field of du=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Deities w=

Markandeyaq who =

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Of course, all these deities are diff=

Parama Purusha is that one deity's will should compel th=

another deity's will should compel that deity to do Y =

play) of the will of Parama

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
As long as there is "I-ness" and individual

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2><FONT face=3DArial size=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thus saying "all =

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Only when "I-ness" is killed and "individual will=

Such a liberated soul may se=

</DIV>Dear PVR Narasimha Rao

tware which was shown to me by my 
  maternal uncle. I am completely ignora=
nt of Jyotish Shastra. <BR>But I am avid 
  reader of spirituality and reli=
gion from very early age.  I have seen 
  many a places like Ramayana,=
 Mahabharata where God himself has made references 
  to Jyotish for auspic=
ious day calculation.<BR><BR>I have few questions in mind 
  which I am not=
 able to find a satisfactory answers from anyone. <BR><BR>There 
  is sayin=
g in Sanskrit "Tena vina truanam api na chalati"  means " A blade 
  o=
f grass doesn't move without his will". In purusha suktam also it mentions =

  God alone is Prabhu(lord) of bhoot(past) and bhavya(future)..<BR><BR>So =
with 
  these statements in mind can't we conclude that everybody's destiny=
 is fixed 
  by God according to his karmas? Now if my destiny is fixed why=
 should I bother 
  if a particular day is auspicious or not, or the girl w=
ill be my perfect match 
  or no. <BR><BR>Can't I just concentrate on my Ka=
rmas and leave the rest to 
  God?  What is the relevance of Jyotish S=
hastra in this point view? Why 
  should I bother about Jyotish at all?<BR>=
<BR>I am convinced that you are the 
  best person to answer these question=
s. Please find for me some time in your 
  busy schedule to answer this bur=
ning question of 
  mine.<BR><BR><BR>Thanks.<BR><BR>Best
