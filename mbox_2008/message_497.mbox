Adarniya Narasimha Guruji Namaste,
=A0
A small doubt arose in mind. You wro=
te:
=A0
"The purpose of sadhana is to instill discipline and control the mi=
nd. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday there is a possibility of mind=
 stopping completely for a little time. When that happens, you perceive the=
 underlying reality that an overactive mind normally stops you from perceiv=
ing. As this happens more frequently, you are able to control your mind far=
 better."
=A0
After astrological consultation people are asked to recite pa=
rticluar mantra for a ovrercoming a specific problem e.g., Marital problem/=
 Debt. Here does it mean that by reciting the particular mantra the mind wi=
ll b calm & we will take better decision or it is something else. Please el=
aborate.

Regards

Namaste Ajit,
=A0
A really l=
earned and elevated soul like you is asking a fool like me for my view - ho=
w weird is the play of the Mother! You read shastras far more thoroughly th=
an me. I read only a little and mostly go by my instincts, words of gurus=
=A0and insights from practical experience. Anyway, as you asked, here are m=
y 2 cents.
=A0
The purpose of sadhana is to instill discipline and control =
the mind. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday there is a possibility o=
f mind stopping completely for a little time. When that happens, you percei=
ve the underlying reality that an overactive mind normally stops you from p=
erceiving. As this happens more frequently, you are able to control your mi=
nd far better.
=A0
If you do things in a business-like attitude, in haste, =
IMHO, it is not really conducive to slowing the mind down and creating a us=
eful complete/partial silence of the mind. It is very counter-productive. B=
efore any ritual, we are expected to do praanaayaama.=A0The idea is that yo=
u get as much control over breathing and hence on mind, and then rely on th=
e meditation/japam/ homam to take the mind further into calmness.
=A0
If yo=
u are somebody who can maintain calmness of your mind even as you rush thro=
ugh some hymns in haste, then I see no problem. But, normally, rushing thro=
ugh something under time pressure destroys the calmness of the mind.
=A0
On=
 the other hand, if you do not have artificial pressures to meet a count an=
d go calmly as long as you can, it is more conducive to the calming down of=
 the mind.
=A0
Thus, I strongly recommend doing japam at the pace that is c=
omfortable and not detrimental to the calmness and focus of mind. If necess=
ary, I recommend dumping restrictions like meeting a count. In fact, in thi=
s age and time, it is probably better to not have a target count at all and=
 have a target time only. In other words, don't say "I will do this mantra =
for 1008 times" and instead say "I will do this mantra for 40 minutes". The=
n, for those 40 minutes, you can focus on the mantra calmly.
=A0
Of course,=
 quantity also matters. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definitely bett=
er than half hour. But quantity without quality is useless. Very focussed m=
editation for half hour is better than distracted meditation for 4 hours. I=
f you can maintain the quality, then quantity starts to matter.
=A0
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha

namaste mahodaya,

I have a=

=A0
Assuming that one has limited time for japa (or other sadhana), which=
 is better -- doing a 
smaller count slowly and deliberately, or trying to =
do the japa very quickly in order to have 
a higher "count"?
=A0
Since it i=

slowly each day, or is it better to try and finish the para=
