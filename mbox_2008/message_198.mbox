Namaskaram anna,
 
I saw this movie and I cannot help responding.
 
It is t=
rue that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffered badly at the hands of Muslim i=
nvaders (and other invaders), but it is wrong to take out that anger on Akb=
ar. Some people cannot see beyond a man's name and religion and hence canno=
t recognize when a great celestial being is born in a different religion.
 =

Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the "Aghora" series books,=
 is somebody who achieved the highest states of consciousness. He received =
a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Accordinging to him, Akbar an=
d Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Rajput King Prithviraj Chou=
han. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim invaders at the border of In=
dia. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of them and=
 put breaks on their aggression and changed their ways.
 
In that age, Musl=
im invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temples, libraries and other re=
lics of native religion and culture. They beheaded Hindus who refused to co=
nvert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded defeated kings. They just t=
ried to wipe out the native religion and culture and replace with theirs. A=
kbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and promoted tolerance and in=
tegration. He stopped the forced conversions, rapes and beheadings of Hindu=
s. He stopped the destruction of temples and libraries. He talked about res=
pecting other religions while following one's own religion. He even took on=
 the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a special tax on Hindus based =
on religion. He was a man of great character, conviction and principles and=
 was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs and was even born in a R=
ajput family and spent early years there. He displayed the samskaras and in=
stincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mughal king -=
 he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-brother Ad=
ham.
 
He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and then participate =
in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to our homam) and then do a=
 namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unheard of from any other Mu=
slim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!). Towards the end of his l=
ife, he even started his own religion, which was based on his realization a=
nd is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated soul. Irrespective of the =
religion one follows, one deserves our respect and admiration if one embodi=
es the spirit of sanatana dharma in one's thoughts and actions.
 
Akbar was=
 a true hero - a being who came down from a higher loka to fulfil a certain=
 mission with the blessings of rishis. His contribution to the safekeeping =
of sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what harm his fellow Muslims in=
flicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to be judged from what *mor=
e* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, I have no=
 doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much more than it did.=
 That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent somebody to alte=
r the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate that those who see th=
e goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cannot see the goodness of Ak=
bar simply because he was a Muslim.
 
It is unfortunate that some Hindus ar=
e equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should=
 be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as an enemy and being shot =
down. Instead, we should promote his story and inspire more people to be li=
ke him. He was a great inspirational figure then and should be now too.
 
T=
he epic movie "Jodha Albar" is a very good movie about one of the greatest =
and most dharmik emperors of India. The director and actor did justice to a=
 man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad about the mud-slinging tha=
t some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please do not assassinate the c=
haracter of Akbar.
 
If you want, please make movies of the same caliber an=
d cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such as Chatrapati Shivaji, Pr=
ithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jna=
aneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vi=
vekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no need to denigrate a fine mo=
vie made on Akbar.
 
These are my 2 cents on the fire over Jodha Akbar.
 
B=
est regards,
Narasimha

s producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick bucks by denigrat=
ing and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people. Sonia's (Antonia Maino) Congre=
ss government promtly banned 'Da Vinci Code' movie after Christians' protes=
t, but this Secular (?) government is so insensitive about Hindus protest a=
bout 'Jodhaa-Akbar' !

  Shameful Hindus who throng to watch Jodhaa-Akbar, a=
