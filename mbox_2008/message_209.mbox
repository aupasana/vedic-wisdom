OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA
Dear Sri Sushil Dlkshit Ji,
Namaskar.
I am blessed to lear=
n the Kar mala from the file section and also 
applied in my daily ritual e=
ffectively. Some difference (pervasive 
effectiveness-may be my feelings I =
do not know) I found while counting 
the mantra through Kar mala than the o=
rdinary finger method that I 
follow. At this juncture, I shall be much obl=
iged if it is possible 
for you to permit us to know the subtle details lik=
e why the finger 
should not touch the finger lines and while counting eigh=
t why we are 
omitting first and the last angusa and the specific method of=
 starting 
from Surya finger and why not including other angusa of the midd=
le 
finger?
With respects.
Yours Sincerely,
S.Dheenadayalan
