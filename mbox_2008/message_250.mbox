Hindu convert a spiritual teacher at temple in Omaha

O=
MAHA =97 When Frank Morales was only 10 years old, growing up in
Brooklyn, =
N.Y., he developed a strong interest in spirituality.

"I started reading t=
he various scriptures of the world," he said. He
read the Bible, the Quran,=
 ancient Buddhist texts. Finally, he read
the Bhagavad Gita, a short book t=
hat is one of the most revered of
Hindu scriptures.

"I felt I'd found what=
 I was looking for," he said.

The Gita tells the story of Arjuna, a warrio=
r in India, who is caught
up in a battle between members of his own family.=
 In a crisis of
conscience, he turns to Krishna, an incarnation of God, for=
 advice.
Krishna gives Arjuna instruction and answers his questions, provid=
ing
a clear and logical explanation of the three paths of yoga, or union
wi=
th God.

The three paths =97 karma yoga (action), gyana-yoga (knowledge) an=
d
bhakti-yoga (devotion) =97 form the basis for the practice of Hinduism.
A=
s a young boy discovering them for the first time, Morales felt that
they g=
ave the most understandable explanation of the human situation
and human be=
ings' relationship with God.

"I was searching for a truth that was univers=
al, not just sectarian,"
he said. "I wasn't looking for faith; I was lookin=
g for philosophy.
It had to be universally applicable."

He went on to stud=
y more Hindu scriptures and soon discovered that
there are so many Hindu te=
xts that probably no one person has read
them all.

"They were written over=
 many hundreds of years. They're older than
the Bible. They're considered t=
he oldest collection of writings known
to humanity."

At age 14, he made hi=
s first visit to a Hindu temple =97 in Queens,
N.Y. The temple was filled w=
ith beautiful artwork and statues
representing many Hindu deities, each of =
whom is considered a
different expression of God.

"It was absolutely stunn=
ing; I was overwhelmed," Morales said. "I
felt I was leaving the world behi=
nd, entering a spiritual world. I
finally sat down in front of a statue of =
Krishna, and in my own mind I
said, `I'm home. This will be my religion for=
 the rest of my life.'"

Morales went on to study philosophy and theology, =
eventually receiving
a doctoral degree with an emphasis on Hinduism and Asi=
an culture from
the University of Wisconsin in Madison. He made several tri=
ps to
India, and in 1986, after living as a celibate monk for six years, he=

was initiated as a Hindu priest.

Back in the United States, he became an =
acharya, or teacher of
Hinduism, and adopted the Sanskrit name Sri Dharma P=
ravartaka Acharya.
The word "dharma" means natural law; his name literally =
means "one who
sets the dharma in motion."

Morales has become a widely rec=
ognized Hindu teacher, especially
through his Web site, www.dharmacentral.c=
om. He is president of the
International Sanatana Dharma Society.

Last fal=
l, he became the resident acharya (spiritual teacher) at the
Hindu Temple o=
f Nebraska in Omaha. He teaches several different
classes, including introd=
uction to Hinduism, a study of the Bhagavad
Gita and a youth class. He give=
s a spiritual talk prior to Sunday
worship at the temple and also leads sat=
sang (meditation and religious
discourse) sessions weekly in Omaha, and onc=
e each month in Lincoln.

Most of his students are people of Indian backgro=
und who want to learn
more about their religion. But a growing number are p=
eople who come
from other religious traditions who want to learn about Hind=
uism. A
few of those have decided, like Morales did, to become Hindus thems=
elves.

"Hinduism does not look for converts," Morales said. "But we do lik=
e
to teach. Anyone is welcome to come and learn."

Heather Mortensen is one=
 of his students who considers herself a
convert to Hinduism. She grew up i=
n an evangelical Christian family,
but said she had many doubts about the G=
od of the Bible, who often is
depicted as angry and judgmental. She went to=
 www.beliefnet.com to
learn about other religions. "I was super impressed w=
ith the Hindu
quotes," she said.

That led her to read the Bhagavad Gita an=
d felt it answered her
questions about God and human destiny. "I was in bli=
ss the entire day
while I was reading it."

Mortensen said she found the Hi=
ndu concept of reincarnation most
appealing, because it gives people a chan=
ce to keep striving, through
successive lives, to learn and grow closer to =
God.

She began studying with Morales in Wisconsin, and when he came to
Neb=
raska last fall, she moved to Omaha to continue taking classes from
him. Mo=
rtensen goes to the Hindu Temple regularly to meditate and
participates in =
Sunday services there with the Hindu community.

The temple serves about 1,=
000 families =97 predominantly immigrants from
India and their children =97=
 but there are a few converts, like
Mortensen, who regularly attend service=
s.

"I'm getting to know them (the Indians)," she said. "They're usually
su=
rprised at first =97 but I remind them I'm Hindu by telling them my
Hindu n=
ame." Mortensen took the Sanskrit name Tulasi in a ritual in
which she vowe=
d to follow Hindu teachings and practices.

On May 29, Morales will lead a =
ritual in Council Bluffs for 20 or more
people who are becoming Hindus. He =
estimates that about 1.5 million
Americans nationwide have converted to Hin=
duism.

Stephanie Guilfoyle, another of Morales' students who lives in Omah=
a,
was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism when she got married,
b=
ut about 10 years ago began studying different forms of Buddhism.
That even=
tually led her to Hinduism, since the Buddha was himself a
practicing Hindu=
.

"I was searching for the truth =97 I was searching for the root of all
t=
he traditions I had studied," she said. "When I read the Bhagavad
Gita, I f=
elt, `This is what all the other religions are saying, but
it's in the pure=
st form, the most undiluted.'"

In the Gita, Krishna teaches Arjuna about t=
he nature of the soul and
about the difference between eternal reality and =
the changing world of
sensory experience. The ultimate destiny of all peopl=
e, Krishna says,
is union with God.

She described Morales as a gifted teac=
her who helped the meaning of
the text come alive.

John Granger, who grew =
up in a Catholic family and attended a Jesuit
high school, became an agnost=
ic at age 17 and didn't become a believer
again until he discovered Hinduis=
m at age 44.

"Hinduism seems to fit my spiritual path, but it was a path I=
 was on
anyway," he said.

Granger enjoys the richness of the Hindu traditi=
on, which is reflected
in the many different deities represented in the Oma=
ha temple. The
temple has 12 separate sanctums, or altars, each with one or=
 more
statues representing different incarnations of God. People from
vario=
us parts of India have certain deities that they honor, so Hindus
of all ba=
ckgrounds feel comfortable in the Omaha temple.

Ram Bishu, a University of=
 Nebraska-Lincoln engineering professor and
chairman of the temple's religi=
ous committee, said the temple was
created primarily as a center of worship=
 and teaching for people from
India who live in Nebraska and Iowa. But, he =
added, "We're totally
comfortable" with people of other religious backgroun=
ds visiting or
participating in prayers and rituals.

"Hinduism is not a pr=
oselytizing religion," he said. "We have no
formal way of converting someon=
e to Hinduism. It's a very
individualistic religion."

Bishu noted that man=
y Americans practice yoga as an exercise
technique, or a way of calming the=
ir mind, but most are not aware of
the spiritual side of yoga as taught at =
the temple. Some people may go
to the temple because they're studying yoga =
and want to learn more
about its origins and deeper meaning, he said.

Many=
 church groups visit the temple seeking to learn about Hinduism
and promote=
 inter-religious understanding.

"Hinduism is a religion of tolerance," Mor=
ales said. His goal as a
teacher, he said, is not to preach but to explain =
the religion and
offer "a supportive environment" for individual spiritual =
growth.
