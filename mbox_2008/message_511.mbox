Nalini Bahen,

wish you and all a great Durgaashtami.

I'll put my 6 cent h=
ere if you don't mind:)

Yes, Narasimha Garu has recorded DeviMahatmya (DS)=
 on his site.

http://www.vedicastrologer.org
on the main page: click on 'l=
isten to some mantra', then you'll find
link for 'Durga Saptha Sathi in mp3=
 format'
------------------------------------------------------------------=


Personally, i've never worried about Swara, Mantra chanting only 
after I=
nitiation, correct protocols for Puja etc... Though i very 
much respect th=
ese things, i have always believed that this is not 
the 'age' where one re=
ally go for all *correctness*.

The most important is Bhavana ! Devotion !.=
 The almighty, The mother 
knows about our very intentions and would she re=
ally care about 
whether or not some body does proper rituals or not? if sh=
e needs to 
make it proper then she herself will bring about the changes.

=
I would quote Thakur here. he used to say that when just uttering 
Name of =
God brings tears in your eyes, know for sure that no rituals 
are required =
by you.
but that's very advance stage. for most of us, ChandiPaath, Naam 
J=
ap, mediatation etc.. are must to reach the stage.The only point 
here is t=
hat too much concern about correctness and such things will 
hamper us. the=
re will be so many people who wants to start some 
sadhana but are afraid o=
f starting becuase of these things.

I congratulate you and people must bec=
ome bold like you. no wories-
the almighty will take care of everything.

o=
nce Thakur scolded the great man Mahendranaath Gupta (M) and said 
that ***=
God knows that from the clay image worship, only he is being 
invoked. if t=
here are any flaws in the worship, he'll himself set it 
right***

personal=
ly, These ARE THE WORDS of Thakur which has given me immense 
confidence. t=
his couple of sentances from the Gospel has dispelled 
my many dowbts.
Shri=
 Krishna didn't bother about all protcols, Royal Pomp, outer 
show and Chap=
pan Bhoga of Duryodhana. instead he declined and went 
to Vidur's hut and w=
ith all love partaken his Bhaji. Same with 
Sudama.

One poet has narrated =
that episode in simple but beautiful words in 
Hindi. it goes like this

"D=
ekhi Sudaamaa ki Deen dasha, Karuna Karake Karunaa-Nidhi roye !
Pani paratk=
o haath chhuyo nahi, Nainan ke Jal se Pagu dhoye" !!!

It means- Krishna cr=
ied looking at the condition of his poor friend 
and didn't use water from =
the vessels but used his Tears to wash the 
feet of Sudaamaa.

that sums up=
 all.

I hope Rao garu will provide today with Technical details and 
Meani=
ng behind *various Nyaasa* for the benefit of all on this 
special day.

Ag=
ain wish you all a very happy Drgaashtami.

best regards,

utpal

starting balance of a million d=
ollars. This is akin to a good guru 
initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishy=

and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fal=
l and not 
achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give mon=
ey 
and may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions

dollars with own effort. This is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana 
with =
a mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.
> =C2=A0

me people hold the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a 
proper "i=
nitiation" . This view is especially prevalent in some 
sections of society=
 w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with 
that view.
> =C2=A0
> If =
you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an 
initiating guru have=
 done for you? Perhaps he would've given some of 
his attainment in the man=
tra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if 
you work hard. Or a guru would=
've taught you the right nyasas to be 
done before the mantra. Well, you ca=
n get the nyasas from books too. 
Moreover, what most people do today for n=
yasas is anyway just a 
ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means place=
ment. You place 
various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of var=
ious 
fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some 
s=
ignals while saying the sounds. This "placement" is actually 
supposed to b=
e an internal act and it creates an ideal environment 
for the repetition o=
f mantra. Due to the external actions, what is 
supposed to occur internall=
y does not occur in most. So the sounds 
end up not getting properly placed=
 in the body. In other words, what 
I am trying to say is that most people =
do
>  not know how to "place" various "sounds" in various body parts. 
They=
 merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if you do 
not know ny=
asas, you are not really missing much compared to others 
who were initiate=
d.

have 
devotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have them, you can
