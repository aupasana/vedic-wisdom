Namaste Sir,
 
There is no need for either Sri or Ji in addressing me.
 
Ho=
ping you won't mind, I am sending this reply to some yahoogroups that may h=
ave some interested people. When I was meditating before replying to you, a=
 really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me and I think it is worth=
 sharing with more people than just you. To ensure your anonymity, I remove=
d references in the quoted mail below that may help one identify you.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
First I will answer your first question in detail, becau=
se that can automatically answer other questions.
 
> 1. Are Vedic (Pure Va=
ithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras
> (people explain that mantr=
a shastra does not originate from the vedas,
> but classified under tantra)=
. Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?
 
*        *        *
 
Whe=
n people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. Th=
ey are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or masteri=
ng a celebrated commentary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, unde=
rstanding each single verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understandi=
ng a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (int=
uition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with =
energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor =
logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expr=
ession, direct knowledge.
 
When one meditates long enough on a verse, the =
verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understan=
d a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible to decipher even a sin=
gle verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.
 
Bottomoline is: Almost =
nobody understands Veda today. What are considered "pure vaidika rituals" a=
re merely another variety of rituals created by someone at some point of ti=
me. From the point of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no =
difference between them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly=
 believe otherwise.
 
*        *        *
 
A simple analogy may help clari=
fy a lot of things related to this complicated issue a little. What the thi=
ng in the analogy represents is shown here and there in square brackets [].=

 
Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aatman]. The=
y regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [expe=
rienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].=

 
As people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually ev=
olved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the s=
ea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew with tim=
e. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].
 
People started =
moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert=
 far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like=
 a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking t=
owards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had t=
o walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of=
 thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or =
some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!
 
Then=
 came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of=
 walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find =
the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the=
 sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].
 
People performing the =
old rituals objected to this and said "but then this horse thing is not gra=
nted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" s=
ea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand wh=
at the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply be=
lieved that those poems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were us=
ed to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructions were mea=
nt for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions came from so=
meone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how =
to get to the sea from there!
 
Slowly many new sets of instructions involv=
ing horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were out=
lined instead of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of=
 mantra/tantra/yantras].
 
One particular path through jungles was dangerou=
s [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, win=
e etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it=
 was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. T=
here were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritua=
l] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise=
 man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path a=
nd discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who we=
re strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.
 
A=
s time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was su=
perior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructi=
ons, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or=
 other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many follow=
ed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did=
 not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joi=
rneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructions fait=
hfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory=
 and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back an=
d gave updated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition=
.
 
*        *        *
 
In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief=
 summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes variou=
s aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered th=
e highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible way=
s to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actua=
l state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on=
 how to reach it. The path depends on one's current position!
 
Great men i=
n many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, exp=
erienced that state, understood the current state of people around them and=
 gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current sta=
te. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead =
kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.
 
Please re-read the s=
tory and try to understand what each part of the story represents. If you u=
nderstand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningless nature=
 of so many debates that people waste time with!
 
*        *        *
 
> =
2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned
> Tantrik p=
ractices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya
> Upasaka h=
imself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did
> Sri Adi Sankara =
condemn? 
 
He did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantr=
a like the use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.
 
However, please go back to my a=
nalogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if=
 it has a lot of wild animals and dacoits and many travellers through that =
path recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusa=
ble. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that pat=
h are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the pract=
ice.
 
If the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when sever=
al adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not =
condemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully=
!
 
The words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of=
 their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that=
 particular birth.
 
*        *        *
 
> 3. What is vamachara? if it is=
 the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,
> why must it be practiced at all?=

 
Suppose one's house is close to the market and the market noise reaches =
one's house. Suppose that noise is disturbing one's meditation, i.e. one is=
 unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one ca=
n take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate=
 there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and develop the abi=
lity to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and contro=
l over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturban=
ce. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is t=
he *inability* of one's mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling=
 one's mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of what is happeni=
ng outside.
 
Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a dece=
nt chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely pru=
dent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with app=
roach (2), it is great. It hastens one's progress.
 
*        *        *
 
=
Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing one's se=
lf-control by rising to the challenge.
 
Please realize that vaamaachaara/a=
ghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about=
 their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one's self=
-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is perfect and one's min=
d can always be focussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If o=
ne is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block =
self-realization.
 
However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from=
 vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a=
 really pure yogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with al=
l his mind even when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked w=
oman tightly embracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control a=
nd hone it. But, if that is going to tempt one, get the mind away from god =
and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as o=
ne who does not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate i=
n solitude and hone one's self-control, one who does not have a strong mind=
 to keep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices suc=
h as wine, meat and sex should stay away from those.
 
*        *        *
=
 
In my analogy before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger =
of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If =
one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and daco=
its tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-reali=
zation using this path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control.=
 If one takes this path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely t=
o fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.
 
If there is ANY weakness =
in one's self-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many=
 paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to se=
lf-realization. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one base=
d on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.
 
*        *        *
 
=
> Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 
 
:-) Sri Ambal (t=
he Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere=
! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own diff=
erent manifestations.
 
If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=
 sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keep=
s his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are al=
l different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.
 
As a matter of fact=
, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his =
desires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only=
. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains =
of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as wel=
l. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polari=
ties are actually Her manifestations only.
 
However, those who are more co=
mfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya=
 will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and re=
main in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* rea=
lity is that She is All.
 
I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that=
 put a few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yah=
oogroups or to me privately.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Sri Sri NarasimhaJI
  Namask=
arams. Hope you remember me. I am a friend of <deleted> of <deleted> temple=
, brother of <deleted>. We met a couple of years ago in <deleted> temple.

=
  I have a few doubts. I would like to hear your opinion on the same.

  1.=
 Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras (people e=
xplain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas, but classifie=
d under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?

  2. I read=
 from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned Tantrik practices. B=
ut I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sr=
i Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? 

  3.=
 What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc, why mu=
st it be practiced at all? Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all t=
hese? 

  I am a little (totally) confused. Hope your reply takes me out of=
 the well to ask you more questions

  Namaskarams
