Namaste Sir,

Thakur himself loved Chandi path and taught it to many of his=
 sishyas including Vivekananda. Of course, praying to Thakur is also good a=
s done by many Thakur devotees today. However, when Thakur was alive, he to=
ld his disciples mantras of various deities. He would give Kaali mantra to =
one, Krishna mantra to one, Raama to one, Shiva to one and so on, based on =
their previous conditioning. But Chandi path was one common thing most of h=
is direct disciples knew very well.

*        *        *

The experience yo=
u mentioned is very interesting. It shows what constant repetition of a man=
tra can do. I have seen some people with that kind of ability.

When I was =
doing meditation once, a priest came to my house. He was talking to other p=
eople in another room.When I came out of pooja room and joined them, he ask=
ed me if I was doing mantra of a specific deity. I was. It is a deity I usu=
ally do not meditate on. He just felt the vibrations relating to that deity=
 and asked me.

The same priest came to my house another time. I showed him=
 the place I was doing Chandi homam. However, before moving to that place, =
I was doing it in a different place. I had also done a lot of other sadhana=
 in that old place. Though that place was empty now and had no indications =
of any sadhana, he just walked to that place, stood there and said "there a=
re very good vibrations here." I told him that I was doing homam there prev=
iously and moved recently.

*        *        *

Such abilities are given b=
y nature to those whom nature wants to use for certain purposes. Those are =
useful for instilling faith in people. But those are neither necessary nor =
sufficient for self-realization, which should be the final goal of sadhana.=
 One should accept all abilities and experiences that nature gives, without=
 *wishing for* any specific ability or experience and without *running away=
* from anything. One should also not let anything that the nature gives to =
interfere with the final goal and become an obstruction. Something becomes =
an obstruction when one becomes attached to it and lets ego to increase.

*=
        *        *

We were talking about doing Chandipath fully vs skippin=
g some things like kavacha, argala and keelaka.

I know a young boy who exp=
erienced something special in his very first Chandi homam. He just did sapt=
ashloki (7 verses) instead of saptashati (700 verses) because he is small a=
nd uncomfortable with Sanskrit. After he finished the short Chandi homam ri=
tual with some guidance, we both sat down to meditate as the poornaahuti wa=
s burning. In the middle of my meditation, I felt a very powerful energy an=
d jolted out of my meditation by it. I looked at the boy to see what he was=
 doing. He was not meditating. His eyes were wide open and he was gazing ab=
ove the fire in amazement.

Later, after we wrapped up everything and were =
getting up, he told me what happened. He said he saw Vishnu's ten incarnati=
ons above the fire, with his naked eyes. He is a small boy and has no reaso=
n to make things up. Moreover, though I did not see anything with my eyes, =
I did perceive a powerful presence at the same time during my meditation. S=
o I can believe him.

Which specific mantras you read, whether you read eve=
rything or some things, whether your ritual is perfect or not are all secon=
dary to how pure and sincere your heart is and how complete your sense of s=
urrender is. Naturally, small children have a higher level of purity and si=
ncerity than we grownups and they can experience faster. Children are mostl=
y simple, while we grownups are complicated beasts of bloated egos.

*     =
   *        *

I want to mention another episode related that boy. Once I a=
sked him, "getting what thing will make you very happy right now? If Shiva =
appears in front of you right now and tells you to ask for a boon, what wil=
l you ask for?" He pondered for a few seconds and calmly replied, "there ar=
e some things that will make me very happy right now. But, if I get them no=
w, I may get bored of them later. Or they may break later. Or other things =
may come later that I like more. So I may not remain happy later. Instead, =
if I ask Shiva to change and fix my mind so that it is always happy with wh=
at I have, I can remain happy always."

In my view, that kid's vision of Vi=
shnu's ten incarnations over fire is less important than the above realizat=
ion. More than getting experiences, it is important to gain wisdom, clarity=
 of thinking and purity.

One child with well-developed muscles and nerves =
may still take longer to start walking. Another child with not-so-well-deve=
loped muscles and nerves may start walking earlier and even possibly damage=
 his legs.

What that small boy mentioned is very wise.

Best regards,
Nara=
simha

        Dear Sir,
        We are really enjoying this discussion. To exchan=
ge our ideas and experiences is really exciting sometime. There was a time =
when I was doing Gayatri Mantra constantly. Now I am doing only Thakur's Di=
xa mantra and after reading your articles I have again started Chandi Path =
daily. We really experience some sort of energy within us. 
        I will =
narrate one of my experiences. In 1976/77 I was reciting Chandi Path daily =
before Shri Thakur's Photo kept in the Pooja (worship)cupboard. I was closi=
ng that cupboard after worshipping. At that time I was living in a single r=
oom only as I was newly transferred from Dwarka to Ahmedabad. One day one l=
ady of 35 came to me to show her horoscope. She was Gujarati but was living=
 in USA. After some discussion on astrology she suddenly went to trance and=
 started saying me that "I hear Mantras of Chandi Path from that corner. I =
see some white blue rays are coming from that cupboard." I was surprised to=
 hear these words as my Pooja Cupboard was closed and she was not knowing t=
hat I was doing daily Chandi Path in that corner. She was also reading Aura=
s and said to me that 'I am seeing Purple and Blue coloured Aura coming fro=
m your body.'
        I asked her how you got this knowledge? She said that=
 she was chanting ' Om Gam Ganapataye Namah'  Mantra constantly from her ch=
ildhood. 
        This experience made my faith towards Chandi Path more st=
rong.

        Well, if you read it loud, others can hear you! That is not a bad t=
hing after all.

          In general, chanting in the mind without sound i=
s better.

          When doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended.=
 Even if there is some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that=
 is enough. That is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration =
of air). When you rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (=
sound) forms a connection between you and fire. You use that fire then to c=
reate powerful subtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can gener=
ate.

          When doing japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal c=
ords having any movement is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better tha=
t way. When relying on the internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound=
 is not needed and avoiding it can help focus the energy and generate stron=
ger subtle vibrations.

          *        *        *

          You were e=
arlier asking about skipping some things vs doing everything fully, in Chan=
dipath. An interesting experience happened in my daily Chandi homam in the =
very morning after I replied to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi morning. I=
 finished the homam and was about to offer poornaahuti. There are a few Ved=
ic mantras that I normally read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning ve=
ry bright. I closed my eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to=
 chant the mantras. But suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mothe=
r was standing in front of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It fel=
t very strongly like she was saying "enough with those mantras. They do not=
 matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti, NOW." I did not think much. I su=
rrendered fully to Her as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagina=
tion of a fool, but I surrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that =
time. I left the standard mantras and just said "om aim hreem kleem chaamun=
daayai vichche vaushat" and offered the dry coconut in fire with eyes close=
d still. With eyes closed still, I went into meditation immediately. I had =
a really nice meditation session.

                    1. The instruction was to spread h=
omam and create a community of sadhakas across the world who worship variou=
s deities in fire. It can be any deities.

                    2. The beaut=
y of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sense of discipline in one. Ev=
en 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting before or after.

        =
            Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moola mant=
ra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and devi sooktam are =
recommended after.

                    However, in my humble opinion, noth=
ing is really compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be very p=
owerful after a while. I see nothing wrong in it.

                    3. B=
oth are correct and work differently. However, those who try who pronounce =
the beeja mantras as "aing hreeng" invariably misponounce them. The "g" bec=
omes explicit. Ideally, you should start pronouncing as though you are goin=
g to say "aing" and abruptly stop just when you are about to say "g", witho=
ut saying it. It is not easy to pronounce this correctly.

                =
    Instead of trying "aing hreeng" and messing it up, it is better to just=
 say "aim hreem".

                    *        *        *

               =
     Internal purity and lack (or minimization) of individualized ego is th=
e key in any sadhana. Thousands of hours of sadhana without them is fruitle=
ss. One who is pure and has a very limited ego achieves results quickly.

 =
                   There is a lot of misinformation and unfounded fears tha=
t are spread regarding Chandi path. Do not worry about them.

             =
       Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desserts before and after =
a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion from it too. If the =
meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy it without appetizers or=
 dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and positively to get the most e=
nergy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read with a sense of surrender =
and limited ego.

                    Instead of doing everything with a lo=
wer focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focus.

                     =
         Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She a=
ppeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam,=
 to spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish =
did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that=
 time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should=
 teach a simple procedure to him.

                              I experime=
nted with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a=
 quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally=
 got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detai=
led manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as ma=
ny people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now!=
 I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far=
 as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for N=
arayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with him.=
 What a fortunate soul..

                              * * *

            =
                  It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me =
at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental=
 state would've been different while working on the manual. I would've been=
 more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was=
 to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and=
 also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up bei=
ng more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known t=
he full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and =
I would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself =
to teach homam to Narayan.

                              Manish told me th=
e full story only when I was better prepared to handle the information and,=
 of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.

=
                              * * *

                              A good g=
uru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc wit=
h the ego. I remember another incident.

                              One =
day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditati=
ng with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out =
of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only =
said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before sunrise and went on till =
9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath an=
d a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was ba=
sically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It wa=
s a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.=


                              I noticed on the next day that the previous=
 day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a ver=
y auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1=
000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it bef=
ore, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentione=
d this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew i=
t earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would've distra=
cted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Trite=
eya and that excitement would've changed the mental focus and brought more =
rajas into the sadhana."

                              He was absolutely r=
ight. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=
ught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =
I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride=
 and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =
further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=
gress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's wor=
ds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and th=
at he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!

                  =
            Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them wha=
t is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (=
or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out,=
 so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it t=
hrough conscious effort.

            =
                  I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata ch=
andi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a =
perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of on=
e of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would do s=
ome important work in this birth.

                              When I saw=
 Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became seri=
ous and said "Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already=
 strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha,=
 the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seek=
er' etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find Tr=
ue Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet ano=
ther new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well=
 be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above=
 all identities."

                              How true and wise!

      =
                        * * *

                              Just as a fat =
and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given =
by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over the s=
pirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master=
 may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must conscio=
usly try to restrain ego and increase detachment.

                        =
      Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points h=
e made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evol=
ution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like man=
y spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would sa=
y the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the=
 lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wi=
pes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) =
that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may b=
e too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..

                          =
    * * *

                              Homam and other spiritual sadhana =
tools are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change on=
e's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people,=
 this does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN ta=
ke a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path =
and not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walki=
ng without distractions will reach the goal.

                             =
 The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) an=
d the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. A=
fter a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to wor=
k together very effectively.

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I know a young boy who exp=
erienced something 
special in his very first Chandi homam. He just did sap=
tashloki (7 verses) 
instead of saptashati (700 verses) because he is small=
 and uncomfortable with 
Sanskrit. After he finished the short Chandi homam=
 ritual with some guidance, we 
both sat down to meditate as the poornaahut=
i was burning. In the middle of my 
meditation, I felt a very powerful ener=
gy and jolted out of my meditation by it. 
I looked at the boy to see what =
he was doing. He was not meditating. His eyes 
were wide open and he was ga=
zing above the fire in amazement.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Later, after we w=
rapped up everything and were 
getting up, he told me what happened. He sai=
d he saw Vishnu's ten incarnations 
above the fire, with his naked eyes. He=
 is a small boy and has no reason to make 
things up. Moreover, though I di=
d not see anything with my eyes, I did perceive 
a powerful presence at the=

him.</FONT></DIV>

Once I asked him, "getting what thing will make you =

Shiva appears in front of you right now and tells=
 you to ask for a boon, what 
will you ask for?" He pondered for a few seco=

may get bored of them later. Or the=
y may break later. Or other things may come 
later that I like more. So I m=
