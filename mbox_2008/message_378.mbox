Dear Sir
=C2=A0
That was another great chain of mails about brahmacharya. =
The paragraph you wrote about about pushing free will to the extreme is so =
true! 
=C2=A0
It reminds me of a personal incident. About=C2=A0two years ba=
ck, I had the chance coincidental meeting with a man, a yogi, and possibly =
the most spiritually advanced being I have met till date. 
Those days I was=
 furious trying to learn jyotish and apply it whereever i can for ever act =
I can. When I=C2=A0prostrated=C2=A0infront of =C2=A0him, he asked me a ques=
tion which I found very intriguing. He said, "what if you show you chart to=
 the greatest living astrologer on earth and he says, seeing the chart, tha=
t however hard you try you wont be able to make any significant spiritual p=
rogress, will you stop your puja-paath?"..
That question really confused me=
 then and it still does quite often. That is why that sentence of yours gav=
e me a clue to what the answer might be. Chart or no chart, I still have so=
me freewill, that is what I believe.
=C2=A0
Happy janmasthami!

Chastity and brahmacharya are *equally important* =
for men and women to make spiritual progress. But the level of difficulty o=
ne experiences in controlling the mind depends on various factors such as g=
ender and, more importantly,=C2=A0mental conditioning acquired from previou=
s lives.

=C2=
=A0
Well, two relevant points:
=C2=A0
(1) The astrology we know and underst=
and is imperfect without a doubt. Even knowledge taught unambiguously by Ma=
harshi Parasara is so misunderstood in this age. Then what to speak of know=
ledge not found in the available teachings of Parasara and available in the=
 "secrets" of various paramparas? It is quite prone to=C2=A0corruptions and=
 misunderstanding.=C2=A0Can we *rely* on it?
=C2=A0
(2) Astrology, even whe=
n understood perfectly, only predicts the predisposition at a given time du=
e to the dynamics of *previous* actions (karmas). The dynamics of previous =
actions decides under what kind of circumstances one has to operate now. Th=
ose circumstances can place *limitations* on what actions can be performed =
*now*. Depending on the seriousness of previous actions deciding the curren=
t circumstances, the limitations can be either mere challenges or serious h=
andicaps. But, in most cases, there are multiple actions possible currently=
. Horoscope only decides the situations faced now. The actions performed *n=
ow* are based on *free will* exerted now, which is NOT captured by the horo=
scope.
=C2=A0
If there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual pr=
ogress is definitely *the* thing. One should push one's free will to the ex=
treme when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth it! Forget somanatha=
 drekkana and other tenets of astrology. When the inspiration comes from wi=
thin, just boldly take a vow, pray to god and your guru (if you have no gur=
u, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish Pandit) and do your best to keep the vo=
w.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

=C2=A0
Even if one cannot keep brahmacharya, on=
e can still do spiritual practices like homam and japam. It will atleast ke=
ep one floating (i.e. not sinking). Basically, one will keep accumulating s=
hakti (purity) and keep consuming it. So purification is slow. But atleast =
there is no further impurification. With brahmacharya, one can actually sta=
rt accumulating shakti and purify oneself much faster.

=C2=A0
Regarding women doing sadhanas:
=C2=A0A great Vedic scholar kn=
own as Upasani maharaj lived at the time of Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 year=
s back. He was learned in several Vedas and Upanishads and did tremendous s=
adhana. Once he realized Self, he threw away his orthodoxy and went against=
 the customs of the time boldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untoucha=
bles colony), swept the floors there and forced the Brahmins from Brahmanaw=
ada (Brahmins colony) who revered him highly to come *there* if=C2=A0they w=
anted to see him! He opened a Vedic school for women and taught them chanti=
ng Vedic mantras and performing traditional yajnas. He gave women of all bi=
rths sacred thread and initiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.
=C2=A0=

When Shridi Sai Baba saw him oneday, he said "Upasani is God Himself. Toda=
y we will do pooja to Upasani!" and made his disciples do a pooja to Upasan=
i maharaj.
=C2=A0
A temple run by women stands in the place of Upasani maha=
raj, a few miles away from Shirdi. If anyone goes to Shirdi, it is a good i=
dea to go to that temple. Though it has no rush, it has very nice energy. I=
t is a great place to meditate.
=C2=A0
Also, Krishna temple at Alandi near =
Pune where Sant Jnaneshwar Maharaj went into underground samadhi 700 years =
back (believed to be there even now) has a tremendous level of spiritual en=
ergy. It is also a great place for productive meditation.
