Namaste,

The yahoogroup vedic-wisdom is strictly for spiritual discussions on the 
essence of Veda, Upanishad etc. I essentially created this group to capture 
my writings on spiritual matters whenever I get the mood to write. Others 
too are welcome to share their thoughts on spirituality.

I have been seeing some mails on astrology and astrology software here now 
and then. Please refrain from it. There are umpteen yahoogroups for 
discussing different aspects related to Vedic astrology and my free 
software. Please discuss on other groups.

For issues related to Vedic astrology software "Jagannatha Hora", jhora 
yahoogroup is the right place.

Best regards,
Narasimha
