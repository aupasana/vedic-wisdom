Dear Jitendra,

>there too much strenghth is given on Guru
>but somebody pl=
ease tell me what one should do
>if he doesn;t have a Guru

My opinion for =
the crucial question you asked - one need not worry, 
need not despair, nee=
d not feel dejected if one don't have Guru. one 
must not be in any hurry t=
o make Guru. one needs to commit one's 
self to spiritual Sadhana. sincerel=
y, dedicatedly. crux of the 
matter is to purify one's heart. to calm one's=
 mind. Chitta Shudhhi 
must be done. GURU will come to You when you are rea=
dy.

that is my conviction. When i am ready, my guru will come and even 
if=
 some physical entity as Guru never comes, i am not doomed.it 
won't stop m=
e from getting the realisation of the self. 

Best Regards,

Utpal
