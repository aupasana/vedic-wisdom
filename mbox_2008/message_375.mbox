Dear Tijana & other members,

YES..If we go by the words of 'realised great=
s', there is NO 
Alternative to Brahmacharya (mainly Sexual energy part of =

Brahmacharya).

Swami Vivekananda Says in Rajyoga that complete abstinence=
 from Sex 
is a must.

he also mentions in one of his books dedicated to 'W=
oman' that 
Marraiges are primarily a Facility provided to weak people.

I =
am convinced that Brahmacharya is a the penultimate goal for 
Spiritual peo=
ple. without that one will not progress much.

some time back i uploaded 'M=
anual of Brahacharya' in file section of 
Vedic-Wisdom group. It is written=
 by Swami Sivananda. It is worth 
reading. nay.. it is a MUST reading.

Bes=
t Regards,

Utpal

 Even if one cannot keep brahmacharya, one can still do spiritual 
practice=
s like homam and japam. It will atleast keep one floating 
(i.e. not sinkin=
g). Basically, one will keep accumulating shakti 
(purity) and keep consumi=
ng it. So purification is slow. But atleast 
there is no further impurifica=
tion. With brahmacharya, one can 
actually start accumulating shakti and pu=
rify oneself much faster.
