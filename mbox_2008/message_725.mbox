Dear Narasimaji and Narayanji
=C2=A0
Thanks to both of you once again. I sh=
all follow your advice sincerely. 
=C2=A0
Interestingly, after many days ag=
ain suddenly I could get in touch with the person who had given me the mant=
ra almost 3 years back. I was of course overjoyed. We had a very brief conv=
ersation. I told him about my homas and he gave me a lot of encouragement. =
Felt good.
=C2=A0
Thanks once again.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Narayan has already answered aptly.

It is ideal if the fire does not go off in the middle. But, if it does,=

I recommend =
doing homam without worrying about how well or badly it went and what resul=
ts it brought. Let me give an analogy.
=C2=A0
Think of your favorite deity =
as the master and yourself as a servant. A servant simply serves the master=
. Similarly, all the sadhana you do and your other activities are your way =
to serve your master.
=C2=A0
A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have m=
any big checks everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail o=
thers. Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank an=
d do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this world=
 and yet god needs human beings who execute god's agenda in this world. Tha=
t is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and various rishis keep co=
ming back to earth every now and then. The supreme god of this world operat=
es through various physical persons present on earth.
=C2=A0
We do homam an=
d other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try to help others, because=
 that is god's work. Just as a servant carries master's papers to the bank,=
 we do such work for god.
=C2=A0
Doing what is applauded by others as good =
work tends to promote ego and we need to guard against it. A servant carryi=
ng a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a s=
ervant carrying a $100 check to the bank and=C2=A0cashing it. Both are mere=
ly doing their master's work and do not own anything. Both are just *instru=
ments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, one who does =
what are considered great deeds in this world and one who does what are con=
sidered meagre deeds in this world are both servants of god helping god exe=
cute god's agenda in this world. Neither really owns anything. One may cons=
ider oneself superior to the other because his/her deeds are considered sup=
erior by the world, but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who consider=
s himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something less valua=
ble.
=C2=A0
If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one=
's attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what situations =
his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy and blissful in plea=
sure and pain, in praise and criticism and in=C2=A0light and darkness.
=C2=
=A0
Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job you=
 are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. You are d=
oing it for god.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Reading your r=
esponse another question came into my mind. You said:
=C2=A0
=C2=A0It is no=
t good if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.

Is it not=
 good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or the fact that the fire is=
 getting extinguished?
=C2=A0
I mean actyually i feel when someone starts d=
oing homa regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets extingu=
ished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple of times... i ser=
iously dont knbow what to make of it but as one member in this list had sug=

Namaste Phani,

> 1)Can Homam be performed on=
 the roof top of a house(3-floors) ? Can a homam
> kundam made by arranging=
 red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a
> copper one?

Yes, you ca=
n do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is actually better than doing it=
 in closed space. But realize that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbre=
lla around to protect the fire if it rains while you are doing homam. It is=
 not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.

Yes, y=
ou can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a sq=
uare shaped huma kunda.

> 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio=
 file, should one repeat the
> mantras mentally along with the audio?

One =
can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not casually). Actually, e=
ven listening to mantras with all the attention focused is as powerful as s=
aying mantras.

Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some =
mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus =
and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing fo=
r person X and yet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra me=
ans "one that protects the mind".. One can say a mantra or listen to a mant=
ra, to be protected. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind =
focused on the mantra.

However, there is a difference between meditation a=
nd homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is =
submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external =
sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just=
 listening. Try to repeat slowly.

> 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam=
? Any Other conditions/niyamas that
> should be followed apart from having =
vegeterain food?

Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) ha=
s been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.

One should =
follow the yamas and niyamas set by one's guru. Whatever rules one's guru s=
ets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only v=
egetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another ru=
le I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.=


By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for spiritua=
l progress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them to do it. Su=
ch a person can think of me or my guru as guru and perform homam. I am will=
ing to take on any karma incurred in the process until the person crosses s=
ome minimum threshhold of purity through homam and other spiritual practice=
s. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it d=
oes not matter after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purit=
y. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this u=
p and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.

As long as one desir=
es no specific material benefits (and ready to receive whatever god gives) =
and does homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to help, even if it mea=
ns some suffering for me.

> 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day=
 would be fine?

For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. =
But any day is fine really.

* * *

Mentioning rain and rooftop homam remin=
ded me of my India trip.

When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru M=
anish traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended=
 up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before=
 the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come o=
nly in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delh=
i in mid-May.. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were=
 in, to do a homam. Manish told me, "Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily=
 in this city after our homam finishes". I just smiled.

To my surprise, it=
 did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it s=
uddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small t=
owel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the=
 two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth co=
ver on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then =
packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, bu=
t we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In =
fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west =
of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in t=
hat place and prepared to move on.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Narasimhaji</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Reading your response another=
 question came into my mind. You said:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>&nb=
sp;It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.=
</EM><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain=
, or the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa regularly, th=
ere can be instances when the homa agni gets extinguished while the homa is=
 still on..happened with me couple of times... i seriously dont knbow what =
to make of it but as one member in this list had suggested to me,  i r=
elight the fire and keep continuing with the homa.</DIV>

<DIV>Namaste Phani,<BR><BR>> 1)Can Homam be perf=
ormed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ? Can a homam<BR>> kundam mad=
e by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a<BR>> copp=
er one?<BR><BR>Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is act=
ually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain can cau=
se problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it rains while =
you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the =
middle of a homam.<BR><BR>Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks =
and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.<BR><BR>> 2)While=
 performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the<BR>&g=
t; mantras mentally along with the audio?<BR><BR>One can repeat mentally wh=
ile listening attentively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantr=
as with all the attention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.<BR><BR>=
Suppose person X
 is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter =
in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of=
 the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and =
yet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra means "one that p=
rotects the mind"... One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be prot=
ected. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the=
 mantra.<BR><BR>However, there is a difference between meditation and homam=
. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitte=
d in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (e=
ven if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listeni=
ng. Try to repeat slowly.<BR><BR>> 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homa=
m? Any Other conditions/niyamas that<BR>> should be followed apart from =
having vegeterain food?<BR><BR>Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread=
 ceremony)
 has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant=
.<BR><BR>One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one's guru. Whateve=
r rules one's guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, o=
ne should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath befo=
re homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2=
 hours before homam.<BR><BR>By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=
s to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility a=
nd allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru an=
d perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process =
until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam an=
d other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropades=
a or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the person cro=
sses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa =
by
 guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold of pu=
rity.<BR><BR>As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and read=
y to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I a=
m willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.<BR><BR>> 4)An=
y good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?<BR><BR>For Mahaga=
napathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.=
<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my In=
dia trip.<BR><BR>When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish tra=
veled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended up doing=
 homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip=
, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in Ju=
ne/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-=
May... We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were in,
 to=
 do a homam. Manish told me, "Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in thi=
s city after our homam finishes". I just smiled.<BR><BR>To my surprise, it =
did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it su=
ddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small to=
wel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the =
two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cov=
er on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then p=
acked everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but=
 we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In f=
act, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west o=
f India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in th=
at place and prepared to move on.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>----=
