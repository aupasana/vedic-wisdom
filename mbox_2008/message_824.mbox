Dear Sir Narsimhaji,

There are two thinking for Chandipath chanting.

1. =
Every verse in Chandipath is a mantra and reading of Chandipath in
Sanskrit=
 is more meaningful to please Goddess and to get desired
results. It is cre=
ated in Sanskrit and whether we may follow the meaning
of the verses or not=
, we should read in Sanskrit only if we can read
Sanskrit fluently because =
every Verse has its vibrations with full of
energy.

2. If we read in Sansk=
rit, we never involve ourselves in the 'Lila' of
Durga nor we enjoy the sto=
ry of Janma(Birth) of different Shakties
narrated in Chandipath  (This is o=
nly possible for those who are
scholars in Sanskrit and can translate each =
and every verse immediately
while reading. For others it is simply reading =
with faith and
devotion.)- Better way is, it should be read in regional lan=
guage with
full involvement in the 'Lila'. Here we can enjoy the different =
roles of
Shaktis, fully understand the differnet Births etc. This type of r=
eading
makes Chandipath more meaningful.

Dear Sir, I request your advice a=
s what is the real way of chanting Sri
Chandipath from these two?

Dr. Ashw=
in Rawal
