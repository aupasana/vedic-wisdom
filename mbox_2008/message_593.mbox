Dear Utpal,

Mahaganapathi homam is usually done with multiple mantras. At the very 
least, the veda mantra (ganaanaam tvaa) and beeja mantra (om sreem hreem 
kleem) are done. If you really want to do only one mantra, that is fine I 
suppose.

You can look at it this way: When you do other homas, you first call Ganesha 
and offer his mantra and then do the main deity. When you do a homam for 
Ganesha himself, you do not do that.

It is a good idea to do a small count of the two mantras atleast. After 
doing them for a small count, the focus can be either atharva seersham or 
beeja mantra or veda mantra.

Ganesha is the lord of Mooladhara chakra, the earthy plane of consciousness. 
Doing different mantras for Ganesha takes care of various aspects of it.

Again, if you want to do only one specific mantra, that is perfectly fine.

Never worry about "irritating".

Best regards,
Narasimha
