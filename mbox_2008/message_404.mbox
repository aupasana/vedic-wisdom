Namaste,
 
I just came back from my daily Chandi homam. Probably because th=
is is a Chaturdasi, that too a Saturday night, the homam was more pleasant =
than usual. I cannot sleep after this one right away and so let me type one=
 more mail.
 
*        *        *
 
If one is an aghori who does not care a=
bout anything and is willing to go through any terrible experience and stil=
l take it as Her blessing, then several things can go into fire. But others=
 should never put red chillies in homam fire. Those who throw red chillies =
in fire and think that their petty problems will go away are fooling themse=
lves. Whatever you put in external fire is actually going into your interna=
l fire also. People having awakened shakti and subtle perception may realiz=
e it and others may not realize it. But it is a fact. Now the impact of red=
 chillies on your internal fire is not at all a desirable one. One may not =
be realizing it because the karma may be going at the end of a long pipelin=
e of karmas and give its result in far future, possibly even in a future li=
fe.
 
My sincere advice to all: Never ever put spicy substances like red ch=
illies and black pepper in a homam fire, even if you are worshipping a fier=
ce deity. Respectfully ignore advice from anyone to use black pepper and re=
d chillies to solve your problems. That practice does NOT solve any problem=
s and in fact creates further problems in future.
 
*        *        *
 
B=
y the way, Pratyangira is not a ""bali kavar Deivam" (deity wanting animal =
sacrifice). It is what people of this age made her to be. Pratyangira, as I=
 described earlier, is a powerful deity who can fill one with pure sattwa. =
Unfortunately, she is misunderstood and her mantras and vidya are so abused=
 and misused these days. That is why I felt compelled to write the last mai=
l. The allegory is actually quite appropriate.
 
I did not write the mail t=
o criticize Pratyangira sadhana. I wrote the mail and the allegory to criti=
cize Pratyangira sadhana *as done* by many people today and to put things i=
n perspective. People don't even understand what Pratyangira is for and wha=
t she can do.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding balis (animal sacrifices), =
I want to say one thing. In the old days, yogis who sacrificed animals were=
 capable of taking some karmas of the animal being sacrificed and give it m=
oksha or atleast a much higher birth after the sacrifice. In other words, t=
here was a give and take of karmas. Now-a-days, those who sacrifice animals=
 have no such spiritual caliber. They are only taking the life of the anima=
l (bodily life which is something very dear to every being that self-identi=
fies with a body very strongly, i.e. animals and human beings) and not givi=
ng anything in return. This causes a big karmik debt that needs to be paid =
back later. Thus, one should think seriously before sacrificing an animal i=
n this age.
 
Some places have sthala maahaatmya. The power of the place, t=
he power of the sadhana performed by elevated beings there and the power of=
 an alive deity there ensure that karmas are balanced even when animals are=
 sacrificed. Such places are few. An example may be Kamakhya.
 
At other pl=
aces, a yogi with no caliber to take on the animal's karmas and give it a h=
igher birth should stay away from animal sacrifice.
 
*        *        *
 =

If you read Saptashati, the last chapter describes how the king and the va=
isya kept chanting devi sooktam for 3 years on a river bank. It talks about=
 the "bali" (sacrifice) they gave:
 
"dadatustau balim chaiva nijagaatraasr=
ugukshitam"
 
It means "and they gave a sacrifice (bali) that was soaked wi=
th blood from *their own* bodies".
 
See, *that* would be something.
 
Best=
 regards,
Narasimha

        Dear  Sri. P.V.R.N.Acharyaji,
        Namaskaram
  =
      Very well said. Now a days people seek quick solutions leaving aside =
the golden path of daily Sadhana. The result is that many temples particula=
rly in Tamil Nadu with archaelogical importance are allowed to remain in ru=
ins and people pour several lakhs in building new temples for Devatas like =
Pratyingira, Sarabeswara etc. and publish widely homams to propitiate these=
 deities. As you have rightly said these deities occupy a special place.  I=
n fact, the greatest of Devi Upasaka Sri Abirami Bhattar of Tirukadaiyur of=
 Abirami Andhadhi firm laments in his Andhadhi (meaning each stanza beginin=
g with the end of previous stanza's last word) that he shall not leaving th=
e lotus feet of Sakthi, waste his efforts after "bali kavar Deivangal" ( wh=
o demand some weird occult sacrifice).  That sums of what you have beautifu=
lly and tellingly exposed in your letter.  Some Vaishnavite Scholars like V=
elukudi Krishnan Swamiji in his discourses decry such practices. Whatever b=
e the purana behind Pratyingira, it is not ordined for the general mass to =
go after such devatas leaving the Bhagawath Githa saying "patram pushpam Yo=
 me bhaktya" offers to Lord Narayana.  It is not my aim to decry such pract=
ices.  But when an easy path is shown in our scriptures, why invoke special=
 deities purely for personal aggrandisement and mundane objects.  In a famo=
us place as Tirunageswara near Kumbakonam known from yore the Great Nageswa=
ra Temple known for its Raghu Sthala and Uppiliappan Temple (Oppilathaappan=
 Temple=3D Purushothama=3DSri Venkatachapathi), a small Pratyingira temple =
in its outskirts has shot into prominence where it is alleged a woman ex ch=
ief Minister of Tamil Nadu was reported to have performed homam with chilli=
es on an amavasya day to gain political ascension and the priest therein ha=
s reportedly gained lot of prominence sporting toyoto van etc.  More people=
 flock to that place nowadays having their individual person specific agend=
a. In this scenario, you have pointed out the obvious. Many thanks for this=
 service
        J.R.Krishnan
