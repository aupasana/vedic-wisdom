Namaste,

allucination...!
 
Absolutely.

akur as he is alive for me today.
 
That is the correct thing to do. When T=
hakur gave you tangible indications of his presence and blessings, there is=
 no reason to believe in somebody else.
 
Even if Thakur is reborn as someo=
ne else, you can stick to Thakur. In fact, if Thakur really wants you to ge=
t in touch with him in his newer form, he will probably show you a pramaana=
.
 
When Lord Rama came back to earth as Lord Krishna, the great bear Jamba=
vantha did not know it. He continued to worship Rama. Krishna came to him, =
fought a battle with him and then revealed his true nature as Rama's new bi=
rth. Until that happened, Jambavanta was right to continue worshipping Rama=
. In fact, he would be correct to worship Rama even after Krishna revealed =
his true nature!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Sir, I have read that chapter. I have always fai=
th on such great souls. But the problem and confusion is I have read 3 auto=
biographies, including Shri Ram Sharmaji wherein it is mentioned that the a=
uthors were  Thakur himself in their previous birth. Two were from Gujarat.=
 One was Swami yogeshwarji who lived his life in Himalayas and other was Mr=
. Nathalal from Gondal, Saurashtra, Gujarat. I have met all these three. Al=
l were on very high state of mind and living spiritual life. It is beyond o=
ur capacity to judge what is right and what is hallucination...!  As Mr. Na=
rsimhaji told I believe only Thakur as he is alive for me today.

          Respected Ashwinji
          This is a very good and inspirin=
g thread. 
          I would like to mention something that may be an inter=
esting insight.
          You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. He actua=
lly said in his
          autobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My In=
heritances and Will,
          loosely translated) that once when he was 14=
 years old and sitting for
          his Morning Sandhya, a divine figure a=
ppeared, guru
          Sarweshwaranandji. His Guru then made him realise h=
is past lives and
          gave him the work for this life.
          He t=
ook him back as in a flash to the past. He realised that he had
          b=
een born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before that Guru of
       =
   Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.

          I will try to locate the ex=
act link and send it.The general site is
          www.awgp.org I remember =
the book is there on pdf in English somewhere
          online. It's in the=
 very first few chapters.

          Thanks
          Shiv

henever I was meeting him he was always talking about
          shri Thakur=
