Re: Great Time for Pitri Tarpana 


Dear friends,
Namaskar to all!

The rea=
l Pitrapaksha/Shradha-paksha ended actually on August 30,
2008, which was t=
he actual Pitra-Amavasya! The real Sharadiya 
Navratras started on August 3=
1, 2008 and ended on September 9, 2008.

Dipavali, the festival of lights, =
is actually on Sunday, September
28, 2008, when all the Hindus will be "cel=
ebrating (sic!)"
Pitramavasya!

We have actually lost our cultural moorings=
 just becasue of the fraud
known as "Vedic astrology" according to which Ut=
tarayana is not the
shortest day of the year (December 21/22) but some othe=
r day---
January 15---as that is the date "advocated" by "almighty" N. C.
L=
ahiri and Lahiriwalas. All our festivals and muhurtas have become
topsy tur=
vy because of "Vedic astrology" and "Vedic astrologers".
This will be clear=
 from a list of correct dates of festivals being
uploaded in the files sect=
ion under the heading "08-09.pdf".
For any further clarifications, pl. join=

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HinduCalendar
Do wake up to this fraud that =
is being played on the entire Hindu
community!
With regards,
Avtar Krishen =
Kaul
