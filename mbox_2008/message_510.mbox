Hare Rama Krsna
=C2=A0
Sri Narasimha garu,
Namaskar.
Deep gratitude to have=
 reassured me/us. I had started the Navaratri Puja of The Mother with Kalas=
am. As I have not been initiated into the pooja vidhanam and only had the f=
ortune of witnessing the ritualistic pooja done by my mother-in-law accordi=
ng to Sri sooktam. Unfortunately I was not a great fan of rituals then. I l=
ive abroad and downloaded the pooja vidhanam according to sri sooktam and s=
tarted my pooja. I found that it was pertaining to Durga and the shodasopac=
hara pooja and the pranapratishta. The Devi Kavacham and the Sapta sloki ar=
e also included. When I started the pooja I wondered if I could chant and p=
erform the pooja as it was a part of Saptashati. My father-in-law advised m=
e not to do it as I was not initiated. But having started and I also strong=
ly believe that Mother would not 'harm' her child=C2=A0 I have continued wi=
th Her Grace. I have always wanted to do SaptaShati parayanam during the sa=
rannaNavaratras. How can I correct my swara? As I
 am not very familiar wit=
h Sanskrit and afraid of not doing it properly, is there a way? Have you a =
recorded version of the Chandipath (by you) on your website sir?

nks and regards

Namaste,
=C2=A0
There are 11 days instead of=
 10 from Pratipada to Vijaya Dasami this time. If you look at the nights be=
fore Vijaya Dasami, then there are ten nights instead of nine this year. Th=
is happens sometimes.
=C2=A0
If you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi c=
omes twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursd=
ay and extended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was=
 on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (=
Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).
=C2=A0
If one's parents did not do =
a proper "anna praasana" ritual (the ritual of first feeding of solid food =
to a baby) to one, should one consider oneself not entitled to eat any soli=
d food? Not doing a mantra because of no initiation is basically like that.=

=C2=A0
Getting initiation is good, especially if the one initiating has so=
me level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessary nor suffici=
ent for making progress in your own sadhana.
=C2=A0
If you see my homam doc=
ument, I gave an analogy for this. A millionaire may open a bank account in=
 his son's name with a starting balance of a million dollars. This is akin =
to a good guru initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by gettin=
g some of guru's attainment. But the son may waste those million dollars an=
d end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not achieve anythi=
ng. Another person may not have anyone to give money and may start off with=
 a zero bank balance but accumulate millions of dollars with own effort. Th=
is is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana with a mantra without guru and at=
taining some level in the mantra.
=C2=A0
Some people hold the view that man=
tras cannot be chanted without a proper "initiation" . This view is especia=
lly prevalent in some sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I=
 disagree with that view.
=C2=A0
If you know the mantra (!), just chant it.=
 What would an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would've given=
 some of his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself =
if you work hard. Or a guru would've taught you the right nyasas to be done=
 before the mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreover, =
what most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no meanin=
g. Nyasa literally means placement. You place various sounds in various bod=
y parts (like the tips of various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). P=
eople merely act out some signals while saying the sounds. This "placement"=
 is actually supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal environ=
ment for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is sup=
posed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds end up not =
getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what I am trying to sa=
y is that most people do
 not know how to "place" various "sounds" in vario=
us body parts. They merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if =
you do not know nyasas, you are not really missing much compared to others =
who were initiated.
=C2=A0
In my humble opinion, the most important qualifi=
cation is to have devotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have them,=
 you can consider yourself "highly initiated".
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasim=

Dear Narasimha,

When does Navratri end? I=
t started on last Monday, September 29, 2008 and should therefore end on Tu=
esday, October 7, 2008 (Nine Nights)...yet the panchang shows that at sunri=
se on Wednesday, October 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue our Na=
vratri on Wednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day? (All th=
ese times are based on US EST)..

Also, can anyone do the Navarna mantra, "=
Om Aim Hrim Klim Chamundayai Vicche" or does this require initiation?

Than=
ks,
Chandraprakash
