Namaste,

may i ask why you felt that it is a blind leading blind?

There a=
re many ways to fight desires, especially Lust for *Sambhog*

what you sugg=
ested can be ONE of the many ways and infact everybody 
in their heart of h=
earts knows. how much powerful it is. it is like 
tsunami which has a capab=
ility to sweep off the feat, even the 
Saints if they are not vigilant.

Sh=
ivananada says in his manual of Brahmacharya that it requires to 
attack th=
e lust from all sides to really overcome and destroy.

If some one needs to=
 keepup Brahmacharya, some practical tips are-

- Cold water Bath
- No Onio=
n, Garlic in food. avoiding very spicy and very Hot food.
- avoiding over e=
ating at night. (Stomach should not be full)
- Mditation, Pranaayaam, Japa,=
 Homam or such Saadhanas
- Shirsaasan, Sarvaangaasan
- Prohibition of seein=
g TV Channels and Movies
- Thinking mentally that all women are Sisters/Mot=
hers

Above all, Prayers to the Ishta Devata. unceasing prayer is the key. =

without Grace of the Lord, it is impossible to uproot the Desire 
complete=
ly.

efforts, efforts and efforts.... prayers, prayers and prayers...cry 
a=
nd then one will start winning over the most draded of enemies.

Vivekanand=
a said "The Character is establised through thousand 
stumbles" - no need t=
o lose heart.

warm regards,

utpal
