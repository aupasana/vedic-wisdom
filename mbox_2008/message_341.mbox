Namaste friends,
 
Now three detailed pitri tarpana manuals are available o=
n the internet. They are appropriate even for a novice and explain clearly =
the details of pitri tarpana. The mantras are simple, the materials needed =
are few and it does not take too long.
 
Homam (fire ritual) and pitri tarp=
anas (water ritual) are two of the most important rituals of Hinduism and w=
orth performing regularly. They cleanse a person, remove various obstacles =
in material and spiritual lives and speed up spiritual evolution. An aspira=
nt desiring spiritual progress should take advantage of them regularly. Mor=
e about the philosophy of pitri tarpana is explained below, where I reprodu=
ced an extract from the manual.
 
Please download the manuals from
 
http:/=
/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana
 
There are three manuals - one with the r=
egular procedure (taking 30-45 min), one with a short procedure (taking 12-=
20 min) and one with a super-short procedure (taking 5-8 min).
 
Please fee=
l free to pass this word around to interested people. I hope this informati=
on reaches with Her blessings as many interested souls as possible.
 
By th=
e way, there is an important solar eclipse in a few hours. It is a great ti=
me to perform pitri tarpanas. Actually, it is a great time to perform many =
spiritual sadhanas.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

External rituals are meant to create the=
 internal visualization needed to affect desirable internal changes in the =
long run. For example, one offers a full coconut into fire as poornaahuti (=
complete offering) at the end of a homam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of=
 surrendering one's head or ego (sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in =
the fire of wisdom and becoming free from ego. As one keeps engaging in thi=
s act again and again, the visualization becomes stronger and stronger and =
ego is slowly reduced.


One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. Tarpa=
na means "satisfying" or "satiating". One acknowledges the debt one has to =
devas (gods), rishis (sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to sati=
sfy them using this ritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homam, pi=
tris are invoked in water in this ritual, then held in the palm and release=
d in a specific way conducive to freeing them.


One owes a lot to one's pa=
rents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, one owes all of one's gene=
tic characteristics to one's parents and ancestors. Each ancestor is actual=
ly present in the person as a genetic characteristic. In karmik terms, one =
inherits some karmas of one's parents and ancestors and each ancestor is ac=
tually present in the person as a kaarmik predisposition. The latter approa=
ch obviously extends to multiple lives and some karmik predisposition is in=
herited from the ancestors from a past life too, though they may not be rel=
ated to one in this life.


By thinking of the deceased ancestors with grat=
itude and trying to give them an emancipation, one is actually trying to fr=
ee oneself from various kaarmic predispositions that one has as a result of=
 the rina (karmik debt) with several people. One can view this as an extern=
al event of satisfying and emancipating an external entity (a pitri). Alter=
nately, one can view this as an internal event of satisfying and releasing =
an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, =
one needs to externalize first and perform external rituals, while thinking=
 of what it means internally. This builds up one's visualization and slowly=
 brings about internal changes and eventually the desired internal change i=
tself.


Two external spiritual sadhanas are particularly powerful, useful =
and recommended for every person desirous of fast spiritual progress:



  =
1.. Homam (fire ritual): Gods are invoked in fire and satisfied with offeri=
ngs with mantras. Please see the homam website at http://www.VedicAstrologe=
r.org/homam for more. In the long run, a regular practice of this ritual in=
creases the subtle fire burning inside one's subtle body, burns various imp=
ediments to spiritual progress and gives clarity, focus and stability to th=
e mind.


  b.. Tarpana (water ritual): Gods, sages and manes are invoked i=
n water and satisfied with emancipation given to them. In the long run, a r=
egular practice of this ritual increases the release of various kaarmik pre=
dispositions and weaknesses that are blocking one's spiritual and material =
progress.


This document describes the procedure of pitri tarpana with the=
 relevant mantras using a simple approach. This document is the regular pro=
cedure. There are also documents giving a short procedure and a super-short=
 procedure for the benefit of those with time constraints or problem with S=
anskrita language. Download them from http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpan=
a.
