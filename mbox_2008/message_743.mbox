Dear Narsimhaji
1.Since=C2=A0I have joined this group before some couple of=
 months, some previous mails I have not read. You have mentioned somewhere =
that Manishji was inspired from Mother to start Homam daily. I would like t=
o know whether it was for Maha Ganapati Homam too or only Chandi Homam?,
2.=
Please also guide me whether really we should read Chandi Path or Sapta Sat=
i Stotra with Devi Kavacha, Argala, Kilak and Ratri Suktam=C2=A0before 13 A=
dhyayas and Devi Sukta, etc in the end ? Suppose we recite only 13 Adhyayas=
 only after Sankalpam-will it not be sufficient in daily routine worship? O=
r it is compulsory?
3. Can you guide me the proper uttering of Beej Mantras=
 in Navarna Mantra? some say it is Aing, Hring, Kling.... and some say it i=
s Aim, Hrim, Klim......
Thanks with respect.
Dr.Ashwin Rawal

Namaste friends,

Excellent and inspirational writeup Narayan!

* * *

E=
arlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She appeared in=
 front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread=
 the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish did not re=
veal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was =
that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a s=
imple procedure to him.

I experimented with homam, started doing occasiona=
lly and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing i=
t daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - teachin=
g Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsigh=
t, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are abl=
e to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefited =
(and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started =
for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people=
 across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..

* * *

It was =
probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what =
the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would've been diff=
erent while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic and also h=
urried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took=
 my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down witho=
ut many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I re=
ally benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would h=
ave had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made=
 the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan=
.

Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle =
the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as =
asked by him then.

* * *

A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary i=
nformation that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.
=

One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day med=
itating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came=
 out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he =
only said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before sunrise and went on =
till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for ba=
th and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I w=
as basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =
It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the=
 day.

I noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya=
 (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious day and it i=
s believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful t=
han on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect d=
ay for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with exc=
itement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I d=
id not tell you because knowing it would've distracted you. You would have =
been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement w=
ould've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana."
=

He was absolutely right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. T=
he ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. =
If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've=
 increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saatt=
wik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one=
 makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After =
hearing Manish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still aliv=
e and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!=


Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is usefu=
l rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone=
 else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that t=
hey can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through con=
scious effort.

* * *

I remember one more similar incident. Before the sha=
ta chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddh=
a (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name =
of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would=
 do some important work in this birth.

When I saw Manish later that day, I=
 mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said "Narasimha, =
do you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity=
 of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasi=
mha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take gre=
at effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that chall=
enge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed=
 your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is no=
t useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities."

How tr=
ue and wise!

* * *

Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and w=
eak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sens=
e of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the ene=
rgy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean=
 dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase de=
tachment.

Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple poi=
nts he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual=
 evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, lik=
e many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He wou=
ld say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust o=
n the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/S=
he wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (=
ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we =
may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..

* * *

Homam and othe=
r spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to intr=
ospect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pi=
ll. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or mont=
h or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start =
walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance left.=
 One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.

The point=
 I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the inte=
rnal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a whi=
le, there will be synergy between them and they will start to work together=
 very effectively.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Excellent and i=
nspirational writeup Narayan!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Earlier, I mentioned the =
Mother's instruction to Manish when She appeared in front of him at the tem=
ple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread the practice of regular=
 homam around the world. However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me=
 until much later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really need=
ed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.<=
BR><BR>I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. =
I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few =
months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose=
 to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the corr=
ect choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam usin=
g the manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit)=
. However, as far as my
 mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When=
 it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world=
 started with him. What a fortunate soul..<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>It was proba=
bly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=
other asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would've been different=
 while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic and also hurrie=
d more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=
weet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=
ny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =
benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=
ad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =
same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.<BR>=
<BR>Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle=
 the information
 and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual a=
s asked by him then.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>A good guru protects a sishya from=
 unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember anot=
her incident.<BR><BR>One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to s=
pend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. =
The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. Whe=
n I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before =
sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min =
break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for anoth=
er bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating w=
ith Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice sta=
te at the end of the day.<BR><BR>I noticed on the next day that the previou=
s day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a ve=
ry
 auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is=
 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it b=
efore, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentio=
ned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew=
 it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would've dist=
racted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Tri=
teeya and that excitement would've changed the mental focus and brought mor=
e rajas into the sadhana."<BR><BR>He was absolutely right. As such, I was "=
proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited=
 the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadha=
na on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and excitement, broug=
ht in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very=
 dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can
 suddenl=
y return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's words, I introspected an=
d found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to=
 feed it with more delicious food!<BR><BR>Lucky are those who have a guru w=
ho can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Luc=
ky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of t=
heir problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through further=
 introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>=
I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in earl=
y 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced=
 soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshi=
s and said that I very close to him and that I would do some important work=
 in this birth.<BR><BR>When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this t=
o him. He immediately became serious and said "Narasimha, do
 you need one =
more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, =
the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the enginee=
r', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take great effort to ove=
rcome those identities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not suff=
icient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed your ego furthe=
r? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for you=
r progress. You have to rise above all identities."<BR><BR>How true and wis=
e!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and=
 weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the se=
nse of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the e=
nergy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the le=
an dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase =
detachment.<BR><BR>Manish has a unique way of looking
 at things and some s=
imple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my =
spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra t=
o me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my hear=
t. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped t=
he dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru d=
oes. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on th=
e glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Somet=
imes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..<BR><BR>* * *<=
BR><BR>Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one sh=
ould also try to introspect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis.=
 There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single =
moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicat=
ed, one should start walking on the path and
 not worry about the progress =
and the distance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reac=
h the goal.<BR><BR>The point I want to emphasize is that the external ritua=
ls (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should =
go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them and they=
 will start to work together very effectively.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Nara=
