Dear Chandraprakash,
 
You ask a very poignant question. I will share my th=
oughts.
 
The goodness of milk is not just a religious belief. It is a fact=
 you can verify for yourself.
 
Physically speaking, milk is a great source=
 of protein that is easy to digest. A diet comprising only of fruits and mi=
lk gives all the nutrition needed by one and keeps one very calm and relaxe=
d. Normal food 
 
Fruits and milk are a very saattwik food. The plant givin=
g fruits may feel some pain because of wind and other weather factors. Even=
 when the fruit is cut off, the planet may feel pain. Still, the emotions o=
f a plant are far more subtle than those of a human being. The gunas that g=
et into the fruits from the plant are far subtler than the gunas that get i=
nto food cooked by a human being. The emotions of a cow are denser than a p=
lant's, but subtler than a human being's.
 
Milk given by a humanely treate=
d cow is definitely superior, but even otherwise milk is superior to a lot =
of substances.
 
Pain and suffering from inhumane treatment is one thing an=
d what they feed is another. A being with a subtle mind can tolerate pain m=
ore than others and the mind reacts to pain differently. But the food goes =
the core of one's being. We are what we eat. Wrong food affects the mind of=
 a being and changes the nature of the mind itself. The milk given by a nor=
mal cow embodies its motherly love and compassion and fills the drinker wit=
h such qualities. But milk given by a cow treated with hormones is differen=
t. These days they feed cows with hormones, chicken and other meat also. Al=
l these slowly change the basic nature of cow's mind. If milk from cows not=
 treated with hormones and not fed chicken is used, that will be a lot bett=
er.
 
If you have a chance to pay more and buy milk from a local farm where=
 cows are not treated with hormones and chicken and treated humanely, it is=
 a good idea to use that milk in religious activities as well as own use.
 =

If a temple can afford it, keeping some cows and getting milk from them is=
 a good idea. This happens at a lot of big temples in India anyway.
 
One b=
ottomline is that everything is slowly more and more corrupted in Kali yuga=
. Even fruits are laced with artificial chemicals and pesticides. Even milk=
 in western countries contains chicken fat and hormones. All food contains =
heavy and dangerous chemicals. More and more, we shun copper and other meta=
l containers and use plastic, thermocoal and other dangerous materials to s=
tore food and heat food (and end up consuming small quantities of those mat=
erials). We use microwave radiation to heat food. The food and drinks going=
 into us contain gradually more dangerous chemicals that slowly dull the mi=
nd. What can we do? Kali will get denser and denser. We can put brakes now =
and then and slow it down, but we cannot stop it.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=

  Dear Narasimha,

  Tha=
nks to you and Ajit for the clarifications. I had sent an e-mail yesterday =
about a related topic yesterday but it has not been posted as yet, so I am =
resending it.

  As I was watching the Shiva Abhishekam at the temple with =
milk, curd, ghee etc. an issue came up and I would appreciate your opinion/=
thoughts on it.

  Use of dairy products (milk, curd, ghee) is extolled in =
our tradition and is encouraged as part of a saatwik lifestyle. However, in=
 this Kali yuga, the reality is that the cows that provide these dairy prod=
ucts for our consumption and use in religious rituals, suffer terribly thro=
ughout their life and meet a painful end. This is specially true in large d=
airy operations in America but I suspect it would be true elsewhere too.

 =
 So, how do you reconcile the religious beliefs/doctrine and the reality of=
 today's life, with respect to using diary products.

  I am providing a li=
nk to a website that was sent to me by a friend. Note: The documentaries on=
 the website, specially "Earthlings" are quite graphic and may not be for e=
veryone but they do depict a reality that is going on these days.

  As Ajit Krishnan has clarified correctly, Maha Shivaratri is to be obse=

  Some temples in USA are observing it on Thursday night, but there ARE=
 some temples that are observing it correctly on Wednesday.

  Happy Maha S=
