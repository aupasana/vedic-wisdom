Rajashri Bahen,

I have put forth what came in my knowledge. at this point =
i neither 
belive nor disbelive Shri Yogeshwarji's revealation.

The Astrol=
ogers working on Previous birth connections might get some 
useful informat=
ion with that.

but one thing must be said here is that the Unfathomable, a=
re the 
ways of higher consious planes. one can not say with firmness that =

it is not possible for a saint to come as a completely different 
personal=
ity to serve the people. even a Begger on the roadside with 
completely dis=
agrreable ways & looks by todays standard might 
turnout to be a great sain=
t and one may find another great saint, 
working for society, among all the=
 luxuries & media gaze and also 
getting critisized by many.  

There is a =
Poem of Shri Narsinha Mehta which goes like this "Hari na 
Jan to Mukti Nav=
 Mage..." means that the Bhaktas don't ask for 
Liberation but they want to=
 be born again and again for helping the 
masses.

thanks for your honest v=
iews. I probably won't write anything 
argumentative further in this connec=
tion. 


Regards,
Utpal

regards,

Utpal
