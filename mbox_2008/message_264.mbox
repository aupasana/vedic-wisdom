Vyam Vyasa Devaya Namah

Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for your wonderful post=
s on spirituality. They are very inspiring .And happy Shree Rama Navami to =
you too!

Can you explain something about the Veda Murtis? (Hanu Mukha =3D =
Atharva Veda, Haya Mukha =3D Yajur Veda, Aja Mukha =3D Sama Veda, Go Mukha =
=3D Rig Veda, Gaja Mukha =3D all Vedas.)
I enjoy chanting their mantras lik=
e " Hanu Mukha Siddhi Rastu" but would like to understand more about the or=
igins of the Veda Murtis. Since Brahma spoke the Vedas from his Four Faces,=
 it seems that they must be related to Him.

Thanks for any light that you =
can shed on this topic!

Blessings,
Willa
