Namaste Narasimhaji,
I am bit confused about 2nd mantra offered in homam. A=
fter offering the pradhan mantra in homam. If we offer mantra of some other=
 deity, does the offering reach that deity or the deity invoked in the fire=
?
I have one more question after going through Sri-Krishna manual. In that =
you have mentioned that all offerring are reaching via Lord Vishnu i.e. Vis=
hnu actually runs the universe. I was thinking Advait vedanta is most widel=
y acceptable, but reading your guide, I think dwiata vedanta is also worthw=
hile to study(which mentions Vishnu as the highest form of god and of cours=
e many other things). How would you comment on this?

Please answer my abov=
e 2 questions

Thanks & Regards, 
Prasad A. Pole
