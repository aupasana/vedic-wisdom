Namaste Sanjeev ji,

It happens to everybody. People find their path, make some progress and then 
feel lost again.

You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017. Taking Cancer 
as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be strong with 
Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The 8th house 
will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and Rahu 
aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th house axis strongly 
suggest powerful mystical experiences.

You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually speaking. Just keep 
your faith and patience for a few more years and keep doing your sadhana.

The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and vimsamsa. This shows devotion 
to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and Mercury owns 
it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship of Lord 
Varaha (Vishnu's boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual progress.

Please contact suresh.battar@... (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask 
him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh Battar is a 
Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available there, he may be 
able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle shaped vessel 
with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be used. Good 
luck for your homam.

Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience through 
meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender to the Lord, 
accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses perceive in 
this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and that we are 
perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we keep 
reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly attracted to or 
repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In addition, if 
you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too helps.

For you, I strongly recommend "Jnaneshwari", a commentary on BhagavadGita by 
Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique saint, who is 
the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and adwaitic 
experience. There is a difference between writings coming from knowledge 
acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings coming from 
the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700 years ago, 
Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical body at the age 
of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more competent or 
sublime commentary on Krishna's teaching. It is quite an inspired work. A 
good English translation of this work is available at

http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648

"Yoga Vaasishtham" is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my opinion. 
When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with him to forest, 
Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of Maharshi 
Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people, Maharshi Vasishtha 
imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings were captured 
by Valmiki and the work is known as "Yoga Vaasishtham". There is an inspired 
English translation available at

http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1

Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.

Best regards,
Narasimha
