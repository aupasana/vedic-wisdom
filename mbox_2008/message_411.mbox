Dear friends,

I was coming with one of my German colleagues last year. It =
was a 
long distance and he knew that I cherish metaphysical discussions; h=
e 
took that opportunity and started some related topic. We came finally 
t=
o discussion *Non-vegetarian food*. He asked me as to what is the 
reason o=
f my being a pure vegetarian eater. Was it something due to 
religious doct=
rine? I tried to explain him various things such as our 
cultural backgroun=
d, tradition of my fore fathers based on religious 
instructions and such r=
esponsible facts. As he wanted to press me 
more on that, he asked me about=
 my personal thinking and likings on 
the issue. I couldn=A1=A6t hold back =
myself and honestly explained my 
conclusive view point on the whole subjec=
t as follow
=A1=A7I don=A1=A6t wish to stuff my stomach with the body parts=
 of killed 
creature. Would never think of troubling any leaving creature w=
hen 
mother-nature has provided enough alternate food. Just for the sake 
o=
f filling my stomach or satisfying cravings of my tongue, I won=A1=A6t be 
=
responsible for killing innocent birds, animals, fishes directly or 
indire=
ctly. What right I have, to snatch away even a single life in 
the universe=
 for my selfish reasons. I consider that as very very 
cruel and that is th=
e personal thinking why I am a vegetarian and not 
strictly due to any reli=
gious or cultural reason=A1=A8

The above was a harsh truth for anybody and=
 there was no reply or 
argument to this. My colleague didn=A1=A6t say anyt=
hing after that but the 
point was conveyed though through a biting fact.

=
I=A1=A6ve observed lot of people, talked to many who are Hindu culture and =

eating frequently meat and fish. The idea of leaving non-veg food 
seems a=
 distant possibility for them. They can restrain themselves on 
some select=
ed weekdays but not leaving it altogether. Even when they 
know in their he=
arts of hearts about that it=A1=A6s a bad karma. Almost 
all of them confes=
sed to me that the TASTE of non-veg food is 
unsurpassable. They can not re=
main without it for long time.  If this 
is the condition of the people fro=
m sanatan-dharma, it is too much to 
put through this view point with our b=
rothers and sisters from 
different faiths, who were born and groomed eatin=
g the non-veg food  

Here I don=A1=A6t wish to offend any of the members. =
I have no 
prejudice/disliking against the people who eat meat. Infact, I e=
at my 
vegetarian (Gaas-patte =83=BA) food sitting on the same table with m=
y 
colleagues where they enjoy theirs. We even share the *veg part* of 
it.=
 They are all my very good friends.

BUT many a times it pains me that they=
 are getting knowingly or 
unknowingly in to unending chain of Karmas. Some=
 of them are 
spiritually inclined and I pray that only if they leave non-v=
eg, how 
much good they=A1=A6ll do for themselves.

But am I wrong in think=
ing this way? Am I wrong in my efforts to make 
them understand my view poi=
nt? Though I never pressurize or irritate 
anybody on the issue. 
Some time=
s I feel that if most of the humans on earth eat meat, fish 
and eggs then =
is there any fundamental misconception about it? can 
there be so many peop=
le wrong in their food habits. But in any case, 
for me I=A1=A6ll stick to =
veg food simply because the logic I gave to my 
German colleague.

I wish i=
f somebody can really though light of knowledge on the whole 
issue for wha=
t is right and what is not and especially considering 
spiritual destinatio=
n as well as world peace. If so many helpless 
creatures are butchered ever=
yday for craving of taste, how then it is 
possible for the human beings to=
 ever live in peace. Will never be. I 
recollect our Magnanimous, all compa=
ssionate prayer which says =A1=A7SARVE 
bhavantu Sukhinah..=A1=A8 not only =
Humans but *Sarve* , all the lives.  

Best Regards,
Utpal
