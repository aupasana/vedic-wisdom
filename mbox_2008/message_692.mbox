Namaste to all

i have read that bhutaagni is very important for
spiritual =
growth 
and for for bhutagni to grow jatharagni should be weak

and for mor=
tals it is quite difficult to 
weaken jatharagni as we need food for surviv=
al

Though as talked in manuals for homam,
homam strenghthens bhutagni ,can=
 we something more
strengthning Bhutaagni

regards
jitender
