Namaste Phani,

1. Yes. Please ensure it is clean. Yes, Red bricks with san=
d are fine.
There are many shapes that can be used, a square shape is sugge=
sted by
most.

2. I would recommend reading it aloud too.

3. Pls ensure a =
bath before homam and keep stomach light/empty before
homam. 

4. You can s=
tart on any date, or if you prefer you can do it on a
Chaturthi.

Please ke=
ep it simple and practical so that you are encouraged to
stick to the routi=
ne as much as possible.

Good Luck

-Narayan-
