Respected Members,

I am sure a lot of you have read the Bhagwat Gita trans=
lated by 
various illustrous people arcoss ages. So which one do you think,=
 or 
rather whos explanation of the Gita do you like best.

I personally fi=
nd the explanations of Geeta given by Sri Shamacharan 
Lahiri to be the pro=
foundest. But that is purely from a yogic point of 
view.

Kindly mention y=
our personal favourite Geeta explanation.

-Regards 
 Rajarshi
