Dear Sir,

I am going to write here second miracle in my life about Shri T=
hakur.
This was also happened at Okha Port soon after my first miraculous
e=
xperience. The first was on 5th April 74 whereas this was in the mid of
May=
 1974, the date I do not remember.

As I have written in my previous mail m=
y duty was as a Telegraphist at
Okha Post Office and my duty hours were fro=
m 7 am to 12 pm and from 4 pm
to 7 pm. I was coming to my home at 12 pm and=
 cooking my food daily as
my wife was at her parent's home at Ahmedabad the=
n. I was alone
there. I was eating my food at 1 pm around and taking rest f=
or 2 hours.
I was awaking between 3 to 3.30 pm and preparing my tea before =
going to
office. This was a daily routine.

I was receiving 30 to 40 telegr=
ams daily before 12 pm and was giving
them to Mr. Babaubhai Pandya, a deliv=
ery postman of 50 years age to
deliver these telegrams to Banks, Navy, Fish=
eries and Shipping agents,
as Okha is a big port. Babubhai was delivering t=
elegrams and coming back
to Post office at 4 pm daily.

I was then reciting=
 Shri Ramkrishnadev Mantra given by Mr. Patel to me
whole day and reading S=
hri Ramkrishna Kathamritam daily after taking my
food at noon before rest. =
One day I was reading Kathamritam after my
food, I slept while reading the =
book. It was a long sleep but I heard 
somebody is knocking my door and I w=
as awake. I opened the door and he
was Babubhai, my deliveryman.

"Are you =
still sleeping Rawalbhai? See your watch, it is already
3.45"

"Oh, thanks =
Babubhai, today I am really late. Let us drink tea
together today as you ar=
e never coming to my home"

And I immediately prepared the tea. We both too=
k the tea and talked some
general talk then.

" Ok, now I am going to deliv=
er these 2 telegrams to Banks and
coming to office within 10 to 15 minutes.=
"

" Ok," I said and Babubhai went to office.

After 5 minutes time I also =
went to office and reached my office at 4.10
hours. I saw Babubhai there, w=
aiting for me.

"Why late Rawalbhai?" he said.

" You know Babubhai, you ha=
ve awakened me today otherwise I might be
still sleeping. Today how you cam=
e to my house?  You are never coming to
that area generally."

"But I have =
not come to your house Rawalbhai, why should I come at
this time? My route =
is different, as you know. I have just come from
market. I don't understand=
 what you are telling." He exclaimed.

I was thrilled again with excitement=
. Who was He who came to my house?
It was not a dream. We had taken tea tog=
ether and 2 cups of tea I had
washed.

I did not reply to Babubhai but I st=
ill search the Answer as to Who was
He to my home on that day? Thakur=85..?=
??
