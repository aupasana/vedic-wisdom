Namaste,

As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed persona=
l. Krishna clearly says in 
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is d=
angerous to follow someone 
else's dharma".

Following the path of dharma b=
asically means engaging in the right 
action/duty. Right action varies from=
 person to person, from time to time 
and from place to place. It is depend=
ent on what nature expects from you, 
which in turn is based on who you hav=
e been in the past, what actions you 
did in the past while identifying wit=
h the action, who you affected in the 
past (and how) with the actions that=
 you identified with, what debts you 
created in the process, and what ment=
al tendencies you accumulated until 
now.

If, based on one's mental tenden=
cies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
to kill evil persons, that be=
comes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
tendencies and karmic debts,=
 nature wants a person to spread the message of 
uniformity of all religion=
s, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and kar=
mic debts, nature wants a person to spread the 
ritual of homam in the worl=
d, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and kar=
mic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of 
money and construct a te=
mple, that becomes one's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a being may change f=
rom one life to another.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's d=
harma to kill his gurus, 
elders and relatives. The time then was such that=
 there was too much weight 
on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved=
 of some weight. Tremendous 
destruction was to take place and civilization=
 destroyed to a great extent, 
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it=
. Arjuna being a great warrior, 
it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some=
 people he deeply loved and 
respected were on the other side and it was hi=
s dharma to kill them.

When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th cen=
tury as one of 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had bee=
n Arjuna in a 
previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was di=
fferent in this 
new time and place. He was born to renounce material life =
despite his 
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and=
 inspire 
generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and ser=
vice to 
others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakr=
ishna 
said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.=


* * *

The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?
=

Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharm=
a 
and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the conce=
pt 
of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concep=
t of 
caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by=
 
killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was=
 a 
kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi =

later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna=
 
of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one 
d=
evelops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one does.

Thus, th=
e misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
dharma=
 from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
the w=
orld. Each person has individual dharma.

Knowing what one's dharma is is v=
ery very very difficult. If one is pure 
enough, one will *know* one's dhar=
ma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
mind that tells us what our dhar=
ma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of 
noise from other parts of our mind=
s which tell other things. Thus, we get 
confused.

We should make the best=
 judgment combining discrimination and intuition and 
decide what is our dh=
arma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
the best we can is =
all that we can do!

More than following dharma, what is of utmost importan=
ce is to engage in 
actions without identification. *That* alone ensures th=
at we are not 
accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We sh=
ould not build 
too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage =
in the best 
possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharm=
a in the given 
situation is), with as little attachment and self-identific=
ation with the 
action as possible. When the action is finished, we should =
leave the result 
to god. We should not think "I did it", "what will happen=
 now", "will it 
work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unficati=
on through 
untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our conscious=
ness slowly. 
As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our d=
harma clearer. 
There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable =
us to see our 
dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. T=
his is not easy, 
but not as difficult as people think.

The bottomline is:=
 Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of 
"this is my dha=
rma" gets refined with time if one engages in action with 
little attachmen=
t.

* * *

In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the =
inputs. 
Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men.=
 One can 
derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to one's =
spiritual 
master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take th=
e words of 
the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerely.

=
When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing guru=
s 
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his=
 
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dhar=
ma 
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadha=
na, 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=
terial 
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One who is not in tune wi=
th nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
debts are and what natu=
re expects from one can err in the judgment of what 
one's dharma is. If on=
e's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into 
one's inner core, s=
uch a guru can give perfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline is that I (or anyb=
ody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
declare that as the dharma. No=
, dharma changes from person to person, from 
time to time and from place t=
o place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
out what one's dharma is. B=
ut, one can refine one's understanding of one's 
dharma by increasing inter=
nal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
sadhana (like homam, japam=
 etc) and engaging in actions without much 
attachment, one can slowly puri=
fy oneself and refine one's understanding of 
one's individual dharma.

Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha
