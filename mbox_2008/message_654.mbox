Dear Mitesh ji,
I started to read the volume 3 in the Google Books. What an=
 
extraordinary book? Swami Shovom thirth Maharaj's Guru Sri Vishnu 
Thirth=
 Maharaj's discourses are awesome. I believe his analysis of 
the mind is s=
uperior than the most advanced psychology professors. I 
believe this volum=
e 3 is superior than any personal development/self-
help/psychology book I =
read.

What a great realized scholor and Master? I would never forget his 
=
detachment and his talks about detachment. This book doesn't just 
talk abo=
ut theory. I believe this book should be the must read for 
all spiritual a=
spirants. This is my opinion after reading just first 
3 chapters. 

I am o=
rdering it now and I want to follow the teachings of this great 
guru.

Let=
 me conclude with a great quote from Sri Shivanand maharaj,
"An Ounce of pr=
actise is worth more than tons of theory"

Thank you very very very much on=
ce again for the great suggestion.
                                        =
   Kumar
