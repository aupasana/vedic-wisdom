Hare Rama Krishna
Dear Narayana,
Hope you are fine! Havent seen you in year=
s.
anyway,, used to be.. long time ago...other yugas, when brahmans were ve=
ry potent due to 
shakti/punya etc
that they could light fire just from MAN=
TRA! 
Yogis could travel on light rays.
In fact one thing I marvel about is=
 
how Krishna etc can invoke his weapons and such just by sound vibration,e=
tc
was practice before things degenerated,
its nice to read Mahabharata and=
 Srimad Bhagavatam.
Best wishes
Lakshmi
