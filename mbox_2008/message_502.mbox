Hello Dilip

Wow you have meet him? very good, if you ca=
n get access to these books
please read them, these are good books. I since=
rely encourage you and 
than come back with more information.

He gave diff=
erent types of initiations based on the state of 
sadhaka. he gave kriya yo=
ga to very few discples explicitly.
He mostly gave rama mantra and then exp=
lained how to do prananyams.
Only one that I read about was a guy name jhad=
avjibhai in rajkot, who 
did kriya yoga and was very advanced sadhaka.

He =
is the guru of all of my family members on my fathers side, except 
for me =
and some of my younger siblings. He used to visit our home 
too, however no=
body in my home knew about this too.

Best Regards

Mitesh
