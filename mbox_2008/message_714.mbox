Dear Jitender,

Namaste,

At first, please try understand the basic philoso=
phy of Sri Aurobindo. His "The Life Divine", which is conisdered by many as=
 'The Veda of the New Age', contains that philosophy. But to delve into it =
for the first time is very difficult, unless you know the basic philosophy =
of Sri Aurobindo. So if you at first read the following books, it would be =
helpful to understand "The Life Divine".

You may at first read the followi=
ng three books:
  1. The Hour of God.
  2. Bases of yoga.
  3. The Mother.
=

These are small books. They contain Sri Aurbindo's basic philosophy and th=
e basis of His Integral Yoga.

After that you may read the following books =
in the order that follows:

  4. Essays on the Gita
  5.The Letters on Yoga=
- 4 volumes.

After finishing those books, you will gain a solid basis on t=
he philosophy and yoga of Sri Aurobindo. The start reading the following bo=
oks:

6. The Synthesis of Yoga.
7. The Life Divine
8.The Upanishads.
9.The =
Secret of the Veda
10.Hymns to the Mystic Fire.
11. Savitri

He also have w=
ritten many books on social and political thoughts.

As an introduction to =
the Philosophy, Yoga and Life of Sri Aurobindo, you may read at first a boo=
k on Sri Aurobindo by Satprem. It is now considered by many as a classic. T=
he title of the book is " Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness."=


Lastly, please read what The Mahayogi has writteen about his yoga:
The fo=
llowing is from SABCL, Vol. 26, "Sri Aurobindo on Himself", pp. 95-97.

The=
 teaching of Sri Aurobindo starts from that of the ancient sages of India t=
hat behind the appearances of the universe there is the Reality of a Being =
and Consciousness, a Self of all things, one and eternal. All beings are un=
ited in that One Self and Spirit but divided by a certain separativity of c=
onsciousness, an ignorance of their true Self and Reality in the mind, life=
 and body. It is possible by a certain psychological discipline to remove t=
his veil of separative consciousness and become aware of the true Self, the=
 Divinity within us and all. 

Sri Aurobindo's teaching states that this On=
e Being and Consciousness is involved here in Matter. Evolution is the meth=
od by which it liberates itself; consciousness appears in what seems to be =
inconscient, and once having appeared is self-impelled to grow higher and h=
igher and at the same time to enlarge and develop towards a greater and gre=
ater perfection. Life is the first step of this release of consciousness; m=
ind is the second; but the evolution does not finish with mind, it awaits a=
 release into something greater, a consciousness which is spiritual and sup=
ramental. The next step of the evolution must be towards the development of=
 Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious being. For onl=
y then will the involved Divinity in things release itself entirely and it =
become possible for life to manifest perfection. 

But while the former ste=
ps in evolution were taken by Nature without a conscious will in the plant =
and animal life, in man Nature becomes able to evolve by a conscious will i=
n the instrument. It is not, however, by the mental will in man that this c=
an be wholly done, for the mind goes only to a certain point and after that=
 can only move in a circle. A conversion has to be made, a turning of the c=
onsciousness by which mind has to change into the higher principle. This me=
thod is to be found through the ancient psychological discipline and practi=
ce of Yoga. In the past, it has been attempted by a drawing away from the w=
orld and a disappearance into the height of the Self or Spirit. Sri Aurobin=
do teaches that a descent of the higher principle is possible which will no=
t merely release the spiritual Self out of the world, but release it in the=
 world, replace the mind's ignorance or its very limited knowledge by a sup=
ramental Truth-Consciousness which will be a sufficient instrument of the i=
nner Self and make it possible for the human being to find himself dynamica=
lly as well as inwardly and grow out of his still animal humanity into a di=
viner race. The psychological discipline of Yoga can be used to that end by=
 opening all the parts of the being to a conversion or transformation throu=
gh the descent and working of the higher still concealed supramental princi=
ple. 

This, however, cannot be done at once or in a short time or by any r=
apid or miraculous transformation. Many steps have to be taken by the seeke=
r before the supramental descent is possible. Man lives mostly in his surfa=
ce mind, life and body, but there is an inner being within him with greater=
 possibilities to which he has to awake - for it is only a very restricted =
influence from it that he receives now and that pushes him to a constant pu=
rsuit of a greater beauty, harmony, power and knowledge. The first process =
of Yoga is therefore to open the ranges of this inner being and to live fro=
m there outward, governing his outward life by an inner light and force. In=
 doing so he discovers in himself his true soul which is not this outer mix=
ture of mental, vital and physical elements but something of the Reality be=
hind them, a spark from the one Divine Fire. He has to learn to live in his=
 soul and purify and orientate by its drive towards the Truth the rest of t=
he nature. There can follow afterwards an opening upward and descent of a h=
igher principle of the Being. But even then it is not at once the full supr=
amental Light and Force. For there are several ranges of consciousness betw=
een the ordinary human mind and the supramental Truth-Consciousness. These =
intervening ranges have to be opened up and their power brought down into t=
he mind, life and body. Only afterwards can the full power of the Truth-Con=
sciousness work in the nature. The process of this self-discipline or Sadha=
na is therefore long and difficult, but even a little of it is so much gain=
ed because it makes the ultimate release and perfection more possible. 

Th=
ere are many things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the wa=
y - an opening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Se=
lf and the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic cons=
ciousness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is =
not essential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over=
 the body and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a=
 combination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge thr=
ough the mind's discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart's=
 way of devotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will =
away from motives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a greate=
r Reality than the ego. For the whole being has to be trained so that it ca=
n respond and be transformed when it is possible for that greater Light and=
 Force to work in the nature. 

In this discipline, the inspiration of the =
Master, and in the difficult stages his control and his presence are indisp=
ensable - for it would be impossible otherwise to go through it without muc=
h stumbling and error which would prevent all chance of success. The Master=
 is one who has risen to a higher consciousness and being and he is often r=
egarded as its manifestation or representative. He not only helps by his te=
aching and still more by his influence and example but by a power to commun=
icate his own experience to others. 

This is Sri Aurobindo's teaching and =
method of practice. It is not his object to develop any one religion or to =
amalgamate the older religions or to found any new religion - for any of th=
ese things would lead away from his central purpose. The one aim of his Yog=
a is an inner self-development by which each one who follows it can in time=
 discover the One Self in all and evolve a higher consciousness than the me=
ntal, a spiritual and supramental consciousness which will transform and di=
vinise human nature. 

Warm regards

Dilip Banerjee

possible by a certain psychological discipline to remove this ve=

consciousness and become aware of the true Self, the Divi=
nity within us and all. 
</P>
<P>Sri Aurobindo's teaching states that this =
One Being and Consciousness is 
involved here in Matter. Evolution is the m=

consciousness appears in what seems to=

develop towards a greater a=
nd greater perfection. Life is the first step of this 
release of conscious=
ness; mind is the second; but the evolution does not finish 
with mind, it =
awaits a release into something greater, a consciousness which is 
spiritua=
l and supramental. The next step of the evolution must be towards the 
deve=
lopment of Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious 
bei=
ng. For only then will the involved Divinity in things release itself 
enti=
rely and it become possible for life to manifest perfection. </P>
<P>But wh=
ile the former steps in evolution were taken by Nature without a 
conscious=
 will in the plant and animal life, in man Nature becomes able to 
evolve b=
y a conscious will in the instrument. It is not, however, by the mental 
wi=

point and after that can only move in a circle. A conversion has to be ma=

turning of the consciousness by which mind has to change into the hi=

al 
discipline and practice of Yoga. In the past, it has been attempted by =
a drawing

the world, replace the mind's ignorance or its ve=

<P>This, however, cannot be do=
