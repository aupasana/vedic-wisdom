Namaste friends,
 
As some of you know, a Mahaganapathi homam manual was ma=
de available about 2 years back and several people are performing Mahaganap=
athi homam on a daily or weekly or monthly basis using it. Recently, we mad=
e a Chandi homam manual and Sri Krishna Homam manual available. Our goal is=
 to create manuals for homam of several deities so that people can pick the=
 deity they like and do a regular homam. What we want to create is a commun=
ity of sincere spiritual seekers who regularly worship *a deity* (any) in f=
ire.
 
Now a manual for Sri Mahalakshmi homam is ready on this auspicious d=
ay of Sraavana Sukravara with Sravana nakshatra! Tithi (Chaturdasi), vaara =
(Sukravara), yoga (Soubhagya) and karana (Vanija) are all owned by Venus ri=
ght now and Venus has risen just now. Nakshatra is Sravana belonging to Vis=
hnu.
 
The procedure taught in the manual uses 3 mantras for the main fire =
ritual - Sri Suktam, Mahalakshmi's 108 names taught by Lord Shiva to Parvat=
i and Mahalaskhmi's Ashtakam (8 verses) composed by Lord Indra. One can pic=
k the mantra one is most attracted to and try it. If one is unable to pick,=
 I suggest the 108 name prayer taught by Shiva. It is very powerful and app=
ropriate for this age.
 
This homam should take about 45 minutes (less with=
 a smaller count and more with a higher count) and hence it is possible to =
use this procedure on a daily or weekly or monthly basis. All the mantras n=
eeded are given with detailed explanations. The document is appropriate for=
 total novices also. This manual is a self-sufficient document.
 
Mahalaksh=
mi is normally considered the goddess of money. People think that Her homam=
 only gives money and not spiritual progress. However, the truth is that Ma=
halakshmi takes different forms such as Dhana Lakshmi (wealth), Dhaanya Lak=
shmi (food), Santana Lakshmi (children) etc and even Moksha Lakshmi, who gi=
ves spiritual progress and liberation. Mahalakshmi is the goddess of well-b=
eing and prosperity. Wealth is one kind of well-being and spiritual progres=
s is another kind of well-being. Mahalakshmi covers all kinds of well-being=
. If appropriate mantras are selected for Mahalakshmi homam, it can be grea=
t for spiritual progress without sacrificing material well-being.
 
Please =
download the manual from
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/lakshmi.htm=

 
Please feel free to spread the word among interested people.
 
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha
