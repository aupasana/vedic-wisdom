Dear Narsimhaji,

Pranaam..

Reading your reply, i got solace.. or rather t=
rue direction..I know 
if i want to come out of my trauma.. i only will hav=
e to do 
something.. at the same time i had to be patient also.. Naliniji h=
ad 
rightly said that being in mire also one can feel the 
divine..provided=
 you need to make yourself worth for it..

I will have to keep alive in me =
the desire of  ''Craving attitude to 
reach to divine" ..which is the ultim=
ate destination..

I would be happy if you could kindly explain me "Detachm=
ent Process" 
or "how to  perform actions in material life to pay back debt=
s 
without incurring new debts".

Narsimhaji, as suggested by you, i will s=
tart doing mahaganapathi 
homam without further delay.. 

I am happy to be =
a part of this group..I am thankful to utpal, my 
childhood friend who had =
brought me to this site.. utpal.. thanks..

Regards
Rajesh
