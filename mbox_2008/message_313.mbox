Hi Jitender,

In the past I have read Yoga Vasishtha (by Swami Venkatesanan=
da) but
wasnt able to sustain and complete.
Not sure which version you are =
reading but there is abridged and full
version. I started with the Full, bu=
t may be the abridged may have
worked better - atleast because of the size.=


I still feel it is among the greatest spiritual works based on
dialogue b=
etween Lord Rama and Sage Vasishta. Making a habit of
reading some sections=
 daily is a great way to keep yourself in the
company of great knowledge.

=
Keep it up.

Shrikanth
