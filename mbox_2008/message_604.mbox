Dear All,
=C2=A0
Excellent chain of mails indeed, including the metion and =
significance of teh Vikata Rupa of Ganapati to overcome lust.
=C2=A0
This i=
s indeed one of the finest internet forums. May Narasimhaji and the other l=
earned members keep up the good work, there is so much that ordinary people=
 like me get to learn just by reading these mails!.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Guys,

I am glad everything is sorted out. But, in general, let u=
s be less 
defensive and instead focus on subject. Knowing Ajit's nature, I=
 knew 
exactly what he meant. However, even if Ajit or someone actually sai=
d 
something negative about me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and=
 
words, good or bad, do not change that, for better or worse. Why be 
sens=
itive to words then?

Ajit, you are certainly qualified in commenting. I al=
ways knew that you have 
tremendous scholarship, great humility and sinceri=
ty. People far less 
qualified than you talk/write so much in today's world=
. Please do write 
more.

The imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentio=
ned by you is really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcam=
e lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
self-control.

Lord Hrishikesha gi=
ves purity and control over senses (hrishika + isha =3D 
lord of senses). H=
e can be worshipped for control over senses.

Mother Kaali gives dispassion=
 and kills the root of desires. She can be 
worshipped for getting rid of d=
esires.

Several things are possible. But, for most people in today's times=
, it is 
not going to be one magic bullet that does it, but a combination o=
f various 
practices. Patience is needed.

Try to increase the understandin=
g of what is permanent and what is 
transient.

Best regards,
Narasimha
