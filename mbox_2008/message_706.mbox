Om Brihaspataye Namah

Dear Members, 
Namaste

I have to assist in compilin=
g a radio program on Kartigai Deepam. Can 
anyone please let me know where =
I can get information about this 
celebration- scriptural references would =
be much appreciated.

The reason I ask for this is because I have noticed s=
ome nonsense 
things on the internet, specifically with one group saying Vi=
shnu and 
Brahma were quarelling about who is Supreme and Shiva showed them=
 all 
that he is supreme, then another group saying that Shiva and Brahma 
=
were quarelling and Vishnu showed them he is supreme.

In my opinion, I don=
t believe these stories as they seem to divide 
Hindus in their belief. Fro=
m my own reading of Brihad Bhagavadamrita, 
the transcendental loving relat=
ionship between Lord Vishnu and Lord 
Shiva is described- and there is no p=
etty quarelling and no 
competition! 

Any help would be much appreciated!

Jaya Sita Raama
