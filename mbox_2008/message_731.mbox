Namaste Utpal,

I liked Narasimha's analogy a lot. But I also think that a =
master 
just doesn't give a million dollar check to a servant to bring cash=
 
from bank, if he doesn't have faith in his servant. To another 
servant, =
he may just give a $100 check. In order to get the 
confidence from God, to=
 do some good things, we all need to prove 
ourselves worthy by doing lot o=
f sadhana etc and we should be ready 
to serve others as per His agenda. 

=
Best Regards.
Bharathi

(somehow, I couldn't post my earlier mail and sendi=
ng a similar 
mail).
