] Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today


Dear Sir, I would like to share o=
ne of my great Devine experience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbel=
ievable experience that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. =
I am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the per=
iod of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. 
=C2=
=A0 
I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My=
 duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra =
duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due t=
o same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One M=
r. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator=
. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Wheneve=
r I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came close =
day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He wa=
s singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. He=
 was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending t=
his weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel =
was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hou=
rs and were talking only about Thakur. 
One day when we were at sea shore h=
e suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and=
 my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I=
 shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son=
 came to call him. 
At one another incident he told me that there will be a=
 plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed abo=
ut him. He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, =
he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went=
 to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the wa=
y. This was surprising. 
This all incidents made me to believe that he had =
some super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attr=
acted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri =
Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to T=
hakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deep=
ly from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. 
Next d=
ay morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking the=
 tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning. I =
told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as m=
y Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was =
a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru should=
 be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take =
Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=
=9D--. 
Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not know=
 much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken hasty d=
ecision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- 
But I remember that Mr. P=
atel had told me that Thakur was telling their disciples to test him before=
 accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immediately told my wife t=
hat =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to our home. You have a=
lso not seen him. He has never asked me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Pate=
l is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my=
 selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- 
She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- 
I prayed Shr=
i Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and convince =
my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 
To ou=
r great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the morning with ang=
ry mood. What he told? 
=E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you=
 know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my =
home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly =
Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=
=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his=
 house=E2=80=9D 
I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me t=
he way to your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturb=
ing him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 
We both=
 were so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. 
I will n=
ever forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some more =
Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime. 
Dear Si=
r, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth. This is a =
fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thak=
ur bless all of us. 
Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad
