Dear Narasimha-ji,

You are not the type to make sp=
eculative statements, so please indulge
our curiosity, how did you land on =
this "1.8 million years" number?
Presumably there is good reason for you to=
 make this statement, and I
ask because others have gone through a similar =
dating exercise and for
most of them I've seen that they conclude that Rama=
 existed around a
few thousand years at most prior to Krishna (or the Mahab=
harata war).
For example, this gentleman Dr. Vartak here (
http://www.hindu=
net.org/hindu_history/ancient/ramayan/rama_vartak.html
) concludes Rama was=
 born around 7600 BC..

Would appreciate your insight into this, Thanks!!
R=
egards,
./Dinesh
