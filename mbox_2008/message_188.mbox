Dear Narasimhaji:

Thank you for your illustrative response. I totally
agree with you on all the points. I have been reciting
Devi Kavacham, Argala, Suktam from Durga Saptashati
and I have been experiencing the effects in my life. 

I hope when the right time comes i would be able to
learn how to perform Chandi Homam.

Thank you
Gaurav
