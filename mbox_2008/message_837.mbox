Namaste Prasad ji,

I was just making little fun! In day to day life, we ge=
nerally use 

the word 'SadGati' for the deceased person and that made me w=
rite it 

spontaneously.

your explanation is very correct and Jitendra's e=
motions are also

pure and saatwik. I am sure Jitendra or Narasimha won't m=
ind it.

Wish you all a very happy, Havan(ly) prosperous new year.

Warm Re=
agards,

Utpal
