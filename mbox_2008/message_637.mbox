Namaste

Both these are very =
credible saints. Sri Yogeshwar was a very highly
realized saint. His book i=
s very good. He does mention about his
prevoius birth and also mentions tha=
t Saccha Baba had also confirmed
the same thing. Saccha Baba was another ve=
ry highly realized saint too.

Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai =
Baba of shirdi and Naamdev
and also many other saints too. The initiation h=
e got on the bank of
river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has descri=
bed very
accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He =
had
very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic
ora=
tor. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the web
site and=
 sharing the information for free both audio and books.

Chiti Leela or the=
 play of Shakti or God is very complex, Ramakrishna
may have taken birth as=
 more than one person and in future may take
more births.

His comsic body =
(karan sharir) or whatever name others use pardon my
lack of appropriate wo=
rd, is also alive and manifest from time to time
After reading this and oth=
er books, I feel that each one of us has a
inner guru along with our atma a=
nd this inner guru in conjunction with
our accumulated or sanchit sankaras =
give us visions of these mahatmas
or help us attach or attract to a Saint o=
r some aspects of the saint
more than others. This inner guru is the same i=
n all humam beings but
manifests uniquely based on each person. 

I also be=
lieve that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is
present in physical =
form and seek guidance from him time to time.
There are many instances of o=
ther forms of inititations like
initiation in dream or inititation by cosmi=
c forms, these forms of
initiations though very important are very rare or =
uncommon.

After reading Sri Yogeshwar's book I had some questions pop up i=
n my
mind about him.

1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have=
 guided many
spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique=
.
2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book
abou=
t it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after that?
3) He di=
d pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving
spirtual talks=
? It seems unusual.

I have also read somewhere that once a person reaches =
a spiritual
state, he cannot remain in human body for more than few days, w=
as this
the case?

May be others who have read this book can share more lig=
ht.
I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has
=
time, it is available for free to download as a pdf book on his web site.

=
Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and
upliftmen=
t, a lot of his information is wellknown. He spread the Devi
Gayatri mantra=
/homa and other things in a big way all around india.

I feel like I have n=
ot even begun my spiritual journey which is very
very long too and many obs=
tacles in the path.

Best Regards
Mitesh
