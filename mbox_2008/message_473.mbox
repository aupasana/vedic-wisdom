Dear Rajarshiji, I would interfere with your kind permission. I have worked=
 on this issue and my findings are as under.
1. At the time of Dixa general=
ly Saturn is connected to Sun and/or Moon by conjunction, opposition or asp=
ect but most probably conjunction/opposition
2 At the time when Jupiter is =
over or opposing natal Saturn=C2=A0/ =C2=A0or=C2=A0 Saturn is over or oppos=
ing natal Jupiter
3 When Jupiter is transitting 5th house or aspecting it. =

For Dixa one should have a connection between Saturn and Moon in the birth=
 chart or in Navamsha chart or otherwise Saturn must be in the Ascendant. T=
his rule is compulsory otherwise he will take dixa=C2=A0under someone's inf=
luence but leave the Mantra or follow up dedication.
If one's Sun or Jupite=
r is in trine or sextile aspect with Neptune in the birth chart he will enj=
oy the grace and bliss of God 100% in this present life.

Namaste,

Choosing the right de=
ity for sadhana is important. If you do not know the 
right deity, just doi=
ng some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick 
whatever deity see=
ms natural to you and do sadhana.

Please remember that sadhana for spiritu=
al progress is different from 
sadhana for specific material benefits. No m=
atter which deity you worship, 
sadhana performed for spiritual progress ne=
ver goes waste. However, 
sometimes it may be necessary to experience the r=
esults of some bad karmas 
before some good things happen. Imagine all your=
 karmas lying in a pile in a 
basket. Suppose some of the really good karma=
s that will enable you to do 
serious sadhana and experience great things l=
ie at the bottom or middle of 
the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose go=
d decides to give you the fruits 
of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him r=
eaching into the pile and 
retrieving those karmas. In the process, some ot=
her karmas may spill over 
and give their fruits. Some of those may be unde=
sirable. So what? They had 
to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway=
!

A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly 
undes=
irable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.

One ge=
ntleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good 
priest-cum-yogi =
in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was 
laid off and =
lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadhana 
and used the =
break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage 
to some nic=
e places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted 
at the Ka=
alikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got 
the oppo=
rtunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house 
of a pr=
iest during the homam. He could observe and interact with my guru 
very clo=
sely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision of the Mother on 
2006 Ma=
rch 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start the work on spreading 
homa=
m in the world, this gentleman was present there. Though he could not 
see =
the Mother, he actually smelled something out of the world and was 
baffled=
. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple 
was cl=
osed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people 
on th=
e premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the 
Moth=
er, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial 
mom=
ent. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.

You never know how, whe=
n and where the grace of god falls on you. 
Calculations and logic are usel=
ess when it comes to the grace of god. Just 
surrender and keep doing whate=
ver sadhana you picked. If it needs 
fine-tuning, somebody will appear to t=
ell you that. Any bad things that 
happen when doing a spiritual sadhana sh=
ould be viewed as nature settling 
some debts so that you are prepared to r=
eceive the fruits of some really 
auspicious karmas.

As Shirdi Sai Baba sa=
ys, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have devotion 
and patience. Ther=
e is no limit to what you can get then.

Best regards,
Narasimha

he <BR>right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiti=
ng. Pick <BR>whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.<BR><BR>Ple=
ase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from <BR>sadh=
ana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, <BR>=
sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, <BR>som=
etimes it may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas <BR=
>before some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in=
 a <BR>basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you =
to do <BR>serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or =
middle of <BR>the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give=
 you the fruits <BR>of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into t=
he pile and <BR>retrieving those karmas. In the
 process, some other karmas=
 may spill over <BR>and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable=
. So what? They had <BR>to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!<BR=
><BR>A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly <BR>=
undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.<BR=
><BR>One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good <BR>pr=
iest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was =
<BR>laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadha=
na <BR>and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pil=
grimage <BR>to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam =
we conducted <BR>at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met=
 my guru and got <BR>the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we=
 stayed at the house <BR>of a priest during the homam. He could observe and=
 interact with my guru <BR>very closely.
 Most importantly, when my guru ha=
d a vision of the Mother on <BR>2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told h=
im to start the work on spreading <BR>homam in the world, this gentleman wa=
s present there. Though he could not <BR>see the Mother, he actually smelle=
d something out of the world and was <BR>baffled. He knew something was goi=
ng on, but did not know what. The temple <BR>was closed at the time and my =
guru and this gentlemen were the only people <BR>on the premises when the M=
other appeared. Even though he could not see the <BR>Mother, it was most fo=
rtunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial <BR>moment. That is en=
ough to mould the rest of his life.<BR><BR>You never know how, when and whe=
re the grace of god falls on you. <BR>Calculations and logic are useless wh=
en it comes to the grace of god. Just <BR>surrender and keep doing whatever=
 sadhana you picked. If it needs <BR>fine-tuning, somebody will appear to t=
ell you that. Any bad things that
 <BR>happen when doing a spiritual sadhan=
a should be viewed as nature settling <BR>some debts so that you are prepar=
ed to receive the fruits of some really <BR>auspicious karmas.<BR><BR>As Sh=
irdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have devotion <BR=
>and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.<BR><BR>Best rega=

; what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous<BR>> but i have =
some small doubts<BR>><BR>> Leaving astrology aside and those who do =
not have a guru<BR>> how can they chooose a particular form of GOD<BR>&g=
t; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity<BR>&=
gt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of a person<BR>> who is gr=
eedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed<BR>><BR>> One thin=
g more<BR>> we have so many deities that on
 diwali i would like to wors=
hip<BR>> Lakshmi and Kali<BR>> in navaratri (nowadays) we would worsh=
ip Durga<BR>> on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA<BR>> an on MAH=
ASHIVARATRI for SHIVA<BR>> like this<BR>> with hte change in festival=
 the deity changes<BR>><BR>> though everybody knows GOD is ONE but it=
 becomes difficult to get<BR>> out of this<BR>> mould and if i didnt =
worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become<BR>> angry<BR>><BR>>=
; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind<BR>&=
gt;<BR>> One thing more<BR>><BR>> Suppose if i choose a deity and =
something wrong happens<BR>> (materiallistically )<BR>><BR>> what =
should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my<BR>> DEBTS/WR=
ONG DEEDS<BR>> or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I am =
not fit<BR>> for that DEITY<BR>><BR>> and sometimes you feel<BR>&g=
t; o what am i doing does this really
 works<BR>><BR>> and one thing =
more<BR>><BR>> what if we go on doing our pooja and someday<BR>> s=
omething like what happened to Pt. GOPI KRISHNA JI<BR>> happens to us al=
so<BR>> though he says in his book that he read a lot about yoga<BR>>=
 and stuff like this<BR>><BR>> At any stage i do not want you people =
to get offended<BR>> but these are my doubts which are there in my mind<=
BR>><BR>> i will not say much now bcoz in<BR>> Swami Sivananda's K=
UNDALINI YOGA on the last page he says<BR>><BR>> "the shastras are en=
dless and there is so much to be known<BR>> turn the gaze. draw the indr=
iyas.still the mind.then<BR>> dive deep into the divine source and reali=
se the infinite bliss"<BR>><BR>> ************ ********* ********* ***=
****** ********* ********* ********* ***<BR>> *<BR>> i ll give one sm=
all personal example here<BR>><BR>> around 26 or 27 dec.2007 i starte=
d chanting 2 mantras (one kar
 mala<BR>> each)<BR>> in morning and ev=
ening<BR>> and on 9 january 2008 my parents met an accident<BR>> thou=
gh my father suffered small injuries my mother suffred fracture<BR>> in =
shoulder and Leg<BR>><BR>> and she is still undergoing treatment and =
will have to<BR>> undergo one more operation in this month<BR>><BR>&g=
t; and in February and March i got placement in<BR>> 2 companies (i m do=
ing MCA in india) where most of my friends have<BR>> not<BR>> even go=
t one and let me tell you i m not very intelligent<BR>><BR>> so somet=
imes even now i consider whether my choosen deity is correct<BR>> or not=
<BR>><BR>> so everyday in the end of my pooja what i ask GOD is<BR>&g=
t; to help me find the right path<BR>> ************ ********* ********* =

 guessed<BR>>> who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who
 I saw=
, and he<BR>> guessed<BR>>> correctly. That should count for somet=
hing!<BR>>><BR>>> I will not be surprised if there are indeed s=
ubtle connections<BR>> between<BR>>> several lineages that seem di=

<BR>> Maharaj.<BR>>> He visited me after a month,
 discussed that =
knowledge and spent a<BR>> day at my<BR>>> house. Thus, some small=

 things happened<BR>> through<BR>>> them, but they did not find an=
