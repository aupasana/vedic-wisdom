Namaste,

I believe sain baba's birthday is today or it was y'day.

I have =
no idea how to interpret dreams but in your case if i were 
you, i would ha=
ve increased my Spiritual Sadhana.

I think you can consider your dreams as=
 blessings from a great saint 
and he might be indicating you to intensify =
your devotion.

Happy Sain Jayanti & Christ Jayanti

Best Regards,

Utpal
