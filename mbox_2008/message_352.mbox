Hi Members,
Just wanted to share an article I wrote...


Selfless Prayer: A=
 Preparation for Bhakti
By Dr. Mukul S. Goel


While asking God for monetar=
y gains, a house, education, or a more
healthy body is not unethical, we ma=
y be worshipping only a
self-limiting aspect of the Divine if our mind is f=
astened to our own
desires. As we create a wish list of finite objects whil=
e worshipping,
we do not try to connect to the One Who is Absolute Truth,
C=
onsciousness, and Infinite Bliss but apply for the blessings of a
finite po=
tency that can fulfill our dreams.

In Hindu spirituality, this concept bec=
omes explicit as certain
expressions of divinity have become culturally ass=
ociated with specific
objects or gains that they can bestow upon us. While =
the principal forms
of God, including Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva, are wors=
hipped selflessly
by followers as the manifestations of Brahman (the Absolu=
te Reality),
the lesser forms (demigods) are traditionally remembered only =
when their
followers need a specific object in life. In the Bhagavad Gita, =
Lord
Krishna promises that whenever we desire something due to our ignoranc=
e
and select a demigod to achieve it, He fixes our faith on the selected
fo=
rm so that our wishes may be easily fulfilled (VII: 20-21). Along
these lin=
es, the thousands of demigods in Hindu mythology, all elements
of the same =
divinity, can also be understood as God's reciprocation
to our own desires.=


As we evolve and learn to connect, our wish list may expand to include
go=
odness, some knowledge, some truthful fellow beings to interact with,
some =
love in life, and some desires for "letting go". This would
mean that we ar=
e getting closer to God and are on our way to meeting
Him. Eventually, we m=
ay start requesting Him for realization and
deliverance from the universe. =
But only when we approach God with an
empty wish list, not desiring even li=
beration, can we actually sense the
original inspirations within us that ar=
e a result of a two-way
connection with the Almighty.

Similarly, we can wo=
rship the Divine Energy as the Mother for knowledge,
wealth, and strength. =
But it is not until we take refuge in Her by
transcending the short-term ob=
jectives of life that we worship the
personification of the infinite source=
 of universal energy and power. We
need to learn to transfer the doership o=
f all karma to Her and adore Her
just for being there for us in order to re=
alize that we all are Her
favorite kids.

God, according to Hindu thought, =
is everywhere -- in you, in me, in all
matter, and yet He is beyond the uni=
verse. Accordingly, His availability
to the individual soul is never a cons=
traint. Our aim is to surrender to
God so that we can experience Him within=
 ourselves or call Him for a
visit in person. And when we remember God just=
 to remember Him, we start
surrendering to God. The lack of any material ob=
jective during
remembrance indicates that the devotional foundation of trus=
t, truth,
contentment, and an earnest aspiration to meet God has been made.=
 This
is where pure love or Bhakti begins, for the love of God, to exist in=

the heart, requires a permanent erasure of all human inclinations
towards =
scheming, passion, and slackness from the mind. On the other
hand, whether =
we opt for the `formless' God or a God with
attributes, large amounts of wo=
rldly knowledge and information about the
Lord may not be necessary to unde=
rstand that God pervades us all.

Moving from duality to the non-dualist sc=
hool of thought, where the
individual soul and God are not really separate =
but appear to be
separated due to our own ignorance, our desires remain as =
the only
barrier in our connecting to our Self -- which is God. Because
ign=
orance-borne selfish karma, laden with desires, are inept in
destroying ign=
orance and cause repeated births in the world, any prayer
to God solely for=
 the fulfillment of our own desires does not contribute
to our awakening. T=
hrough whichever yoga we choose, the introspective
path of knowledge or the=
 emotional path of pure love, when spirituality
purges the difference betwe=
en the individual soul and the Divine,
ignorance, desires and the feel of s=
eparation -- all leave together.

In spite of the fact that our desires, wh=
ich are present when we are
spiritual beginners, prevent us from worshippin=
g God in His entirety,
every prayer slowly and steadily helps us build a pl=
atform for our inner
rise due to the tiny bits of pure love that are often =
unknowingly
present in our communications. Even the elementary prayers that=
 are
directed towards an object of the material world may strengthen our
ha=
bit of applying for a connection to the Divine. And it may not be long
befo=
re we turn to the selfless mode of praying to activate selfless
karma. Once=
 we are in love with God, we are all set; God remembrance
with a feel of su=
rrender can desert all our remaining passions to
connect us to God eternall=
y.
