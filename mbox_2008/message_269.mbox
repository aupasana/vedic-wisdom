 in the

the screen. For example, suppose there is a scene where the heroine

happiness 
when something good happens in the movie and shudders when somet=
hing 
terrible happens in the movie. He is analogous to a person deeply 
st=
uck in maya. Really speaking, this life we live is quite similar 
to a big =
movie, except that it is interactive. Thus, my analogy is 
quite appropriat=
e.
>  
> Now, one smart person may very well know that this movie thing is =

not really happening and hence controlling emotions mostly. But an 
odd sc=
ene may make him shudder too! Such a person is analogous to 
one who intell=
ectually understands and appreciates the essence of 
Veda (that all is Brah=
man and the objects we see are all an 
illusion) and yet does not fully com=
prehend it.
>  
> If one fully realizes, then nothing should make one happy=
 or sad 
internally. One may act externally as though one is happy or sad, =

but the heart should be stable always and not excited or depressed 
by *an=
ything*. If all is Brahman, why should anything exicte you 
depress you? In=
 our analogy, such a person is like one watching the 
movie with zero invol=
vement, realizing at all times that it is only 
imaginary and not happening=
 for real and not being shaken even once. 
One who has only an intellectual=
 understanding and not a complete 
understanding may some times be affected=
 by the illusion.
>

one humiliates,

 have it? 
If something seems disgusting, do you want to go away?
>  
> As =
long as there is attachment and self-identification with a body 
or a name =
or some other limited object, some ego remains and causes 
all of the above=
. It results in happiness on some events and sadness 
on some events. Self-=
realization cannot come without overcoming ego 
*fully*. It never comes fro=

limited ego to zero ego? There is no single

realize Self. This is jnana yoga.

to a specific deity and slowly force oneself
