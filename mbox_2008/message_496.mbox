Adarniya Guruji Namaste,
=A0
I had the same doubt=A0because due to time res=
triction & in the run to do more quantity I too=A0 rushed. But I was wonder=
ing whether such a speed is ok or it is better do it calmly. But then obser=
ving the Brahmins who recite the mantras at Super Super speed I thought tha=
t it may be allright as Brahmins are Supreme. I was in Dilemma. After readi=
ng you post the doubt is crystal clear & feels like the truth is being reve=
aled directly from God & no second thought on that. Your views/postings are=
 a Great Blessing. Hope that many such wrong=A0practices will be corrected =
in time.

Namaste Ajit,
=A0
A really le=
arned and elevated soul like you is asking a fool like me for my view - how=
 weird is the play of the Mother! You read shastras far more thoroughly tha=
n me. I read only a little and mostly go by my instincts, words of gurus=A0=
and insights from practical experience. Anyway, as you asked, here are my 2=
 cents.
=A0
The purpose of sadhana is to instill discipline and control the=
 mind. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday there is a possibility of m=
ind stopping completely for a little time. When that happens, you perceive =
the underlying reality that an overactive mind normally stops you from perc=
eiving. As this happens more frequently, you are able to control your mind =
far better.
=A0
If you do things in a business-like attitude, in haste, IMH=
O, it is not really conducive to slowing the mind down and creating a usefu=
l complete/partial silence of the mind. It is very counter-productive. Befo=
re any ritual, we are expected to do praanaayaama.=A0The idea is that you g=
et as much control over breathing and hence on mind, and then rely on the m=
editation/japam/ homam to take the mind further into calmness.
=A0
If you a=
re somebody who can maintain calmness of your mind even as you rush through=
 some hymns in haste, then I see no problem. But, normally, rushing through=
 something under time pressure destroys the calmness of the mind.
=A0
On th=
e other hand, if you do not have artificial pressures to meet a count and g=
o calmly as long as you can, it is more conducive to the calming down of th=
e mind.
=A0
Thus, I strongly recommend doing japam at the pace that is comf=
ortable and not detrimental to the calmness and focus of mind. If necessary=
, I recommend dumping restrictions like meeting a count. In fact, in this a=
ge and time, it is probably better to not have a target count at all and ha=
ve a target time only. In other words, don't say "I will do this mantra for=
 1008 times" and instead say "I will do this mantra for 40 minutes". Then, =
for those 40 minutes, you can focus on the mantra calmly.
=A0
Of course, qu=
antity also matters. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definitely better =
than half hour. But quantity without quality is useless. Very focussed medi=
tation for half hour is better than distracted meditation for 4 hours. If y=
ou can maintain the quality, then quantity starts to matter.
=A0
Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha

Assuming that one has limited time for japa (or other sadhana), which i=
