Hinduism: The Universal Religion

rsalism, Does Hinduism Teach that All
Religions are the Same?" Dr. Frank Mo=

THIS is a booklet in which the author, a practicing Hindu considered=

America's leading authority on Hinduism, reiterates his important
message =
that Sanatana Dharma must be understood and practiced only in
its original =
form if it is to survive and thrive as the world's most
important and relev=
ant spiritual tradition.

All human beings have a common religious urge=97a=
 seeking to contact the
Divine or a higher spiritual reality=97which has ha=
d different
expressions according to the time, place, culture and the indiv=
idual
himself or herself. Due to different beliefs and practices in existin=
g
religions, something that is regarded as holy in one religion may be
cons=
idered unholy in another. As a result, religion has often
prevented the spr=
ead of unity among human beings; it has instead, led
to disagreement, hatre=
d, war and even genocide in the world.

In an effort to be tolerant and mor=
e inclusive than others, Hinduism
has made "the blanket that all religions =
are true, valid and equal and
lead to the same goal=97what could be called =
a `radical universalism',"
says the author. It is this radical universalism=
 that promotes
acceptance of all religions as same in order to lead us to u=
nity
behind our religious strivings=97it is immaterial what religion one
fo=
llows or whether one goes to a church, mosque or a temple. One needs
to hav=
e full faith in the religion that one has adopted to reach the
highest trut=
h.

Different religions of the world contain various doctrines and
teaching=
s that cannot all be equally valid. Here the author states
that the law of =
karma and rebirth, for example, is either true or
false. "If it is true, th=
en religions which do not teach it are
flawed. If it is not true, then the =
religions that teach are
incorrect. Both cannot be true at the same time." =
He says that
similarly there can be no final guru, prophet or saviour for a=
ll
humanity. Religion should, in its real import, be a quest for eternal
tr=
uth and "seeking to realise it within our own consciousness." This
means th=
at we question everything and accept only that which is proved
by our exper=
iences.

Hindu Dharma "teaches us pluralism relative to the spiritual life,=

which can both tolerate many points of view but also discriminate
between =
them and find out what is best for each individual." Thus an
enlightened pl=
uralism must rest upon a higher sense of discrimination.

In this book Dr M=
orales bases his views on a rationality reflecting
the great principles of =
Vedanta, which insist upon a clear
understanding of the issue and not just =
the imposition of one's belief
as the answer. He shows how the Hindu tradit=
ion does not teach us
blind equation of all religions, but instead emphasis=
es on enlightened
pluralism. This not only allows the existence of many pat=
hs but
insists that only a razor-sharp path can take us to our highest goal=
.

It is heartening to read a Western scholar of Hinduism say that a
tradit=
ional Hindu has always been the most tolerant of all religious
persons and =
that Hindu India has been the sole nation on earth where
the Jewish communi=
ty was never persecuted and who have lived in India
for over 200 years. Sim=
ilarly Zoroastrian refugees, escaping the
destruction of Persian civilisati=
on at the hands of Islamic
conquerors, were greeted with welcome refuge in =
India over 1,000 years
ago. The Zoroastrian community, now known as Parsis,=
 has thrived in
India in all these many centuries, living together as they =
do with
their Hindu neighbours in peace and mutual respect. He says that in=

keeping with the Vedic adage that the guest in one's home is to be
treated=
 with as much hospitality as a visiting divinity, Hindus have
always lived =
peacefully with indigenous Indian religions like
Buddhism, Jainism and Sikh=
ism and even the foreign religions like
Christianity and Islam.
