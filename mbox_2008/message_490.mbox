>
> Namaste,
>  
> You misunderstood me. The appearance was not "before =
me". It was 
before my guru Dr Manish Pandit. The only other person present=
 on 
the temple premises at that time was the gentleman I mentioned, who 
l=
ost his job after starting Kaali mantra and went to India for 
pilgrimage. =
I was not there then. Though I was chanting with Manish 
on other days, I w=
as sent away on that specific day to visit Kanchi 
and Tirunavannamalai (Ra=
mana Maharshi's place).
>  
> I understand it was Mahaakaali who gave a dar=
shan and asked Manish 
to spread homam as a spiritual sadhana in the world.=
 She told him 
that she would arrange all the resources needed and asked hi=
m to 
just start. She also apparently told him of a sequence of events 
tha=
t were to happen.
>  
> Interestingly, the head priest of that temple had s=
ome books on 
homam gifted to Manish and me on the very next day. Neither M=
anish 
nor I asked him for such books. We never expressed interest in doing=
 
homam or learning homam. He himself got the inspiration. There was a 
boo=
k on different styles of homam for Ganesha and another book (by 
Ramakrishn=
a Mutt, Chennai!) on the procedures for various types of 
homam. Manish and=
 I were gifted one copy each. I perused those books 
to devise the short me=
thod described in the manuals.
>  
> *        *        *
>  
> Interestingl=
y, how we met that priest and how this shata Chandi 
homam was arranged is =
based on interesting coincidences. The son of 
the guru of a local priest w=
as visiting greater Boston temporarily. 
He was a famous sivacharya (a spec=
ial group of priests) from Chennai 
and the head priest of Kaalikambal temp=
le in Chennai. We merely went 
to take his blessings on a Thursday night. W=
e chatted a little with 
him and then my wife asked him "what are you doing=
 on this 
Saturday". He immediately said with affection "we are doing on 
S=
aturday whatever Mrs Padmaja (my wife's name) tells us to do". 
Please note=
 that we met for the first time in this life and did not 
know each other a=
t all. My wife said "well, we perform a Satya 
Narayana vratam on every Pou=
rnima night. You are most welcome to 
attend." He said "we are coming". The=
n he called up a few guys in 
Canada and told them to cancel some events in=
 Canada. We learnt 
later that he was supposed to spend that weekend in Can=
ada. Instead, 
he decided to stay back and come to our house.
>  
> He came=
 to our house on Saturday evening (Pournima) with two other 
senior priests=
. They stayed till the end of Satya Narayana vratam 
(almost midnight) and =
enjoyed it. As soon as he entered our house, 
he declared "I must do a Chan=
di homam at your house. The mother 
wants me to do a homam here. But I have=
 one condition. I and other 
priests who come with me will not take even a =
cent. You buy the 
materials needed, but give no money." Even though we wer=
e not 
excited about the condition, we said ok.
>  
> During the navaratris=
 of 2005, a few days after a solar eclipse on 
my lagna (when Sun, Moon, Me=
rcury and Ketu were in Kanya - my lagna 
and 8th house from Moon), he came =
with 3 other priests and did a 
Chandi homam in really grand style. It was =
an amazing experience. It 
was actually the first time in my life that I he=
ard Chandipath. I 
had never heard it before. Interestingly, I had my own b=
iases. In 
the morning, I actually prayed to Mahalakshmi (my ishta devata),=
 "O 
Mother, these priests want to do Chandi homam at my house and I 
conse=
nted. I don't know who Chandi is. Whichever deity they call, I 
will be thi=
nking of you only. You please come and bless us." It was 
partly innocent a=
nd partly foolish.
>  
> This was my first exposure to Chandipath and the f=
irst Chandi 
homam at my house. To think that I have now done more than 320=
 
Chandi homas at my house..
>  
> *        *        *
>  
> Manish was con=
cerned about the continued troubles faced by the 
Sankaracharya of Kanchi (=
the state government filed some cases 
against him) and he decided that we =
had to perform a Shata Chandi 
homam for his relief. He was not sure when a=
nd where it should 
happen.
>  
> After the Chandi homam at our house, we b=
ecame close to that 
priest and kept meeting him regularly (until he left B=
oston). When I 
mentioned Manish's wish to him, he said "Sir, we will do th=
e Shata 
Chandi homam he wanted at our temple. I will arrange everything. Y=
ou 
and Manish Pandit just come and sit for the event. We will take the 
sa=
nkalpa you want. I will do everything."
>  
> Finally, the shata Chandi hom=
am was conducted March 1-7, 2006. 
Interestingly, on the 64th day from the =
poornahuti of that homam, 
the ruling government of that state was defeated=
 in elections and a 
new government came.
>  
> Manish put it this way late=
r "Narasimha, who are we to help a 
great saint like Sankaracharya? We are =
not capable of helping him. 
We are really of no use. The idea was not that=
 we would help him. 
The idea is that we would help *ourselves* because of =
the positive 
intention to help Sanakaracharya! It is all Her play. See, th=
e 
Mother gave the thought of helping him and brought us to Chennai. 
Then =
she appeared and instructed to spread homam. Now so many people 
are doing =
homam and benefiting. In future, many many more will do. 
All this is happe=
ning because of a positive intention to help 
Sanakaracharya."
>  
> Though=
 the dates for shata Chandi homam were picked almost 
arbitrarily, there wa=
s one interesting coincidence. The day on which 
the ritual was started (20=
06 March 1) was actually the lunar 
birthday (tithi pravesha) of Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa. In fact, the 
time when we took sankalpam formally and kicke=
d off the 7-day-long 
ritual (in the morning of March 1) was interestingly =
within a couple 
of minutes from the *exact* Tithi Pravesha time (time at w=
hich the 
same fraction of same tithi is left as at birth) of Ramakrishna 
=
Paramahamsa. This was not planned and was a mere coincidence. In 
fact, I n=
oticed it after the fact!

the homam movement that is slowly picking up. I am=
 fortunate to be 
picked as an instrument in this spiritual movement.
