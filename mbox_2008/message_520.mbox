Namaste,
 
Every tradition has a valid basis, but also corrupted in time..
=
 
So many people touch the feet with hands or forehead when bowing to elder=
s. It is incorrect to say that "all of elder's punyas" are transferred then=
. So many people touch the head of youngsters with hand to bless. It is inc=
orrect to say that "all of youngster's sins" are transferred then.
 
Howeve=
r, this belief is not without a basis. When a person touches the feet of a =
person with awakened energy, *some* transfer of energy occurs automatically=
, whether or not one is aware (that is why we have the tradition of touchin=
g the feet of saints). However, how much energy gets transferred is depende=
nt on the capabilities of the two persons, the strength of the desire in th=
e two persons for (or against) the transfer and the previous rina between t=
he person.
 
It is not necessary to touch the feet of a person with the for=
ehead. It is possible to touch with hands and receive energy. Once one youn=
g man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched my feet at the end to =
take blessings. Normally, when people to do that, I mentally say "sarvam Sr=
i Krishnarpanamastu" and imagine that the obeisance is going to Lord Krishn=
a. But, this time, I could clearly feel some energy leaving me. It was a ve=
ry tangible feeling. This person touched specific spots in the two feet wit=
h a specific mudra of the two hands.
 
Of course, one can dismiss my feelin=
g as a hallucination. But, when the same young man came to a Satya Narayana=
 vratam at my house later in the week and touched the feet of a very good p=
riest who came from India (the same one who I said performed the first Chan=
di homam at my house, arranged for the shata Chandi homam in Chennai and ha=
d books on homam gifted to us), he immediately exclaimed "sir, we have to b=
e careful with this boy! He seems to do some sadhana. He definitely knows h=
ow to take away some energy from people." I had not told him what I had exp=
erienced a few days back and this was his independent conclusion after the =
same experience as mine!
 
I am convinced that some enegy give and take hap=
pens when feet and head are touched for blessings. However, it requires a c=
ertain level of ability and purity to receive energy from someone by touchi=
ng feet. So many people touched my feet. Only a handful gave me the feeling=
 that some energy left me.
 
There is another way to look at this. If a per=
son gets something from me, it is probably because there is some rina. Why =
should I try to resist a payback of rina? Who are we anyway to give or to t=
ake? All the energy deposited in all the beings of this universe is Hers an=
yway. Why should one look at the energy deposited in oneself as one's own?
=
 
*        *        *
 
My simple bottomline advice is this:
 
If someone p=
ays obeisance to you, let them do it. Do not feel proud or superior when so=
meone touches your feet. Think that Krishna (or Shiva) in him is paying obe=
isance to Krishna (or Shiva) in you and offer it to Krishna (or Shiva). Whe=
n you touch the feet of someone, feel humble and think that the person you =
are bowing to is a limited manifestation of Krishna (or Shiva). Leave the r=
est of the karma/energy calculations out and do not worry.
 
At the same ti=
me, if someone does not let you touch his/her feet, just bow to them and pa=
y obeisance in the mind without a physical touch. You can still feel humble=
 and think that the person you are bowing to is a limited manifestation of =
Krishna (or Shiva).
 
A lot of this is in the mind and controlling the mind=
 is the key.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

RSH OBEISANCE


        Adarniya Narasimha Guruji Namaste,

        I had a=
rranged for the first time Chandi Homam at my house on Friday. The Brahmin =
priest did a excellent pooja. During Durga swaroopini Kanya(small girl 7 ye=
ars old) poojan I asked her to take her feet out so that I could touch the =
her feet with my forehead to offer my obeisance & I normally do touch the f=
eet with my fore head during the Namaskar. The Brahmin Pujari prevented me =
from touching the feet of girl as well as his feet with my forehead saying =
that if a person touches the feet of a guru/elder with forehead all the pun=
ya of the Guru/Elder will transfer to me & incase the Guru keeps his hand o=
n my head all his sins will be transfered to me. Please shed light on this
=

        Regards

        Vinayak P Tandle
