Shivapuri Baba
---------------
I. A Short Life Sketch 
1. Bi=
rth:

Sivapuri Baba was born on Moolam Nakshathram (star) in the month of 
=
Bhadra 1883, corresponding to AD 1826, as the son of Narayanan 
Nambudiripa=
d of Oruvannur Mana, near Guruvayur, Kerala. 
2. Childhood: He was named as=
 Jayanthan. Since parents died early, 
his grandfather brought him up. 

3.=
 Brahmacharyam: As per custom, he entered the Brahmacharyam stage 
(Upanaya=
nam) at the early age of 6 or 7, and started studying Vedams 
and Sanskrit.=
 By the time he completed Brahmacharyam in 1840, 
sufficient knowledge had =
been acquired in Sanskrit, Vedams 
Braahmanams, Ayurvedam and Astrology. 

=
4. Married Life: Immediately after completing his Brahmacharyam, he 
got ma=
rried and was blessed with two sons and two daughters. 

5. Rejection of Fa=
mily : While in his twenties, Jayanthan 
Nambudiripad left his family so as=
 to be free from the worldly ties. 
In search of the eternal truth, he reac=
hed Sringeri Mutth of Aadi 
Sankaracharya. 

6. Spiritual Institution: He m=
et Achuthan, a great scholar in 
Mathematics and Astrology and a teacher at=
 the Mutth. Achuthan 
foresaw a great Samnyaasi in Jayanthan and accepted h=
im as his 
student. The future Sivapuri Baba also accepted Achuthan as his =

Daadaaji (grandfather) and learnt from him, as much as a spiritual 
instit=
ution could provide. 

7. The Last Wish of Daadaaji: Later, both he and Daa=
daaji left 
Sringeri Mutth and reached the shores of Narmada River for 
doi=
ng "Thapasya". One day Achuthan told him that he should undertake 
a pilgri=
mage around the world. 

8. The End of Daadaaji: That was his last wish. A =
few days  later, 
Daadaaji breathed his last, leaving Jayanthan all alone. =


9. The Great "Thapasya": Thereafter he  walked through the shore of 
the =
River Narmada and reached the thick forest where human contact 
was impossi=
ble. There, at a place of complete solitude, he began his 
great "Thapasya"=
 in search of the absolute truth. For nearly 20 
years, he observed deep me=
ditation. He had lost count of time, 
seasons and years. 

10. Realisation =
of the Absolute: During the last stages of this deep 
meditation with point=
ed objective of realisation of God, and with 
progressive elimination of al=
l that can support and comfort the 
senses and the mind, he was blessed wit=
h the beatific vision or the 
final enlightenment, the "Ithambara prajna". =


11. What Next ?: How can a man who had spent so many years in almost 
com=
plete solitude, re-emerge into the world of reality? But in his 
case, the =
re-emergence was with more vigour, highest wisdom and great 
determination =
to execute the programmed decisions. Only an 
enlightened  soul could do it=
. He decided to undertake a long 
pilgrimage around the length and breadth =
of the world by foot, as per 
the last wish of his Daadaaji. 

12. Bharat D=
arshan: Thus decided, from his forest retreat, he went to 
Gujarat in the w=
est, Calcutta in the east, Kanyakumari in the south 
and the Himalayas in t=
he north. 

13. Non-attachment: After the "realisation", he was a fully lib=
erated 
Samnyaasi who was above all the worldly ties. He influenced Aurobin=
da 
Ghosh at Baroda, taught Nirukalpa Samaadhi (practical) to Ramakrishna 
=
Paramahamsa at Calcutta, and taught Astrology to B G Tilak at Pune. 
But he=
 never accepted the position of a Guru (teacher) which 
connoted "attachmen=
ts". 

14. Samnyaasam: During the Indian pilgrimage, he accepted Samnyaasam=
 
from Sringeri Mutth and became "Govindaananda Bharathi". 

15. In Afghani=
stan: After India, the world pilgrimage on foot began, 
starting with Afgha=
nistan through the Khyber Pass. There he met 
Agakhan (Hassan Ali Shah), an=
d lived with him for a few days. 

16. The First Hindu to Visit Mecca: From=
 Afghanistan, he went to 
Mecca through Persia, where he established contac=
t with Shah 
Nassiruddin. During those times, entry to the holy city of Mec=
ca was 
granted only to pure Muslims who surrendered wholly to God. But he =

had obtained a special permission due to his total submission to God, 
and=
 his arguments - "God is the same for all. Mohammed was a prophet 
of God, =
and not God. Who is a pure Muslim? - He who is completely 
surrendered to G=
od. I am fully surrendered to God." He spent a few 
months at Mecca in deep=
 meditation. 

17. From Mecca to Jerusalem and Rome: From Mecca he went to =
Rome via 
the holy land of Jerusalem, Istanbul and Athens. It is a wonder a=
s to 
how he travelled on foot through the Arabian desert, which is 
daunti=
ng even for camels, and how he travelled across mountains, 
valleys and ran=
ges over and over again through the Anatolian Steppe. 

In those days, the =
holy city of Vatican was prohibited for non-
Christians. But, Govindaananda=
 Bharathi managed to stay for a few 
days at Vatican. 

18. That Long Pilgr=
image: That enlightened soul continued his 
pilgrimage on foot, covering co=
untries of Europe, England, Greenland, 
Canada, United States, countries of=
 South America, Pacific Islands, 
New Zealand, Australia, Japan, China, etc=
., and finally reached back 
in India via Tibet and Nepal. Again he took a =
final pilgrimage of 
India. During this time, he visited Kerala and his own=
 ancestral 
house where he found that nobody of his generation was living. =


19. From the Poorest to the Emperor: In this great pilgrimage of 
super-h=
uman character, he visited more than 50 countries and the 
heads of nations=
. He visited queen Victoria as an adviser and the 
queen found him as a man=
 beyond the curtain of death. In Germany, he 
stayed in the Garden of Wilhe=
lm Kaiser II. While in Germany, once he 
told Einstein : "Absolutely speaki=
ng, only God exists. So, the 
question of adding one thing to another canno=
t be entertained. 
Relatively speaking, no two things or beings are exactly=
 alike. Thus, 
to say that, 1 + 1 equals 2, is convincing and convenient, b=
ut not 
precise." 

When he was introduced to the materialist George Bernar=
d Shaw, Shaw 
said: "I hate Indian Samnyaasis who have no value for time." =
He 
immediately responded: "You are the slaves of time. We are much 
beyond=
 the constraint of time". 

But his stay was not confined only to big citie=
s like London, Berlin 
or New York, or great houses. He used to wander on f=
oot from village 
to village meeting all types of people. 

20. Sivapuri Ba=
ba: When he returned after the long and great 
pilgrimage, he was about 99 =
years old. He, then decided to spend the 
rest of his life in the forest of=
 Sivapuri, near Kathmandu, Nepal. 
Thereafter, Govindaananda Bharathi becam=
e Sivapuri Baba. Even after 
the age of 100, he often used to undertake pil=
grimage to Kasi and 
other places, on foot. 

21. At Dhruvasthali: At the a=
ge of 120, he shifted to Dhruvasthali - 
another forest retreat - nearly 1.=
5 km from Pasupathinath Temple, 
Kathmandu, due to cancer which he himself =
later cured with Yoga, 
after medical advice failed. 

22. Mahaasamaadhi: O=
n the morning of 28-01-1963 (Monday) at 6.15, he 
told his devotees : "Now =
I am going". he also gave his last 
advice : "Live right life; worship God;=
 that is all, that is enough". 
Then he drank some water and rested on both=
 his hands and breathed 
his last in the sitting position at 6.30. 

II. Si=
ddhis (Super-human Powers) 
1. Astral Vision: Being a man who had realised =
the "Absolute Truth", 
Sivapuri Baba had astral vision and omnipotent power=
. But he was 
extremely calm and serene, and never felt tense or anxious. V=
ery 
rarely did he use his powers, believing that it may create reactions 
=
and disturb the serenity. Yet it will be appropriate to mention a few 
of h=
is super-human character. 

2. Friendship with Wild Animals: In Sivapuri fo=
rest, wild animals 
like tiger used to terrify the visitors. But, Baba will=
 say : "They 
will not harm you, if friendship is extended". Sometimes the =
tigers 
would take a few rounds of Babaji and return. Baba would often offe=
r 
them sugar cane chips, which they would eat before retreating to the 
fo=
rest. 

3. Meditation: Timilsina had served Babaji for nearly 37 years. One=
 
day Babaji asked him to bring provision from the market downhill, and 
th=
en went into deep meditation. From the 10,000 ft. high Sivapuri, it 
would =
take 5 or 6 hours to reach the town. By the time Timilsina 
reached the tow=
n, he had high fever, and therefore, could not return 
for the next 9 or 10=
 days. Worrying what Baba would say for such a 
long delay, when he reached=
 the Aasram, Baba was still in meditation. 
It was nearly a day later that =
Babaji opened his eyes, saw him, and 
asked : "Have you not gone yet?" He w=
as not aware of the passage of 
time. 

Even in the normal course, Babaji u=
sed to take meals only once or 
twice a month. 

4. The Experience of the M=
aharaja of Travancore: When Babaji was in 
Kerala, he visited the Maharaja =
of Travancore. When they were 
talking, Babaji suddenly felt a shock. The M=
aharaja asked for the 
reason, and was told that at that moment, somebody e=
xpired in Nepal, 
3,000 km away. The Maharaja was astonished when he confir=
med it over 
the phone. Then the Maharaja asked him to predict when he (the=
 
Maharaja) will die. Babaji said such predictions are not appropriate, 
bu=
t when insisted, said : "A great son of Kerala will die in an 
accident and=
 yours will be soon after." This prediction was true, the 
person referred =
to was Kumaran Asan.

III. Babaji's Teachings in Brief 
1. Do the necessary=
 duties for maintaining life, and think mostly of 
God. 
2. Every thing can=
 go against us till we know God. 
3. God can be experienced, but never expl=
ained. 
4. If God is seen and known, there are no more troubles; fears; pai=
ns 
and doubts are gone for ever. 
5. Intensify your longing for God. Let t=
he thought of God alone be in 
your mind; destroy all other thoughts. You w=
ill see God, and all    
your problems are solved.
