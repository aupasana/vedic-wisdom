Hello,

This is my first post. I have been perusing this forum with great
i=
nterest. I have a question. If anybody, especially Narasimha Ji, has
a spar=
e moment to answer I would really appreciate it.

 Personally, I do not lik=
e to do Japa with a Mala, as I feel this
makes the whole process very mecha=
nical and preoccupies my mind with
issues such as not crossing the Meru, ha=
ndling the Mala properly
etc..I find my mind dwelling on these issues rathe=
r than the mantra
itself. 

1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?

1. W=
hat are the ramifications of crossing the Meru bead?

I know some scripture=
s say Japa done with Mala (in my case Vishnu
mantra done with Tulsi Mala) i=
s more effective then japa done without
Mala. 

2. Is this meant to be take=
n seriously? 

3. What should one concentrate when reciting Japa for purpos=
e of
remedial measures? The mantra, the devata, one's goals?

Thank you so =
much.
