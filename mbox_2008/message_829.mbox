Namaste,
 
I happened to be at a Sudarsana homam performed by a local pries=
t at the house of some friends in North Carolina. The priest made a mistake=
 which made me realize that others may be making that mistake too!
 
That p=
riest performed the homam with a small fire in a big rectangular aluminum t=
ray. Of course, I had my copper homa kundam with me and had just performed =
a homam before going there and my host too had a copper homa kundam with hi=
m and either of us would've been happy to bring the homa kundam and lend it=
 to the priest for the ritual. But the priest just performed in an alumimum=
 tray, which is not ideal. But that is not the mistake I am referring to.
 =

He offered a full dry coconut and some grains as poornaahuti. Though dry c=
oconut burns well if it catches fire, this gentleman dropped it away from t=
he fire and it did not catch fire. The grains also did not burn. The food h=
e offered before poornaahuti was also too much for the fire and did not bur=
n. Had the full coconut caught fire, there would have been a big fire and e=
verything would have probably burnt. But it didn't and a lot was left unbur=
nt.
 
It is in general not good if something offered in homa kundam does no=
t burn, especially poornaahuti. Make sure that your poornaahuti burns. If y=
ou offer a dry coconut or a dry coconut half or a dry coconut piece in poor=
naahuti, make sure that it is in contact with fire (so that it catches fire=
). If you offer a regular coconut (advisable only if you have a big homa ku=
ndam and a big fire), make sure you pour enough ghee on it so that it catch=
es fire completely. In any case, the poornaahuti needs to be burn fully.
 
=
If poornaahuti or some other offerings don't burn fully, it is fine to burn=
 it on the next day by performing homam in the same homa kundam. You can co=
ntinue doing homam daily without emptying the homa kundam of the ashes from=
 the previous day.
 
But, if you do a one-off homam like that priest, make =
sure that your poornaahuti burns fully.
 
When you are in front of a fire a=
nd making an offering, some of your karmas are brought to the top of the "p=
ile of karmas" for burning. If you make the offering in fire properly with =
a decent mental focus, most of that karma burns and what is left for experi=
encing is minimal. On the other hand, if you make an offering and it does n=
ot burn, you brought out a karma to the top of the pile and it did not burn=
. You now have to face it!
 
If you are one with a *perfect* sense of surre=
nder who can take *anything* with an equal vision, all this is inapplicable=
. But, if you are still trying to get there and doing homam to help you get=
 there, this is quite applicable.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
