Namaste,

Whether the astronomical calculations used by today's astrologers are 
correct or grossly wrong is beyond the scope of this yahoogroup. Please take 
this discussion to vedic-astrology or some such yahoogroup. This yahoogroup 
is strictly discussing spiritual matters.

There is no benefit for the spiritual progress of anybody here if arguments 
are made with highly opinionated proponents of fringe theories as far as 
astrology and astronomy are concerned. Such people come with deep 
convictions and have a different idea regarding several basics. Even after a 
long debate, it is likely that both sides stick to their positions and no 
agreement is reached. I have been through such useless debates many times on 
vedic-astrology yahoogroup and wiser from the experience. Moreover arguments 
with people who have displayed a militant disposition are particularly 
unproductive.

Please everybody drop the topic of astrology and its calculations.

Mr Avtar Krishen Kaul, you got your opportunity and made your point. Please 
stop harping now and leave this topic. Those who have a rina with you, share 
your samskaras and are destined to be guided (or misguided) by you have been 
exposed to your view now. That is enough. You cannot expect to get more from 
this forum. This forum is NOT for discussing astrology and astronomical 
calculations. Please leave this discussion now.

I taught astrology at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam several times. I met Nandan 
Chirmulay, a good astrologer and an engineer, there. He was a fellow 
teacher. He apparently got into astrology to disprove it!

When he was doing BTech at IIT, Bombay, he argued with some classmates that 
astrology was nonsense. Dismissing a subject without knowing it well enough 
is unwise. So he took up a study of astrology. He intended to confirm that 
it does not work. But, as he learnt it, he realized that it has some worth 
in it and not nonsense as he believed. He realized that our understanding 
may not be perfect and we cannot be 100% successful with predictions, but it 
has worth in it and works with a reasonable success rate. Now he is an 
astrologer and astrology teacher.

Such people are rare. There are far more people who pronounce judgments on 
subjects they have not studied in depth.

Best regards,
Narasimha
