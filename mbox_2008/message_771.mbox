Shri Rajesh,
Namaskar. 
You had asked for Utpalji's words, I know.. But=C2=
=A0wanted to give=C2=A0mho.
First, we cannot compare the mortals to the hum=
an form of The Lord. Lord Rama could after=C2=A0His=C2=A0Task simply *give =
up* everything and return to Vaikunta. Sri Krishna at the end of His Avatar=

Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya



Namaste,

I have read the =
contents of utpal.. that had raised few questions in to my mind.. i would b=
e happy if utpal can answer me..

1. Supressing desire cannot be termed as =
a brahmacharya. .right?
2. To control desire is also not brahmacharya? 

In=
 our vedic books also, it is specifically mentioned that DHANYO GRUHASTHASH=
ARAM. Lord rama was also married and had kids..still he was called Maryada =
purushottam. ..Lord Krishna has 8 patranis and 16000 gopia.. well does it m=
ean that Lord krishna had physical relationship with all of them.. or he ha=
d not? that is all together different issue..But lord krishna was shringar =
priya=C2=A0 and=C2=A0 it seems that he had enjoyed physical realtionship. .=
 (???)=C2=A0 still he was called brahmachari. . how? i am bit confused.. 

=
I personally feel that to have sexual desire and not fulfilling it,=C2=A0 c=
annot be termed as brahmacharya. . it is like cheating yourself... and if y=
ou are married and if you donot fulfill desire of your spouse is also not g=
ood.. Please advise.

Thanks

Rajesh

Namaste,

Let m=
e put some thoughts and i'll continue writng as it keeps on 
occuring to me=
...

1) Thakur's marraige was never a marriage in physical sense

2) The au=
thor of 'Autobiography of a Yogi', Paramhamsa Yogananda has 
mentioned in t=
he same book that his parents lived like a Husband & 
wife only once a year=
 to biget child.

3) I've read some where that our ancient Rishis though ma=
rried, 
lived extremely restarined married life and that too only to beget =

children.

4) Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all monastic disci=
ples 
of Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri 
=
Ravishankar and countless known realised souls never married (We 
assume th=
at they maintained perfect brahmacharya) .

5) Many saints such as Tukaaram=
, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Jalaaram, 
Rishis of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jan=
a Bai, and many other saints 
were married. but i am confident that at some=
 stage in their life 
they would have ended, forever, the physical relation=
ship with their 
spouses.

6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical & Menta=
l. physical 
brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not ju=
st the 
procreative organs.

There are many things looks contradictory in a=
bove but if one see 
deeper then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a c=
ommon truth. 
what i've started believing from the above written thoughts a=
s well 
as many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one of the most 
=
important vertue for realisation. but it seems that even married 
people wi=
ll also start maintaining that, knowingly or unknowingly 
before final real=
isation. actually, it seems that Like realisation, 
Brahmachrya aslo DAWNS =
!!!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
