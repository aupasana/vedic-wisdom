OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA
Dear Sri Narasimha P.V.R Rao Ji,
Namaskar.
Thanks for Ajit=
 Krishna Ji's information and your clarrification. At 
the same time kindly=
 permit me to put forward my request regarding 
such holy events. If it is =
possible to include people living in 
India also for such advice it will be=
 of great help to us all to 
celebrate the events correctly. Because here a=
lso we have such 
discrepancy in day.
As Krishna Ji has mentioned earlier, =
if the middle part of the tithi 
does not synchronize with midnight of the =
day, then how to celebrate 
the event correctly. 
With respects.
Yours Sinc=
erely,
S.Dheenadayalan
