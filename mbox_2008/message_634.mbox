Dear Utpal,

ogress?

One person may be seeing visions of deities, experiencing mystical=
 things 
and another person may not be experiencing any such "extraordinary=
" things. 
Yet, the latter may realize Self first. It IS possible.

Believe=
 me, all it takes for Her is a split second to turn a fool into a 
self-rea=
lized person.

You will do yourself a big favor if you take the thoughts of=
 "extraordinary 
experiences" off your mind. These expectations are a big o=
bstacle.

If you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticize=
s you badly 
and you are now able to feel normal in that situation, isn't t=
hat a 
"tangible" sign of progress? If you normally feel elated when someon=
e 
praises you to the sky and you are now able to feel normal in that 
situ=
ation, isn't that a "tangible" sign of progress?

Instead of focusing your =
senses outward and looking for some miracle or an 
"extraordinaty experienc=
e", focus your senses inward, watch your thoughts 
and instincts closely an=
d refine them. Try to reach a state where criticism 
and praise are the sam=
e for you.

That will put you in a good stead. THAT is real progress. If yo=
u make real 
progress and do not bother about any "extraordinary experience=
s" , you may 
indeed have an extraordinary experience oneday! Not the one t=
hat gets you 
stuck with a sense of possessiveness or entitlement, but the =
one that frees 
you.

thers than it is

One can get stuck in some expectations tha=
t are unknowingly formed in the 
mind based on what one read or heard.

One=
 can get stuck in possessiveness or a sense of entitlement over an 
"extrao=
rdinary experience" that actually happened to him.

One can get stuck in ma=
ny ways.

If you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have no se=
nse of 
ownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not because it wil=
l give X 
or Y or Z, but because everything is really Hers. Keep looking at=
 yourself 
and your own actions/thoughts and refine them to make the sense =
of surrender 
fuller and fuller. And expect to get nothing from Her in retu=
rn for that 
surrender. That is a surefire way to succeed in one's spiritua=
l pursuit.

Best regards,
Narasimha

I =
am inspired by many saints and Thakur being the most prominent of
them. Sri=
 Sri Ravishankar is the one who i know to be a really great
spiritual teach=
er, however i found my guru in you.

I highly appreciate your clarity of th=

simmilarity in our attitude and thoughts over years, =
however i know
for sure that there is a big gulf between our level of consc=
iousness.

through some of your messages on list as well as personla mails,=
 i am
completely convinced about one thing which is mentioned below

- Baro=
meter of spiritual growth is the reduction of I ness (limited
ego) viz-a-vi=
z increase of surrender. the feeling of being an
instrument in the hand of =
Mother/god/nature increases

what i am still not convinced about is that th=
e possibility of not
experiencing any *tangiable* extraordinary expereinces=
 but still one
is really making good progress?

If i think rationally and t=
ake the experiences of others than it is
quite clear that the spiritual gro=
wth invariably comes along with
some out of the world and tangiable experie=
nces. this some times
temporarily disappoints me.

i feel that i'll never b=

of the subtle world.

Yours,
