Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A group on Vedic his=
tory


The group of "Vedichistory" endeavors to be a professional forum on
=
indology and Vedic history on one hand and a meeting place of like
minds, e=
xchanging their views here,on the other.

groups.yahoo. com/group/ vedichis=
tory/ join 

The supreme spiritual antenna of Indian thought, Vedas have a =
place
unparalleled not only in Hinduism, but also in the world wide
scriptu=
ral literature. They are the oldest of the world scriptures.

Vedas, litera=
lly meaning the (true) knowledge, are not only the
epitomes of philosophica=
l, spiritual and religious vision, dogmas and
aptitudes, but also are a sto=
rehouse of sociological
processes, historical events and verily, the
cultur=
al thread of the Indian subcontinent. However, most of us,
whether Indians =
or foreigners, have failed to read correctly into
these great literature.

=
In an attempt to understand these super scriptures, I have not only
created=
 web pages http://www.geocitie s.com/siva_ sai19/vedas, which
have had a wi=
de acclamation from the netizens, but also recently
started a group on Vedi=
c history.

http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedichisto ry

This group endea=
vors to read into the currently available Vedas and
make the reading a comm=
entary on the historical, cultural and
spiritual saga of ancient India

How=
ever, in Vedic history, instead of projecting my views, I like
more learned=
 and the commoners alike to join and exchange views.

I cordially invite ev=
ery one of you, especially the spiritually
elevated, to join my group to ma=
ke it a success and useful to others.

groups.yahoo. com/group/ vedichistor=
y/ join 

I hope you will join and actively participate in this
humble, yet=
 noble and holy, endeavor.
