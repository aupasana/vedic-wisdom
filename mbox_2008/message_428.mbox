Dear Shri Bhadraiah Mallampalliji,
Namaskar!
I would request y=
ou to kindly go through your own post once again.

Can you pick even a sing=
le cogent reason from your own points as to 
why we should continue to foll=
ow the fraud known as Vedic astrology, 
which is neither scientific, nor lo=
gical, least of all Vedic, 
instead of celebrating our festivals and muhurt=
as on correct days, 
as advised by our shastras, logic and science--since 
=
Uttarayana/Dakshinayana/Vasanta Sampat/Hemanta Sampat etc. are all 
phenome=
na of seasons and therefore scientific!  Similarly, all the 
Vedas and Pura=
nas have fixed certain days for rituals!  E.g., 
Nirjala Ekadashi is a sort=
 of Tapasya only if we observe it in 
Summer, when we feel most thirsty, wh=
ereas in Winter, it is hardly 
worthwhile!  And that is what we will be doi=
ng after a few centuries-
-celebrating that day in Winter--thanks to "Vedic=
 astrologers" and 
their "Vedic astrology"

One of your questions is even h=
ilarious!  You have said
<When Vedic yajna kanda says if vashat call is giv=
en at wrong time
some mishap happens, yajamana's son may die, did it happen=
 really?>

My counter question is:  If you have no faith in celebrating 
fe=
stivals and muhurtas on correct days, why celebrate them at all, 
since if =
no harm has come by celebating them on wrong days, 
certainly, no harm will=
 come by not celebrating them at all!  Why 
waste your precious time and en=
ergy and money in celebrating them at 
all?

Another counter question is:  =
Since you are defending "Vedic 
astrology" with all the might at your comma=
nd, can you quote any 
instances where it has done any good to any nation o=
r country?  On 
the other hand, we have instances galore where it has done =
the 
maximum harm:  Our erstwhile Hindu neighbouring country is a glaring 
=
example of its "suicide" because of an extraordinary infatuation 
for "Vedi=
c astrology".  So is the example of the BJP which had 
an "akalamrityu" by =
advanding the last election by several months on 
the advice of its "Minist=
er of Astrology"!

Similar was the case with "the greatest Vedic astrologer=
 of 
twentieth century"---he overestimated his own life span on the basis 
=
of "Vedic astrology" and instead of making preparations for 
Yamaloka, he p=
lanned, on the basis of his "cherished science", to 
deliver a lecture on "=
Astrology as a guide to preventing heart 
attacks" but he met an "astrologi=
cally" unscheduled end and that 
also because of "cardiac arrest!"!  His jy=
otisha magazine also has 
got stopped completely--that "event" also was not=
 foreseen by 
any  "Vedic astrologer"---since his own offspring fought amon=
g 
themselves like Kilkenny cats over the spoils of the "Vedic jyotisha 
em=
pire".  And mind you, all his offspring were "top notch Vedic 
astrologers"=
 and even "Vastu experts" as per their own claims in 
that very defunct mag=
azine!

Then another "Vedic astrologer" of repute made a fool of himself by=
 
declaring that a genetleman of Betul would die at 4-30 pm on a 
particula=
r date abouit two years back, but unfortunately for 
that "Vedic astrologer=
", that Betul man is still going strong!

Of course, these are just tips of=
 iceberg and God only knows what 
damage has been done by dint of "Vedic as=
trology" to the nation 
otherwise!
Is that the "benevolent" aspect of "Vedi=
c astrology" you are talking 
about and defending?
The most glaring damage =
it has done is that our budhi has become 
Tamasik---we have become "budhi b=
rashta" since we have started 
viewing the adharma of celebrating all our f=
estivals and muhurtas on 
wrong days as the real dharma and simultaneously =
calling and 
defending those predictive gimmikcs that compel us to celebrat=
e our 
festivals etc. on wrong days as "Vedic astrology"!
I do not know wha=
t other "beneficial results" you are expecting 
from "Vedic astrology"!
Wit=
h regards,
A K Kaul
