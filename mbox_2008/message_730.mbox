Namaste Rajarshi ji,

today when =

peice (square or round =
shape) put it in homa kund and light it by 
some external stick lighted fro=
m a ghee-lamp.

during Homam- 1) I keep vigile that fire remains always suf=
ficiently 
blazing.

2) if still in case if it extinguishes, i lit it again=
 with Camphor 
pieces and carry on without worrying about anything as if no=
thing has 
happenned. MahaGanapati for sure will not be unhappy even if suc=
h a 
thing happenned even after careful conduct..but NOT on account of

warm regards,

you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is

 Yes, you can do it on a r=
ooftop. Doing it in the open is <BR>actually better than doing it in closed=
 space. But realize that a <BR>rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella ar=
ound to protect the fire <BR>if it rains while you are doing homam. It is n=
ot good if fire is <BR>extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand <BR>a=
t the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.<BR>> <BR>> > 2)While=

 repeat mentally while listening attentively (not <BR>casually). Actually, =
even listening to mantras with all the attention <BR>focused is as powerful=
 as saying mantras.<BR>> <BR>> Suppose person X is chanting a mantra =
and thinking of <BR>some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is li=
stening to it <BR>with focus and thinking
 of the mantra and its deity. The=
n the mantra <BR>may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit f=
rom the <BR>mantra. The word mantra means "one that protects the mind".. On=
e can <BR>say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is <=
BR>control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.<BR>>=
; <BR>> However, there is a difference between meditation and <BR>homam.=
 Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it <BR>is submi=
tted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some <BR>external s=
ound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent <BR>chanting or j=
ust listening. Try to repeat slowly.<BR>> <BR>> > 3)Can bachelors =

 Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) <BR>has been performed c=
an do it. Bachelor or married is
 irrelevant.<BR>> <BR>> One should f=
ollow the yamas and niyamas set by one's <BR>guru. Whatever rules one's gur=
u sets, one should follow them <BR>strictly. At the minimum, one should eat=
 only vegetarian food on the <BR>day of homam and take a bath before homam.=
 Another rule I will <BR>recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hour=
s before homam.<BR>> <BR>> By the way, if one without a sacred thread=
 wants to do <BR>homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respons=
ibility and <BR>allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my gu=
ru as guru <BR>and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurre=
d in the <BR>process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of pu=
rity <BR>through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no <=
BR>sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter <BR>a=
fter a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The <BR>goal =
of upanayanam and other
 mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up <BR>and m=
ake the person cross the threshhold of purity.<BR>> <BR>> As long as =
one desires no specific material benefits (and <BR>ready to receive whateve=
r god gives) and does homam for spiritual <BR>progress, I am willing to hel=
p, even if it means some suffering for <BR>me.<BR>> <BR>> > 4)Any =

; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. <BR>But any day=

d rooftop homam reminded me of my India <BR>trip.<BR>> <BR>> When I w=
ent to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish <BR>traveled together to sev=
eral places (on a specific project). We ended <BR>up doing homam in the mor=
ning in several places (wherever we were). <BR>Before the trip, my guru tol=
d me to carry an umbrella with me. As <BR>monsoons come only in June/July i=
n India, I did
 not take it <BR>seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.=
. We proceeded to the <BR>rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to d=
o a homam. Manish <BR>told me, "Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in t=
his city after <BR>our homam finishes". I just smiled.<BR>> <BR>> To =
my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas <BR>finished. After we offere=
d poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining <BR>with really big drops. Lucki=
ly, there was a small towel/blanket on <BR>the rooftop close to us. Togethe=
r, we held it on top of the two small <BR>homa kundas, closed our eyes and =
meditated. We held the cloth cover <BR>on the homa kundas until fire in the=
 two homa kundas went off and <BR>then packed everything and went down. We =
left for Kurukshetra later <BR>that day, but we were told that a heavy rain=
 continued for a few days <BR>in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on th=
at trip as we covered <BR>the north, east and west of India. It rained in e=
very
 place we went <BR>to, as we finished our task in that place and prepa=
red to move on.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> --=
