The Best Treatment For Acute Back Pain   
Do you know what it's like to have a sudden, sharp pain in your back         that you know is going to lead to several days of terrible pain and stiffness? 
  I am very familiar with this scenario from my own experiences with 
  back pain and from my work as a chiropractor for many years. 

If you know what this feels like, then you might find what I have to say 
  next to be surprising. 

The best thing that you can do for yourself as soon as you feel 
  that familiar spasm or pull in your back muscles is the following: 

Nothing. 

No matter what you are doing - shovelling snow, carrying groceries, 
  painting, laundry, or exercising 
   
  - stop immediately and lay down on the closest comfortable surface. 
   
  You want to lay down with your knees bent up so that your feet are flat 
  on the floor, or so that your calves are resting on several pillows or 
  on a chair. As you lay down, try to relax all of your muscles, 
  especially the ones in your back. You can facilitate effective relaxation 
  by taking slow, deep breaths from your tummy. 

Depending on how badly you have pulled your muscles or ligaments, 
  you can lay like this for 15 minutes or 1 hour. 
   
  When you feel very relaxed, try to get up slowly, turning on your side 
  and using your arms to help lift your upper body off the ground. 
  Be sure to use your thigh muscles to stand up. If you feel any pain 
  as you try to stand up, lay down again and relax some more. 

Following this recommendation will significantly decrease the severity 
  of your injury, and will have you back to normal much sooner than if 
  you had continued on with your activities. 

Here's why... 

The first moment that you experience sharp pain in your back is a signal 
  that a muscle or ligament has been stressed beyond its natural capacity. 
  From that moment on, if the muscle or ligament in question is still being 
  asked to work, your body will create inflammation in that area, 
  which brings pain, stiffness, and swelling. 
   
  Why does your body do this? 
   
  Because pain, stiffness, and swelling are parts of a 
  protective response that your body uses 
  to get you to rest that area until it heals. 

Can you see why popping a pain killer in this situation 
  is not in your best interest? 
   
  If you numb yourself to pain, then you'll probably continue 
  being active, not giving your injured tissues a chance to rest and recover. 
  This is a great way to worsen your injury and prolong your suffering. 
   
  And let's not forget the negative side effects that pain killers 
  have on your stomach, liver and kidneys. 

At the first sign of sharp pain in their backs, many people choose to 
  continue working, finding that if they stay active and warm, 
  they don't stiffen up and they are able to remain functional 
  for a few hours or the rest of the day. 
   
  Continuing to be active after the initial injury causes your body 
  to produce natural pain killers like endorphins, 
  which gives you the illusion that you are fine. 
   
  The problem with this is that while you are not feeling much discomfort, 
  your injured tissues are continuously being stressed, which will increase 
  your pain and stiffness later on that day or the next morning. 

By laying down at the first twinge of back pain, 
  you will minimize damage to your injured tissues. 
   
  You will also minimize inflammation, which will lead to less pain 
  and stiffness. 
   
  Sometimes, if the injury isn't too severe and you are able to lay down 
  right away, you might be totally fine as soon as you stand up. 

Following this recommendation can mean the difference 
  between having back pain for one hour or for one week. 
   
  Please try it the next time you feel that awful pull or twinge 
  in your back. 

Note: some people make a trip to a physical therapist, 
  chiropractor, or massage therapist right after injuring their backs. 
   
  Unless your injury is causing you to lose control over your urine flow 
  and bowel movements, I highly recommend that you first try my suggestion. 

Why? 

Think about all of the stress that your back faces in going for treatment. 
  You have to get into your car, make the drive to the office, 
  get out of the car, sit in the waiting room, get up onto the treatment table, 
  and all of the above in reverse. 
   
  Believe me, in most cases, it is far more beneficial to lay down 
  on your living room floor for an hour than to put your back 
  through all of these steps. And your floor is free. 

If you still have pain or stiffness after resting right after your injury 
  and do not experience gradual improvement over the next few days, 
  that might be a good time to visit a practitioner 
  who can provide treatment that will hopefully help your injured tissues 
  heal properly. 
  What All People With Chronic Low Back Pain Need to Try
  


Do you know anyone who suffers from chronic low back pain? 
   
  As simple as it seems, many people with chronic low back pain 
  can improve and even fully heal their backs by doing one simple thing: 
  stretching their hamstrings. 
   
  Your hamstrings are the muscles that run along the back of your thighs, 
  from behind your knees to the bottom of your pelvis. 
   
  If your hamstrings are tight, they are causing a constant downward pull 
  on your pelvis. 
   
  Since your pelvis is the foundation of your lower back and spine, 
  having tight hamstrings contributes to an unstable lower back 
  and a greater chance of intermittent sprains and strains. 
   
  In my chiropractic practice, I estimate that at least 80 percent of people 
  who present to me with chronic lower back pain have tight hamstrings 
  as the root of their problem. 
   
  Even if these people have their lower backs treated on a regular basis, 
  they will continue to suffer from intermittent lower back pain 
  if they do not address their hamstring tightness. 
   
  How do you know if your hamstrings are tight? 
   
  The best way to assess hamstring length is to lie flat on your back 
  and have someone slowly raise one leg. 
   
  Your leg must be completely relaxed, and you must not help lift the leg 
  with your own muscles. If your hamstrings are at an appropriate length 
  for your body, your leg can be raised to 90 degrees off the ground without 
  any significant tightness anywhere along your hamstrings from 
  behind your knee to your sitting bone (pelvis). 
  If you start to feel tightness before 90 degrees, you know it's time to stretch! 
   
  A simple and effective way to stretch your hamstrings is to sit in a hurdler's stretch � with one leg tucked behind your bum, and one leg flat on the ground, outstretched in front of you - and to lean forward slightly until you feel a stretch anywhere along the back of your thigh or knee. An alternative is shown in this picture, where your resting leg is tucked in with the foot resting on the inner thigh of the leg being stretched. 
   
  It is important to keep your back straight, and to only go to a point 
  where you feel a comfortable stretch. If you experience pain, 
  ease back until you are comfortable. 
   
  Some people find that slinging a towel around their outstretched foot 
  and holding onto both ends with their hands is more comfortable 
  than bending forward without a towel. 
   
  Be sure to breathe while you stretch, and to do the same stretch 
  for your other leg. 
   
  It is best to stretch your hamstrings later on in the day, or 
  after a good warm up such as after a brisk walk or jog. 
   
  The key is to get lots of blood going through your muscles 
  before you stretch. Alternating between legs for a few minutes 
  each day is enough for most people. 
   
  Many people with chronic lower back pain 
  can experience dramatic improvement after stretching 
  their hamstrings on a daily basis for 1-3 months. 
   
  If you don't have lower back problems, 
  stretching your hamstrings everyday is an 
  excellent preventive measure 
  that will keep your lower back and pelvis 
  balanced for the years ahead.
