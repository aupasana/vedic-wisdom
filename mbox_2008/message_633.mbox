Namaste Dinesh,

Your skepticism is justified.

The duality is infinite and impossible to master. Even great jnaanis are 
occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual 
Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever. She is 
capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as 
one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She 
does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal 
with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.

> on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity

BTW, though we are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. 
In the non-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
have differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide what 
and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is 
born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. 
When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of 
things in the dual world that are impossible for others.

Realizing the non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but 
there are limits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based 
on the force of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one 
(non-dual) level and all are different at another (dual) level.

But it is tough to know for sure what one's caliber is. Thus, your basic 
point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We 
should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the 
same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what.

Best regards,
Narasimha

|| Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||

Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation? And anyway, how will
you distinguish when *those* very folks have gone beyond the meaning
of "I"? What you can only do (well, at least, IMHO) is consider
yourself blessed to read about or be part of their lives...
One part of me is skeptical whenever someone claims to be a
reincarnation of someone else, on the other hand we are all a part of
Divinity, so why bother arguing over trivial things.

What the Learned say is to pick one, and surrender yourself totally.
Me, I cant figure out who to pick to surrender to... :-) Just my
opinion, I could be wrong, and I say it with all due respect...
Best,
./Dinesh
