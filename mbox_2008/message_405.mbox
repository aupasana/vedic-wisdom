The posting is excellent. Specially=
 the following;
=A0
" Regarding balis (animal sacrifices), I want to say on=
e thing. In the old days, yogis who sacrificed animals were capable of taki=
ng some karmas of the animal being sacrificed and give it moksha or atleast=
 a much higher birth after the sacrifice. In other words, there was a give =
and take of karmas. Now-a-days, those who sacrifice animals have no such sp=
iritual caliber. They are only taking the life of the animal (bodily life w=
hich is something very dear to every being that self-identifies with a body=
 very strongly, i.e. animals and human beings) and not giving anything in r=
eturn. This causes a big karmik debt that needs to be paid back later. Thus=
, one should think seriously before sacrificing an animal in this age."
=A0=

This was an eye opener. Because there are so many yearly fairs in my local=
ity where animal sacrifice is given. Also I was=A0 wondering why this pract=
ice is in place. My doubt is clear by reading the above. Also my Kuladevata=
 is Malhari martand Khandoba at Jejuri Pune, & as per the practice I have t=
o give animal sacrifice after marraige of which I am against but mother ins=
ists it. 
=A0
One doubt if you could please clarify is the Pradikshina for =
Lord Shankar full or half?
=A0
Also since your posings & writings are ultim=
ate answers to many misconceptions & practices I kindly request you to plea=
se write a book on this misconceptions.
=A0

Namaste,
=A0
I just came =
back from my daily Chandi homam. Probably because this is a Chaturdasi, tha=
t too a Saturday night, the homam was more pleasant than usual. I cannot sl=
eep after this one right away and so let me type one more mail.

If one is an aghori who does n=
ot care about anything and is willing to go through any terrible experience=
 and still take it as Her blessing, then several things can go into fire. B=
ut others should never put red chillies in homam=A0fire. Those who throw re=
d chillies in fire and think that their petty problems will go away are foo=
ling themselves. Whatever you put in external fire is actually going into y=
our internal fire also. People having awakened shakti and subtle perception=
 may realize it and others may not realize it. But it is a fact. Now the im=
pact of red chillies on your internal fire is not at all a desirable one. O=
ne may not be realizing it because the karma may be going at the end of a l=
ong pipeline of karmas and give its result in far future, possibly even=A0i=
n a future life.
=A0
My sincere advice to all: Never ever put spicy substan=
ces like red chillies and black pepper in a homam fire, even if you are wor=
shipping a fierce deity. Respectfully ignore advice from anyone to use blac=
k pepper and red chillies to solve your problems. That practice does NOT so=
lve any problems and in fact creates further problems in future.

By the way, Pratyangira is =
not a ""bali kavar Deivam" (deity wanting animal sacrifice). It is what peo=
ple of this age made her to be. Pratyangira, as I described earlier, is a p=
owerful deity who can fill one with pure sattwa. Unfortunately, she is misu=
nderstood and her mantras and vidya are so abused and misused these days. T=
hat is why I felt compelled to write the last mail. The allegory is actuall=
y quite appropriate.
=A0
I did not write the mail to criticize Pratyangira =
sadhana. I wrote the mail and the allegory to criticize Pratyangira sadhana=
 *as done* by many people today and to put things in perspective. People do=
n't even understand what Pratyangira is for and what she can do.

imals were capable of taking some karmas of the animal being sacrificed and=

d not giving anything in return. This causes a big karmik debt that needs t=
o be paid back later. Thus, one should think seriously before sacrificing a=
n animal in this age.
=A0
Some places have sthala maahaatmya. The power of =
the place, the power of the sadhana performed by elevated beings there and =
the power of an alive deity there ensure that karmas are balanced even when=
 animals are sacrificed. Such places are few. An example may be Kamakhya.
=
=A0
At other places, a yogi with no caliber to take on the animal's karmas =
and give it a higher birth should stay away from animal sacrifice.
=A0
*=A0=

=A0
If you read Saptashati, the=
 last chapter describes how the king and the vaisya kept chanting devi sook=
tam for 3 years on a river bank. It talks about the "bali" (sacrifice) they=
 gave:
=A0
"dadatustau balim chaiva nijagaatraasruguksh itam"
=A0
It means =
"and they gave a sacrifice (bali) that was soaked with blood from *their ow=
n* bodies".
=A0
See, *that* would be something.
