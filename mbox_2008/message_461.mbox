Dear Lakshmi,
 
This is Kali yuga. While a really spiritual person must con=
tinuously try to destroy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us w=
ith bloated egos which are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly=
 excited at sycophancy. Such gurus are not of much use.
 
But how do separa=
te the grains from the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are jus=
t a few grains in the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is useful bu=
t not that much. Astrologer's mind, which makes the final judgments, works =
based on his/her prejudices and secret beliefs.
 
*        *        *
 
In =
the past, many great souls used intellectual discrimination and intuition t=
o judge one's guru for a long time before whole-heartedly embracing one's g=
uru. In many traditions within Hinduism, this is encouraged. You do not acc=
ept a guru in an impulse. You "test" your guru and take your time to accept=
 him. But, once you accept a person as your guru, you follow him faithfully=
.
 
*        *        *
 
If you take Narendra (Swami Vivekananda), the cel=
ebrated disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he was a highly rational and s=
keptical young man. Though Ramakrishna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by=
 mere touch in their second meeting itself, it was not enough to convince N=
arendra of Ramakrishna's ability and purity. He thought the whole experienc=
e could just have been a hallucination/hypnotism and did not jump to any co=
nclusion. As he visited Ramakrishna continuously, received love and knowled=
ge from him and saw that Ramakrishna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to =
just talking the talk), he was slowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishn=
a. He then became a tireless soldier who dedicated his life to carrying out=
 the mission of his guru!
 
During the early stages, he even told Ramakrish=
na bluntly about the latter's visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, "Sir, the=
y could all just be your imaginations or hallucinations". Narendra did not =
even believe in god with a form and believed only in the formless. Ramakris=
hna was never offended at these comments.
 
Other sishyas like Joginder (Sw=
ami Yogananda) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested him for a=
 duration. These young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren't blind men led=
 by a blind man. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, who were reb=
orn together for a purpose.
 
They observed Ramakrishna for a while, confir=
med that he practiced what he preached and realized that there was a valuab=
le lesson in each action and word of his. They took a while to realize his =
purity and divinity, but once they realized they became faithful sishyas. H=
e accepted them, loved them and taught them even before they realized his t=
rue nature and accepted him fully as their guru. He knew they were skeptica=
l and testing him, but he was never offended (what good is a guru who canno=
t recognize a worthy student and what good is a guru whose ego is insulted =
at someone's skepticism). Once they accepted him and became faithful sishya=
s, each one of them was also transformed into a really pure person who take=
s the entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in every thought and ac=
tion. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in spiritual purity.
 
=
*        *        *
  
One whose rinas draw one towards a fake guru gets su=
ch a guru because that is what his karmas entitle him to. The circumstances=
 we have to face are based on the previous actions. But the current action =
(freewill) is in our hands. If one can truly believe from the deepest cores=
 of heart that one's guru is pure and like Shiva himself, follows guru blin=
dly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, that WILL pay off oneday. Nature WI=
LL bring light into that person's spiritual life. It is just a matter of ti=
me.
 
Thus, I will not be judgmental about other gurus and their sishyas. I=
f a sishya believes in his/her guru fully, so be it. It is not our business=
.
 
But, if one were to find a guru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana =
Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Srila Prabhupada, it is one's immense luck. Ho=
wever, the point I want to make is that having a great guru is not a guaran=
tee of success and also having a fake guru is not a guarantee of failure!
 =

At the end of the day, the measure of success in any sadhana is the purity=
 generated by that sadhana. The measure of the purity is the effacement of =
ego. If ego is reduced completely or eliminated, one is making progress. Th=
is can happen inspite of who is the guru, what one is doing etc.
 
When the=
 full grace of the Supreme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficien=
t to reflect that grace.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Hare Rama Krishna
  Dear Narasimha.
  Sorry I got my people and linea=
ges all confused! Was reading about too many people lately.

  Also last ni=
ght  I saw a  documentary on religious leaders, cults etc.
  People want to=
 see God so badly they are very eager to push anyone who is willing to clai=
m to be special up on a pedestal.That happened with my ex , he got up there=
,felt it wasn't right and tried to climb down, but his"disciples" didn't wa=
nt him to.
  They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his purity, and =
all sorts of cover ups.
  God and Jesus are living in some many places. Som=
etimes there are several people simultaneously claiming to be Jesus in any =
psych unit across the world/
  Its amazing where and to within whom people =
see "God".
  Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living like a mortal in all cap=
acities while telling others how to find realization sort of hypocritical a=
nd bizarre?

  There is one fellow who used to be a heroin addict and now h=
e says he is Jesus and has a huge following. they are willing to do whateve=
r he says and they give him money and all sorts of things.
  Yesterday I we=
nt on the Internet, and looked at some many so called yogis, preachers etc
=
  IN the USA I cant begin to tell you the number of religious leaders that =
were revered as "God" or some other incarnation.
  India is no different, p=
erhaps worse because people have a natural respect for sadhus , yogis etc a=
nd more yogis can get away with pretending to be a renunciate.
  I believe =
God appears in different forms in different places and times to attract peo=
ple who are looking for him and to associate with his devotees..
  Now that=
 Documentary TV program and your posts got my mind swimming.
  What are pri=
nciples of religion? What is dharma, What is the purpose?
  Now if there we=
re no laws or rules, social or religious and everyone did what they felt li=
ke, we would be living in a hell. At least in Kali Yuga.
  What was the poi=
nt of Jesus? Seems he got a lot of uncivilized people to work on basic code=
s of conduct... thou shalt not steal,lie, commit adultery etc.
  Whose to s=
ay one person is a saint?.. some people(his faithful followers) couldn't un=
derstand that Charles Manson was a mad man not a prophet.
  There are other=
 "yogis" who came to USA, smoking pot, taking drugs,
  and other ones advis=
ed having sex to find self realization and acquiring tons of cars and 
  he=
lping many people trade STDs.
  Some people ADVOCate mandatory forced  marr=
iage of young girls AT puberty, usually to older men.. and its ok for their=
 fathers to teach them a thing or two, before being handed off.
  One "sain=
t" makes gold, but other people say he molested their young teenage sons..
=
  In itself, being able to perform siddhis or mystic things doesn't make on=
e elevated  really. Maybe they have just accumulated the power to manipulat=
e physical matter.
  Unless a person is pure- it is hard to see who else is=
 pure.
  And even then, well intentioned people are deceived all the time.
=

  People have given up everything they owned and moved into under ground t=
unnels because their leader( an incarnation of this or that) said the world=
 was ending.
  Or, time and time again, some swami turns out to molest kids=
, and or do all sorts of things when no one is looking..
  "The Do as I say=
 , don't do as  I do"...
  "He is so pure he doesn't have to obey the rules=
 like everyone else."
  Whose to say who is pure?
  I think someone who is =
100% serving their GOD day and night, at all times and practicing what they=
 preach has got to be pure....
  Self realization after much thought and ye=
ars meditating/chanting is simple i found... its the realization ,the compl=
ete understanding of our relationship to God and to everything and everyone=
 else in our conscious and unconscious universe.
  But then by the time I d=
ie , I'm sure I'll have even more realizations.
  There was a big article i=
n TIME magazine with some personal letter of Mother Theresa that she didnt =
want shown publically that showed her apparently having doubts(privately in=
 her heart) I guess as a way to try and discredit her.
  Was she a saint, c=
oming to India and pushing her views on the poor?People go in circles debat=
ing her worth .
  And I guess these are the things I'm here for in this lif=
e, which is different than other peoples path.
  I keep hoping astrology ca=
n "reveal" the real saint the real sadhus..etc
  Suffering helps one think =
about these things.
  Best wishes
  Lakshmi

    There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and swamis in the last =
few thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in =
one way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakt=
i yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and expe=
rienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state o=
f nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no "experience". He was in sahaja sama=
dhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touc=
h or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is wh=
y he could do all that!!!).

        Many "gurus" force their dharma on the=
ir sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of e=
ach sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the =
form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight=
 into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He tau=
ght totally different mantras, totally different forms and totally differen=
t paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to differ=
ent sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude rou=
ghed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded "shame on you. With you=
r attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You sho=
uld learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in =
a good stead and not your aggression". When another sishya who needed to me=

 away silently, he scolded him "shame on you. Shastras say that you should =
kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You=
 should give them a piece of your mind."

        Spiritual sadhana does no=
t mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a certa=
in period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one t=
ransforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every act=
ion and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for intro=
spection and transformation of internal attitude.

        Anyway, coming b=
ack to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He =
belonged to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru=
 to an exceptional group of sishyas.

        Without his [indirect] blessi=
ngs, I would be a nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able =
to say anything intelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who a=

 an instrument and not to me.

        BTW, you are all free to forward my =
posts that you like to people who may be interested in spiritual discussion=

personal. Krishna clearly says in

 your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone

 engaging in the right 
                  action/duty. Right action varies =
from person to person, from time to time 
                  and from place =

               =

                  of caste (varna) ha=
s been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of 
                 =
 caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
   =
               killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vi=
shwamitra was a 
                  kshatrita and a powerful king. He became=
 a brahmana and and a maharshi 
                  later. Basically varna sh=
ows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna 
                  of fat=
her, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one 
         =
         develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one does.=


                  Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which te=
lls you to know your 
                  dharma from your caste is wrong. Mo=
reover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
                  the world. Each =
person has individual dharma.

                  Knowing what one's dharma =
is is very very very difficult. If one is pure 
                  enough, o=
ne will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
       =
           mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a=
 lot of 
                  noise from other parts of our minds which tell o=
ther things. Thus, we get 
                  confused.

                  W=
e should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and =

                  decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We ma=
y be err, but doing 
                  the best we can is all that we can d=
o!

                  More than following dharma, what is of utmost importa=
nce is to engage in 
                  actions without identification. *Tha=
t* alone ensures that we are not 
                  accumulating new karmas=
, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build 
                  too =
much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best 
       =
           possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma =
in the given 
                  situation is), with as little attachment an=
d self-identification with the 
                  action as possible. When =
the action is finished, we should leave the result 
                  to go=
d. We should not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it 
      =
            work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication th=
rough 
                  untached action) will simplify our ego and purify =
our consciousness slowly. 
                  As we become purer, our mind w=
ill work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. 
                  There is a=
 positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our 
           =
       dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is n=
ot easy, 
                  but not as difficult as people think.

        =
          The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one=
's sense of 
                  "this is my dharma" gets refined with time i=
f one engages in action with 
                  little attachment.

       =
           * * *

                  In deciding one's dharma, one's intelle=
ct and intuition are the inputs. 
                  Another external input =
is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can 
                  deri=
ve one's dharma from them. A special place is given to one's spiritual 
   =
               master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can tak=
e the words of 
                  the master to determine one's dharma and =
follow it sincerely.

                  When Arjuna was confused about what=
 his dharma was and thought killing gurus 
                  and relatives =
was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his 
               =
   dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dha=
rma 
                  and wanted to renounce the world and go to a seclude=
d place to do sadhana, 
                  Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and=
 prevailed upon him to stay in the material 
                  world and do=
 the work of Mother for him.

                  One who is not in tune with=
 nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
                  debts a=
re and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what 
      =
            one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear=
 insight into 
                  one's inner core, such a guru can give per=
fect guidance.

                  * * *

                  Bottomline is th=
at I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
                 =
 declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from=
 
                  time to time and from place to place. Also, there are n=
o thumbrules to find 
                  out what one's dharma is. But, one =
can refine one's understanding of one's 
                  dharma by increa=
sing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
                =
  sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much 
   =
               attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one's u=
nderstanding of 
                  one's individual dharma.

=
but he was never offended (what good is a guru who cannot recognize a worth=

  <DIV>People want to see Go=

  didn't =

  <DIV>They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his=

  <DIV>God and Jesus are livi=

  <DIV>=
Its amazing where and to within whom people see "God".</DIV>
  <DIV>Isnt a =

  <DIV>IN the USA I cant begin to tell you the number of religious leader=

  <DIV>Ind=

  <DIV>I believe God appears in different forms in dif=

  <DIV>Now that Documentary TV prog=

  <DIV>What are principles =
of religion? What is dharma, What is the
