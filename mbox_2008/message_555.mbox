Dear Narsimhaji,
1. I had arranged one Shatchandi Homam at Ambica Temple in=
 2003 wherein 
Acharya of the Homam read 108 Saptashati Stotra path within =
9 days 
arranging 3 Brahmins at the temple and on the 10th day a Homam was =

arranged with 9 Brahmins like Navchandi Homam. This way he read 108 
Sapta=
shati Stotra Path (Pathatmaka)and last Homam with 9 Homatmaka.
After some t=
ime one Acharya told me that this was not Shatchandi Homam. 
Actually in Sh=
atchandi there should be 108 Brahmins at a time and 108 
Yagna-kundas shoul=
d be created.
Sir, what is the right procedure for Shatchandi Homam? 
2. Do=
 you refer anybody in South India whom I can call to Gujarat to do 
this ty=
pe of big Homam? This is because in this present time such 
learned Acharya=
s are rare. Most of the Brahmins are doing path 
stereotype without any lov=
e or devotion here. I have seen some good 
pronounces in South Indians.
