Namaste Ashwin Bhai,

The head priest of Kali Temple in Chennai, when met m=
e, asked about 
how i am reciting chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati). I told h=
im that i 
try to follow conventional instructions given in the book i.e 13=
 
chapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi & Ratri Sukta, Nyas, 3 
rasyas an=
d Kshma Prarthana at the end.

He told me that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa =
etc... at the begining 
and then continues reciting 13 chapters every day. =
THE IMPORTANT 
thing here is that He only indicated me his way of recitatio=
n, he 
NEVER asked me to do the same way or change the conventional way.

I=
 need to give one background. for many years i wonder about 
*Mahatmya* in =
many fo our spiriual books. take for instance Gita. it 
is indicated that G=
ita Mahatmya must be recited whenever Gita is 
recited and without that it'=
ll not be complete. Ganapati 
Atharvashirsh also has added protion of the s=
ame. Durga Saptashati 
also says that if you don't recite this, this & this=
 then the whole 
chandi paath is like fruitless.

i am not able to reconcil=
e with all these. IT gives a impression of 
injecting Fear. It is simply Do=
gmatic. If you don't do this then 
your efforts are wasted but if you do th=
is along with the main thing 
then it'll bring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoy=
ment of Swarga and even 
liberation.

I am at loss to understand these extr=
a things. it seems to me that 
it is a Ancient days Marketing gimmick added=
 NOT by the original 
author but some others at later stages. it is quite p=
ossible that it 
was introduced everywhere out of good intentions to make p=
eople 
recite it and get benefited. BUT these things have a danger of 
crea=
ting religious Fanatics.
 
Due to the above written feelings, i welcomed th=
e way of the head 
priest and now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Pa=
ath since 
last few recitation. my intentions are to avoid all the added th=
ings 
which glorifies the Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or 
Intimadat=
e with bad results)

i think it was off the track.

before i finish, must s=
ay that the sounds with which i do are Aim, 
Hreem, Kleem 

Yours,

utpal

 I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily 
for a fe=
w months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching 
Narayan. I ch=
ose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In 
hindsight, I made the =
correct choice, as many people in addition to 
Narayan are able to do homam=
 using the manual now! I and many other 
people have benefited (and will be=
nefit). However, as far as my mind 
concerned, all this started for Narayan=
! When it was time for 
Narayan to start doing homam, many people across th=
e world started 
with him. What a fortunate soul..
> 
> * * *

onset itself what =
the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental 
state would've been dif=
ferent while working on the manual. I 
would've been more egoistic and also=
 hurried more. Because the only 
thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I t=
ook my sweet time, arrived 
at the correct balance and also wrote it down w=
ithout many 
pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and=
 I 
really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, 
it =
would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would 
not have =
had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself 
to teach homam t=
o Narayan.

ded to spend a whole 
day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming =
weekend. The 
inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on =
to it. 
When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I 
sta=
rted before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 
breaks of 2 m=
in, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch 
and another 10 min b=

sitting in the same place a=

a very good experience. I was in=
 a very nice state at the end of the 
day.

hat the previous day was Akshaya 
Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is=
 considered a very 
auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhan=
a on that day 
is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had=
 not 
noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was 
exc=
ited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days 
later, he=
 said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell 
you because kno=
wing it would've distracted you. You would have been 
excited at doing the =
sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement 
would've changed the menta=

sadhana."
> 
> He was absolutely r=
ight. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a 
sadhana. The ego and pride br=
ought rajas and limited the mental 
focus on the mantra. If I was aware tha=
t I was doing this sadhana on 
a powerful day, it would've increased the pr=
ide and excitement, 
brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on man=
tra further. 
Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellen=
t 
progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing 
Manis=
h's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive 
and kickin=
g and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious 
food!

 are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what 
is useful rath=
er than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a 
guru (or someone else=
) who can go to the heart of their problem and 
point it out, so that they =
can weed it out through further 
introspection and weaken it through consci=
ous effort.

homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a=

(a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned th=

of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the 
ast=
rologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual 
seeker' etc=
. It will take great effort to overcome those identities 
and find True Sel=
f. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you 
really need yet another =
new identity to feed your ego further? See, 
what he said may very well be =
correct. But it is not useful for your 
progress. You have to rise above al=

keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.
