Namste to all
i have recently found a way to find a way to know ISHTA DEVAT=
A 
through jyotish but how should i make transition from deity to whom 
i p=
raying at present to the one i have got to know as my ISHTA DEVATA

I mean =
what should say at present to my deity which i chose earlier
though i don't=
 do so many rituals for worshipping just sitting in 
siddhasana and chantin=
g his mantras


And in recent posts i liked one thing a lot
"if you want, d=
ig deep in one place.Don't dig one foot in one place, 
another foot in anot=
her place and so on".

and i have also decide to that
But what should i say=
 to all those deities i have been praying and 
chanting their chalisas and =
mantras
should i ask for forgiveness and continue to just one deity(my isht=
a 
devata which i have just found)

regards
jitender
