Namaste,
 
Look at nakshatra sooktam. If you get the book "Mantra Pushpam" =
(in Devanagari script) or "Saswara Veda Mantramulu" (in Telugu script) publ=
ished by Ramakrishna Mutt, you can find nakshatra sooktam in it (with the i=
ntonation markings).
 
On the internet, you can find the list at
 
http://w=
ww.selfrealisation.net/VedicAstrology/devata.htm
 
Also, some detailed info=
rmation on the qualities of these nakshatras (in addition to deities) is at=
:
 
http://www.barbarapijan.com/bpa/bAstrHom.htm#twenty-seven%20nakshtras
 =

The above links only give the names. But nakshatra sooktam is not just nam=
es. It is a collection of Vedic chants for the 28 deities ruling the 28 nak=
shatras.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 For example, Sravana nakshatra is considered auspicious for Vishnu pooja. =
It is not because Moon is the ruling planet of Sravanam. It is because Vish=
nu is the ruling deity of Sravanam as per nakshatra sooktam. Suryopanishat =
says "yo hastaaditye japati sa mahaamrityum tarati" (whoever chants this wh=
en Sun is in Hasta nakshatra crosses death). As per Vimsottari ruling plane=
ts, Hasta is owned by Moon. However, that is immaterial. The actual reason =
is that Hasta is ruled by Savita (a form of Sun)as per nakshatra sooktam. T=
hat is why it is important for Sun's worship. Though the ruling planet of b=
oth Asresha and Revati is Mercury, the former is considered very inauspicio=
us for most activities and the latter is auspicious. It is because its ruli=
ng deity of the former is Sarpa (snake) and the latter is Pooshan as per na=
kshatra sooktam.
