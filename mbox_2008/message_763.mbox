When doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended. Even if 
there is so=
me movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that is 
enough. That is=
 enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical 
vibration of air). When you =
rely on an external fire, the physical 
vibration of air (sound) forms a co=
nnection between you and fire. You 
use that fire then to create powerful s=

 any movement is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better 
that way. Whe=
n relying on the internal fire alone, physical vibration 
of sound is not n=
eeded and avoiding it can help focus the energy and 
generate stronger subt=
le vibrations.

 3. Both are correct and work differently. However, those who try 
who pron=

misponounce them. The =
"g" becomes explicit. Ideally, you should start 
pronouncing as though you =

Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She 
appeared =
in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi 
homam, to spr=
ead the practice of regular homam around the world. 
However, Manish did no=
t reveal that incident to me until much later. 
All he told me at that time=
 was that Narayan really needed to do 
homam everyday and that I should tea=
ch a simple procedure to him.

 occasionally and liked it. 
I started doing a quick procedure everyday. Af=
ter doing it daily for 
a few months, I finally got down to the original ta=
sk - teaching 
Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose=
. In 
hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to 
=
Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other 
people=
 have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind 
concerned, =
all this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan 
to start doing =
homam, many people across the world started with him.

ing of the same year, I decided to spend a whole 
day meditating with Gayat=
ri mantra during the coming weekend. The 
inspiration came out of nowhere a=

When I told Manish, he only said "good,=
 go ahead and do it". I 
started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. E=

breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small=

day.

 I noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya 
Triteeya (Vai=
sakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very 
auspicious day and it is be=
lieved that spiritual sadhana on that day 
is 1000 times more powerful than=
 on other days. Though I had not 
noticed it before, I picked a perfect day=
 for the sadhana. I was 
excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with exci=
tement a few days 
later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I d=

you because knowing it would've distracted you. You would have=
 been 
excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement=
 
would've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the 
sadhan=
a."

s=
adhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus 
on th=
e mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a 
powerful day, =
it would've increased the pride and excitement, brought 
in rajas and reduc=
ed the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a 
very dangerous entity. E=
ven after one makes excellent progress, it 
can suddenly return and pull on=

I introspected and found that my ego=

Namaste............

I had been reci=
ting Chandi Path not every day but on ashtami or 
navami and while reciting=
 a brilliant blue light would appear in the 
text. During the chapter where=
 Kalika comes out of the third eye a 
golden light with red aura would appe=
ar. I was not reciting every 
day, however these lights would appear during=
 my daily routines, 
work, interactions with others, etc, as if Mother was =
reminding me of 
her presence in all my daily affairs.

How could I be such=
 a dunce so as to get involved with so many other 
mantras and dilute the p=
ure shakti that comes as a result of reciting 
Chandi? 

I have been follow=
ing these mails and I feel grateful to you 
gentlemen for your faith and wi=
sdom.

Warm Regards.................Ajaya
