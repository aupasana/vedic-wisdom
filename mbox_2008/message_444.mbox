Namaste,
 
I meant it figuratively.
 
For the reference on Yogananda, you c=
an read the section on Swami Yogananda in "God Lived with Them: Life Storie=
s of Sixteen Monastic Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna" by Swami Chetanananda.
=
 
*        *        *
 
There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and=
 swamis in the last few thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Parama=
hamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who mastered every single pat=
h. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He=
 worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even=
 reached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no "experience". H=
e was in sahaja samadhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in=
 people by mere touch or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had =
zero ego (that is why he could do all that!!!).
 
Many "gurus" force their =
dharma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature an=
d dharma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant,=
 worship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had=
 deep insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instruc=
tions. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and tot=
ally different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory thi=
ngs to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive=
 attitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded "shame on =
you. With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to=
 him. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place =
your guru in a good stead and not your aggression". When another sishya who=
 needed to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some pe=
ople and came away silently, he scolded him "shame on you. Shastras say tha=
t you should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong =
behavior? You should give them a piece of your mind."
 
Spiritual sadhana d=
oes not mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a=
 certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which=
 one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, eve=
ry action and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for=
 introspection and transformation of internal attitude.
 
Anyway, coming ba=
ck to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He b=
elonged to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru =
to an exceptional group of sishyas.
 
Without his [indirect] blessings, I w=
ould be a nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say a=
nything intelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impre=
ssed/inspired by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish =
Pandit and to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an inst=
rument and not to me.
 
BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you =
like to people who may be interested in spiritual discussions. I have no pr=
oblem. As I said before, I am a servant distributing the wealth of a king (=
Mother) as asked by the minister (my guru).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimhaji

        Another wonderly inspired pos=

        I did not understand one line of your post. You said =
during the time of Mahabhrata there was tremendous weight on this planet. I=

        Also, could you tell me the name of =

      Thank you once again for your mails which are an inspiration to us al=

          Namaste,

          =
As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in 
  =
        Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow s=
omeone 
          else's dharma".

          Following the path of dharma b=
asically means engaging in the right 
          action/duty. Right action v=
aries from person to person, from time to time 
          and from place to=
 place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, 
          which i=
n turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you 
       =
   did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in t=
he 
          past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, wha=
t debts you 
          created in the process, and what mental tendencies y=
ou accumulated until 
          now.

          If, based on one's mental t=
endencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
          to kill evil p=
ersons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
          ten=
dencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of 
 =
         uniformity of all religions, that becomes one's dharma. If, based =
on one's 
          mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pers=
on to spread the 
          ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one'=
s dharma. If, based on one's 
          mental tendencies and karmic debts,=
 nature wants a person to make a lot of 
          money and construct a te=
mple, that becomes one's dharma.

          * * *

          The dharma of =
a being may change from one life to another.

          At the time of Maha=
bharata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, 
          elders an=
d relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight 
       =
   on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendo=
us 
          destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a=
 great extent, 
          to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arj=
una being a great warrior, 
          it was his dharma to facilitate that.=
 Some people he deeply loved and 
          respected were on the other sid=
e and it was his dharma to kill them.

          When the same Arjuna was b=
orn again in the 19th century as one of 
          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa'=
 s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a 
          previous life, =
according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this 
          new=
 time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his 
       =
   aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire 
=
          generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and ser=
vice to 
          others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per w=
hat Ramakrishna 
          said), his dharma based on the time and place ma=
y be something else.

          * * *

          The tricky question is: Ho=
w does one decide what is one's dharma?

          Some people have interpr=
eted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharma 
          and not some=
one else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept 
          o=
f caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of =

          caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who liv=
ed by 
          killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. =
Vishwamitra was a 
          kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a bra=
hmana and and a maharshi 
          later. Basically varna shows one's apti=
tude. One starts off with the varna 
          of father, because that is w=
hat one is exposed to in childhood. As one 
          develops in life, one=
 gets one's own varna based on what one does.

          Thus, the misinter=
pretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
          dharma=
 from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
     =
     the world. Each person has individual dharma.

          Knowing what =
one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure 
          enou=
gh, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
  =
        mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lo=
t of 
          noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things=
. Thus, we get 
          confused.

          We should make the best judg=
ment combining discrimination and intuition and 
          decide what is o=
ur dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
          the =
best we can is all that we can do!

          More than following dharma, w=
hat is of utmost importance is to engage in 
          actions without iden=
tification. *That* alone ensures that we are not 
          accumulating ne=
w karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build 
          too =
much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best 
       =
   possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the g=
iven 
          situation is), with as little attachment and self-identific=
ation with the 
          action as possible. When the action is finished, =
we should leave the result 
          to god. We should not think "I did it=
", "what will happen now", "will it 
          work" etc. Such adherence of=
 nishkama karma yoga (unfication through 
          untached action) will s=
implify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. 
          As we becom=
e purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. 
         =
 There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our 
=
          dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This i=
s not easy, 
          but not as difficult as people think.

          The=
 bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of 
=
          "this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in acti=
on with 
          little attachment.

          * * *

          In decidi=
ng one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the inputs. 
          A=
nother external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can 
=
          derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to one's =
spiritual 
          master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one c=
an take the words of 
          the master to determine one's dharma and fo=
llow it sincerely.

          When Arjuna was confused about what his dharm=
a was and thought killing gurus 
          and relatives was not dharma, he=
 had a guru in Krishna who clarified his 
          dharma. When Narendrana=
th (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma 
          and wanted =
to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, 
          =
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the materia=
l 
          world and do the work of Mother for him.

          One who is=
 not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
        =
  debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of wha=
t 
          one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clea=
r insight into 
          one's inner core, such a guru can give perfect gu=
idance.

          * * *

          Bottomline is that I (or anybody) canno=
t outline a set of principles and 
          declare that as the dharma. No=
, dharma changes from person to person, from 
          time to time and fr=
om place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
          out wha=
t one's dharma is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's 
      =
    dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritu=
al 
          sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions witho=
ut much 
          attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one=
's understanding of 
          one's individual dharma.

          Best reg=
ards,

 <DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. 
    =
      Krishna clearly says in <BR>Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. I=
t 
          is dangerous to follow someone <BR>else's dharma".<BR><BR>Foll=
owing 
          the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right 
=
          <BR>action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from =
time 
          to time <BR>and from place to place. It is dependent on wha=
t nature 
          expects from you, <BR>which in turn is based on who you=
 have been in 
          the past, what actions you <BR>did in the past whi=
le identifying with 
          the action, who you affected in the <BR>past=
 (and how) with the 
          actions that you identified with, what debts=
 you <BR>created in the 
          process, and what mental tendencies you =
accumulated until 
          <BR>now.<BR><BR>If, based on one's mental tend=
encies and karmic debts, 
          nature wants a person <BR>to kill evil =
persons, that becomes one's 
          dharma. If, based on one's mental <B=
R>tendencies and karmic debts, 
          nature wants a person to spread t=
he message of <BR>uniformity of all 
          religions, that becomes one'=
s dharma. If, based on one's <BR>mental 
          tendencies and karmic de=
bts, nature wants a person to spread the 
          <BR>ritual of homam in =
the world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based 
          on one's <BR>men=
tal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
          to make a=
 lot of <BR>money and construct a temple, that becomes one's 
          dha=
rma.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The dharma of a being may change from one 
       =
   life to another.<BR><BR>At the time of Mahabharata war, it was 
        =
  Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, <BR>elders and relatives. The time 
  =
        then was such that there was too much weight <BR>on earth and natur=
e 
          wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous <BR>des=
truction 
          was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great=
 extent, <BR>to 
          welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjun=
a being a great 
          warrior, <BR>it was his dharma to facilitate tha=
t. Some people he 
          deeply loved and <BR>respected were on the oth=
er side and it was his 
          dharma to kill them.<BR><BR>When the same=
 Arjuna was born again in the 
          19th century as one of <BR>Ramakri=
shna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami 
          Yogananda had been Arjuna in =
a <BR>previous life, according to 
          Ramakrishna) , his dharma was =
different in this <BR>new time and 
          place. He was born to renounc=
e material life despite his 
          <BR>aristocratic upbringing and live=
 the simple life of a monk and 
          inspire <BR>generations to embrac=
e a simple life of mental detachment 
          and service to <BR>others. =
When he is born again (which he has to, as 
          per what Ramakrishna =
<BR>said), his dharma based on the time and place 
          may be somethi=
ng else.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The tricky question is: How 
          does on=
e decide what is one's dharma?<BR><BR>Some people have 
          interpret=
ed Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharma <BR>and not 
          so=
meone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept 
         =
 <BR>of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the 
    =
      concept of <BR>caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a 
   =
       shudra who lived by <BR>killing birds. He became a brahmana and a 
 =
         maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a <BR>kshatrita and a powerful kin=
g. 
          He became a brahmana and and a maharshi <BR>later. Basically =
varna 
          shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna <BR>of=
 father, 
          because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As=
 one 
          <BR>develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on wha=
t one 
          does.<BR><BR>Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's word=
s which 
          tells you to know your <BR>dharma from your caste is wro=
ng. Moreover, 
          there are not just 4 dharmas in <BR>the world. Eac=
h person has 
          individual dharma.<BR><BR>Knowing what one's dharma=
 is is very very 
          very difficult. If one is pure <BR>enough, one =
will *know* one's 
          dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our =
<BR>mind that tells us 
          what our dharma is, but it is surrounded =
by a lot of <BR>noise from 
          other parts of our minds which tell o=
ther things. Thus, we get 
          <BR>confused.<BR><BR>We should make th=
e best judgment combining 
          discrimination and intuition and <BR>d=
ecide what is our dharma and 
          follow it sincerely. We may be err,=
 but doing <BR>the best we can is 
          all that we can do!<BR><BR>Mor=
e than following dharma, what is of 
          utmost importance is to enga=
ge in <BR>actions without identification. 
          *That* alone ensures t=
hat we are not <BR>accumulating new karmas, i.e. 
          not increasing =
the load. We should not build <BR>too much attachment 
          to what we=
 are doing. We should engage in the best <BR>possible 
          actions (b=
ased on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given 
          <BR>si=
tuation is), with as little attachment and self-identification 
          w=
ith the <BR>action as possible. When the action is finished, we 
          =
should leave the result <BR>to god. We should not think "I did it", 
      =
    "what will happen now", "will it <BR>work" etc. Such adherence of 
    =
      nishkama karma yoga (unfication through <BR>untached action) will 
  =
        simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. <BR>As we bec=
ome 
          purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma cleare=
r. 
          <BR>There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enabl=
e us to 
          see our <BR>dharma clearly and follow it without incurri=
ng new karmas. 
          This is not easy, <BR>but not as difficult as peo=
ple think.<BR><BR>The 
          bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=
g one's dharma, one's sense 
          of <BR>"this is my dharma" gets refi=
ned with time if one engages in 
          action with <BR>little attachmen=
t.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>In deciding 
          one's dharma, one's intellect=
 and intuition are the inputs. 
          <BR>Another external input is the=
 words of scriptures and learned men. 
          One can <BR>derive one's d=
harma from them. A special place is given to 
          one's spiritual <BR=
>master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, 
          one can take t=
he words of <BR>the master to determine one's dharma and 
          follow =
it sincerely.<BR><BR>When Arjuna was confused about what his 
          dha=
rma was and thought killing gurus <BR>and relatives was not dharma, 
      =
    he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his <BR>dharma. When 
          =
Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma <BR>and 
   =
       wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhan=
a, 
          <BR>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to s=
tay in 
          the material <BR>world and do the work of Mother for him.=
<BR><BR>One 
          who is not in tune with nature and does not know who=
 one is, what 
          one's <BR>debts are and what nature expects from o=
ne can err in the 
          judgment of what <BR>one's dharma is. If one's=
 guru is an elevated 
          soul with a clear insight into <BR>one's in=
ner core, such a guru can 
          give perfect guidance.<BR><BR>* * *<BR=
><BR>Bottomline is that I (or 
          anybody) cannot outline a set of p=
rinciples and <BR>declare that as 
          the dharma. No, dharma changes=
 from person to person, from <BR>time to 
          time and from place to =
place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
          <BR>out what one's =
dharma is. But, one can refine one's understanding 
          of one's <BR>=
dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various 
          kinds of =
spiritual <BR>sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in 
          ac=
tions without much <BR>attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and 
     =
     refine one's understanding of <BR>one's individual dharma.<BR><BR>Best=
