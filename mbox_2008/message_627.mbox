ough constant vigilance and total surrender.

I am inspired by many saints =
and Thakur being the most prominent of 
them. Sri Sri Ravishankar is the on=
e who i know to be a really great 
spiritual teacher, however i found my gu=
ru in you.

I highly appreciate your clarity of thoughts and found many 
si=
mmilarity in our attitude and thoughts over years, however i know 
for sure=
 that there is a big gulf between our level of consciousness.

through some=
 of your messages on list as well as personla mails, i am 
completely convi=
nced about one thing which is mentioned below

- Barometer of spiritual gro=
wth is the reduction of I ness (limited 
ego) viz-a-viz increase of surrend=
er. the feeling of being an 
instrument in the hand of Mother/god/nature in=
creases

what i am still not convinced about is that the possibility of not=
 
experiencing any *tangiable* extraordinary expereinces but still one 
is =
really making good progress?

If i think rationally and take the experience=
s of others than it is 
quite clear that the spiritual growth invariably co=
mes along with 
some out of the world and tangiable experiences. this some =
times 
temporarily disappoints me.

i feel that i'll never be convinced unl=
ess i get the concrete proof 
of the subtle world.

Yours,

utpal
