Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Reading your response another question came into my=
 mind. You said:
=C2=A0
=C2=A0It is not good if fire is extinguished by rai=
n in the middle of a homam.

Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished=
 by rain, or the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?
=C2=A0
I mean =
actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa regularly, there can be ins=
tances when the homa agni gets extinguished while the homa is still on..hap=
pened with me couple of times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it =
but as one member in this list had suggested to me,=C2=A0 i relight the fir=
e and keep continuing with the homa.
=C2=A0

Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the ope=
n is actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain=
 can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it rain=
s while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain=
 in the middle of a homam.

Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with brick=
s and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.

ming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the

ntally along with the audio?

One can repeat mentally while listening atten=
tively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the att=
ention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.

Suppose person X is chant=
ing a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose perso=
n Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity.=
 Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit f=
rom the mantra. The word mantra means "one that protects the mind". One can=
 say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is control ov=
er the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.

However, there is =
a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra is submitted in the inter=
nal fire in meditation and it is submitted in the external fire as well in =
a homam. So making some external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as o=
pposed to silent chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.

> 3)Can=
 bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other conditions/niyamas that
> shou=
ld be followed apart from having vegeterain food?

Yes. Anybody whose upana=
yanam (sacred thread ceremony) has been performed can do it. Bachelor or ma=
rried is irrelevant.

One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one's =
guru. Whatever rules one's guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At t=
he minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and tak=
e a bath before homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any=
 solid food 2 hours before homam.

By the way, if one without a sacred thre=
ad wants to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsib=
ility and allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as =
guru and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the p=
rocess until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through h=
omam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mant=
ropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the per=
son crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantro=
padesa by guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold=
 of purity.

As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and read=
y to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I a=
m willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.

> 4)Any good da=
te to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?

For Mahaganapathi homam, =
the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.

* * *

Mentio=
ning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.

When I went to I=
ndia in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to several places =
(on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morning in several =
places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umb=
rella with me. As monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take =
it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop =
of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, "Narasi=
mha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after our homam finishes". I =
just smiled.

To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. Af=
ter we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big dro=
ps. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. To=
gether, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and=
 meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until fire in the tw=
o homa kundas went off and then packed everything and went down. We left fo=
r Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued =
for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we c=
overed the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went =
to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.

Best re=
gards,
Narasimha
