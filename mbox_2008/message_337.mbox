There seems to be a discussion on sohamsa list regarding what yug=

Yukteshwar Maharaj was a great yogi. But mistakes do happ=

One more point..
 
There is suppo=

Kali yuga, dharma i=

(even below 25% level!). It=

is atleast 25%. Thus, as the society becomes more and m=

selfish and adharmik, some sections of the society will sprin=
