Home Remedies to GET RID OF BELLY FAT   What is that thing that�s been growing around your mid-section since you started college? Is it a beer belly? Is it belly fat? Is it tummy fat? Is it a gut or a beer gut? There are so many names for the fat at builds up around our stomachs, is it any wonder why it�s become a national obsession? But don�t misperceive our obsession with fat as war on fat. 
   A little body fat is actually good for you. It keeps you warm and helps your body maintain a sufficient core temperature and nutrients when we get sick and can�t eat. Personally, I like the little tummy I have, and I�d rather it stay that way�little. So, I�ve started working out. Evidence is starting to prove the theory that lifting weights (anaerobic exercise, or weight training) and using the Stair Master (aerobic exercise) will help you get rid of that extra weight around your midsection. A healthy diet is also a good idea. 
   So, I�ve summarized here a list of things you should take into consideration if you�re serious about losing that tummy: 
   The Best Way to Lose Belly Fat 
  Reducing the amount of calories you consume is the most effective way to get rid of belly fat. 
   
  Really, when it comes down to it, losing any kind of fat, no matter where it is on your body, requires you to consume less calories than you body needs. This lack of calories will set into motion the processing of excess body fat to make up for the lack of calories. But don�t go all crazy about it. Starving your body of calories is only good to a certain extent, after a point you begin to do damage to important things, like your central nervous system.
   There�s a reason they call it a �beer belly,� and drinking less beer, or quitting drinking altogether, will help you lose belly fat.
   No matter who (or how good looking) the drinker is, beer is bad for a number of reasons. The most obvious reason is the caloric content of beer. The less obvious reasons are the inflammation of the pancreas and liver, and the bloating that often accompany the over-consumption of alcoholic beverages; this includes alcohol mixed with sweet, sugary liquids like soda.
   Consuming less food loaded with sugar will help you to lose tummy fat. 
   Sugar is a big one. The sugar found in junk food and soda is the kind of sugar that burns quickly, unlike those sugars found in fruits and vegetables, which burn more slowly. If your body is processing sugar to create energy, and you�re not using any energy, those sugars will be converted into fat for later use. If you�re going to enjoy sweets, enjoy them right before you use the Stair Master.
   There�s nothing wrong with strengthening your abdominal muscles, but it won�t get rid of belly fat like magic.
   You may want to consider not only working out your abs, but also working out your shoulders, pectorals, back, and arms to help create a more shapely �V� figure, which will help reduce the appearance of your belly. Keep this in mind: bulking up your muscles requires fewer reps (about 8) and fewer sets with greater weight. Building leaner muscle requires more reps, more sets, and less weight.
   Daily exercise and walking will definitely get rid of belly fat. 
   Going for a walk after a big meal or enjoying a dessert is never a bad idea. When Natasha and I were in Europe, we ate our fair share of delicacies, but we didn�t gain a single pound�in fact, we actually lost weight�because we walked everywhere. We walked from the train station to our hotel, and from our hotel to the restaurant, and from the restaurant to the museums, and from the museums to the�well, you get my point.
   �  A calorie restrictive diet, which requires you to eat no less than 10x and no more than 15x your LEAN bodyweight in calories.
  �  Regular cardiovascular activity for at least 30-45 minutes 3-4 times per week. Some recommend a moderate pace while other recommend a vigorous pace -- it doesn't really matter as long as you are exercising.
  �  Weight training.
  �  Supplementing your diet with vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Vitamin C, L-glutamine, and a good multi vitamin are the bare essentials.
  �  Adequate dietary fat, including high amounts of Essential Fatty Acids
   
  Certainly I expect these postings will be beneficial for all. But I request to give some astrological facts underlie/combination of grahas for the disease and the remedies of vegetable I give hereunder which planet governs. So I request other knowledgeable people join with the issue and comment..
