Dear Members,

I've come across the press release on net which gives intre=
sting
account. I am happy to see that serious efforts are being made by
wel=
lmeaning scholars to *put the record straight*.

Our history books needs to=
 be re-written and Dr.  Narahari Achar has
really provided momentum for tha=
t.

!....!....!

PRESS RELEASE


Scientists Collide with Linguists to Asser=
t Indigenous origin of Indian
Civilization

Comprehensive population geneti=
cs data along with archeological and
astronomical evidence presented at Jun=
e 23-25, 2006 conference in
Dartmouth, MA, overwhelmingly concluded that In=
dian civilization and its
human population is indigenous.

In fact, the ori=
ginal people and culture within the Indian Subcontinent
may even be a likel=
y pool for the genetic, linguistic, and cultural
origin of the most rest of=
 the world, particularly Europe and Asia.

Leading evidences come from popu=
lation genetics, which were presented by
two leading researchers in the fie=
ld, Dr. V. K. Kashyap, National
Institute of Biologicals, India, and Dr. Pe=
ter Underhill of Stanford
University in California. Their results generally=
 contradict the notion
Aryan invasion/migration theory for the origin of In=
dian civilization.

Underhill concluded "the spatial frequency distribution=
s of both L1
frequency and variance levels show a spreading pattern emanati=
ng from
India", referring to a Y chromosome marker. He, however, put severa=
l
caveats before interpreting genetic data, including "Y-ancestry may not
a=
lways reflect the ancestry of the rest of the genome"

Dr. Kashyap, on the =
other hand, with the most comprehensive set of
genetic data was quite empha=
tic in his assertion that there is "no clear
genetic evidence for an intrus=
ion of Indo-Aryan people into India, [and]
establishment of caste system an=
d gene flow."

Michael Witzel, a Harvard linguist, who is known to lead the=
 idea of
Aryan invasion/migration/influx theory in more recent times, conti=
nued
to question genetic evidence on the basis that it does not provide the=

time resolution to explain events that may have been involved in Aryan
pre=
sence in India.

Dr. Kashyap's reply was that even though the time resoluti=
on needs
further work, the fact that there are clear and distinct differenc=
es in
the gene pools of Indian population and those of Central Asian and
Eu=
ropean groups, the evidence nevertheless negates any Aryan invasion or
migr=
ation into Indian Subcontinent.

Witzel though refused to present his own d=
ata and evidence for his
theories despite being invited to do so was nevert=
heless present in the
conference and raised many questions. Some of his com=
mentaries
questioning the credibility of scholars evoked sharp responses fr=
om
other participants.

Rig Veda has been dated to 1,500 BC by those who us=
e linguistics to
claim its origin Aryans coming out of Central Asia and Eur=
ope.
Archaeologist B.B. Lal and scientist and historian N.S. Rajaram
disagr=
eed with the position of linguists, in particular Witzel who
claimed litera=
ry and linguistic evidence for the non-Indian origin of
the Vedic civilizat=
ion.

Dr. Narahari Achar, a physicist from University of Memphis clearly
sh=
owed with astronomical analysis that the Mahabharata war in 3,067 BC,
thus =
poking a major hole in the outside Aryan origin of Vedic people.

Interesti=
ngly, Witzel stated, for the first time to many in the
audience, that he an=
d his colleagues no longer subscribe to Aryan
invasion theory.

Dr. Bal Ram=
 Singh, Director, Center for Indic Studies at UMass
Dartmouth, which organi=
zed the conference was appalled at the level of
visceral feelings Witzel ho=
lds against some of the scholars in the
field, but felt satisfied with the =
overall outcome of the conference.

"I am glad to see people who have been =
scholarly shooting at each other
for about a decade are finally in one room=
, this is a progress", said
Singh.

The conference was able to bring togeth=
er in one room for the first time
experts from genetics, archeology, physic=
s, linguistics, anthropology,
history, and philosophy. A proceedings of the=
 conference is expected to
come out soon, detailing various arguments on th=
e origin of Indian
civilization.

The conference was sponsored by the Cente=
r for Indic Studies at UMass
Dartmouth (www.umassd.edu/indic <http://www.um=
assd.edu/indic> ) with
co-sponsorship from Educator's Society for the Herit=
age of India
