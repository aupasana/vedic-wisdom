Nama=
ste,

Choosing the right deity for sadhana is important. If you do not know=
 the 
right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waitin=
g. Pick 
whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.

Please rememb=
er that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from 
sadhana for speci=
fic material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, 
sadhana performe=
d for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, 
sometimes it may be ne=
cessary to experience the results of some bad karmas 
before some good thin=
gs happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a 
basket. Suppose so=
me of the really good karmas that will enable you to do 
serious sadhana an=
d experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of 
the pile. When yo=
u start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits 
of those auspi=
cious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and 
retrieving those karm=
as. In the process, some other karmas may spill over 
and give their fruits=
. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had 
to be experienced so=
metime or the other, anyway!

A serious sadhaka should never be disheartene=
d by a few seemingly 
undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhan=
a. Just keep going.

One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a =
very good 
priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few =
days, he was 
laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued=
 his sadhana 
and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and mak=
e a pilgrimage 
to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi ho=
mam we conducted 
at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He me=
t my guru and got 
the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we s=
tayed at the house 
of a priest during the homam. He could observe and inte=
ract with my guru 
very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a visio=
n of the Mother on 
2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start =
the work on spreading 
homam in the world, this gentleman was present there=
. Though he could not 
see the Mother, he actually smelled something out of=
 the world and was 
baffled. He knew something was going on, but did not kn=
ow what. The temple 
was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen =
were the only people 
on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though=
 he could not see the 
Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be present t=
here at *that* crucial 
moment. That is enough to mould the rest of his lif=
e.

You never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. 
Calc=
ulations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just 
sur=
render and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs 
fine-tuning=
, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that 
happen when d=
oing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
some debts so=
 that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really 
auspicious kar=
mas.

As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have d=
evotion 
and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.

Best re=
gards,
Narasimha

<BR>> Namaste Sir<BR>> what you said makes a lot sense and it was mar=
vellous<BR>> but i have some small doubts<BR>><BR>> Leaving astrol=
ogy aside and those who do not have a guru<BR>> how can they chooose a p=
articular form of GOD<BR>> bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, sai=
d choosing right deity<BR>> is very important, as the analogy he gave of=
 a person<BR>> who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his gre=
ed<BR>><BR>> One thing more<BR>> we have so many deities that on
 =
diwali i would like to worship<BR>> Lakshmi and Kali<BR>> in navaratr=
i (nowadays) we would worship Durga<BR>> on janmashtami we would fast fo=
r KRISHNA<BR>> an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA<BR>> like this<BR>> =
with hte change in festival the deity changes<BR>><BR>> though everyb=
ody knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get<BR>> out of this<BR=
>> mould and if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become<B=
R>> angry<BR>><BR>> I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this t=
hing hangs in the mind<BR>><BR>> One thing more<BR>><BR>> Suppo=
se if i choose a deity and something wrong happens<BR>> (materiallistica=
lly )<BR>><BR>> what should i consider that my deity was helping me t=
o clear my<BR>> DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS<BR>> or the NATURE was telling me t=
o change the DEITY as I am not fit<BR>> for that DEITY<BR>><BR>> a=
nd sometimes you feel<BR>> o what am i doing does this really
 works<BR>=
><BR>> and one thing more<BR>><BR>> what if we go on doing our =
pooja and someday<BR>> something like what happened to Pt. GOPI KRISHNA =
JI<BR>> happens to us also<BR>> though he says in his book that he re=
ad a lot about yoga<BR>> and stuff like this<BR>><BR>> At any stag=
e i do not want you people to get offended<BR>> but these are my doubts =
which are there in my mind<BR>><BR>> i will not say much now bcoz in<=
BR>> Swami Sivananda's KUNDALINI YOGA on the last page he says<BR>><B=
R>> "the shastras are endless and there is so much to be known<BR>> t=
urn the gaze. draw the indriyas.still the mind.then<BR>> dive deep into =
the divine source and realise the infinite bliss"<BR>><BR>> *********=
*** ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ***<BR>>=
 *<BR>> i ll give one small personal example here<BR>><BR>> around=
 26 or 27 dec.2007 i started chanting 2 mantras (one kar
 mala<BR>> each=
)<BR>> in morning and evening<BR>> and on 9 january 2008 my parents m=
et an accident<BR>> though my father suffered small injuries my mother s=
uffred fracture<BR>> in shoulder and Leg<BR>><BR>> and she is stil=
l undergoing treatment and will have to<BR>> undergo one more operation =
in this month<BR>><BR>> and in February and March i got placement in<=
BR>> 2 companies (i m doing MCA in india) where most of my friends have<=
BR>> not<BR>> even got one and let me tell you i m not very intellige=
nt<BR>><BR>> so sometimes even now i consider whether my choosen deit=
y is correct<BR>> or not<BR>><BR>> so everyday in the end of my po=
oja what i ask GOD is<BR>> to help me find the right path<BR>> ******=

 discussed that knowledge and spent a<BR>> day at my<BR>>&=
