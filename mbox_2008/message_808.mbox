Narasimha Garu,

u need not!

I didn't ask that actually :). I just gave the excerpts from t=
he 
Article, which is in terms of question & answer. The question was 
aske=
d by somebody and the reply was given by some monk from 
Ramkrsihna Mission=
.

Anyways, your misunderstanding was also good, which would have 
cleared =
some more doubts of some on the list :)

Yours,

Utpal

 Take another example. Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are incarnations 
of the=
 same being (Vishnu). But each is unique and not replacable by 
another. Si=
milarly, Ramakrishna is unique. Those who like him will 
get knowledge and =
spiritual progress through him. The reborn version 
may again be unique and=
 have a new lila - a new play. Those who like 
him may get knowledge and sp=

it may=
