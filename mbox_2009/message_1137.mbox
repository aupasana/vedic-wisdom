Dear Shri Kshroum,

in in requesting him for such video. It'll be useful.

Narasimha has mentioned in the manual thus:
[
The full (or half) coconut =
used in the poornaahuti is a symbol of
one's head, i.e. ego ("I-ness"), whi=
ch is to be sacrificed 
(surrendered) to Mahaganapathi. Without
that inner =
sense of surrender, an elaborate poornaahuti ritual with 
pristine material=
s has no
meaning.
]

I think that is why he keeps Poornahuti over his head =
which 
symbolises that one is offering one's HEAD (Ego, Brain etc...) in 
t=
he Homam to the invoked lord. i do the same way.

its possible that my unde=
rstanding in this case may be not entirely 
correct.

Best Regards,

Utpal
