Namaste Puneet,

Although your questions are to Narasimha, i am writing few=
 thoughts of mine hoping it'll not be inapporopriate.

you've asked a very =
vital question which would have confused many in the past and many are faci=
ng dilema presently. I've faced this dilema in the past but now over time, =
my understanding has become clearer (atleast i feel that way).

Just take e=
xamples of Ganapati Atharvashirsha and Sri Sukta. They both are having quit=
e a few verses in the end which describes Phalshruti. Like wise there are m=
any spiritual texts that are coupled with Phalshruti. It is observed that m=
ost of the 'Propagated Fruits' are for Material benefits.

It is very logic=
al to assume that when one reads such stotras or spiritual knowledge source=
s such as Bhagvad Gita only for the sake of spiritual progress, meaning imp=
roving upon the inner faculties such as discrimination, detachment, humilit=
y etc., One does not need to recite Phalshruti.

It is my well considered o=
pinion that Phalshruti can be skipped entirely even if there present a vers=
e which says that if one does not read Phalshruti path then the whole effor=
t will be fruitless !

It is very likely that these "Fruits verses' were ad=
ded to the basic text to attract people so that they are ultimately benefit=
ed spiritually. Like Nityaananda (Nitai) famously allure people to chant Ha=
ri Naam.   

Narasimha Garu will surely enlighten us all.

Best Regards,

U=
tpal
