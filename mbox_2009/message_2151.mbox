Dear Utpal,
 
If a room has mirrors on the walls, the mirrors may reflect t=
he light of a bright candle in the middle of the room and light up the room=
. But part of the candlestand that supports the candle may have a shadow on=
 it and be in the dark, despite supporting a candle giving light to many.
 =

If Ramakrishna was like a candle, sishyas such as Vivekananda, Brahmananda=
, Shivananda etc were like mirrors on the wall. Hriday was like the candles=
tand.
 
Yes, the candle has enough light to give to *anyone*, but the stand=
 is not in a good position to receive much light.
 
In any case, I do not t=
hink you have to pity Hriday that much. Why do you conclude that Hriday was=
 not "finally saved" like Hazra? Yes, he was troubled by material problems =
till the end and they prevented him from rising above them. However, you ca=
n look at it as praayaschitta forced on him in the same life for some of hi=
s sins. Please note that nobody knows where and how he died and what he exp=
erienced at the end!!
 
Hriday was a strong and energetic man who feared go=
d and wanted self-realization. He served and protected Ramakrishna during v=
ery important phases of his life, especially when he was engaged in very in=
tense sadhana for god-realization. The role played by Hriday in the entire =
lila of Ramakrishna is very significant and enables everything else.
 
Howe=
ver, a few serious bad karmas was incurred by him. He exploited Ramakrishna=
 for material benefits. He was the one who fought with Bhairavi Brahmani, w=
ho was Ramakrishna's tantra guru (gurvi), which eventually resulted in her =
leave the place. He abused Sarada Mata also. As Ramakrishna's popularity an=
d following increased, a strongman with a propensity to exploit the followi=
ng materially had to be sent away. That is why the divine Mother forced Hri=
day into an unfortunate situation resulting in his being evicted from the t=
emple.
 
The material suffering for the rest of his life may have been puni=
shment in the same life for trying to materially exploit Ramakrishna's earl=
y popularity.
 
*        *        *
 
Pratap Chandra Hazra was much moe dif=
ferent and lacked many virtues of Hriday. He was a good scholar, but was eg=
oistic, untruthful, selfish, jealous, shrewd, calculating, manipulative and=
 hypocritical. This man with half-baked and dry scriptural knowledge fancie=
d himself as a spiritually elevated soul and tried to preach even to Ramakr=
ishna. Interestingly, young Narendra was attracted to him and even tried to=
 convince Ramakrishna about Hazra. Must be some karmik connection from befo=
re.
 
If Hazra received Ramakrishna's grace and had a blessed end, do you r=
eally believe that the man who served Ramakrishna tirelessly for many many =
crucial years would have been left to his fate at the end? He had to be lef=
t to his fate for many years in his old age, to realize the futility of pur=
suing material things. But, he too could have received Ramakrishna's grace =
at the end.
 
Actually, he had some nice experiences during the time he liv=
ed with Ramakrishna. But his mental conditioning did not allow it to be per=
manent. The suffering for the rest of life may have been necessary to wipe =
that conditioning and prepare him for a higher realization.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
Each person plays a role in the divine drama of a saint. There is =
no need to pity anyone. Based on the spiritual readiness and mental conditi=
oning of each person, each person plays a different role. In the end, all m=
ake spiritual progress due to their association with the saint.
 
Let us wo=
rry about our own progress, instead of worrying about Hriday and Hazra.
 
B=
est regards,
Narasimha
