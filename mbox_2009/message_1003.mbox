Dear ALL,

Sleep is a biological need of man. It is essential for the smoo=
th running of
life. Like hunger and thirst, it too comes at fixed cyclic in=
tervals. It
energizes the body and freshens the mind. Lapsing into sound sl=
eep is an
art; it is not something haphazard. Those who are skilled in this=
 art are
able to put it to optimum advantage.

Ayurveda gives very deep ana=
lysis of sleep. It classifies sleep into six
kinds: (i) sleep generated by =
physical exhaustion, (ii) caused by mental
fatigue, (iii) post-ailment slee=
p, (iv) sleep induced by some bodily hurt,
(v) that brought about by increa=
se in cough, and (vi) tamoguni sleep. This
last kind fills the body and min=
d with 'tamas' or darkness instead of
freshness and vigor. Death is known a=
s the mahatamoguni sleep. The physical
death of yogis, however, is called '=
divine sleep'.

Modern psychology divides sleep into three phase-types: lig=
ht sleep, deep
sleep and the dreaming phase. These phases come in successio=
n. In the deep
sleep state, a person becomes completely oblivious of his su=
rroundings and
remains totally unaffected by them. Scientists believe that =
it is this phase
which is the real sleep time. It takes away all mental and=
 physical
tiredness and fills a person with energy and vitality.

In the th=
ird phase of dreaming, the conscious mind takes a back seat and the
unconsc=
ious mind becomes active. It is this mind, which 'sees' dreams. The
psychol=
ogists are still not able to fully grasp the mechanism and meaning of
dream=
s. But the yogi understands this phenomenon in its totality. Through
variou=
s yogic techniques he refines and purifies his unconscious mind to the
exte=
nt where it becomes non-existent. The yogi acquires full control over
sleep=
. He does not dream; rather he illumines this dream phase with the
bright r=
ainbow-like lights of a Deepawali.

An ordinary person requires sleep becau=
se his unconscious has a vast
ocean-like expanse. But how much sleep is rea=
lly needed? Psychologists opine
that the required quantum of sleep varies f=
rom person to person. It depends
on many factors =96 physical and psycholog=
ical state of a person as well as on
his social and material environs. A ch=
ild who sleeps for 15 hours can hardly
manage a sleep of even 4-5 hours in =
old age. The thumb rule is that only
that much sleep is required as fulfill=
s the requirements of the body and
mind. Napoleon slept for only 3 hours wh=
ile Einstein for 10. On an average,
a person sleeps for 5 =96 7 hours.
