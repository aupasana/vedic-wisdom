Namaste,

>Let me give another analogy. This life is like a long dream. >Sa=
viklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa >samadhi is=
 like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like >being in the dream =
and yet being awake.

Very nice and FRESH analogy.
This is quite similar an=
alogy which was given by thakur and recorded in Gospel by M.

Nirvikalpa Sa=
madhi: A being who when experiences the other side of the wall (which separ=
ates Absolute and relative) just falls in to and does not come back to rela=
tive side.

A being who has attained Sahja Samadhi - A very very special be=
ing who can go through the wall (which separates Absolute and Relative)at w=
ill. while remaining in absolute, also works in relative for some special p=
urpose.

i hope i decribed it correctly. 
 
thanks.

Utpal

This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult s=
ahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work =
in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.
