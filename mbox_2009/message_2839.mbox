Dear Rajarshi,
 
Before I answer your main question, I want to address the =
following:
 
> Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that ther=
e is probably
> no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.
> 
=
> Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a di=
vine
> presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditation th=
ere?
 
Two points:
 
(1) One can have a nice meditation session anywhere. W=
hile different places and times have some difference in the nature and degr=
ee of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if th=
e internal factors are conducive.
 
(2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs =
Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any observation=
 is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual =
energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What w=
e are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditio=
ning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.
=
 
> But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/creative/
> =
destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is
> re=
aching God, is it not enough?
 
The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain =
imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular ener=
gy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that=
 form gets "established" in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be foc=
used on that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol.=
 Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connect=
ed feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other peopl=
e's strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is work=
ing as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to foc=
us on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in an=
other person too.
 
However, there is some translation involved when though=
ts of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This =
translation is dependent on one's mental conditioning. Thus, what we percei=
ve at the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!
 
Suppose a foo=
lish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess w=
ho kills all of one's enemies, brings people under one's control and makes =
one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to=
 that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you ov=
ercome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to ha=
ppen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of ne=
gative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.
 
However, please note that th=
is principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particula=
r place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thought=
s everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying the=
re later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of=
 thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opp=
osed to just air. That's all.
 
However, please note that most people have =
some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when =
they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and =
selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus,=
 the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes consider=
able only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible p=
ractices without understanding what they are doing.
 
> is Idol worship ris=
ky?
 
Bottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.
 
*        =
*        *
 
> Does Man create God, or God creates man?
 
God created man a=
s his replica. But the replica got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to r=
ecreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back =
to the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/=
conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends u=
p creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to ke=
ep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining onese=
lf and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replic=
a of oneself, that god will match the god that created man in the first pla=
ce. When that god fills one's mind, one is free from the cycle.
 
*        =
*        *
 
I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about resp=
ected spiritual leaders of other religions.
 
In general, please remember t=
hat saying negative things about people that one may not have understood fu=
lly or correctly is unwise.
 
>From time to time, the Lord may send someone =
to a part of the world to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhram=
a that is required in that part of the world at that time. One cannot judge=
 a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people=
 claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did =
not send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher =
attained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh=
 in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.
 
If one is unh=
appy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or=
 spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things =
and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and d=
o your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the=
 cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.

        Namaste,

        To add to my query, a good nu=
mber of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth=
 is one, how can it be so contradictory? 

        I can understand that a =
Idol may contain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have =
a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakal=
i into an Idol.

        But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/=
negative/creative/destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assumi=
ng that it is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax =
collecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective o=
f whether a divine presence is there or not there infront?

        I would=
 like to mention a small incident here about someone I know well. There was=
 a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take =
time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaaligha=
t temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to me=
diate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought=
* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there =
was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thought=
s as if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.  Als=
o a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Go=
ddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked mo=
re than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but a=
ll he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind tha=
t night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomline: a=
 nice spiritual experience.

        Some months later he ended up meeting =
a very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.  =
He strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with the pers=
on was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that the=
re is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.

   =
     Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a=
 divine presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditation t=
here?  Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee whi=
ch counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the=
 idol has any energy at all?

        -Regards
         Rajarshi

           =
       *        *        *

                  It is my humble opinion that =
some famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not=
 want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples =
seem to have a powerful divine presence.

                  I was very impr=
essed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Gir=
nar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Mahars=
hi's place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those plac=
es. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For exam=
ple, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at D=
akshineshwar is "alive". I did not get the same impression at the famous Ka=
lighat temple which is also in Calcutta.

                  There was one s=
mall temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to vi=
sit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi hom=
am in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed li=
ke a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there =
was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even rememb=
er the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my =
mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce god=
dess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful=
 presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or =
the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried t=
o put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire=
 accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open ai=
r and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very p=
leased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of=
 the temple and goddess.

                  Like this, I am sure there are =
many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.

               =
   Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences=
 when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I =
am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground cham=
ber there.

                  *        *        *

                  Even t=
he middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in=
 USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is =
rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any t=
emple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there =
is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.

    =
              If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sad=
hana near a temple, I suggest the following:

                  Mayapur, Da=
kshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Ar=
unachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi,=
 Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, =
Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and U=
jjain in central India.

                  There are many other good places=
, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and st=
aying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doi=
ng a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.

     =

about Dakshineshwar vs 
Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in m=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>The purpose =
of an idol is to evoke certain

"established" in that ido=

that specific form fas=

think that our min=

all of us are =
able to perceive in some vague form other people's strong thoughts

        <DIV>To add to my query, a good number =
of religions explicitly 
        prohibit idol worship. If the underly=
ing truth is one, how can it be so 
        contradictory? </DIV>
        <=
DIV> </DIV>
        <DIV>I can understand that a Idol may contain a pr=
esence created by 
        human imagination which maynot have a divine lin=
k. Not everybody is a 
        Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali i=
nto an Idol.</DIV>
        <DIV> </DIV>
        <DIV>But then, what ev=
er the idol may contain, 
        postive/negative/creative/destruction, if=
 someone prays to it with 
        devotion, assuming that it is reaching G=
od, is it not enough? After 
        all God is finally tax collecter =
of prayers. Does not all prayer finally 
        reach God, irrespective of=
 whether a divine presence is there or not 
        there infront?</DIV>
  =
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>I w=
ould like to mention a small incident here about someone I know 
        we=
ll. There was a certain individual, who whenever he 
       =
 would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and 
        =
meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat 
        temple.&=
nbsp;Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat 
        ther=
e trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly 
       =
 became very focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights 
=
        (probably just his imagination) - but there was a distinct fee=
ling 
        of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as=
 if there 
        was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.=
  Also a 
        strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he =
needed to worship 
        the Goddess. As he came out he found t=
hat his shoes were 
        missing, so he walked more than a kil=
ometer distance bare feet 
        though an extremely dirty road but =
all he felt was a deep joy. 
        Nothing was actually registering =
in his mind that night, except for 
        an overwhelming joy, as he=
 said later on. Bottomline: a nice 
        spiritual experience.</DIV=
>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV=
>Some months later he ended up meeting a very 
        spiri=
tual person who instructed him about worshipping the 
        Goddess. =
; He strongly believes that night at the temple and 
        his meeti=
ng with the person was related. Interestingly, even that 
        spiritual=
 person told him that there is probably no divine 
        presen=
ce inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2></FONT><FONT face=3DArial 
        size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>=

        <DIV>Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did n=
ot 
        have a divine presence why did this person suddenly h=
ave such 
        a nice meditation there?  Does it mean tha=
t finally 
        it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts=
 for spiritual energy 
        inside a temple, irrespective of whether the=
 idol has any energy at 
        all?</DIV>

          times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and 
 =
                 they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and n=

                  roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, =
I was 
                  very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil =
Nadu 
                  probably knows the name of the temple and 
goddess.=
