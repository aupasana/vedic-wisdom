Namaste,
 
Mars can give diseases, debts (including financial debts), enemi=
es, litigation, quarrels, wars etc and also the energy to fight and overcom=
e those problems. Propitiation of Mars is useful to a lot of people these d=
ays.
 
Compared to meditating with the mantra of any deity or worshipping a=
n idol or a kalasha, it is more powerful to offer the mantra in fire. I was=
 instructed by my spiritual master, who was told by the divine Mother, to t=
each simple procedures for worshipping various deities in fire and spread t=
he ritual of homam in the world. As the world goes through an interesting p=
hase in the coming years, it will be good to have a large number of people =
performing homam to various deities on a regular basis around the world.
 
=
Several manuals for doing homam (fire ritual) to various deities in 30-40 m=
inutes are already there on my website. More manuals will be added in the c=
ourse of time.
 
Now, I have added a manual for a short Kuja homam for Mars=
 that can performed everyday or once every week (Tuesday or some other day)=
 or once every month. It is hoped that some people will take advantage of t=
his manual, get some relief from the material troubles given by Mars that b=
lock their spiritual progress, make some spiritual progress and also contri=
bute to the well-being of the world in a small way.
 
Best regards,
Narasim=
ha
