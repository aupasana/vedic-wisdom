Dear All

Can anyone suggest a good Sanskrit edition of the Devi Mahatmyam?

The current book that I have is by Swami Jagishwarananda (Ram Krishna Math) and it does not have any of the samputikarana procedure as mentioned by Narasimha.

Any suggestion for good translations of the Chandi Paath in English would also be appreciated.

Thank you for your help.

Chandraprakash

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Samputikarana with beejas (Re: a question on Chandi Paath..)





Dear Utpal and friends,

Yes, this is samputikarana (enclosure). The entire prathama charitra is 
enclosed with Mahakali's beeja "aim". The entire madhyama charitra is 
enclosed with Mahalakshmi' s beeja "hreem". The entire uttara charitra is 
enclosed with Mahasaraswati' s beeja "kleem".

If you want to enclose any mantra with a beeja, the best way is to say "om 
beeja" at the beginning and "beeja om" at the end. For example, you can read 
Vishnu sahasra naama stotram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram with 
"om shriim" at the start of "shriim om" at the end of each verse, for 
prosperity. You can read Narasimha's mantra with "om kshroum" at the 
beginning and "kshroum om" at the end for removal of poisons (material and 
subtle). You can add "om kliim" and "kliim om" (at start/end) to several 
mantras, including Gayatri mantra, to overcome desires.

You can note that each chapter in Chandipath is also enclosed with plain Om. 
You get "om RShiruvaaca" at the beginning and there is an "om" at the end of 
the chapter. Placing plain Om at the beginning and end of a mantra is the 
simplest samputikarana. It is used for all the 13 chapters.

*        *        *

When you do Chandipath, it is actually fine to use the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, 
kleem) to do samputikarana of *each verse* in the respective chapters. For 
example, first chapter will go as

"om aim RShiruvaaca aim om
om aim saavaarNiH suurya tanayo yo manuH kathyate.aShTamaH
nishaamaya tadutpattim vistaraat gadato mam aim om
om aim mahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvantaraadhipaH
sa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH saavarNistanayo raveH aim om..."

Like this, add "om aim" at the beginning and "aim om" at the end of each 
verse in first chapter. For each verse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add "om 
hriim" and "hriim om". For each verse in other 9 chapters, add "om kliim" 
and "kliim om".

*        *        *

The beeja aim is known as sristhi beeja or creative seed. It puts life in 
material and subtle things. Note that Brahma is the rishi for the first part 
(pratha charitra).

The beeja hriim is known as maayaa beeja or delusion seed. It gives mastery 
over the delusion of this universe and helps one come out of maya. Note that 
Vishnu is the rishi for the middle part (madhyama charitra).

The beeja kliim is known as kaama beeja or desire seed. It helps overcome 
desires and cleanse one. Note that Rudra is the rishi for the final part 
(uttara charitra).

Best regards,
Narasimha
