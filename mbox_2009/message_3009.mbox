 Sometime in 1944-45, a devotee by name Somasundaram Pillai came to
Arunach=
ala with the intention of staying in the Ashram permanently. His wife
is al=
so a great devotee of Bhagavan. Her devotion is however of a peculiar
natur=
e.

It seems Bhagavan once appeared to her in a dream as a little child; so=
 she
wrote some verses about feeding the little child,bathing it, putting i=
t in a
cradle and lulling it to sleep.

She began singing those songs in th=
e hall and at times used to faint after
getting into an ecstasy. Her relati=
ves used to take her home on such
occasions with a strong belief that it wa=
s a divine blessing.

Bhagavan watched the whole thing with amusement but k=
ept quiet. One day, she
brought a cradle, sat opposite to Bhagavan in the h=
all, kept a small photo
of his in it, rocked the cradle and began singing a=
 lullaby. She had by her
side a diaper bag with a spare bed and children=92=
s clothing.People in the
hall were witnessing the whole thing with curiosit=
y.

She says, =91Come my little child; I will give you milk; I will give yo=
u a
bath; I will give you food; I will put you to sleep.=92 She is doing al=
l this
in my very presence. What to tell them! People do all sorts of funny=
 things
according to their preconceived notions. We have merely to keep qui=
et
witnessing them,=94 said Bhagavan.
