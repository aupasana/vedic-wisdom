Namaste,

i think you meant Kunjika Stotra and not devi sukta.

My opinion =
to add Swaha as under:
Add Swaha after -
Bhavet,Vaarchanam, Labhet, Paarvat=
i, Muttamam, phutt Swaha,
Mahishaardini, Kurushwa Me, Namostute, Mantrarupi=
ni, Subhamkuru,
Namo Namah, Swaha, Kurushwame, Paarvati, Rodanam yatha.

th=
ere are all the chances that i made mistakes here. it is as per 
how i reci=
te.

warm regards,

utpal

 to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommend homam with 
Kunjika stotra. Kun=
jika stotra is a coded stotra containing several 
mantras in coded form. It=
 is not what it may seem to be. It is for a 
reason that Shiva tells Parvat=
i that this prayer should be hidden 
like one's privates. It is weird that =
we are discussing such a 
secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a colle=
ction of powerful 
mantras for specific prayogas that would be considered 
=
raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the 
actions=
 is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.

do a homam with Kun=
jika stotra to stop the army of a country in

or delude someone etc and if you are 
detached enough to carry it off succe=
ssfully, then you will be given 
an opportunity by nature to learn it and d=

try?

 doing a homam with Kunjika 
stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses).=
 If that is too long 
for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th c=
hapter or just 
the 11th chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just=
 the 
moola mantra (navaakshari) .
