ONCE somebody asked Bhagavan, =93Why don=92t you visit places and guide peo=
ple
on the right path as Sankara and some others did?=94

Bhagavan: Merely =
being physically alive is itself an act of grace of
Mahatmas.Even if they k=
eep quiet, the vibrations set off by the power of
their tapas spreads harmo=
ny and peace.

The question itself was inappropriate in the first place.Div=
ine beings come
into the world with a purpose and no distractions of their =
mission are
desirable. The Maharshi=92s abidance in the Self was intended t=
o demonstrate
the importance of experiential knowledge as distinct from mer=
e bookish
knowledge. The desire for experiential wisdom depends on one=92s =
samskara and
there is no use trying to inspire those who do not desire libe=
ration.

Further, mouna-upadesa is best. That subtle power touches the subt=
le body of
the seeker and influences his samskara. Instead of preferring th=
is why look
for speech which is gross?

On another occasion a similar quest=
ion was put to Bhagavan, to which he
replied, =93If you go and ask an elect=
ric fan to give light, it won=92t give it.
So is the case with an electric =
light if it is asked to provide breeze.=94
Each person had an allotted role=
 to play, that was what Bhagavan meant.
