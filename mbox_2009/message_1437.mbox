Dear Raju,

>I am a normal humanbeing..and desires are thre in me.. 

i hop=
e i haven't hert you. i didn't write with the intention to belittle you or =
giving a theoritical lecture. if my message has given that feeling or it ha=
s created any feeling of complex or guilt in you,then i am sorry.

most are=
 not vignani here. you and me included. yesterday i recited durga saptashat=
i where in i was never in to it mentally. my mind was wandering in my profe=
ssional and other matters.... do you remember 'SO WHAT and SOHAM'? to kya h=
ua? Jaisi Maa ki Ichchha.

my main point to convey you and others is that w=
e have to start at some point in our life to struggle for Truth. till now w=
e were living and praying to god only for getting some thing or the other l=
ike money, flat, luxuries, good marks in exams, acadamic degree, fame, resp=
ect, importance, wife, children, their comfort, our comfort,career growth a=
nd infinite things. if we honestly judge, most of us have never loved god i=
n real sense. it was mostly bagging for our maintanance of body and ego. No=
w i am sure that when one starts struggle for truth, it will be a real fier=
ce struggle which will test one to the core. one might cry, feel frustrated=
, agitated, helpless, fallen, ruined, elated during this period. to fight s=
elfishness and achieve desirelessness is NO easy thing. 

I am very happy t=
hat you have now started doing Homa every day. please forget about the feel=
ings during Homam and after that. let it come and go. the other day you cal=
led me from Mumbai. i could feel your hapiness from you voice.

thanks to o=
ur dear Guruji Shri PVR Narasimha Rao Garu for the begining of bringing thi=
s change for us.

Regardlessly Yours,

Utpal
