Namaste

Please check the following

http://www.divyabhaskar.co.in/2008/06/=
04/0806042240_global_vorming_pray.html

It is in Mehasana and they are doin=
g 1 crore chandi homams or something like that. Please check the divyabhask=
er newspaper for 
june 4 2008 and the organiser is dayabhai patel in meldi =
mandir near ramosana.

They will recite 1 crore times and do homam for 10 l=
akh times something like that.

It may be worth going for a darshan to this=
 place as they are close to completion, as if done properly the energy will=
 be fantastic

My bad about modasa instead it is near mehsana. I am not fam=
iliar with these areas much so pardon my ignorance.

Best Regards
Mitesh
