Dear Aashish,
Maha Mrityunjaya Homam is  performed   for pleasing Lord Shiva  so that one can escape from  untimely death . Although in common parlance, it is understood that the homam is done 'with the objective of  achieving victory over death', who can escape from death?  One of the synonyms of Lord Shiva is Mrityu, meaning death. Lord Shiva is the destroyer of death.  The Mrityunjaya Mantram reads as follows:-
Tryambakam yajaamahe sugandhim pushti vardhanam
Urvaarukamiva bandhanaat mrityor muksheeya Maamrutaat
The homam is to performed with Durva Grass as the main offering. It is beleived that this homam bestows longevity on the performer. The Mantram is a prayer to Lord Shiva for alleviation of Mrityu Dosha or untimely death.It also cures chronic illness and grants healthy life. It should be performed on Birth Nakshatras .The havan is  not to be done  on English  Birthdate.  This homam is ,perhaps, one of the most effective spiritual  process of healing-to survive and rejuvenate a man or woman who is under a threat of life . By performing this yagnam it is believed that chances of  early or untimely death and fear of death is removed. It is also performed when one is suffering from prolonged sickness. This Mantram also protects one from accidents, any kind of misfortune etc. The Mantra has to be chanted  in proper and prescribed  svaras  and with high devotion and faith. The Ritwiks(Purohits)  performing the yagna should be well-versed in Vedas and dedicated.
 Purity of body and  dress  of the priests  is a must apart from mental purity. A word of caution: this havan or Japam will not save  one from meeting normal death especially in old age. Suggest you consult a competent Purohit who has already conducted this homam on many occasions. Any  South Indian Priest would have done this havan.
G.Balasubramanian

Dear Mr. Balasubramanian,
Please forgive my ignorance as I have no idea about Homam. I am a religious person do my japam's regularly. On special occasions I do 108 Atharvashirsa japams.   We don't have access to learned Vedic acharya's in Orissa.  After going thru Narasimhaji' s mail I thought of doing Homam. And the curiosity of doing Shiva homam as he has mentioned in the Shiva Homam can reduce Physical suffering.

So can you please elaborate Mritunjaya Mantra Homam as it's not in Narasimhaji' s list.

Regards,
Aashish

We generally call this as Rudra Homam and not as Shiva Homam. Mritunjaya Mantra Homam  (which mantra  is part of Rudrapatam)  is  recommended  for good  health and longevity.

Namaskar Narasimhaji,
Is there any harm in doing the Shiva Homam mentioned by you for physical health benefits? Can I do it for my son's health on his behalf? If yes, what other process or sankalp's will be needed for that.

Regards,
Aashish
