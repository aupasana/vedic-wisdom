Namaste,

Sorry to intervene!

This year contains 'Adhika Vaishakh'.

>this=
 somehow does not *feel* to me like Kaarthika month>

Probably he was right=
. During last 'Kartika Pournima' (1st/2nd Nov'09), Moon was Far off from 'K=
ruttika'nakshatraa. i.e. at the fag end of Pournima, Moon was in 1st pada o=
f Bharani.

***
i checked the subsequent months till Adhika Vaishakh and th=
ey are all expectedly Off by a month. However, after Adhika Vaishakh, all t=
he other months Pournima coincides perfectly with corresponding Nakshatra t=
ravelled by Moon (Exception is Shraavan, where Moon is very close to Shrava=
n nakshatra but not exactly IN Shravan during Pournima.

***
Just a passing=
 thought...If start of all months are Marked according moon's position in c=
orresponding Nakshatra while matching it to Pournima, then the whole concep=
t of tithi (distance between Sun & moon to be 12degree) will go invalid.
at=
 the moment quick understanding says that If our Lunar Months which are ent=
irely based on Distance between Sun and Moon- how they can exactly match 'N=
akshtra'position of Moon consistently.
and If we take Nakshtra position of =
moon to Mark our months then Tithis will never match the current defination=
 (12 degree between sun and moon).

***

can Maths solve this?

best regard=
s,

Utpal

ding to the definition used today, Margasira month starts when Sun and Moon=
 conjoin in Vrischika raasi, i.e. Moon is in Vrischika raasi at the end of =
Amaavaasyaa tithi when a new lunar month begins. If you look at the Pournim=
a of such a month in the last 3 years, Moon was indeed in Rohini/Mrigasira =
or in Mrigasira/Aardra on the Pournima day. The standard definition results=
 in the same reckoning most of the times. This year happens to be a border =
year where the two definitions are mis-aligned by one month.
>

e the error in reckoning came in during the last millennium or so. The birt=
h tithis of gods, rishis and yogis noted from the ancient times (e.g. Lord =
Rama's birth on Chaitra Sukla Navami, Dattatreya's birth on Margasira Pourn=
ima etc) must have been noted down using the "correct definition". It is up=
to us now to iron out the correct definition now.

re is a different energy around us at different times. However, most of us =
are not capable of identifying it. A yogi with zero ego and very pure consc=

near Mrigasira. He is instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini=
 in the evening. This is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.
