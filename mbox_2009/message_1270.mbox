Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.


I have a quick question for you if you have a =
moment. Are there any 
negative implications as per Vaastu or any other scr=
iptural source 
regarding having Puja room in one's basement? 

Besides thi=
s, I read that when reciting Japa one should face a certain 
direction, cou=
ld you kindly elaborate on this? Thank you very much.

Regards.
