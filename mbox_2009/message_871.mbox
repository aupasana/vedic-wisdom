Dear Sir,

I am reading your mails for last 5 to 6 months only and have mi=
ssed much
in the past when I was unaware of this Group. I want to read all
=
communication from the day Group started. How I can read those old
mails? W=
hat is the link?

Utpalji, you also tell me something for this matter. I ju=
st read
recently that Narsimhaji has written something on Vishnu Sahasra Na=
m
also. Oh, I missed that and I decided to read all valuable write ups of
p=
ast. But how?  I don't know.

Dr. Ashwin Rawal
