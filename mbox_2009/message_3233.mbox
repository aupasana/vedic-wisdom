Dear Sriram,

Looks like your friend is a big believer in the wisdom of the=
 book. Maybe you can share with him the wisdom about vegetarianism found in=
 these books!

>From a religious/spiritual perspective:
Food for the Gods by=
 Rynn Berry

Here is a review of the book
http://www.vegsource.com/berry/fo=
odgods.html

>From a secular/ethical perspective:
Eating Animals by Jonathan=
 Safran Foer

Here is the website for the book
http://eatinganimals.com/

T=
hese are very well researched and documented books and the websites also ha=
ve excellent links for your friend to explore.

If your friend prefers vide=
o to the written material, here is an website to jolt him to the reality of=
 his choices. BTW, I think this website also might be the one that the Utpa=
l's German acquaintance might have seen.

Sor=
ry, this does not answer your question directly but I hope it helps.

best =
wishes,
Chandraprakash
