Dear Siva,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Nice mail. However I have one issue with Sri Ravi=
shankar. Why did he accept to debate the infamous Zakir Naik on Hinduism? S=
ri Sri Ravishankar maybe an enlightened master but he just cannot debate. I=
f you see the vedios of that debate that happened a couple of years back, y=
ou will find Sri Ravishanker utterly clueless on stage, not knowing what an=
d how to counter the polemical queries of the Zakir Naik.
=C2=A0
Now when S=
ri Sri choses to accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he does not=C2=A0=
go there merely in his=C2=A0own capacity but as a representative of the rel=
igion - Hinduism. And when he fails miserably on stage, it becomes shameful=
 to watch for hindus. I mean, if you are not good with debating why did you=
 even take it up?=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I am sorry if this mail sounds a little stro=
ng, but everything I have stated here is a fact. The vedios are available f=
or free on youtube, for anyone who wants to see how that debate went.
=C2=
=A0
-Regards

The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhair=

 Of course, there are yogic techniques meant for raising Kundalini forceful=
ly (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara bandha). But, with such techniques, one=
 is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa discouraged his disciples (e=
.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda) from Hatha yoga and other Raja y=
oga practices, telling them to stay away from practices that emphasize the =
body and to absorb the mind in god'a name instead. He said that realizng go=
d through practices that
 emphasize the body and its perfection, is nearly =
impossible in this age due to impurities present everywhere, in food, water=
, air and thinking.<BR>> ><BR>> > If one practices yama, niyama=
 etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to go into sama=
dhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for most people=
. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body) is given t=
o one. If one is close to the bank (liberation) , one can just jump out of =
the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean jumps out o=
f the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bhakti yoga or=
 karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work without expecta=
tions as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja yoga, one ta=
kes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. That will wo=
rk if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Otherwise, jus=
t jumping out of
 the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lot of prepa=
ration. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one's progres=
s and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are done too =
early, it may result in irreversible damage.<BR>> ><BR>> > Bott=
omline: Use various praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physical =
and emotional health and to create an environment conducive to spiritual sa=
dhana. But do not be under an impression that you can realize god through s=

 ><BR>> > Regarding charging a lot of money for such things, one s=

or a reason. When Srila Prabhupada initiated so many people into mahamantra=

a really
 big organization, though he did not demand any fee for his lectur=

time to build, but it will last a long time. Things built with tamas or raj=
