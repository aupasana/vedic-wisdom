 Can God be found in the Scriptures? After reading the Scriptures, the
highest knowledge one can get is about the existence of a God; but God does
not appear to him who does not dive below the surface. Until then doubts are
not removed and Divine knowledge does not come.

You may read thousands of volumes, you may repeat verses and hymns by
hundreds, but if you cannot dive into the ocean of Divinity with extreme
longing of the soul, you cannot reach God. A scholar may delude the people
by his knowledge of the Scriptures and by his book-learning, but through
these he will not attain to God. Scriptures, books, sciences, what good will
they do? [p. 327]
