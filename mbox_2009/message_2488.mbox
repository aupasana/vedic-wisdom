Sri Narayan garu,
=A0
Thank you for the classification. I just wanted to do=
uble check about the thing we do.
=A0
Just curios about the example you ref=
erred about the karmic debt, is it regarding Vimalananda and Robert svoboda=
?
=A0
Thanks

=A0 



Namaste Shri =
Krishna Kanth,

I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.=
 Immediate family includes spouse, children and parents. However, if you ha=
ve a strong karmic connection with someone from previous lifetime's then th=
ey can also participate. Of course, this may not be obvious. For example, t=
here was a gentleman whose last rites was performed not by his kids, but by=
 one of his foreign students. Needless to say, the last rites are considere=
d very important ritual and is a privilege of the children, however, in thi=
s case since there was a karmic connection, the foreign student (whom the g=
entleman also considered as one of his spiritual children) ended up perform=
ing the ritual. 

Regards
Narayan
