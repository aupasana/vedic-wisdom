Namaste Narasimhaji, Rajarshiji, and Others,

While following the discussio=
ns on the other threads,
it struck me that even though our rishis and maha-=
purushas
had ability to look at past, present, or future,
there never has b=
een even one account to my knowledge,
where they could travel to the past. =
It looks like
time can only move monotonically forward as an absolute
princ=
iple, and what has happened cannot be fixed in the past
(unlike many sci-fi=
 movies)?

Regards.
