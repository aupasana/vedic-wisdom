Your lagna is Meena lagna and rashi is Tula rasi. For Meena lagna the 7th h=
ouse become the bhadhaka sthana and the bhadhakesa Mercury is sitting in th=
e 4th house which means that during your past life you have messed up with =
the house of the lord (temples).  Mutilated them hence the problem.  

The =
lord of the 7th house Mercury is sitting in the 4th house which confirm the=
 same.  Hence in order to rectify this issue you need to renovate a temple =
(may not be in a big way but do it)and also the lord Mercury himself is bec=
oming the bhadhaka you need to visit a navagraha temple on any of your birt=
h tithi which falls in any day of the month and offer sandalwood paste, per=
fumes to the lord mercury.

This would sort out the issue of bhadhaka.  

Y=
our 10th house lord JUpiter is sitting in the 11th house and got debilitate=
d here and in  retrograde.YOu need to recite the mantra of brihapati and al=
so perform pooja to him on every thursday by offering yellow flowers or gar=
lands.

Right now you are under saturn Maha dasa which started from 1998 ti=
ll 2017 with the antar dasa of Moon from 08.10.2009 till 08.10.2010.   Moon=
 is the lord of the 5th house governing your intelligence and children and =
as Moon is getting in the 8th house there would be probability that your in=
telligence/thinking capability would be low and also you would find situati=
ons where your child would get sick 

I also recommend you to recite vishnu=
 mantra to get the issue resolved totally

Regards
Uma shanker achanta
