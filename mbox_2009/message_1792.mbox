Namaste Narsimhaji,
  First of all,thankyou very much for this 'Bare minim=
um homam procedure.'I finally started doing homam on Narsimha jayanti day a=
s i could somehow not start on Akshay Tritiya.I have now done homam two day=
s in a row, and it has been a very fulfilling experience,esp. the first tim=
e.
  The mantra i did homam was Gayatri mantra.I have one query here-
I did=
 homam for around 10 mins.But i did not count,ie. i  do not know as to how =
many mantras i did as i was not using a mala,is it alright?or should i be c=
ounting and doing --say one whole mala?
  Also, as it was Narsimha jayanti =
the first day,i gave 5 aahutis for Narsimha,and on the second day,it being =
Kurma jayanti, i offered for Kurma devta.
  On both days, i offered a few a=
ahutis for Kuldevi,LakshmiNarayan and UmaMaheshwar---is that ok,Or should i=
 be doing homam with only one mantra?Also,i used 'svaha' after the mantra w=
ithout namah,i hope i did right

Thank you once again,
Sunita.
