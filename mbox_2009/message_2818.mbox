Namaste,
 
A tasty almond may be surrounded by a hard shell. A sweet mango may have a bitter peel covering it. To enjoy the almond or mango, you have to remove the shell or peel and throw it away.
 
Similarly, the external signs may be unpleasant, but they may just be hiding some pleasant energy. *Some* holy places where you can see rampant commercialism (e.g. priests harrassing people for money and not focusing attention on the pooja) or ignorant adherence to the letter of the customs while breaking the spirit (e.g. forceful feeding of cows like you mentioned) may still be filled with excellent spiritual energy that you can tap into if you do some spiritual sadhana there!

In some temples, the energy has indeed been dissipated already and there isn't much left. The daily rituals and periodic re-energization rituals are not working well because people doing them are not upto it. There are many temples like that.
 
However, there are also temples where there is powerful energy left still. It does not of course mean that everyone near that temple must be saattwik or spiritually elevated. To a blind-folded person, there is no difference between day and night. Even when Sun is shining brightly, he cannot see anything. Similarly, a person whose vision is blind-folded by the dark cloth of tamas cannot see the divine light near him.
 
*        *        *
 
As you correctly pointed out, good people sometimes ignorantly adhere to the letter of a custom while breaking its spirit blatantly.
 
An old astrologer once mentioned to me a griha pravesha (housewarming) ceremony he went to. It is believed that getting a cow inside a new house is an auspicious sign. So they rented a cow and got it inside the house. However, there were a few stairs to climb in order to get in and the cow was afraid to go up. They kept beating it agressively to force it to go up the stairs. That made this old astrologer very upset. Without any concern for propriety or diplomacy, he yelled at them for this unwise act, which was adharma in his view, and simply went out. Of course, they still persisted with their strategy and succeeded in finally getting the cow inside the house, thus following the recommendations of scriptures!
 
Unfortunately, well-meaning people engage in wrong actions thinking them to be the right actions, as they do not understand the spirit of customs and blindly follow the letter of customs.
 
Some religious activities of some people are based on fear, insecurity, greed etc, which are taamasik qualities, rather than love, compassion and surrender. That is the root of the problem.
 
*        *        *
 
BTW, Hari is correct. The temple I was thinking of is Vekkaali Amman temple near Tiruchirapally.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

But, my experience was really bad. I could see lot of commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there including those in position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could feel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main building and crows) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would not have been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and energised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then why did "locals" who have always been here, are getting corrupted. But, then probably the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incense disappear over the period of time.

After taking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per their "Custom". Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.

Rather, I always happen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that to keep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these places. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.
