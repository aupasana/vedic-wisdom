Dear Utpalji
=C2=A0
That was also the mantra that Swami Ramdass the great G=
uru to Shivaji Maharaj used to chant.
=C2=A0
Once I had gone to a Hanumanji=
 temple where I was told that wheneevr I mentally say Jai Hanuman, it is ev=
en more potent to say Ramdooth Hanuman ki jai!
=C2=A0
Using the word Ramdoo=
th makes Lord Hanuman even happier, I was told. 
=C2=A0
--Regards
=C2=A0Raj=
arshi



The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra
