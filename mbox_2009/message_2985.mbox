 14h December, 1949

On a festival day in 1944, some ladies were decorating=
 the floor of the
Ashram with rice paste prepared by soaking rice in water =
and then grinding
it. While returning from the cowshed, Bhagavan remarked t=
o the people
following him,=93Look at those people. See what they are doing=
. They
concentrate their mind on that sort of work. What to do? Let them ca=
rry on.
Be careful not to step on the drawings. Why should we step on them =
when they
are doing it with such great devotion?=94 So saying, he walked ca=
refully
without disturbing the designs and sat in the hall.

Immediately af=
ter that, Bhagavan noticed an old lady of the Ashram carefully
drawing desi=
gns with dry lime powder on the floor below the steps opposite
to the hall.=


Bhagavan called her by the familiar name, Granny, and when she came with
=
great expectations, he said, =93Look here,Granny. You are taking so much
tr=
ouble for decorating the floor with that powder, but is it rice flour?=94
W=
hen she replied that it was powdered lime only, Bhagavan said, =93What a
pi=
ty! It will not be useful even for the ants. The ladies there are also
doin=
g the same thing. It is mere waste of time.

Their work is of no use whatso=
ever. The paste they are using is made of rice
dough which sticks to the gr=
ound and so the ants cannot eat it. Decorating
the floor really means feedi=
ng the ants. If that dharma is given up and
powdered lime is used not only =
the ants cannot eat it but if, by
mistake,they come anywhere near, they die=
 because of the strong pungent
smell. Why all that? Please add at least som=
e rice flour to it.=94

An Andhra gentleman enquired, =93Is it for feeding =
the ants that in the
dhanurmasa, i.e., in the month of December- January, t=
hat floors are
decorated with rice powder?=94

=93Yes, of course!=94 said B=
hagavan. =93Out of their feelings of happiness and joy
at the receipt of th=
e fresh crop of rice, they decorate the floor with rice
powder thus feeding=
 the ants.Practices laid down by elders are always based
on kindness to liv=
ing creatures. But who cares for those traditions now?
They do most things =
just for the sake of beauty only.=94
