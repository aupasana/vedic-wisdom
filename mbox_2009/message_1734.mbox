Dear Narasimhaji,

I used your Homam manual to do the Mahamrityunjaya mantr=
a. I have done
this several times now over the past few weeks, early on Sun=
day
mornings.  The thing that concerns me is that there is an unmistakably
=
negative effect on one member of my family, and that person has a very
stro=
ng exalted, simhasanamsa, unafflicted, badhakesh Sun conjoining AK
Mercury.=
  I see this (the correlation between my doing the homam and the
negative e=
ffect) over and over and over again, it doesnt seem to be my
imagination. I=
 dont want to go too deep in the details.

I know you cant analyze anything=
 based on such little detail, but
clearly fire-based worship does seem to "=
play up" the agni-tattwa and
related planets, no? Are there "cooler", perha=
ps water-based forms of
worship too? After these thoughts came to my head, =
I saw that you have a
Pitri tarpana manual and it is water-based(!) as well=
.. But I dont
understand it well. Can you please explain a bit of the astro=
logy of
these worships - am I mistaken in noting this increase in agni-tatt=
wa
based planets, and "wanting" "cooler" forms of worship? A long time ago,=

I started listening to/chanting the Gayatri mantra, and I only saw
positiv=
e effects there (but there was no fire involved)..

Thank you very much in =
advance,

Sundeep
