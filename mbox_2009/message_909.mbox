Namaste,

I am glad. Good luck for future.

(1) Yes.

(2) Yes. If you say atharva seersham 8 times, you are putting 8x10 aahutis. 
First 79 aahutis are with swaaha and the final aahuti in the 8th time 
chanting (80th aahuti) is with vaushat.

(3) Yes, flower petals and fruits or fruit slices can be offered. But make 
sure that your fire is big enough to burn them. I am not sure the what they 
signify.

(4) Yes, you can. You can give give different items as aahuti in each 
swaahaa.

(5) Vishnu sahasra naamam (1000 names of Vishnu) is a very powerful prayer. 
It was revealed to the world bu Dharmaraja and Bhishma just before Kali yuga 
came, because it was to play an important role in Kali yuga. My guru asked 
me to spread Vishnu sahasra naama homam. That will come soon. I will give 
one for Shiva also.

Best regards,
Narasimha

>
> 4) if i say a particular mantra 10 times can i do 2-2 offering like

>
> 4) I use small homa kund, only 4.5 " to 4.5 ". Is it fine ?
>
> 5) Please post homam for Vishnu and Shiva also.

> Thanks very much for these homam procedures.
