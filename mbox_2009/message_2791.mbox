Namaste,

Thank you for the kind words.

Manish is trying to get it on some western channel, but it is not easy. The 
old views on Indian history are so well-established in the west, despite not 
being proven, that works containing any other ideas encounter heavy 
resistance. He has not ruled out any options yet and doing everything in his 
hands.

Those interested in the DVD can go to 
http://www.SaraswatiFilms.org/Krishna.html.

*        *        *

All the shooting was done by Manish himself for this movie. He received a 
little assistance from me and a couple of other people, but did all the work 
himself. For post-production work such as editing, music, graphics, voice 
over etc, he hired professionals in UK.

In 2007, he got inspiration during Chandi homam a few times that he should 
make movies on spiritual matters. First goal was to contribute towards 
undoing the false history of India. Second goal was to establish correct, 
tolerant and integrated ideas of religion and spirituality and eliminate 
divisive ideas. Third goal was to establish Veda dharma in the world. This 
movie is a *humble beginning* towards achieving those goals.

When Manish got that inspiration, he first ignored it. When the same 
inspiration kept coming in Chandi homam, he decided to act on it. Though he 
wasn't into photography, he spent a lot of money, bought a professional 
camera, learnt how to use it, created a screenplay and started shooting. In 
the beginning, he did not know what to do and how to do. One thing after 
another got just worked out and things just happened. As he has been in 
touch with me throughout this time, I am aware of how things happened and 
how it worked out. Apart from the content, the movie is quite good in 
technical aspects and visually good too. It is surprising that Manish has 
gotten such a good grip over photography in less than 2 years.

Manish used to say "this is our offering to Krishna and it should be as 
perfect as possible". He put in his best effort.

Hopefully, it will soon be on some channel. But it is all in His hands. As 
Manish keeps reminding me, only effort is in our hands. So we must put in 
the best effort possible. After that, we should not worry.

BTW, I know that the second movie "The Indian Jesus" is dedicated to showing 
how different religions show different paths to the same realization and how 
fights over religion are useless. This movie is based on the life of a great 
saint who taught tolerance. It advances several ideas regarding god, 
spirituality and religion, using the life and miracles of that saint as the 
backdrop. I think this movie is in post-production stages now.

Best regards,
Narasimha
