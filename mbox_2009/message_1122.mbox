Narasimha garu

what is the full meaning of the traditional blessing/slokam=
 - satamanam 
bhavathi, satayuh purusha, ....

 means the well wisher is blessing that the 
individual to invoke several (=
thousands, satah) powers within him/her - 
self.

when you have time, can y=
ou elaborate?

thanks
sri
