 12th April, 1948

=93After I came to this place, Tiruvannamalai, I had no =
bath for four months. One
day, when I was in the compound of the Arunachala=
 Temple, the wife of a
devotee by name Ponnuswami, came unexpectedly, pulle=
d me along, made me sit,
cleaned my head with soap-nut powder and gave me a=
 bath.

She had been coming to the temple every now and then; so I had thou=
ght that
she had come as usual, but that day, she had come there prepared! =
That was
my first bath.=94

=93Were you bathing regularly everyday afterwar=
ds?=94 I asked.

=93No, there was no question of a bath; who was to make me=
 bathe? Who was the
one to bathe? After that, a year or so passed in the sa=
me way.


I had been in Gurumurtham for some time, you see, and as not many=
 people
came there
every day, no one bothered me.

Even so, a lady, by name=
 Minakshi, who used now and then to bring food to
give me,
one day brought =
a large pot and began to boil water.

I thought it was for some use for her=
self, but, taking from a basket some
oil, soap-nut, etc., she said, =91Swam=
i, please come=92.

I did not move. But would she keep quiet! She pulled me=
 by the arm, made me
sit, smeared the oil all over my body and bathed me.

=
The hair on the head which had got matted for want of care, was now spread
=
out and hung down like the mane of a lion.

That was my second bath. After =
that,Palaniswami came and everything was
adjusted into routine of daily bat=
hs.=94

=93No, that is so,=94 said Bhagavan, =93it was never written then. =
Shaving was
also like that. The shave I had on the day I came here has been=
 recorded;
the second was after a year and a half.

The hair had got matted=
 and woven like a basket. Small stones and dust had
settled down in it and =
the head used to feel heavy. I had also long nails,
and a frightful appeara=
nce.

So people pressed me to have a shave, and I yielded. When my head was=
 shaven
clean, I began to wonder whether I had a head or not, it felt so li=
ght.

I shook my head this way and that to assure myself that it was there.=
 That
showed the
amount of burden I had been carrying on my head.=94
