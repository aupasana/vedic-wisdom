Good point. Yes, this Thursday coincides with Pushya nakshatr=
a and that is <br>
auspicious. Thursday is owned by Brihaspati/Guru (Jupite=
r). Among 28 <br>
nakshatras, Pushya is owned by Jupiter. Not only that, to=
morrow is Panchami <br>
tithi, also owned by Jupiter. Thus, tithi, vaara an=
d nakshatra are owned by <br>
Jupiter tomorrow. It is a day with very stron=
g Jupiterian influence.<br>
<br>
In India, entire Thursday after 9 am has t=
his combination. In US, this <br>
combination exists until 4:20 pm on Thurs=
day.<br>
<br>
One can pray to Jupiter. Or engage in vedic rituals such as c=
hanting <br>
chanting veda mantras, doing any kind of homam etc. Jupiter is=
 the foremost <br>
of Brahmins and stands for Brahminical activity.<br>
