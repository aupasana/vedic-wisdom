Namaste,

There have been saints like Sant Kabir and Shirdi Sai Ba=
ba, who have demonstrated how to reconcile.
 
Sai Baba broke the orthodox r=
ules of both Hindusm and Islam. Nobody knew till the end whether he was a H=
indu or a Muslim. He lived in a mosque and did namaz, but also maintained a=
 continuous fire with him like Hindu yogis. He did that inside a mosque, wh=
ich is considered blasphemous as Islam considers fire to be very inauspicio=
us! He gave sublime interpretations of Qoran and also Bhagavad Gita and oth=
er Hindu scriptures. He never hesitated to tell a Hindu, "Allah will do goo=
d to you" or to tell a Muslim, "Ram will bless you". Hindus and Muslims ali=
ke considered him their own and worshipped him. Even today, there is a spec=
ific ritual at his tomb in Shirdi, where Hindus stand on one side of the to=
mb and Muslims on the other and they worship him together, using their own =
methods.
 
It was heartening to me when I saw it. I saw a ray of hope in th=
e age of religious intolerance and fundamentalism and killing in the name o=
f god.
 
*        *        *
 
We have many religions and movements, most o=
f them started by people of varying levels of self-realization, who taught =
guidelines that were quite helpful and relevant to the spiritual progress o=
f people around them at their times. Just as raw grains remain fresh for a =
long time while cooked grains become stale fast, similarly uninterpreted an=
d intangible essence of the teachings of scriptures remains fresh for a lon=
g time while interpreted, tangible and clear guidelines that are ready for =
digestion by followers become stale (irrelevant/inapplicable) fast. Great t=
eachers effectively cook the raw grains of scriptural essence using the hea=
t of their wisdom and the water of their compassion and serve cooked food r=
eady for consumption by people around them.
 
When people stick to some irr=
elevant details and miss the essence, it can result in clashes and conflict=
s. The purpose of religion is to aid in finding god. Unfortunately, no univ=
ersal thumbrules can be given for finding god. A good religion will not dep=
end on a single text or person and will depend on a string of self-realized=
 souls who re-interpret previous texts based on their realization from time=
 to time. That is certainly true with sanatana dharma.
 
The last paragraph=
 in the following post is quite relevant in this context.

Dear Rajarshi,

Thanks for the information=
 on Wajid Ali Shah.

***
>Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the=
 perfected man. If >that perfected man could not have a directed communion =
with Allah >ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in >=
intermediary,

Islaam in nutshell is The life of Prophet Muhammad and writi=
ngs in Koran. That is the 'Patthar Ki Lakir' for all or most of them. so it=
 may not be difficult to *mugup* what is written in one book. so i dont den=
y that Dr. Naik knows Koran well.
***
I was told that Allah created beings-=
 first Angel, then Shaytan (FIRE) and finally Man (from Earth element-taken=
 as a best of creation). And then he asked Angel and Shaytan to Salute the =
Man which was obeyed by Angel but not by Shaytan. Shayatn then on started c=
orrupting minds of Men by influencing them to pray to the statues (images -=
 idolatary) and like wise getting them away from Allah.

I may be little wr=
ong in the above understanding.

***
 > However, one who does Homa need for=
 a=C2  deity need not worry >about these in the least. When a deity like Ma=
haganapati or >Chandika in present, nothing else will dare interfere.

I wa=
s just joking when i said that we do fire rituals. it was a teasing remark.=
 Fear ki to aisi ki taisi...

***
>The differences are so fundamental that =

be a >reconciliation.

You see my reply to Krishnendu about Fanatics and Bl=
ind *Faith*. when one keep faith in any one book/Man/idea, without understa=
nding or thinking, the earth will have blood shed and reconciliation will o=
nly be a day dreaming.

Thank God that Sanatana dharma is not the doctrain =
of a Single person or book or idea but a collective ocean where many rivers=
 meet and merge. 
 
Best Regards,

Utpal

Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C2 to be a branch of Islam. My perso=

in Islam that=
 *Shayatan* was created from the fire. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> Actually 
as f=
ar as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The 
en=
tities which live by fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are anoth=

class who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposed=
ly carry 
information from earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for =
the 
same.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult pr=
actitioner 
use Jinns for different purposes. I don't know what is the exac=

to Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I =
know people who do 
actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. May=
be they are something 
like spirits or beings of some astral plane. <BR>>=

who does Homa need for a=C2 deity need not wor=

deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in=

eal reason why most muslims have an issue 
with fire is because in one Hadi=
th it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked 
fire because it reminded him =
of Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the final 
times where the sinners=

fire.<BR>> =C2 <BR>&=

they run 180 degr=

In my=
 reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use 
h=
alf truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly a=
nd 
wholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - sp=

Hindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2 An explanation f=

digressing and long.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> But generally, if =
I were born in a 
muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadith=
s day in and day out 
and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and =
Muhammed as the perfected 
man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motio=
n, I would consider Zakir Naik 
to be 100 % correct. The differences are so=
 fundamental that unless one is ready 
to whitewash and ignore a LOT of thi=
ngs, there cannot be a 
reconciliation.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Remember, Aurn=

koran for 9 years. At the end of the nine yea=

t is no wonder that more than 
90 percent of muslim youth, even those highl=

a gift of Allah to the Ummah and the =
greatest 'scholar' of Islam and 
'comparitive religions' alive on earth. I =
am speaking from personal interaction. 
<BR>> =C2 <BR>> At some point=
 I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I 
don't. I find them to be a v=
