Namaste

In a discussion with another very learned individual, I was told =
this following statement:

"Valmiki had projected Ram as a person who tried=
 his level best to live by principles. He was still not God. Or, at least, =
he never realised he was an avatar (one who undergoes an 'avataran' (coming=
 down to earth to serve a specific purpose of the society of his time).

It=
 was latter day writers like Tulsidas who conferred godhood on Ram."


Is t=
his true? Is there any verse in the original Valmiki Ramayana which shows d=
ivinity (avatarahood) on Rama?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
