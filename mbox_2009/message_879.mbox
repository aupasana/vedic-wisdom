Dear Rajarshiji,
I am really thankful for a lucid and detailed reply on my =
query.
I value your inputs,particularly on Shrines at Durga Kund and Maa Vi=
ndhyavasini. I do agree to the idea that let any experience happen and make=
 me view it with saatvik bhava.

May we all be blessed to pray with all our=
 might !!! 

Thanking you again for the time and thoughts shared,
amit

Dear Amitji
=A0
Well the ghats are no doubt a marvel. Each one of t=
hem. There are in total 84 ghats, of which Dashashwamedha is the most famou=
s and most populated. Dont miss the arati of Ma Ganga every evening.
=A0
I =
felt Kasi to be a generally safe city if can ignore the pandas and random p=
urohits. Just keep walking on the ghats, its a marvellous experience. Every=
 ghat is unique and exciting. You will find lots of foreigners too living i=
n Kasi. One of the best ghats I found was the next to manikarnik ghat. I do=
nt recall the name right now, but if you walk from Dashashmedh towards Mani=
karnik ghat, there is a ghat which is a little isolated. There are some str=
uctes made of cement which jut out inside the the Ganges from the ghat. Dur=
ibng evening, after 6. its generally less populated area. So you can actual=
ly go and sit on the banks of this ghat and do your japa/meditation. Its wo=
nderful. No disturbance at all. I used to do that everday. 
The name of the=
 dasashmedh ghat is so because Brahma himself had done ten ashwamedha yagja=
s on this ghat to invite Lord Shiva in Kasi. That is why the name is Das-as=
hwamedha which has become Dashasamedha.
=A0
In the kasikhanda, it is descri=
bed that Lord Shiva took Ma Parvati along with him and showed to her what i=
s called teh Abhimuktashetra. In the Jaballa Upanished this Abhimuktashetra=
 (Kasi - the area between Varuna and Ganga) has been described as the area =
between the two eyebrows of a man. Here Lord Shiva established himself as A=
bhimukteshwara, that is Vishwanath, and recided in Kasi. Immediate hudreds =
of Pashupata Siddhas came into the area in astral bodies and rejoiced in th=
e glody of Shiva as=A0 the Supreme Lord of pure light.
=A0
While bathing in=
 the ghats, I would suggest be a little careful because some places are ver=
y slippery. What you can do is take a boat to teh otehr bank and then take =
a dip in the water. The boatman can charge you anytring between Rs100 to Rs=
250 (depending on your bargaining skills).
=A0
Then among the temples I wou=
ld stronly suggest goign to Sankataji Temple. On fridays, the temple gets o=
ver crowded, there is a well in the temple called chandra kupa. 
=A0
Then t=
he famous Durga Kund temple. Inside the temple, apart from teh main deity M=
a Chandi, there are also three other deities on the sides of the temple com=
plex. Saraswati, Mahalakshmi and Ma Kali. This is one of the MOST unique Ma=
 Kali partimas I have ever seen. She stands in a defiant tone with her head=
 pointed upwards and her tougue jutting out towards the sky. When I looked =
at Her, the first thought that came to my mind was to ask for forgiveness. =
All I could say was Ma kshama karo. Do sit infront of her and pray/meditate=
/do japa.
=A0
Then you can hire a car and visit Vindhyachal where there is =
a famous temple of Ma Vindabashini. This is one of the Shakti Pithas. Its a=
bout a couple of hours journery from Kasi in the neighbouring district call=
ed Mirzapur.
=A0
Actually there is so much to write about Kasi, I can go on=
 and on. Just have an open mind from teh time you land in Kasi. Take every =
experience, good or bad as a gift from the Almighty/Istha Devata and you wi=
ll surely cherish every bit of your stay there.
=A0

Dear All

First of all, wish e=
very one of you a very very wonderful and 
fullfilling year ahead.
 Last we=
ek I had been on a trip to Kasi. It 
turned out to be a terrific trip for m=
e. That city has a strange 
spiritual atmosphere unlike any other place I h=
ave been to. Just in 
case someone is planning on a trip to Kasi any time i=
n the future, 
do not miss out of the following places/temples apart from t=
he 
regular temples. The following are lesser know but really powerful 
pla=
ces of worship which I came across during my trip last week:

1) Chausat Yo=
gini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temple has one 
idol for the 64 Yogini=
s and an idol of Ma Kali. 

2) Temple of Lord Shiva as Kedareshwar in Kedar=
 Ghat. An amazing 
temple. 

3) Sankata Temple near Schindhia Ghat. 

4) Bi=
ndu Madhav temple 

5) The temple of Gopal where Anandamayi Ma used to wors=
hip. 

6) Kinnaram Baba's Ashram. There is a dhuni in the ashram which was =

lit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a funeral pyre and has been
 
burning co=
ntinuously since then. The deity in Agni Rudra. Regularly 
wood from the ma=
hasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordinary people 
are not allowed to giv=
e any ahutis in that fire but one can sit 
close to it and meditate. I felt=
 that ashram to be one of the most 
powerful places I had ever been to. 

J=
ust thought of sharing the names of these places I came across 
during my v=
isit this time. 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
