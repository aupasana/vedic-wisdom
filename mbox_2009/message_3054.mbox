Subject: Fire ritual using funeral pyre (Re: on the final rites of a person)

Namaste,

I am cc'ing to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without revealing your identity.

Unfortunately, I am not familiar with rituals related to final rites.

I was told that a homam like fire ritual can be performed on a funeral pyre 
by changing some standard aahutis and changing some mantras like 
"kravyaadamagnim". For example, "kravyaada" form of Agni is requested to 
leave in that Veda mantra. But it is that form of Agni, which will consume 
the corpse and carry the person. So that Veda mantra is inappropriate when 
doing a fire ritual using funeral pyre.

I was told that a Chandi homam can be performed on a funeral pyre with some 
small changes and know someone who actually did it.

However, if one's conditioned mind has ANY discomfort with that idea and 
cannot respectfully and humbly visualize the divine Mother coming in that 
fire, there is no point in doing such a ritual. When you call a deity into 
an idol or fire and worship, you should be able to imagine that deity in 
that object. If an object is impure and inappropriate for a deity's entry in 
one's mind, one should not call that deity into that object.

As I was not interested, I did not find out details about changes to homam 
procedure when using funeral pyre. But there are methods given in shastras. 
The bottomline is that your pandit may have known what he was doing and 
doing something quite appropriate.

Best regards,
Narasimha
