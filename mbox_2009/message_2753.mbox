Namaste,

Thi=
s is excellent - your terminology seems to be evolving and getting refined =
now. At one stage, you said "Ahamkara isn't the dominant cause of I-ness in=
 Astral/Causal bodies", while I was saying ahamkara=3DI-ness. Now, you wrot=
e:

> PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D ASMITA =3D Physical Egotism
> ASTRAL I=
-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D MANAS =3D Astral attachments
> CAUSAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA=
) =3D CHITTA =3D Causal Perceptions

So you are acknowledging that I-ness a=
nd ahamkara are synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal pla=
nes. It is good that you are slowly converging!

* * *

I did not want to d=
ivert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individualized consci=
ousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your references to Pa=
tanjali. Now that there is some convergence on "ahamkaara", let me address =
"asmita" mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.

> identification of the seer =

You are assuming tha=
t physical senses or physical body is the only instrument of seeing (or exp=
eriencing) .

However, mind can see, hear, feel and experience things even =
when it is not working with a physical body and physical senses. For exampl=
e, one's mind may "see" something in a dream without the physical eyes seei=
ng anything.

Also, a yogi in deep meditation may see, hear, feel or experi=
ence something without the involvement of eyes, ears and other physical sen=
ses.

If such a yogi identifies with the instrument of that experience, i.e=
. the mind, that too is asmita as per Patanjali's yoga sutra that you quote=
d. Just as I had an issue earlier with your limiting of ahamkaara to physic=
al body, I also have an issue with your limiting of asmita to physical body=
.

BTW, identification with physical body *as well as* identification with =
mind block one from yoga (communion) with true Self. Both are due to ahamka=
ara as defined by upanishads. Both are due to asmita as defined by Patanjal=
i.

Best regards,
Narasimha

BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual imp=
ressions of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa =
Guna, it doesn't have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impres=
sions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn't autom=

while talking about Patanjali Sutras brought in the conflict. In any case, =
what is called as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, =
which can be very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.<BR>> <BR>> The idea sta=

that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don't have sense of Asmit=

BR>> <BR>> Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings=
 in the Astral cosmos who have
 never been in Physical forms - We Physical =
beings are not the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will sti=

 One may h=
ave forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think o=
f something else as "I". In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body=
 or may not even "see" onself, but still one may have the sense that so and=
 so thing is happening to "me". So, even when the mind is drawn away from t=
he physical body, there is still a notion of "I am this" (I-ness) in a drea=
m. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.<BR>> > > > <BR>=

eover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with =
each other, whether we use the word "control" for some of those interaction=
s or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges va=
rious past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells=
 it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) a=
nd makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my =
manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.<BR>> > > &=

not "read up" these things in a single place. There are different abstracti=
ons and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. There a=
re several sources that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in sli=
ghtly different terms. One will assimilate this knowledge better if one rea=
