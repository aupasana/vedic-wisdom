Namaste Prasad,

I guess he has the right to post what he wants. However, I=
 agree with you. I see no point in the cut-paste posts. It would be more he=
lpful if one adds one's opinion which could blossom into a positive discuss=
ion and a learning opportunity. After all, they might as well provide the w=
eb url or the book name and we could always buy it or read it online. If pe=
ople take the contents directly from the web and paste it here, then I woul=
d strongly discourage this kind of posts. However, if they have painstaking=
ly typed up the matter from books, then I don't have the heart to ask them =
to stop it.

I usually skip these posts and others where the fonts are enla=
rged and bold to such a point that it makes it difficult to read and irrita=
ting. People should realize, in the internet/email medium, using upper-case=
, bold. italics have a different meaning especially if one wants to strongl=
y emphasize a point. What's the point of writing the entire article in the =
same manner??

Anyways, I don't want to write more on this topic and consum=
e members bandwidth.

Thanks & Regards
Narayan
