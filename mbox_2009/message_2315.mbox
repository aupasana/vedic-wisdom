Namaste Narasimha & Narayan,
    As I re-think on this, I realize that my i=
ssue is not with the 'cut & paste' nature of the posts as much as with the =
frequency or volume of such posts that may start appearing on this list and=
 thus making it difficult for members to follow the threads/topics. As Shri=
 Narasimha had remarked, if the posters show some discretion on the length,=
 frequency and volume of such posts then it'd definitely be more 'palatable=
' experience. Just my thoughts and I apologize if this thread had hurt anyo=
ne unintentionally. 
Regards,
-Prasad

 Based on my own experiences, I could finally make sense of various seeming=

one wants to cover, over a period of time. So please limit such posts.
