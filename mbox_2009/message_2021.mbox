Namaste Narasimha Garu and Rajarshi,

>Moreover, when it comes to great lin=
eages, there are connections >between all. 

Yes. quite evident. I have rea=
lized this very fact a couple of years back. also i meant the same thing wh=
en i mentioned in one of the messages that Homam movement has been started =
by various sources parallely.

To Rajarshi - It was a fantastic read. I lik=
ed your delineation and detailed understanding of Aurobinod's article. As y=
ou rightly mentioned, when we sum up the article and Narasimha's feeling (a=
nd foresight of few others as well), it can mean that the Age of Truth or D=
harma (However small duration it may last) within Kaliyuga is about to Star=
t - Probably, in the coming few decades or centuries ground will be prepare=
d.


>There are so many different elements in the Universe, as well as >dif=
ferent Universes, that compared to all that we are too tiny as a >species. =


If Information from one particular slide (About Physical Universe)is any =
way close to authentic, then, the scaling of Milky Way and our solar system=
 can be relates thus: if Milky way is mapped to 130 Km in Diameter - Our en=
tire solar system is reduced to 2mm in width.

So now any scale to map our =
physical ego?

Warm Regards,

Utpal

the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobi=
ndo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his h=
igh states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in=
 the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right her=
e on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was =
now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a br=

      Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, M=
irra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked =
on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to =
the colossal uncertainties we face today.
>                 =EF=BF=BD

             Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, =
and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of =
the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pro=
cess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolu=
tion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these =
two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fores=
aw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BD=
supramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change =
everything on Earth.
>                 =EF=BF=BD
>                 Man=EF=
=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he =
makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom ac=
tive in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstr=
ucted from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is=
 a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses se=
ems to contradict it.
> 
>                 Sri Aurobindo recognized that hu=
mankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached i=
n which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is =
left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Mean=
while, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness hi=
gher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has re=
cently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Ou=

      Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and lat=
er with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap =
forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Superm=
ind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we wi=
ll soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=
=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessi=
ng an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and mergi=
ng with it.

is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-=

 of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to=
 merge with cellular consciousness.

the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.
> 
>    =
             The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing=
 supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their ow=
n bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supram=
ental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness=
 fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its ful=
l manifestation in collective matter.
>                 Whenever there is a=
 =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo=
 and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=
=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is=
 the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and=
 the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, a=
nd which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them =
the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently=
, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter=
 two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the=
 Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during Worl=
d War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence=
. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing o=
ther world leaders in the current political sphere.

th the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete hum=
an structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that al=
though the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrop=
hic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for t=
he most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, ca=
rried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by mean=
