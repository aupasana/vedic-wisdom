This list is unmoderated. People here are usually gentle, =
humble, compassionate and unassuming and I never had to moderate. Unfortuna=
tely, you are correct and we had a spate of uncivil posts. I will start to =
warn the offending members and ban them if they continue to offend after be=
ing warned.
 
It is unfortunate that people interested in spiritual knowled=
ge should exhibit uncivil behavior in addressing others.
 
However, as more=
 and more people start coming, we can expect such disturbances now and then=
. I urge members not to be perturbed by new members with an attitude proble=
m, ignore them as best as they can and stick to the subject matter and to c=
ontinue their activities as usual.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
