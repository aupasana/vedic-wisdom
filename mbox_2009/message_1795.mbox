Namaste

Good Question, thanks for this, it would be nice to hear more on t=
his subject.

I feel that from one perspective all mantras do get you to sa=
me level
at some point in time, if done with correct bhava and surrender et=
c ..

What we want is chit shuddhi and to get there, there is evidence
peop=
le have used different mantras and have reached similar higher levels of co=
nscoiusness.

But we still have many mantras too and people have very uniqu=
e and differing opinion. Earlier I too felt differently about each mantra a=
nd was curious about it them, always wanting to do the most potent
and powe=
rful mantra so that the progress speeds up but off late
I feel differently =
and agree with Narasimha and other to stick to
one and that one mantra will=
 do the trick, same with homa also

I did some Lord Ganapati and then here =
and there lord krishna and goddess laxmi devi, lord narasimha dev etc and t=
hen due to winter stopped doing it,
now I am gradually starting or thinking=
 about them, may be start with
lord ganapati homa and try to do it atleast =
40 times or so and then
may be observe at that time what is in store in the=
 mind and also the external circumstances.

For lord ganpati one mantra tha=
t resonates to me at this time is
"Om Gam Gluam Ganpataye VighnaVinashine s=
waha". Please pardon my spelling errors here. I am sure others feel strongl=
y too about other mantras.

I feel a lot of Lord Ganapati Mantras help remo=
ving obstacles, and there may be special mantras for special results or exp=
ectations,
and a lot of people feel strongly about it.

I feel that one can=
not escape prarabdha karmas, when sanchit karmas take the form of prarabdha=
 karmas, sometimes we get good direction and get special mantras and they m=
ay help but also at times even trying special mantras one seem to not get a=
ny help over prarabdha karma. It is all play of conciousness and unfolding =
or fruitification of karma.

May be I digressed and moved in different dire=
ction, I thought it is important to see different mantras in the light of a=
chiving progress in spiriruality, overcoming obstacles, and our curiocity a=
t times help us get confused and lost.

I do believe one should understand =
about different mantras and firmly pick quickly with conviction one and use=
 that mantra for some period of time without expecting any results or quick=
 expectations. Again this applies towards progress in spirituality and not =
for mantras for worldly expectations. That is a different thing altogether,=
 for instance someone wants a child or someone wants to get married or over=
come some challenges, there are mantras for it and one should consult exper=
ts on mantra shastra, and many times the karmas do play their role and to t=
he extent possible it is better to let it play and be done with it and move=
 forward.

Best Regards
Mitesh
