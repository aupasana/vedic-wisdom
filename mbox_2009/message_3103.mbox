Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I read the other mail. Its very true and corr=
ect.
=C2=A0
It is also true that Sai Baba did a lot for unifying the commun=
ities. However the current=C2=A0truth is that the effect of Sai Baba on lar=
ger muslim psyche is very less, to be honest almost negligible.
=C2=A0
In h=
istory there have been people who have tried to modify, change, reinterpret=
 Islam based on desh-kaal-patra but it only resulted in more violence. The =
Ahamadiyas get persecuted ruthlessly even today=C2=A0just as the Bahai foll=
owers.
=C2=A0
Again the reason is because Muhammed had told muslims that no=
thing can change from what he has been told, he is the last prophet and Kor=
an is the direct and final=C2=A0word of God. Nothing more after this. Plus =
da'wa or inviting non muslims to take up Islam is their holy duty which wil=
l earn them a place in heaven. They truely and blindly believe in these two=
. No amount of logic, reason etc will work here. 
=C2=A0
Hence Islam cannot=
 change. It never has, it never will. It can only die.
=C2=A0

There have been saints like Sant Kabir and Shirdi Sai Baba, who have=
 demonstrated how to reconcile.
=C2=A0
Sai Baba=C2=A0broke the orthodox rul=
es of=C2=A0both Hindusm and Islam. Nobody knew till the end whether he was =
a Hindu or a Muslim.=C2=A0He lived in a mosque and did namaz, but also main=
tained a continuous fire with him like Hindu yogis. He did that inside a mo=
sque, which is considered blasphemous as Islam considers fire to be very in=
auspicious! He gave sublime interpretations of Qoran and also Bhagavad Gita=
 and other Hindu scriptures. He never hesitated to tell a Hindu, "Allah wil=
l do good to you" or to tell a Muslim, "Ram will bless you". Hindus and Mus=
lims alike considered him their own and worshipped him. Even today, there i=
s a specific ritual at his tomb in Shirdi, where=C2=A0Hindus stand on one s=
ide of the tomb and Muslims on the other and they worship him together, usi=
ng their own methods.
=C2=A0
It was heartening to me when I saw it. I saw a=
 ray of hope in the age of religious intolerance and fundamentalism and kil=
ling in the name of god.

=C2=A0

We have many religio=
ns and movements, most of them started by people of varying levels of self-=
realization, who taught guidelines that were quite=C2=A0helpful and relevan=
t to the spiritual progress of people around them at their times. Just as r=
aw grains remain fresh for a long time while cooked grains become stale fas=
t, similarly uninterpreted and intangible essence of the teachings of scrip=
tures remains fresh for a long time while interpreted, tangible and clear g=
uidelines that are ready for digestion by followers become stale (irrelevan=
t/ inapplicable) fast. Great teachers effectively cook the raw grains of sc=
riptural essence using the heat of their wisdom and the water of their comp=
assion and serve cooked food ready for consumption by people around them.
=
=C2=A0
When people stick to some irrelevant details and miss the essence, i=
t can result in clashes and conflicts. The purpose of religion is to aid in=
 finding god. Unfortunately, no universal thumbrules can be given for findi=
ng god. A good religion will not depend on a single text or person=C2=A0and=
 will depend on a string of self-realized souls who re-interpret previous t=
exts based on their realization from time to time. That is certainly true w=

Dear Rajarshi,

Thanks f=

Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If >that perfected man could not have a d=
irected communion with Allah >ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril =
in Arabic) as in >intermediary,

Islaam in nutshell is The life of Prophet =
Muhammad and writings in Koran. That is the 'Patthar Ki Lakir' for all or m=
ost of them. so it may not be difficult to *mugup* what is written in one b=
ook. so i dont deny that Dr. Naik knows Koran well.
***
I was told that All=
ah created beings- first Angel, then Shaytan (FIRE) and finally Man (from E=
arth element-taken as a best of creation). And then he asked Angel and Shay=
tan to Salute the Man which was obeyed by Angel but not by Shaytan. Shayatn=
 then on started corrupting minds of Men by influencing them to pray to the=
 statues (images - idolatary) and like wise getting them away from Allah.

=
I may be little wrong in the above understanding.

I was just joking when i said that we do fire ri=

You see my reply to K=

book/Man/idea, without understanding or thinking, the earth will have blood=
 shed and reconciliation will only be a day dreaming.

Thank God that Sanat=

 In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and =

<DIV> </DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I read the other mail. Its very true and correct.</D=
IV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It is also true that Sai Baba did a lot for unif=
ying the communities. However the current truth is that the effect of =
Sai Baba on larger muslim psyche is very less, to be honest almost negligib=
le.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In history there have been people who have=
 tried to modify, change, reinterpret Islam based on desh-kaal-patra but it=
 only resulted in more violence. The Ahamadiyas get persecuted ruthlessly e=
ven today just as the Bahai followers.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ag=
ain the reason is because Muhammed had told muslims that nothing can change=
 from what he has been told, he is the last prophet and Koran is the direct=
 and final word of God. Nothing more after this. Plus da'wa or invitin=
g non muslims to take up Islam is their holy duty which will earn them a pl=
ace in heaven. They truely and blindly believe in these two. No amount of l=
ogic, reason etc will work here. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Hence Islam =
cannot change. It never has, it never will. It can only die.</DIV>
