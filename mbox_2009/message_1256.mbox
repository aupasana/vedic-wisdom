Dear PVR,
It is great to hear that u are doing this great activity. I am in=
 
India so i can not attend and enjoy ensuing bliss of the same. 
It is sta=
ted by masters that mass puja provides joy to all. 
Meditation too can be d=
one together. Solitary Meditation is 
considered best. My personal experien=
ce is also same. One definitely 
enjoys both, but i feel solitary meditatio=
n is better.

What is your opinion on above? I think one suits to some and =
other 
suits to some other people.

Regards,
sanjeev
