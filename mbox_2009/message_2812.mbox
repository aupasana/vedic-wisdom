 20th June, 1947

Four or five days back, a notebook of Madhavaswami was fo=
und. As Bhagavan
was looking into it, he saw a Tamil verse in it written by=
 him, long ago. It
was in Malayalam script, and while transcribing it into =
Tamil he told us its
meaning: =93When a man attains jnana, he will not have=
 any regard for this
body.

Just as, after taking food, the leaf on which i=
t was taken is thrown away
however nice it may be, so also after attaining =
jnana one will be waiting
eagerly for the time when it can be thrown away. =
This is the essence of what
is stated in this verse.=94

He then wrote it i=
n Tamil script and began telling us further as follows:
=93The symbol of th=
e used leaf has been given by many people. However nicely a
leaf-plate is s=
titched, it is useful only until the meal is over.

After that will there b=
e any regard for it? It is immediately thrown away.
Rich people have food o=
n silver plates with gold flowers inlaid in them. Why
are such things requi=
red when we have hands given by God?

=93When I was on the hill someone got=
 a leaf plate made of silver and
requested me to eat from it. I sent it bac=
k saying that I did not require
it. When the food can be eaten out of the h=
ands, why silver and gold? For a
long time I did not eat food from a leaf.
=

If anybody brought food, I used to stretch out the palms of my hands and
w=
hen the food was put in them I used to eat it. It is only of late that I
ha=
ve begun eating food served on a leaf.=94

When you have hands, why all the=
se things? It used to be an exhilarating
experience in those days. When I w=
as going out for bhiksha, I used to take
the alms in the palms of my hands =
and go along the street eating it.

When the eating was over I used to go o=
n licking my hands. I never used to
care for anything. I used to feel shy t=
o ask anyone for anything. Hence that
karathala bhiksha (alms in the palms)=
 used to be very interesting.

There used to be big pundits this side and t=
hat; sometimes big government
officials also used to be there. What did I c=
are who was there?

It would be humiliating for a poor man to go out for bh=
iksha,but for one who
has conquered the ego and become an Advaiti, it is a =
great elevation of the
mind. At that time, he would not care if an Emperor =
came there.

In that way, when I went out for bhiksha and clapped my hands,=
 people used
to say, =91Swami has come=92, and give me bhiksha with fear an=
d devotion. Those
who did not know me used to say, =91You are strong and st=
urdy.

Instead of going out like this as a beggar,why don=92t you go out to=
 work as a
cooly?=92 I used to feel amused. But I was a Mouna (silent) Swam=
i and did not
speak.

I used to laugh and go away feeling that it was usual=
 for ordinary people to
talk like that. The more they talked like that the =
more exhilarated I felt.
That was great fun.=94

=93In Vasishtam, there is =
a story about Bhagiratha before he brought Ganges
down to the earth. He was=
 an Emperor but the empire seemed to him a great
obstacle to atmajignasa (S=
elf-enquiry).

In accordance with the advice of his Guru and on the pretext=
 of a yagna
(sacrifice), he gave away all his wealth and other possessions.=


No one would, however, take the empire. So he invited the neighbouring Ki=
ng
who was an enemy and who was waiting for a suitable opportunity to snatc=
h it
away and gifted away the empire to him. The only thing that remained t=
o be
done was to leave the country.

He left at midnight in disguise, lay i=
n hiding during day time in other
countries so as not to be recognised and =
went about begging alms at night.
Ultimately he felt confident that his min=
d had matured sufficiently to be
free from egoism.

Then he decided to go t=
o his native place and there went out begging in all
the streets. As he was=
 not recognised by anybody, he went one day to the
palace itself. The watch=
man recognised him, made obeisance and informed the
then King about it, shi=
vering with fear.

The King came in a great hurry and requested him (Bhagir=
atha) to accept the
kingdom back,but Bhagiratha did not agree. =93Will you =
give me alms or not?=94
he asked. As there was no other alternative, they g=
ave him alms and he went
away highly pleased.

Subsequently he became the K=
ing of some other country for some reason and
when the King of his own coun=
try passed away, he ruled that country also at
the special request of the p=
eople. That story is given in detail in
Vasishtam.

The kingdom which earli=
er appeared to him to be a burden did not trouble him
later when he became =
a Jnani. All that I want to say is, how do others know
about the happiness =
of bhiksha? There is nothing great about begging or
eating food from a leaf=
 which is thrown out after taking food from it.
