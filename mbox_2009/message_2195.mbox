Namaste Rajarshi ji & Friends,

Thats nice. All the best!

One more thing, =
I don't know to read tamil/malayalam (mother tongue) script, and very shaky=
 with Devanagari script and hence it's a chore for me. I am sure most membe=
rs are well versed with their mother tongue and will be able to read it flu=
ently and in a shorter time than mine.

Regards
Narayan

 I find is that, the Chandi I have is a version I had bought from the Ramak=
rishna Mission, in Bengali, my mother tongue. This publication of Chandi is=
 very popular in west bengal, unlike the Gita Press publication. And when I=
 bought a Gita=A0Press Chandi and compared it recently, I found that there =
are words and places (sandhis) which are different in the two!

Anyway kindly tell me where I can find this mp3.
