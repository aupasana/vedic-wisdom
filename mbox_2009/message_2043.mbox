Dear Narasimhaji

Namaste,

Thanks for the detailed explanation. It really =
helps and I really appreciate
your time & patience in explaining it so beau=
tifully for a layman.

One followup question:

Regarding Homam - will it no=
t depend on my chart? As per my chart (26/2/73,
17:07, 87E19,23N29, Leo Lag=
na) and my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta
will be Shiva(Sun), Palan=
 devta is Samba siva (have not heard much about
him) and Guru Devta is Skan=
ada.

Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME of shiva =
and
ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It's a difficult to describe feeling=

- it's as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me. Recently, I
w=
ent to a shani( w/Hanuman & Ganesha) temple, and it also seemed to have
goo=
d vibration to me. How do I reconcile these facts on choosing the homam?
Is=
 it just the play of my mind to be ignored , or divine intervention to be
i=
nterpreted.
Or
if Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting point before we go ah=
ead with any
effort at reconciliation.

Thanks & Regards

Sanjay

<div>Thanks for the=C2=A0detailed explanation. It really helps an=

<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>One followup question:<=
/div>
<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Regarding Homam - will it not depend on my cha=
rt? As per my chart (26/2/73, 17:07, 87E19,23N29, Leo Lagna) and my brief s=
tudy of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta will be Shiva(Sun), Palan devta is Samba si=
va (have not=C2=A0heard much about him) and Guru Devta is Skanada. </div>

=
<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy =
in SOME of shiva and ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It's a difficul=
t to describe feeling -=C2=A0it's as if a spiritual energy/vibration is=
 surrounding me.=C2=A0Recently, I went to a=C2=A0shani( w/Hanuman=C2=A0&=
; Ganesha)=C2=A0temple, and it also seemed to have good vibration to me. Ho=
w do I reconcile these facts on choosing the homam? Is it just the play of =
my mind to be ignored=C2=A0, or divine intervention to be interpreted.=C2=
=A0</div>

<div>Or </div>
<div>if=C2=A0Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting =
point before we go ahead with any effort at reconciliation.</div>

 and remove the attachment to and dependency on those things. However, it i=

one, even as one remains in their middle! Staying away from something is ne=
ither necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment.=C2=A0What things and=
 people are around you and what actions you engage in are <em>not </em>the =
problem that blocks you from moksha. It is how <em>you</em> look at them an=
d with what frame of mind <em>you </em>engage in the actions that are the b=
lockages. So the problem is not the material world around you, but <em>your=

<div>Dear Narasimha,</div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=
=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Very good article/discussion..Thanks for sh=
aring it.</div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<d=
iv>If I can, Let me also ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all th=
is. Search for some answers has brought me to this forum.) </div>
<div><fon=
t face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>a) Why Madhukaitam is =
=C2=A0so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being sustained by people ke=
eping their head down and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God =
by keeping our head down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious a=
nswer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self=
-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? </div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=
=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituality and materialis=
m two poles apart (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach th=
e heights of professional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a=
 good spiritualist (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, =
does it mean I should stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do =
understand about "Limited Bandwidth" issue - but, then I also rea=
d about King Janak. Can I combine these two - if yes, how?</div>

<div><fon=
t face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>
<div>c) Getting even =
more confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation is our=C2=A0spirit=
ual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - should our goal not=
 be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play. By seeking for =
emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and trying to escape the r=
ole assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God's scheme of things=
 by trying to get out of the scheme? </div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=
=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>d) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to pu=
t us in this "maya" first and then ask us to get out of the "=
;maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be playing=C2=A0"=
;rats in the maze" game. Then, why??</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" =
size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>e) Sometimes, I also think that all the=
se above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid and the way=
 she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying about her profes=
sion or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Emancipation/Merger=
 in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking at the begi=
ning of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more till we =
are ready (for what?)</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=
=C2=A0</div>
<div>f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual journey? where/how =
do we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - but is that the =
right way? or there is another way. Probably, there are many ways - then ho=
w do I choose my way? An "user guide" or " spirituality for =
dummies" book=C2=A0 would have been useful. Do we have one?</div>

<di=
v><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>I will appreciat=
e if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I dono=
t even have the right question right now - forget about articulating them w=
ell and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))</div>

<div>I have a question. Though it will probably sound stup=

to it, so thought of putting this question in this forum.</div>
<div><font =
face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>You mentioned that a=C2=
=A0senior=C2=A0Maharishi is doing this. In the books of Vimalananda he says=
 Naths, Munis and Rishis are higher beings, even higher than deities.</div>=

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>What confuse=
s me is that, what can be higher than a deity? For example Goddes Durga is =
the supreme mother of all worlds, then how can a Rishi or any being be high=
er than Her? Or lord Shiva or Narayana?</div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" siz=
e=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>I mean is it the Rishi who is acting our t=
he Mother's instructions or is it She who is creating the environment f=
or the Rishi's wish to come true? Which one came first?</div>
<div><fon=
t face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>It gets confusing-:(. =
</div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>As a d=
evotee it is natural and simple to believe that the God I pray to is the Ul=
timate Supreme authority, but when I hear that Rishis are even beyond this,=
 then doubt creeps in, is the deity therefore not as supreme as is made out=
 to be?</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<di=

g about this.</div>

indo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of S=
wami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He had =
a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a few years aft=
er his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahams=
a Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishy=

 by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some p=

<div>I found an interesting article based on Sri Auro=
bindo's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.</div>
<div=
><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Near the beginnin=
g of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri A=
urobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In =
his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new sta=
ge in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest righ=
t here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life=
 was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced=
 a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body =
towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Sri Aurobindo was =
joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later =
became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensiv=
e cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainti=
es we face today.<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force =
permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciou=
sness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is call=
ed involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of =
matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reache=
d a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his i=
nner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of wh=
at he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that =
would entirely change everything on Earth.<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Man=EF=BF=BDs g=
reatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes pos=
sible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in m=
ost people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed fro=
m descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great =
divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to co=
ntradict it.</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font><font face=
=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font><br>Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is=
 going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which th=
e human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopel=
essly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as =
the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than =
the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently bee=
n established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now=
 is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.<br>
</div>
<div>Evolution=
 took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the eme=
rgence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even m=
ore momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobi=
ndo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be star=
ting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal hu=
man,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individua=
lized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.<br>=

=EF=BF=BD<br>Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is =
spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding su=
pramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-c=
onsciousness rather than mind-consciousness. </div>

<div><font face=3D"Ari=
al" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=
=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possess=
ion of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun=
 to merge with cellular consciousness. </div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" siz=
e=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is=
 the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within =
the subtle realms of matter. This w
