Hi Vijaya,
One book I read said that we are in a state of grief when some o=
ne has died in the family because of which we are not in a position to conc=
entrate on japa,homa etc, which appears true. As you know japa/homam requir=
es full concentration. There are more chances of making mistakes when you a=
re not concentrating which may make gods angry?


Also regarding =A0Darbha =
please see the scientific explanantion given at=A0
http://www.trsiyengar.co=
m/id65.shtml=A0which I came across last week.




Thanks,Manish

=A0




    
          =
        I was wondering what is the basis to prohibit close relatives of a =
dead person from doing religious activities?



What are scriptures that pr=
escribe it and what are the levels of this (in Telugu we call it maila. Bas=
ically for few days after death of a clsoe relative, one should not perform=
 pujas etc.).



Also, can we do Japam/Homam/ Go to temple etc.



If I tou=
ch a person in maila, should I take bath? Why?



Also, during Grahanam, we=
 are advised not to eat any thing cooked before grahanam unless it was cove=
red with darbhas. Any sceintific explanation for this?



Best regards,

Vi=
jay
