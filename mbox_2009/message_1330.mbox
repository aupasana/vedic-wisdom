Namaskaaram Amit Bhai,

Our own resourceful Mitesh has provided good inform=
ation of Ujjain 
and Shree Maa and other places where Yagyas are performed.=


"Ujjainiya Mahaakaalm..." ! My Parents visited Mahaakaal last year. 
it i=
s also said that, the main attraction of Mahaakaal is to attend 
their earl=
y mroning Bhasma Aarati. and people told me that it is a 
custom to bring t=
he ashes of last cremated body from the nearby 
smashaan for the Bhasma Abh=
iskek. by the way it is well known that 
Amitabh Bachhan has a turn around =
in his career after rirual 
performed at Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing happened=
 and came out from 
debt etc..
Ujjain was once the capital of great king Vi=
kramaaditya. Gujarati 
calander year, which is Vikram Samvat is also named =
after him. so 
gujaraatis have connection to Ujjain:)

I am not sure but is=
 Raja Bhartuhari considered as one of the 
Chiranjivis? and was under the i=
mpression that the name of his 
treaty was Vairaagya Shataka.

but not much=
 important. how much information we'll store in this 
memory and what we wi=
ll do with that.

warm regards,

utpal
