You will be mentally pronouncing the mantra. This is similar to reading a b=
ook with out reading aloud.

This may be difficult in the beginning. Just h=
um the tune while remembering the actual words mentally.

I am recording Om=
 Namo Bhagavate Naarasimhaya in humming as an example. Listen to File > pro=
nunciation > mantram1.wav

After a while, you will be able to cut out the h=
umming sound, but internally you will engage your vocal cord. After some ti=
me, even that can be avoided.

Any japam when done mentally, gives you bett=
er results than when you pronounce aloud.

Best regards,
Vijay
