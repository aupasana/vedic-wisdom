Dear Narsimhaji

This is to request you to kindly differentiate Mind("Mann"=
), Intelligence(" Buddhi") and Concious("Prana"). Is it ok if i am terming =
concious as Prana? or "Concious" and "Prana" both are different.Sometimes p=
articular words cannot be translated properly. Every language has its own d=
istinct feature.. I think "Prana" in Hindi cannot be translated as "Breath"=
 in English. "Prana" and "Breath" both are different.. right? 

I would be =
happy if you could put light to my confusion by giving illustrations of our=
 day to day routine life..say for example.. my mind(man) want to get carrie=
d away with emotions.. moh and maya and vasana of life.. but my intelligenc=
e("buddhi") stops me by telling me that it is not good for spiritual growth=
.. I am sure we all come across such situations in our life where "buddhi" =
dominates "mann" and viceversa.. what should we do in such case? should we =
follow "mann" or should we follow"buddhi".=C2=A0 "Buddhi" will lead us to t=
he correct parth of our life or "mann" ? And in this conflict between "Mann=
" and "Buddhi" what is the role of "Prana"? I am confused..seeking your gui=
dance..

Regards

Rajesh

Honestly speaking, I am embarrassed that =
somebody thinks a 
fool like me can certify or endorse or comment on the "w=
orth" of Vishnu sahasra 
naam, which was taught by Bhishma to Dharmaraja at=
 the onset of Kali yuga to 
help human beings in Kali yuga in=C2=A0followin=

*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Mantras like Vishnu sahasra n=
aam (1000 names of Lord Vishnu), 
Hanuman chalisa, Chandipath, Mahamantra (=
Hare Krishna), Gayatri mantra, Rudram, 
Arunam, Pavamana sooktam, Mrityunja=
ya mantra, panchakshari, ashtakshari, 
dwadasakshari etc are well-establish=
ed and many people achieved spiritual 
progress with them. One cannot quest=
ion their worth.

*=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
However, that is not to sa=
y that everyone meditating with them 
will make fast spiritual progress. To=
 explain this, let me return to a previous 
analogy, as I believe that anal=
ogies help one understand concepts 
better.
=C2=A0
Mantras are for protecti=
ng mind (from its enemies, i.e. one's 
weaknesses like ego, pride, attachme=
nt, lust, anger etc). Imagine one's mind to 
be a person. Imagine one's wea=
knesses to be enemies charging at the person 
aggressively. Imagine mantra =
to be a weapon (stick or stone or gun) in the hands 
of the person.
=C2=A0
=
One may have a nice stick that was used by thousand people 
before him to b=
eat up strong enemies. Yet, he may not know how to use it and the 
weapon m=
ay become ineffective in his hands. If one taps an aggressive enemy 
gently=
 with a stick, that will hardly be effective. One has to beat hard and 
wit=
h all the energy one can muster. Similarly, one's will power should be 
str=
ongly focused on overcoming ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy=C2=A0etc and o=
ne 
should make conscious and forceful effort.
=C2=A0
If one with some expe=
rience in beating up enemies with sticks 
tries to throw stones at them, he=
 may not know how to aim and may fail. 
Similarly, one with experience in c=
hanting other mantras tries beejaksharas, one 
may not succeed in aiming th=
em correctly and making them work.
=C2=A0
If one not knowing how to shoot a=
 gun aims a gun confidently 
as the enemy approaches and tries in vain to s=
hoot, one will fail and be beaten 
by enemy. Similarly, one not knowing how=
 to use powerful Veda mantras is 
overconfident, he may fail in sadhana=C2=
=A0and succumb to ego, pride etc. If one 
atleast realizes that one cannot =
shoot, one can atleast use the gun as a stick 
and try to beat up the enemy=
. Similarly, if one atleast realizes that one does 
not know how to put ved=
a mantra to use, one can chant the veda mantra hundreds 
or thousands of ti=
mes everyday with sincerity, surrender and humility and try 
consciously to=
 control negative emotions such as ego, pride, lust, anger, 
jealosy etc.
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Bottomline is this: Just as how well a perso=
n puts a weapon to 
use and overcomes enemies depends on how strong and ser=
ious the person is, how 
much training and practice he has in using the wea=
pon, similarly how well a 
person puts a mantra to use use to overcome inte=
rnal weaknesses depends on what 
kind of mental conditioning one has, how s=
trong a desire one has for spiritual 
progress, what kind of a guru one has=
 and how much effort one puts into 
spiritual sadhana. Thus, we cannot make=
 a blanket statement that reading Vishnu 
sahasra naam, for example, everyd=
ay will help one become pure and get 
moksha.
=C2=A0
While one engages in v=
arious external practices as a part of 
the spiritual sadhana, one should r=
emember that the internal goal is to overcome 
ego and attain a spirit of c=
omplete surrender and detachment and try to 
cultivate that internal spirit=
. In the beginning, things are difficult and this 
is a mere thought. But, =
as one progresses and crosses a threshhold, external 
practices promote str=
onger internal focus and purity and stronger internal focus 
and purity pro=
mote better and more effective sessions of external 
practice.=C2=A0A kind =
of=C2=A0synergy develops between them. Eventually, one 
makes sufficient pr=
ogress internally, which is the goal after all.
=C2=A0
Whatever mantra or s=
totra or ritual was given to you by a guru 
that you *surrendered* to, you =
should follow it while engaging in internal 
contemplation on an ongoing ba=
sis.
