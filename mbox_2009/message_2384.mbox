THE RAMAYANA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California,
Janu=
ary 31, 1900)

Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses

Rama and Sita are the ide=
als of the Indian nation. All children, especially
girls, worship Sita. The=
 height of a woman's ambition is to be like Sita,
the pure, the devoted, th=
e all-suffering! When you study these characters,
you can at once find out =
how different is the ideal in India from that of
the West. For the race, Si=
ta stands as the ideal of suffering.

The West says, "Do! Show your power b=
y doing." India says, "Show your power
by suffering." The West has solved t=
he problem of how much a man can have:
India has solved the problem of how =
little a man can have. The two extremes,
you see. Sita is typical of India =
=97 the idealised India. The question is not
whether she ever lived, whethe=
r the story is history or not, we know that
the ideal is there. There is no=
 other Paur=E2nika story that has so permeated
the whole nation, so entered=
 into its very life, and has so tingled in every
drop of blood of the race,=
 as this ideal of Sita.

Sita is the name in India for everything that is g=
ood, pure and holy =97
everything that in woman we call womanly. If a pries=
t has to bless a woman
he says, "Be Sita!" If he blesses a child, he says "=
Be Sita!" They are all
children of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the=
 patient, the
all-suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through=
 all this
suffering she experiences, there is not one harsh word against Ra=
ma. She
takes it as her own duty, and performs her own part in it. Think of=
 the
terrible injustice of her being exiled to the forest! But Sita knows n=
o
bitterness. That is, again, the Indian ideal. Says the ancient Buddha, "W=
hen
a man hurts you, and you turn back to hurt him, that would not cure the=

first injury; it would only create in the world one more wickedness." Sita=

was a true Indian by nature; she never returned injury.

Who knows which i=
s the truer ideal? The apparent power and strength, as held
in the West, or=
 the fortitude in suffering, of the East?

The West says, "We minimise evil=
 by conquering it." India says, "We destroy
evil by suffering, until evil i=
s nothing to us, it becomes positive
enjoyment." Well, both are great ideal=
s. Who knows which will survive in the
long run? Who knows which attitude w=
ill really most benefit humanity? Who
knows which will disarm and conquer a=
nimality? Will it be suffering, or
doing?
