 A SANNYASIN dwelt by the side of a temple.There was the house of a harlot
in front. Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute's house,
the sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: "You are a great
sinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot
hereafter."

The poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her misdeeds, and with
genuine inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching forgiveness. But as
prostitution was her profession,she could not easily adopt any other means
of earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh sinned, she always
reproached herself with greater contrition of heart and prayed to God more
and, more for forgiveness.

The sannyasin saw that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon
her, and thought, "Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the
course of her life." And from that day forward, whenever any person entered
the house of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble
aside,and in course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.

One day the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: "Woman,
don't you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission of
the deadly sin you have been indulging in since. I advised you last to
desist from the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil
deeds!" The poor wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation of
her sins, and she prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness,
inwardly repeating, "Lord, wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life
that I am leading?" The prayer was heard, and on that very day the angel of
death passed by her house, and she ceased to exist in this world. By the
strange will of God, the sannyasin also died on the same day.

The messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body
of the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers of
Yama bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether
world. The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud:
"Is this the subtle justice of God? I passed all my life in asceticism and
poverty,and I am carried to hell, while that prostitute,whose life was a
whole record of sin, is going to Heaven!"

Hearing this, the messengers of Vishnu said: "The decrees of God are always
just; as you think, so you reap. You passed your life in external show and
vanity, trying to get honour and fame;and God has given you this. Your heart
never sincerely yearned after Him.

This prostitute earnestly prayed to God day and night, though her body
sinned all the while. Look at the treatment which your body and her body are
receiving from those below. As you never sinned with your body,they have
decorated it with flowers and garlands,and are carrying it with music in a
procession to consign it to the sacred river. But this prostitute's body,
which had sinned is being torn to pieces at this moment by vultures and
jackals.

Nevertheless, she was pure in heart and is therefore going to the regions of
the pure. Your heart was always absorbed in contemplating her sins and thus
became impure. You are therefore going to the regions of the impure. You
were the real prostitute, and not she."
