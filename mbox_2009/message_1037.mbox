Namaste,

At the level of supreme cosmic being, please realize that supreme cosmic 
being (Parama Purusha) contains all beings of this universe. His desires are 
the sum total of the desires of all beings. His actions are the sum total of 
the actions of all beings. His knowledge are the sum total of the knowledge 
of all beings. Thus, anything that is happening through the individual will 
of a single being is also happening with the will of supreme cosmic being. 
The statement "nothing in this world moves without the will of God" is take 
the supreme cosmic being as God.

A demon like Raavana conquering the world happens through his individual 
will and actions, which is part of the will and actions of suppreme cosmic 
being. But this makes gods and rishis unhappy and Lord Vishnu decides to 
kill him. This decision of Vishnu's avatara as Rama and its execution 
happens through the will and actions of Lord Vishnu, which is part of the 
will and actions of supreme cosmic being. This is the karmaphala of 
Raavana's actions, given by Nature through gods, rishis and Vishnu. A demon 
becoming strong and abusing gods and Vishnu killing him are both due to the 
will of supreme cosmic being.

Though every action is indeed due to the will of god, that is a generic and 
1000 ft high view. A better view would be to look at it as the will of a 
specific being, who will get a corresponding karma phala (reaction) in 
future from another being. The action and reaction are all happening due to 
the will of god (supreme cosmic being).

If X murders Y, it is the will of X that is responsible for it. Though it is 
also due to the will of supreme cosmic being, a more useful way to look at 
it is as the will of X.

Of course, will of Y may be responsible for some adharmik actions in the 
past and the reaction given by nature may be his murder (with X being the 
instrument of this reaction). When Y committed those actions in the past, it 
was due to his will and hence also due to the will of supreme cosmic being 
(as Y is part of supreme cosmic being). Then X is used by nature as an 
instrument to murder Y, so that he gets the reaction of his action. This 
happens due to the will of X and also due to the will of god as X is a part 
of supreme cosmic being.

However, if X does this action with self-identification, this becomes a new 
karma for him. He will get its reaction later and nature will use someone 
else (or Y himself) as an instrument. This is an endless cycle until one 
realizes that what is happening to one is a reaction to one's own previous 
actions and does not harbor emotions like hatred, anger, jealosy etc towards 
people and objects used as instruments by nature to bring reactions to one's 
previous actions.

Similarly, when many people who engaged in some bad actions using their free 
will (and hence also god's will) are together, nature may decide to give 
them the reaction to their actions together. A natural or man-made disaster 
(like a tsunami or earthquake or a terrorist attack) may come to all of them 
and give the reaction to their bad actions from the past. This is happening 
as a result of their own actions.

All actions of all beings and the reactions given to them by the nature are 
due to the will of supreme cosmic being. It is very difficult to understand 
supreme cosmic being.

Best regards,
Narasimha
