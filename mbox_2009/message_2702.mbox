How do I determine if I am having enough Sattwa?

Right from my childhood, =
I prefferred to read through nights, and I feel I have less destraction dur=
ing nights. I can focus better at night compared to day time.

When I do ho=
mam during night:
*) No time pressure
*) No distractions
*) With darkness a=
round (I usually switch off lights or do it in the terrace), the only brigh=
t light comes from homam helps me keep focussed on Homam (particularly afte=
r I stopped referring to notes for any mantras)

Only catch I see is after =
poornahuti, while doing japam, I loose the count and do not know if I am co=
ntinuing to do japam or asleep, then suddenly realise my state and continue=
 the japam. But, as long as I am vocal, I am not facing any problem with my=
 focus.

I normally do my homams late (Between 10 pm and 3 am).

I am able =
to judge if I am able to do homam with attention or not. But, how do I judg=
e if I am having any sattwa?

Best regards,
Vijay
