Namaste Manish Bhai,

Just now i referred to one reputed Gujarati Panchanga=
 for details of Grahana.

They have mentioned timings for Grahan Sparsha, G=
rahan Madhya and Grahan Moksha for each Grahan. The duration i.e. from Grah=
an Sparsh to Grahan Moksha seems to be the period during which actual grass=
 of Sun or moon takes place. if Grahan is suppose to be immensely beneficia=
l for spiritual saadhanaas then in my opinion, that is the time to perform =
Japa, meditation, havan etc, however, the whole day may also be very good f=
or these activities.

my 3 cent:)

Regards,

Utpal

has very clearly explained this before in a mail. I could not find the exac=
t mail, but the gist of it is that if you want spiritual growth ONLY, then =
doing any sadhana during an eclipse is good. But if your aim is material, o=
r anything short of pure spirituality, then it maynot be the best option.
