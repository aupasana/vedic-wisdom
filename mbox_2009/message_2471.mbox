Namaskarams Narasimhaji,
I am planning to start doing regular Ganapathi ho=
mam (once in a week)starting this Sunday. I had a few queries . Request you=
 to kindly answer them for me.

1) During some homams performed at my home,=
 I have seen the Vadhyar (priest) ask my mother to light the homam fire dur=
ing the agni invocation. I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when w=
e had a namboothiri perform the homam he would light the homam fire himself=
. 
My question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire or do i=
t myself ?

2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam bee=
jam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to touch the h=
eart , then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the video you ha=
ve shown it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the  beejam , sha=
kthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ? 

3) There ar=
e 4 more avhana mudras for  suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava, varado bhava, s=
arvAbhIshTaprado bhava. The manual does not talks about these mudras. Kindl=
y let me know if these are imporatnt and how to show these mudras.

Thanks =
and regards,
Girish Sundaram
