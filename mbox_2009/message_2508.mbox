fusion.

Sir,=A0 
I have some questions pertaining to Shraddh=
a Tithi.=A0 
1.Generally as per our Hindu Shastras, Tithi is to be counted =
from one sunrise to next sunrise. There remains a big controversy in this d=
ecision. Sometimes it happens that=A0Tithi is changed after few hours from =
sunrise as per Sun Moon distance. I will give one example. My mother expire=
d in 1999 on Ashtami tithi as per calendar. This tithi was upto 5-35 evenin=
g as per real calculation of Sun Moon distance. My mother expired at 23.25 =
hours at night on Ashtami tithi when actually Navami tithi was started from=
 5.35 hours. Which day I should fix for Shraddha and death anniversary ? As=
htami or Navami ? ( I am doing Shraddham on Navami ).
2.Some say that Tithi=
 of actual death moment should be taken for Shraddha day and=A0one openion =
is that Day of funeral ceremony should be taken as Shraddha day. If one exp=
ires on Saptami=A0late evening and if funeral is done on Ashtami morning, A=
shtami should be taken as Shraddha Tithi. But I=A0am not convinced with thi=
s second openion as sometimes funeral is done after so many days, how this =
funeral day is acceptable?=A0
Kindly give some light on these confusions.=
=A0 Regards.
