<div>Dear Laxmi Narayan,</div>

<div><i></i>=A0</div>
<d=
iv>Yes he is a friend of mine.=A0 I can only tell you very little about his=
 spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is marrie=
d, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>Before I=
 tell you anything more=A0about his spiritual life=A0that I know, let me sa=
y=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about tw=
o years back. What first attracted me to=A0 towards him was his impeccable =
honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=A0when it comes to=A0honestly.=A0If someon=
e were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=
=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never=
 jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=A0spoken even a single l=
ie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his tea=
cher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed hi=
s teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive langua=
ge and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bou=
ght himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten =
years every day he spend one
 hour reading the English dictionary and one h=
our reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=A0up volumes of Hindi a=
nd English literature.=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because h=
e wanted to be=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can=
 take a really detached view to judge the truth about=A0which is more compr=
ehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it com=
es to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is ma=
thematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to =
journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes f=
luently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. =
Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. Wh=
en he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for =
a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk w=
ho was
 supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked my friend=
's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote "Hindu". Seein=
g this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right the=
re. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form=
 would have been a lie. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>So this gives a basic i=
dea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls =
him Rama of Kaliyuga.</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>One day, long back, he was =
going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Kris=
hna temple. As he was passing by in=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a stran=
ge urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went i=
nside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next wh=
en he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of =
how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went i=
nto the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time withou=
t any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my frien=
d had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in dee=
p sleep.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Then he started meditating at home, and=
 it was there=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much ab=
out these, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. B=
ut once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat=
, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=A0 Onl=
y his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays=
 when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. Whe=
n someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if=
 the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, t=
he planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the spa=
ce, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurate=
ly desribed.=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=A0Lord Rama to be the=
 ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thi=
nks it
 elevated Sri=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the or=
ginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal <i>man,=A0</i>not a=
 God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emu=
lated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a G=
od cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=
=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, bu=
t I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru=
 at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless =
to say, he is not an atheist any more.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Later he =
had once=A0mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around=
 him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past li=
fe etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums inter=
acting with people, specially=A0with those in=A0the age group of 18 to 30, =
discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to India=
n history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to youn=
g people who will be the future of this country.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div=
>He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.</=
div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I=
 had not asked his permission before mentioning him.</div>
