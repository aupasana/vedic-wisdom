Namaste,

As one does spiritu=
al sadhana, some shakti (can be translated as energy or 
purity) may be acc=
umulated. However, certain egoistic actions make one lose 
some or all of t=
he accumulated shakti.

Long hair and beard trap some shakti and help avoid=
 situations where one 
commits an action that results in a loss of all of o=
ne's shakti. They 
improve the control over senses in tricky situations.

I=
t is like a small railing atop a mountain. If one wanders off at night, 
th=
ose railings can stop one from falling. A small barrier can make a big 
dif=
ference at critical times. Beard and long hair are like that small 
barrier=
.

Of course, a small railing cannot save a car driving at 70 mph from plun=
ging 
down. But it can stop a person wandering at night. Similarly, beard a=
nd long 
hair are not sufficient for control over senses, but one who made =
a lot of 
progress and still struggling at some critical times can benefit =

significantly from long hair and beard.

BTW, the tradition of growing lon=
g hair or beard is not limited to Hinduism.. 
It is there in many religions=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha
