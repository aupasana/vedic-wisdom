ts & girl a lot & her parent.
Aweek has left to get married & you have this=
 feelings on looks subject?
Her nature & how she brings you happiness in yo=
ur life & how she will adjust in your family is main & should effect you no=
t just cosmatic

BUT NOW LET ME TELL YOUR IF REALLY YOU ARE IDIOT & NOT YET=
 FULLY MATURED THAT YOU ARE A PERSON THAT YOU ALREADY ARE THINKING YOU ARE =
NOT GOING MAKE HER HAPPY THEN ITS REALLY BETTER THAT HAVE A SEAT WITH ALL F=
AMILY ELDERLY PEOPLE & BLAME EVERY THING ON YOU & GIVE THEM IN WRITING ITS =
YOUR MISTAKE & THEN STOP THIS MARRIAGE

What does Dharma=
