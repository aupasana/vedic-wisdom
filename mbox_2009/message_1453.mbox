Namaste,

Anybody who told you to stop reading Vishnu sahasranaam because =
it gave 
certain undesirable results has no idea whatsoever. Reading Vishnu=
's 1000 
names can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase good results or d=
ecrease 
bad results, but never increase bad results.

Secondly, the sympto=
ms you are describing sound a lot like some movement of 
praana (life force=
) in some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad thing at 
all. If some ot=
her pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can actually 
help your spirit=
ual progress considerably.

Instead of telling you to stop Vishnu sahasrana=
am, I will suggest increasing 
the number of times you read it. If you spen=
d an hour in the morning and an 
hour in the evening, it will be awesome.

=
In fact, if it is possible, doing a homam every morning with Vishnu 
sahasr=
anaam will accelerate the progress. I will have to soon put together a 
Vis=
hnu sahasra naama homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
