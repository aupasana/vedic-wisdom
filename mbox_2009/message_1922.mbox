Narasimha Garu,

>Like I said, earlier, Rama and Krishna are from the soul =
and mind >principles of the cosmic being. Soul is not bothered about the >d=
uality and maya, but mind is. Rama was not a miracle worker. >Krishna was t=
he master of miracles and had complete control over >duality.

I fully appr=
eciate your explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama was capa=
ble of manipulating realm of Maya (Miracle worker) like Lord Krishna BUT th=
e role assumed by him in that incarnation was of that 'Maryaada Purshottam'=
 and that is why he demonstrated 'Maryaada' in every aspect of life.he abid=
ed himself by the general rules of society. But i do not think that he had =
not Mastered the Duality. where as Krishna didn't bound himself in any boun=
dry whatsoever.

***
Is it fruitful/useful in any ways to extend philosophi=
es like comparing Krishna & Kali, Rama and Tara or Matangi. somehow i don't=
 feel like reading and getting in to exercise of reading and imagine such c=
oncepts. no offense to any body but it is my question to myself. Narasimha =
garu ! why i am not inclined to such things.


apologise if my thinking is =
wrong here.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
