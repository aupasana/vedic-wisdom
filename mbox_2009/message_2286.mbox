Friends,
We saw in posting no.1 as to  what Manu  Smruti says about  Brahmins living  in a land ruled by  Sudras.     The same   smruti   also says that such Brahmanas become degraded by associating with fallen people(patita-samsargaat)   at their place of work.  That Smruti declares, " If a  Brahmana disassociates himself from  lower caste people and associates only with higher caste people, he attains greatness.  If he does the opposite, he becomes a  sudra(Manu4.245).  Knowledgeable people hold the view that many of the professions like  software engineering , technological jobs,a  Govt. servant(raja sevaka),  a teacher working in a school, a doctor etc. etc. --- all of these professions fall under the category of  sudra`s  domain.  They hold that a Brahmin should not take employment from anyone (especially from sudras).  In this regard  the Kurma Purana   says---
"Those Brahmanas who make a living from protecting cows, engage in trade, become artists, take the occupation of servants, and lend money on interest are no better than sudras (......... vipran  sudra-vad acharet)."

"O Brahmanas, one who does not study the  Vedas (anadhitya sruti dvijah)  but carefully endeavours for other pursuits is certainly foolish( sa sammudo) and ostracized from vedic life(veda-bahyo dvijatibhih).  Brahmanas  should not speak to such a person"(na sambhasyo). 

But, Srimad Bhagavatam   speaks of  a permissible  exception  and  mentions the circumstances in which a Brahmana may pursue  another occupation.  Verse 47 of chapter 17 of Canto 11 says that if a Brahmana  can not support himself through his regular duties and is suffering,he  may adopt the occupation of a merchant  and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling material things.  If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kshatriya.  But under no circumstances become like a dog, accepting an ordinary master. Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.35) also states  that this is one of the symptoms of Kaliyuga. It says," Businessmen will engage in petty commerce and earn their money by cheating. Even when there is no emergency, people will consider any degraded occupation quite acceptable.

The Dharma Sastras  declare that if one takes birth in aBrahmana  family but does not cultivate scriptural knowledge, he can not be accepted as a Brahmana.  Visnu Dharma Sastra 93.7 says that religious- minded  people should never give even a drop of water to the hypocritical son of a   Brahmana,  who is ignorant of the Vedas.  Manu Smriti 2.157   says that a brahmana  who does not study the  Vedas  is  similar to a wooden elephant or a deer made of skin, i.e.,  an elephant or deer only in name but does not function effectively as such.  Moreover,  the same   smriti  says that until a  Brahmana  qualifies himself in the  Vedas, he is on the same level as a sudra(2.172 Sudrena hi samah tavad  yavad vede na jayate). In Mahabharata, Santi Parva 189.7  it has been stated that Brahmanas who lead a life of violence, lies and greed, who are impure and indulge in all kinds of  karmic  activity in order to maintain their lives(sarvakarmopajivinah) are degraded to
 the status of sudras(dvija sudratam gatah).  Such a person , who eats anything and everything without discrimination, who is attached to worldly things, who will accept any occupation just to make money(sarvo karma karo asuchih), who has given up Vedic  Dharma (tyakta vedastvanarchah)  and proper behaviour is called  a  sudra (sa vai sudra iti smrutah).  Let each one of our community weigh our  respective merit and  conclude as to where we are as Brahmins.
(to be continued)
