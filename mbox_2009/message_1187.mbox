Dear M. S.

Namaste

You are indicating of two different things here,

Abou=
t you feeling sleepy while concentrating, this is not abnormal, 
There are =
two ways to look at it: 

One as mind concentrates it feels rested and tran=
qalised so I donot 
think it is a bad thing. I have felt similarly when rea=
ding some 
spiritual books, a couple of books that I always try to read I f=
all 
sleepy and it is a good type of feeling.

The second type is due to in=
crease in tamasic qualities at the time 
of trying to concentrate and as re=
sult one looses interest and does 
not want to concentrate. This does not g=
ive good feeling, to overcome 
this, one should try to avoid tamasic foods =
for an extended period of 
time and eat more satvick food, along the satvic=
k lines lead a life.

Children or all should sleep well before exam, there =
is nothing wrong 
in that. why do you see that as a problem?

Hope this giv=
es a different perspective ....

Best Regards
Mitesh
