Namaste,
 
Orthodox tradition is rooted in meaningful principles that got o=
verstretched in time.
 
Several ethereal beings are sensitive to smell and =
many of them do not like the smell of menstrual blood and also the aura of =
normal women in periods (if it is a spiritually elevated woman, it is diffe=
rent). Though most higher deities do not care about this, their attendants =
may be sensitive. When you do a sadhana, an attendant of a deity may visit =
at first. One can try to make the visitors comfortable.
 
However, there ma=
y be so many other offensive things where we do sadhana these days and putt=
ing too much stress on one little thing is somewhat unbalanced. You can try=
 to follow tradition if that is possible. Otherwise, don't worry.
 
Regardi=
ng cooking food, the food we eat now-a-days is so badly corrupted in variou=
s ways that being cooked by a lady with periods is a very small thing in co=
mparison. Coming into the pooja room is also not a big deal in my view.
 
H=
owever, when you do homam, I suggest not using food cooked by such a lady i=
f possible. Also I suggest that ladies with periods should not come too clo=
se to the fire. These are precautionary suggestions only.
 
Chandipath is f=
ine. The Mother does not care much about external things.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

                Dear Sir,
                At my home we are not ma=
intaining the 3 days M.C time period. All my daughters in law when in Time =
are making tea, cooking the food and I am eating. They are also coming to P=
uja Room and may touch me  while my Puja. Sir, is it OK? The "Belief" that =
they should not be allowed in Puja Room or cook food is correct? Is there a=
ny harm in doing ChandiPath during these days ?
