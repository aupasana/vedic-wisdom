Dear All, 

At the end of Sandhya Vandanam, we do Achamanam again. I thought that Achamanam is required BEFORE performing a spiritual activity, which we do anyway. But what is the significance of doing it AFTER it? Similarly, if you remember the end of the holy Aditya Hrudhayam stotram, there's the verse "thriraachamya suchirbhootvaa dhanuraadhaaya veeryavaan" which comes after the verse which mentions Bhagavan Sri Rama chanting the stotram. Is it that the ensuing battle itself is considered a spiritual activity needing purification before one starts it? When I try relate it to the popular custom of "not washing one's hands and feets" upon arrival back home, after visiting a temple, I get confused. 

Regards, 
Hari
