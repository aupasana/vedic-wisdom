Namaste,

Take a sankalpa to do Vighneshwara pooja. Invoke Vighneshwara in an idol 
made with turmeric paste. Do a shodasopachaara pooja to Vighneshwara. Then 
take a sankalpa to do the main homam (e.g. Mahaganapathi homam). Call back 
Vighneshwara. Invoke Varuna in kalasha with "imam me" and "tattvaayaami" 
mantras (veda mantras). Do shodasopachaara pooja to Varuna. Then read 
Punyaahavaachanam (Pavamaana sooktam). Call back Varuna and sprinkle a bit 
of kalasha water all around.

Then start the fire. There are few additional procedures including the 
invocation of Brahma and Varuna in small water bowls with darbhas on then 
and quick pooja to them with akshatas. After the poorvaangam, call 
Mahaganapathi into fire and do shodasopachaara pooja. Then do the mantras 
you want. Do a shodasopachaara pooja again at the end. Do uttaraangam with 
avijnaataadi praayaschitta mantras etc just as in the short procedure. But 
one can optionally do Jayaadi homam also in the uttaraangam. It is a bunch 
of aahutis for various celestial beings with veda mantras. The rest is 
similar to the short procedure.

I have done big ones as well, including 7-hour Mahaganapathi homam and 
9-hour Chandi homam. But I have no doubt that a short homam repeated 
everyday is more effective than a long homam done once in a while.

*        *        *

I once saw some priests performing a Mahaganapathi homam and Navagraha 
homam. The priest declared, "all the bad karmas of whoever is present here 
are burned today and all of you will start on a clean slate now." Though 
they did a detailed ritual, the actual mantras of Ganesha and planets were 
done to the minimum. For example, they offered the mantra of each planet 
just 4 times! For such a small count of mantras to actually burn all the 
karmas of 100 people, the performer has to be a rishi or something! I was 
amused by the declaration.

Obviously, they were under time pressure and made a wrong tradeoff.

The point I wanted to make is this. If you are able to do the main thing in 
a ritual for 2 hours, then it is reasonable to have 30 minutes of overhead. 
If you have only 40 minutes, it is a bad idea to spend 30 minutes on the 
overhead and wrap up the main thing in 10 minutes. It is better to do the 
overhead in 10 min and do the main part for 30 min. It is better that way.

Sometimes, I see learned priests making the wrong tradeoffs when pressed for 
time. In this age, most people are pressed for time. They need help to make 
the correct tradeoffs so that they maximize the impact of the little they 
get to do.

Best regards,
Narasimha
