Dear Siva,

I strongly wish that this message of Narasimha should reach Sri=

se are the noteworthy points mentioned by him. even i was not convinced wit=
h what you have written in defence of Sri Sri.

Please, if you can, get the=
 response from Sri Sri Ravishankar.

Best Regards,

at Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadh=

 the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get necessar=
y guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in person a=
nd several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner=
 connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL=
 courses, Sri Sri's elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledg=
e are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner =
communion with Guru can be established.
