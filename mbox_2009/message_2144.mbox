Namaste...

I dont believe this is a negat=
ive comment on all women.  But in the context of the relationship of a man =
with the 'evil-omened wolves'. It may be true however that some women or pe=
rhaps all women have the capacity to devour a man on various levels, mainly=
 on the emotonal level.  Lets face it, women are actually superior in stren=
gth to men in this way.  Now virtues are some thing different and this vari=
es with each individual both man and woman.

Regarding friendship between m=
en and women, is it not many times like playing with fire and expecting not=
 to get burned? This seems to the situation with these friendships that may=
 be little more than disguised romances or something of that sort.  If the =
text were a woman speaking it may be one woman consoling the other by sayin=
g "oh you know men are all dogs". Now this is not true of all men.  Yet all=
 men have the capacity to exibit doglike tendencies.

This is is my humble =
opinion

Ajaya
