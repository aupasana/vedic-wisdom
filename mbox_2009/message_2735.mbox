Dear Narasimha and Sundeep,

   Thanks for your feedback. =
I thought, I had written a quite clear and explicit mail, but your reply ha=
s proved that it needs to be put down in at least 10-fold simpler words.

 =
  You read my mail, but picked up notions in an incorrect, incoherent manne=
r, and are reading beyond what is written in my mail.

   To prove my point=
, I would ask Sundeep to read my previous mail on "Gyan Marg" followed by y=
our reply and see if he also picks up the notions in the same manner as you=
 did ?

   The only addition required is an example:

Your hypothesis
   Ah=
amkara is the only I-ness there is for all the beings in all the 3 cosmoses=
 i.e. all the Physical, Astral and Causal-bodied beings.

Proof by Contradi=
ction
   A person who lives as a farmer, should, after death, remain a farm=
er in the astral cosmos, and after subsequent astral death, should be rebor=
n as the same farmer with the same name and same identity as in his previou=
s earthly incarnation.
   This is not the case, people don't even remember =
what they were in previous birth, and start their life afresh in a new eart=
hly body
    =3D> Contradiction 
    =3D> the original hypothesis is wrong =

    =3D> Ahamkara is not the only sense of I-ness applicable to all beings=
 in all the 3 cosmoses.

Inference #1:
    =3D> Ahamkara is dominant sense =
of I-ness in Physical Cosmos.
    =3D> Manas    is dominant sense of I-ness=
 in Astral Cosmos.
    =3D> Chitta   is dominant sense of I-ness in Causal =
Cosmos.

Corollary #1:
   A Devata as an Astral-being has I-ness due to his=
 Manas, and doesn't have Ahamkara for the work done by him in all the vario=
us physical bodies.

    Inference #1 and Corollary #1 is what I had writte=
n in my previous mail on this topic.

    There are many other ways to prov=
e the contradiction on this hypothesis (e.g. Powers of beings in physical c=
osmos < those in astral cosmos < those in causal cosmos).

    Your made tw=
o additional points that are also invalid. My comments on that is:

1.  I-n=
ess derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control a=
ny other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.
   Reason:
   Soul is the only Truth =
and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, =
all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. 
=

2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sen=
se-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys' sense of I-ness derive=
d from Manas, that coordinates the senses.
   He has no Buddhi or discrimin=
ating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what =
to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to it=
s own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.

   I hope this clarifies.

Regar=
ds,
Nitish

 Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal =
cosmoses, it doesn't apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-b=
odied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activ=
ities. Thus, what is "the very basis" of the entire individualized consciou=

 astral/causal bodied being.

   Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, h=
ear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of=
 egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn't create Ast=
ral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everyth=

re mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness)=
 is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal=
 body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bo=
