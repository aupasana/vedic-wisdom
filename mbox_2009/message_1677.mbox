Namaste

Just a curious thought.

We in Hinduism have a certain set of deit=
ies. In history we see that every ancient culture had their own set of deit=
ies and rituals etc etc.

If deities are not universal and rather culture s=
pecific, are they a creation of the people? But if they are a creation of t=
he people, how do they have such universal abilities/powers and also their =
avatarts. We have in Sanatana Dharma many instances of amsa avatars of vari=
ous deities taking birth.

What happens to the deities of a certain culture=
, once the culture has died and there is no one to worship that deity? And =
why did not the ancient deities of different cultures protect those culture=
s from anihilation?

Any thoughts on this would be interesting.
