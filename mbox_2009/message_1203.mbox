Namaste Mitesh,

I am sure you are not blaming Narasimha but your way of ex=
pression 
clearly shows that you are not familiar with his writings. I had =
the 
good fortune of observing him and his writings for over a decade now 
=
and I have seen no other person who is as crystal clear in his 
writings an=
d who is as mindful of his responsibilities and who is as 
etiquette as Nar=
asimha is. He almost never answers unless he feels 
that what he is going t=
o write is useful not only to the person who 
has asked the query but to ma=
ny more. All his posts are very 
thorough, informative and I for one believ=
e that not only the people 
in this group but also others who will have the=
 good fortune of 
seeing his posting in the future will benefit immensely f=
rom these 
postings on the net. When I look at the development and 
transfo=
rmation that he has gone through in this period, it amazes me 
to no end. I=
nitially he was (of course still is) a scholar of Vedic 
astrology and late=
r is developing in to a spiritual giant. In all 
these years, he has unself=
ishly contributed to whatever he takes up 
and made it a point to spread th=
e knowledge all around for the 
benefit of the humanity in general. 

I kno=
w Narasimha will not appreciate this mail as it contains no 
valuable infor=
mation for the seekers and it might sound as though I 
am praising him. My =
intention is not that, for I believe he has risen 
above accolade. 

You ca=
n certainly make requests or even oppose/question his writings 
and can ext=
end other opinions that you may have, in a way that will 
not offend the me=
mbers of the group. Particularly the paragraph "We 
eat=85" is not at all i=
n good taste, although Utpal has taken them as 
hilarious comments, which s=
hows his magnanimity. It clearly shows 
your lack of understanding of the c=
ontext and level of Narasimha's 
spiritual attainments.

I have never writt=
en in support of anyone so far nor do I have the 
habit of participating in=
 the discussions on the various groups. I 
have been a silent member, as ma=
ny are, reading the wonderful 
writings of people like Narasimha and trying=
 to learn from them.

I hope I have not offended you with my comments, I ju=
st felt like 
butting in! I know Narasimha does not need support of anyone,=
 much 
less from me:-)

Regards,
RJ
