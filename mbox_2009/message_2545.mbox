Namaste,

Such dilly-dallying and doubts will remain for a while. Nature puts some 
serious impediments to doing serious sadhana and realizing Self. Otherwise, 
everyone will realize Self very quickly. So, even one on the right path will 
occasionally start to wonder.

Even Vivekananda and other disciples of Ramakrishna had doubts at various 
stages of their spiritual evolution. Especially after Ramakrishna left, 
several of them wanted to go back to their houses and lead "regular lives". 
Some force kept them together. It was worthwhile at the end, because all of 
them realized god. Actually, that is not the important thing - they were all 
elevated beings who had realized god before and bound to realize god again 
that time too. What is more important is that each of them helped so many 
other people in making progress towards realization! *That* was why that 
whole group came to earth after all.

If such elevated beings had doubts about so many things (is the guru 
genuine, am I on the right path, can I succeed, is it worthwhile etc), what 
about ordinary people like us?

So, expect the doubts to return now and then and put in your best conscious 
effort to overcome them!

Good luck,
Narasimha
