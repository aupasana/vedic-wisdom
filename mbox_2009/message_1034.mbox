Namaste,

Yes, running after wealth, fame and women (or men if you are a woman) is not 
a good thing and blocks one's progress.

However, one's internal spirit and attitude cannot be always judged 
correctly based on external indications. Having abundant wealth does not 
mean that one is running after wealth (though most wealthy persons are 
addicted to wealth). A famous man may not be addicted to fame (though many 
are). A man with ten wives may not be addicted to sex (thought many are).

Renunciation that frees one is at the mental level and not necessarily at 
the physical level. Physical renunciation of things promotes mental 
renunciation, but does not guarantee it. On the other hand, mental 
renunciation is possible without physical renunciation. One may renounce the 
material world and live under a tree in a forest alone for the entire life 
and yet not overcome the instinctual attraction to money, fame and sex. 
Another person may live in the middle of wealth, fame and glamor, yet remain 
detached from all of it it and surrender at the feet of god despite being 
very active in many ways. It is all in the mind.

One needs to interact with the world and world objects in order to pay back 
one's rinas. The karmas taken on by Swami Vivekananda when he voluntarily 
chose to come back to earth required him to become famous and spread the 
message of sanatana dharma to varrious corners of the world. He *had* to 
become famous for fulfilling his dharma. It does not mean he craved for 
fame. He did not. In fact, his guru moulded him and released him into the 
world only after he was strong and detached enough to be unaffected by fame.

Similarly, a king like Dasaratha (or a queen like Draupadi!) may marry 
several people in order to pay back the rinas that had to be paid back in 
that life.

Remember one fundamental point: We exist on earth in order to fulfil our 
dharma. We must do it without incurring new karmas and becoming attached. So 
what we do should be based on our personal dharma (as decided by our 
instincts, intelligence and gurus). But what is important is *how* we do it. 
*That* is what decides the new karmas incurred for future. If we can do 
whatever we do with a spirit of detachment and with a sense of surrender to 
the Lord, we minimize our chances of incurring new troublesome karmas.

Best regards,
Narasimha
