Namaste,

I asked few of my friends here locally in USA and they are aware =
of separate slokas/ mantras only either for Shiva or Parvati and not togeth=
er. 

I would be thankful if any one can advise me any sloka or mantra or b=
eeja japa for Parvati Parameswaran. I do not know Sanskrit or Hindi and I w=
ould be thankful if the sloka or mantra is in Tamil script. 

Thanks and Re=
gards,
