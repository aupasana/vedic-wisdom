Namaste,

Some people hold the view that one with a living father cannot do it and 
one's father must do it instead. The other view is that anybody can do it.

I subscribe to the later view.

If one's grandfather had some unfilfilled desires and one's father is alive, 
of course, one's father can offer tarpana. However, grandson can also do it. 
Depending on the karmic debts, the unfilled desires may have more effect on 
the grandson than son and hence tarpana offered by grandson may work better 
than tarpana offered by son. Thus, the idea that father has the exclusive 
"right" to tarpana and his son will get that right only after he passes away 
is illogical.

If a father is a rich man with a lot of money, son may not need to work. 
However, if father is not that rich, son should better work. Especially if 
father is not capable of getting a good job and son is capable of getting a 
good job, son should definitely find a job and work. Saying that only father 
should work as long as he is alive and son should stay home is wrong. Same 
with tarpana.

Best regards,
Narasimha
