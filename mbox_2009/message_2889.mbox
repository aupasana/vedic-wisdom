 People's characters can be divided into three classes,--Tamas, Rajas and
Sattwa.

Those who belong to the first class are egotistic; they sleep too much, eat
too much, and passion and anger prevail in them.

Those who belong to the second class are too much attached to work. They
love nice, well-fitting clothes and are very neat; they care for a
luxurious, richly furnished house; when they sit and worship God, they love
to wear costly garments; when they give anything to charity they parade it.

Those who belong to the third class are very quiet, peaceful,
unostentatious; they are not particular about their dress, they lead a
simple life and earn a modest living, because their needs are small; they do
not flatter for selfish ends; their dwelling is modest; they do not worry
about their children's dress; they are not anxious for fame, nor do they
care for the admiration or adulation of others; they worship God, give
charity and meditate silently and in secret.

This Sattwa quality is the last step of the ladder which leads to the roof
of Divinity. A person reaching this state does not have to wait long for
God-consciousness. [p. 340]
