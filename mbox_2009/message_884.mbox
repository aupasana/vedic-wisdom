namaste narasimhaji,

thankyou. your words are always very inspiring.

yes,=
 u are right that what u had recorded was just the humming of ups
and downs=
 of the mantra to show the intonation. it stuck in my memory
because it was=
 very different from the mantra i have heard recorded by
various people. 

=
there may not be any perfect rendering of the mantra in the present
times..=
.but still one longs for something closer to the real
thing...whatever that=
 may be. 

so the search continues....

personally, i am in favour of livin=
g thru my karmas with consciousness
rather than appeasing anything/anyone. =
the grace of consciousness of
savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking=
, isn't it? 

however, having a very very rudimentary "knowledge" of astrol=
ogy i
sometimes indulge my imagination in thinking that with a retro mars,
=
saturn and mercury my karmas must be rather "jatil". 

you mentioned about =
lord subramanya. carrying the imagination a lttle
 further, i find an echo =
of lord subramnaya in the krittika nakshatra
which is the lagna nakshatra. =
there is also (imaginatively speaking)
perhaps some connection to have jupi=
ter, sun and mars on the adra -
mool (rahu-ketu) axis or guru-soul-karma ax=
is?

Personally, i dont have any god i can visualise while meditating
thoug=
h i feel an affinity to shiva sometimes. yesterday while doing
the gayatri =
mantra i tried to visualise gayatri and for some reason
that made me think =
about love and mother.... and that made me cry.

sorry, i may be getting ca=
rried away...so i will stop here.

many thanks once again!

love and best w=
ishes...
