Vinitaji,

1. Good that you have started. But, don't limit yourself to shor=
t version for ever. You do not have to follow short/medium/long version as =
if. You can take bits and pieces and do the homam your way. I have taken fe=
w from longer version, but, predominantly do the medium version. Starting w=
ith shorter version is good as you will easily get used to it. After a whil=
e, do look out side the shorter version and adapt your self.

2. I have a s=
lightly different opinion. As Narasimha earlier mentioned, sticking to a ma=
ntra is better how ever, if you are drawn naturally to a specific mantra, I=
 would advise against opposing it. Don't analyse much as to why you are dra=
wn to a mantra on a specific mantra. The most important thing is concentrat=
ion and devotion. By opposing some thing naturally coming you will more lik=
ely get distracted.

During my homam, I do manny mantras, how ever, I repea=
t one mantram several times.

1) OM SrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM gaNapatayE var=

trying special mantras one seem to not get any help over prarabdha karma. I=

Again this applies towards progress in spirituality and not for mantras for=
 worldly expectations. That is a different thing altogether, for instance s=
omeone wants a child or someone wants to get married or overcome some chall=
enges, there are mantras for it and one should consult experts on mantra sh=
astra, and many times the karmas do play their role and to the extent possi=
ble it is better to let it play and be done with it and move forward.

y has been aroused about the different "quality" of mantras. The above mant=
ra is supposed to be a "moola" mantra and also a "bija" mantra for ganapati=
. Can you explain the significance of this?As a remover of obstacles which =
other mantra would you suggest for ganapati? i am drawn to "aum vakratunday=

one main mantra only? Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneously =
towards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it mentally. Shoul=

ra at least for a month?
