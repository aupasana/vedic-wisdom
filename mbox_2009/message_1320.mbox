Dear Utpalji, please give me your mobile number just to listen to different=
 intonations of Swahaa from you. I hope you are aware of this. This is real=
ly interesting.

Namaste Rajarshi,

Ooops! sorry for the=
 misleading information. i went thro' the manual 
again. 

In the manual Na=
rasimha has suggested following: 

[After kavacham, argala and keelakam, re=
ad "Ratri sooktam" without 
offering anything in the fire. Do not even add =
"swaahaa" at the
end of each verse.]

[
Then "Devi sooktam" may be read wit=
hout offering anything in the 
fire. Do not even add "swaahaa" at the end o=
f each verse
]

The Reason for above is mentioned in the following foot not=
e.

[
Adding "swaahaa" in veda mantras may require changing the swaram 
(in=
tonation) of the last few syllables of the mantra. Most
people are unfamili=
ar with the relevant rules. Even some good 
priests end up reading the vers=
e with the original swaram and simply
add "swaahaa". This is not correct. I=
t is instead better to not 
add "swaahaa" and to read it as is and not make=
 an offering.
]

Warm Regards,
utpal
