Namaste,
 
Nakshatra or tithi is not the issue. Whichever you take, the iss=
ue is whether you should fix the nakshatra or tithi for the entire day base=
d on sunrise. Suppose nakshatra is Punarvasu at sunrise and changes to Push=
yami 5 min after sunrise. Suppose someone is born or dead at 10 pm. We shou=
ld take the star to be Pushyami, but many take it as Punarvasu. Same thing =
with tihti.
 
As most rituals are done at sunrise, this rule may have been =
injected into shastras. For laymen, having a calendar with a nakshatra, tit=
hi and yoga fixed for an entire day is conveniennt, instead of remembering =
the times within the day when tithi, nakshatra etc change.
 
If Ashtami was=
 over before death, your mother's death tithi should be taken as Navami. De=
ath anniversary every year/month is when Navami returns. it will be ideal i=
f you can perform annual/monthly after-death rituals around the same point =
within tithi. suppose death occurred when Navami was 15% over and 85% left.=
 Then take the time every year/month when Navami is again 15% over and 85% =
left. If not, make sure that the tithi running at the time of the ritual (a=
nd not at sunrise of the day of ritual) is the same as the tithi running wh=
en death occurred (and not at the sunrise of the day of death).
 
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha

        In fact my father also expired and=

the nakashtra in which he passed away and do the karma with your heart and =

          Si=
r,  

          I have some questions pertaining to Shraddha Tithi.  

    =
      1.Generally as per our Hindu Shastras, Tithi is to be counted from on=
e sunrise to next sunrise. There remains a big controversy in this decision=
. Sometimes it happens that Tithi is changed after few hours from sunrise a=
s per Sun Moon distance. I will give one example. My mother expired in 1999=
 on Ashtami tithi as per calendar. This tithi was upto 5-35 evening as per =
real calculation of Sun Moon distance. My mother expired at 23.25 hours at =
night on Ashtami tithi when actually Navami tithi was started from 5.35 hou=
rs. Which day I should fix for Shraddha and death anniversary ? Ashtami or =
Navami ? ( I am doing Shraddham on Navami ).

          2.Some say that Tit=
hi of actual death moment should be taken for Shraddha day and one openion =
is that Day of funeral ceremony should be taken as Shraddha day. If one exp=
ires on Saptami late evening and if funeral is done on Ashtami morning, Ash=
tami should be taken as Shraddha Tithi. But I am not convinced with this se=
cond openion as sometimes funeral is done after so many days, how this fune=
ral day is acceptable? 

          Kindly give some light on these confusio=
ns.  Regards.

          Ashwin Rawal
