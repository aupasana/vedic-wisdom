Namaste Vijay,

>Indra gifts him a mala which when he wears, >will give him=
 victory >in a dual.

I am not aware of this but i remeber that Vali had an=
 extraordinary boon that he'll get half the strength of the opponent in dua=
l and that is the reason, Rama could not fight him in a Dual.

about Ravan =
story, you are right. he was humbled by vali when the later kept former und=
er his arm pit like a child playing with a toy. it was not even a fight. Th=
e great ravana was thus humbled by Sahastraarjun also.

warm regards,

utpa=
l

 we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against Dharma towards his br=
other. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on himself in the lat=
