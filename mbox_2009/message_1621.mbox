Dear Sri PVR Narasimha:

I have a naive question for you.

Recently I came =
across a story narrated by Ramana Maharishi
that perturbed me.

A disciple =
asked the Maharishi whether mantras could be
chanted without initiation. Th=
e Maharishi replied that no
it shouldn't be and the same will not work.

He=
 then narrated a story which I paraphrase: 
A king asked a similar question=
 of his minister and asked for
an explanation. The minister without answeri=
ng the question
asks the king's guard to arrest the king. The guard of cour=
se
doesn't budge, in spite of repeated requests from the minister.
The king=
 gets angry at the minister's insolence and asks the 
guard to arrest the m=
inister, which the guard promptly does.
The minister laughs and tells the k=
ing: See, this is the answer
to your question, it is a matter of authority.=
 The same command
was uttered by the two of us, but only one of us had the =
authority
to make it work.

On the other hand, we can assume that someone o=
r some saint
is our guru and we with full faith use this mantra as if recei=
ved
from him. But then the story of Ekalavya, who did exactly this
comes to=
 mind.

Can you please give your insight on this topic?
Which mantras do we=
 need initiation in?
Are these all the veda mantras used in homams?
What ab=
out the mantras used in the pradhana homam?
For example if one is chanting =
Sri Suktam, do we need to be
initiated in this?

Regards.
