Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs. Non-Veg (Fr=
om a non-vegetarian's point of view)

   
Dear Rajarshi,
Do not think that =
I'll be offended or misunderstand you to be a cruel hearted etc...
In this =
message, i am giving only what i feel right as per me and how i think about=
 the whole issue myself.  so pl. take that in consideration.
But to say tha=
t it is  immoral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetar=
ian food, is illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.
In my previous message, =
i've clarified some points.  i put it again below:
Please do not consider m=
y point for Veg/Nonveg with perspective of
Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Sa=
atwik/Taamsik etc... My only point in
Vegterianism is related to Compession=
 against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)
against Adharama (Killing Innocent =
creatures).
***
Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat to=
tally vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like hav=
ans, or else it conflicts with your system badly.
In my opinion, Saadhana o=
r No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing f=
or filling stomach is if Not right then for me it'll remain *Not right in a=
ll conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to challan=
ging conditions and start eating meat but even then it'll not justify and m=
ake it proper thing.
***
Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don't get offended b=
y my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.
 your second Para an=
d some writings in your earlier message gives me impression that you are he=
avily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be ve=
ry honest. 
In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken=
, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those peo=
ple who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alrig=
ht. even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and=
 not doing anything wrong as per the 'their' thinking.
To talk about Karma,=
 Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the lo=
gic of 'Direct killing' and 'eating meat of already dead' does not go well =
with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.
Poeple born in Those cultures=
 have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an examp=
le of one such person and there are few more i know. howvever they are very=
 very very rare.
***
The above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-veg=
etarian people who provide such arguements,  but these arguments are nonsen=
sical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of arguments.
 I agree complete=
ly. it is childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it whe=
n such people talk such nonsense.
***
Lastly, i'll add a philospohical thou=
ght. If so much of killing every hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose =
of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the prime mover is Human society, th=
en how we hope to have a peacefull world without blood shed and massacare. =
unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect) will find many ways to give it back=
 to (in)Human societies.

 One cannot avoid it however much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are he=

      <p></p><p>Dear Rajar=
shi,</p>
<p>Do not think that I'll be offended or misunderstand you to be a=
 cruel hearted etc...</p>
<p>In this message, i am giving only what i feel =
right as per me and how i think about the whole issue myself. &nb=
sp;so pl. take that in consideration.</p>
<p><strong>But to say that it is&=
nbsp; immoral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetarian=
 food, is illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.</strong><br>In my previous =
message, i've clarified some points.  i put it again below:</p>
<=
p>Please do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspective of<br>Spi=
ritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point in<br>Vegte=
rianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)<br>=
against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>An=
yway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vegetar=
ian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or =
else it conflicts with your system badly.</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, Sa=
adhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. k=
illing for filling stomach is if Not right then for me it'll remain *N=
ot right in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succu=
mb to challanging conditions and start eating meat but even then it'll not =
justify and make it proper thing.</p>
<p>***<br>Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope y=
ou don't get offended by my message. i apologise in advance for my blu=
ntness.</p>
<p> your second Para and some writings in your earlier mes=
sage gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/=
kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. </p>
<p>In my opino=
n, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. =
then anything under the Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those people=
 who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright.=
 even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and no=
t doing anything wrong as per the 'their' thinking.</p>
<p>To talk about Ka=
rma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality j=
udgements by the logic of 'Direct killing' and 'eating meat of already dead=
' does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.<=
/p>
<p>Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they ha=
te killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and there are few=
 more i know. howvever they are very very very rare.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><str=
ong>The above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people wh=
o provide such arguements,  but these arguments are nonsensical a=
nd childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of arguments.</strong></p>
<p> I =
agree completely. it is childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i al=
so take it when such people talk such nonsense.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lastly, i=
'll add a philospohical thought. If so much of killing every hourly ba=
sis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the=
 prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have a peacefull world w=
ithout blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect=
) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.</p>=

 =C3=82 <br>> I personally c=
an not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic s=
ite. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throa=
t of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly b=
utchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that=
 they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out o=
f water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don't have proper E=
nglish word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the=
 dead fish thus is so tasty.<br>> =C3=82 <br>> =C3=82 <br>&=
gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share=
 them. Call me cruel hearted. <br>> =C3=82 <br>> When the questi=
on of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is =
moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may=
 not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to
 judge everyone.=C3=82&nbs=
p; <br>> =C3=82 <br>> Some of my non-vegetarian friends were wat=
ching discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts of the =
world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, "Why?". If yo=
u can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an =
insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in =
a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustome=
d to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to b=
e born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the sli=
ghtest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own c=
onditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we=
 think our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and =
therefore we wonder why don't others share similar ideas. That is incorrect=
. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is.
 Everything is desh-k=
aal-patra. A person who is a<br>> vegetarian in this life, if he gets bo=
rn in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non=
-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I=
 know=C3=82 people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doct=
ors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity =
can be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=
=82 a universal logic applicable to all.<br>> =C3=82 <br>> =
A far better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if som=
eone can make sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a li=
ve animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma gener=
ated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82&nb=
sp;does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-veget=
arian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is quite
 acceptb=
le IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you w=
ould get for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through t=
he hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else=
. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavo=
idable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. T=
hey are designed to be eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot=
 like dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming that? God know=
s.<br>> =C3=82 <br>> An average non-vegetarian, at least in Indi=
a, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 =
percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific poi=
nt of view, this is a good combination. People who feed on more than 60 per=
cent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues a=
t a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologically
 good.<br>>=
 =C3=82 <br>> =C3=82 <br>> =C3=82 If we don't eat fish=
 then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg f=
