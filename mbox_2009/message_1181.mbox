Dear Sir,
At my home we are not maintaining the 3 days M.C time period. All=
 my daughters in law when in Time are making tea, cooking the food and I am=
 eating. They are also coming to Puja Room and may touch me=A0 while my Puj=
a. Sir, is it OK?=A0The=A0"Belief" that they should not be allowed in Puja =
Room or cook food is correct? Is there any harm in doing ChandiPath during =
these days ? 
Dr. Rawal
