Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,

Assuming perfect astrological predictions, one's life should be read
from the chart almost like a biography with no elaborate details in it.
If this is correct and the backdrop is set for a person, how
does spirituality
effect one's life?

Here is a line of thought based on this mail:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2733

A person's birth time is based on that person's chitta baggage.
Astrology gives hints on person's chitta to tell the person's tendencies
to react in certain conditions also a path with a set of life events like
birth, graduation, marriage, children, happy and sad occassions etc..
As every step towards next event life is a natural result of decisions
made during previous steps, the decisions to chose a path are heavily
influenced by chitta.

Ahamkaara makes decisions. Spirituality pushes chitta away from
influencing logical unit ahamkaara so that ahamkaara can make
decision according to swadharma (one's dharma). This results in
decreasing chitta baggage and increasing spiritual knowledge for future.
Eventually spirituality only influences ahamkaara, the actions are oriented
towards self-realization as next major event.

Using this reasoning, one can say the following:

a) with zero spirituality, one's life should comply 100% with astrological
predictions (from a pure person)

b) with 100% spirituality, the person only touches the predicted events
for the sake of clearing chitta baggage

Help me understand this better.

-Kishore
