Is there any manthras in MP3 format for vallaikappu / Seemantham.  I also
heard that vallaikappu and seemantham is two different functions...can
anybody highlight me abt these two functions and what are the rituals need
to be done.


The moment a child is born, the mother is also born.  She never existed
before.  The woman existed, but the mother, never.  A mother is something
absolutely new.
