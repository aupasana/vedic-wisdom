Its Kaliyug. I dont think that India will be a Hindu Rashtra in any one of
=
us's lifetime.

Hindu religious studies have taken more advance stages and =
results in
foreignland. Nothing wrong in it, after all the origin is "Sanat=
an Dharm"
for whole mankind. Only as of now we are not able to sow its seed=
s in its
birthland.

Dear Members<br>
<br>
I was hearing of a famous sentence attributed to Swam=
i Ramdas who had <br>
told Shivaji "hindavi swarajya whave...hi shrren=
chi ichcha"..<br>
<br>
Which means, to have a Hindu Rastra is God'=
s desire. Is it really <br>
God's desire? Will such a thing ever happen=
?<br>
<br>
Inspite of having so many spiritual super giants born in this la=
nd, <br>
hinduism and Sanatan Dharma has suffered such terribly at the hand=
s of <br>
foreigners.  I wonder why.<br>
<br>
Kindly provide your learned v=
iews on the same. I am curious to know <br>
what others think. <br>
