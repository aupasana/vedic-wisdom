            Namaste Rajarshi,



Rituals fall in two=
 groups - those done for dharma and those done for 

moksha.



Sun and Moo=
n were doing their dharma when they pointed out to Vishnu that 

Rahu was d=
rinking amrita (nectar) and Vishnu did his dharma when he cut off 

the hea=
d of Rahu. The event of eclipse, in which Rahu and Ketu trouble Sun 

and M=
oon, is not conducive to dharma, i.e. adherence to the rules of 

engagemen=
t in the field of duality.



But it is conducive to spiritual experience o=
f the underlying single reality 

where there is no duality (no god, no dem=
on, no good, no bad). Torturing of 

Sun and Moon by Ketu is conducive to m=
oksha. The eyes of the cosmic being, 

through which the variety of beings =
in this creation is observed, need to be 

closed in order to get out of th=
e field of duality and become absorbed in 

Brahman.



At the time of ecli=
pses, temples close and priests do not do temple rituals. 

However, for in=
dividual sadhana for spiritual progress, it is a great time. 

Some say tha=
t japam and homam done at the time of a homam gives 1000 times 

more resul=
t.



If you are doing a homam for spiritual progress, eclipse time is a gr=
eat 

time to do homam.



Best regards,

Narasimha
