Namaste,
 
The Veda mantra quoted by Sri Balasubramanian ("pUrNamadaH pUrNa=
midam") is saying that all is the Infinite Brahman. It is saying that Brahm=
an is Complete and also this Creation is Complete. Though the Creation has =
come from Brahman, still both Brahman AND the manifested Creation are Compl=
ete by themselves! In other words, Creation exists within Brahman as a pote=
ntiality and Brahman exists within Creation as the Indestructible essence.
=
 
If one really understands what the verse is saying, the discussion of "co=
mplete" coconut and "half" coconut is a moot point. The same "Complete" Bra=
hman exists within a giant planet and within an atom too. And, of course, w=
ithin a full coconut, half coconut and even a small coconut piece!
 
*     =
   *        *
 
However, such an understanding is not natural to our minds =
in their conditioned state. The rituals we perform and the sadhana we do ar=
e aimed at removing the mental conditioning and make such an understanding =
natural to our minds. Thus, rituals employ tools that put some useful ideas=
 in our minds.
 
Whatever you offer as poornaahuti in a homam, the key is t=
o imagine it as your head or ego and surrender to the deity completely. Imm=
ediately after the poornaahuti, go to meditation with as deep a sense of su=
rrender as possible for you. THAT is the key. If putting a full coconut or =
another full fruit makes such a visualization easier AND if it is practical=
 in your situation, go for it. If not, offer whatever you can (half coconut=
, a small coconut piece, a small banana, a date, a raisin or whatever) and =
do your best to maximize the sense of surrender.
 
*        *        *
 
> =
a full coconut (dry one off course) Purnaahuti
 
Utpal, apart from a full d=
ry coconut, one can even offer a normal full coconut, i.e. one with a shell=
 and with water inside. While a full dry coconut is highly combustible and =
symbolic of the ego of an advanced yogi, a normal coconut is far more diffi=
cult to burn and a better symbol of the ego of a normal person. If one has =
a big homa kundam and a big fire with enough wood, one can burn a regular f=
ull coconut too. One can also offer other fruits such as bananas.
 
However=
, one has to do the best one can, in one's practical situation. If one is d=
oing in a closed room (e.g. apartment) with a small homa kundam and a small=
 fire, one has to choose materials that minimize the smoke.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
Rishis are compassionate. They never said so and so thing is unavo=
idable. They knew that procedures are only symbols for internal changes. Pr=
ocedures are not absolute and what they symbolize are absolute. Same intern=
al changes can be achieved with different procedures, based on desa, kaala =
and paatra. So rishis always gave many options.
 
Instead of not doing some=
thing because you are missing one ingredient, it is better to do something =
with the available ingredients. If one does a homam and offers a half cocon=
ut or even a dry coconut piece as poornaahuti, it is perfectly fine. As I s=
aid before, work on the mental part of it for the best results.
 
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha

. Due to serious constraint(s), if some one is not able to offer full cocon=
ut as Purnaahuti, then can he not offer Half coconut or even a piece of coc=
onut making a 'Bhavana' that it is his/her head which is offered and reques=

 can be a big mistake even if that differs slightly at gross level from the=
 prescription of Shastras?
