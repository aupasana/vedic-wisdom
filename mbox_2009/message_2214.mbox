 Bivash 

I had similar doubts previously but after reading Aghora at the l=
eft hand of god , those doubts were cleared. Please take the below only as =
something that has been gathered from books and so that the nagging questio=
n in your mind is laid to rest.Learned members can kindly correct if any mi=
stakes are done in intrepretation.

Often this question can also take the f=
orm of " Why should god have an ugra roopa....should not god always be calm=
 patient...loving "

Whether that is the case or is it a case of the observ=
er attributing these qualities to god is a also a valid question. Often app=
earances are deceptive.

1.Tantra has six rites of destruction as well ( Ma=
rana , Ucchatana,Vidveshana...etc etc ) . Also tantra has abhichara prayoga=
s to cause the destruction of enemies.

Two instances where it has been men=
tioned in the classics is 

2.Meghanada the son of Ravana begins an Abhicha=
ra homa which if completed would have made him invincible.Lord Hanuman and =
Lakshmana stop the homa before it is completed and slay Meghanada.

3.Sudak=
shina son of Vasudeva of Kasi ( Vasudeva is killed by Krishna in the battle=
 of Kasi) does an Abhichara and sends an fiend to attack Krishna in Dwaraka=
. Krishna repels the Fiend and with any Abhichara when repelled it will tur=
n against the one who has intiated it. Kasi is burnt down and this is menti=
oned as the incident of Kasi burnt by Krishna.


The six destructive rites =
are only to be used for specific purposes relating to war , these are not r=
ites for ordinary human beings. They carry terrible terrible consequences.
=

Left hand tantra ( Please note Left hand is not used in any derogatory sen=
se) contains similar other practises as well....

Take for example : Vashik=
arana...and Bali 

The rite itself has many variations and many purposes. U=
sed on a lower level it is used to control others to do your bidding...Used=
 on a higher level it can attract a bhairavi ...whom if you have the right =
attitude you can accept as a mother and learn a lot from.


Vimalananda has=
 also clarified the use of Bali. In the pure sense the surrender of ego....=
But he has also clarified the use of pashu bali.....

Kamakhya one of the m=
ost sacred Pithas of the Goddess does an yearly bali of goats....Yet it is =
said to be one of the most peaceful places on earth to meditate . Only goat=
s with special markings on their bodies are used....when the priest does th=
e bali he is directly sending them to the abode of kali..In a way it is a b=
oon for the being in the body of the goat.It will surely come back as a hum=
an being.



Just like a forest fire appears destructive on the surface ...=
.but it is a proven scientific fact that the growth of trees is highest aft=
er a forest fire occurs .


Tantra especially the Left hand kind is not for=
 the faint of heart...nor is it for the timid in mind. Vimalananda in the v=
ery beginning had to do a shava sadhana before he could have a vision of hi=
s most compassionate Smashana Tara.


It is a very powerful path with rapid=
 progress but the pitfalls are many without the guidance of a Sadhguru...pr=
obably the reason Tantra was heavily put down later in the later period whe=
n most traditions got distorted.
