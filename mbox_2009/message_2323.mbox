 Volume 2, Practical Vedanta and other lectures
THE WAY TO BLESSEDNESS

Wha=
t is this Self? We have seen that It is even beyond the intellect.We
learn =
from the same Upanishad that this Self is eternal and omnipresent,
that you=
 and I and all of us are omnipresent beings, and that the Self is
changeles=
s. Now this omnipresent Being can be only one. There cannot be two
beings w=
ho are equally omnipresent =97 how could that be? There cannot be two
being=
s who are infinite, and the result is, there is really only one Self,
and y=
ou, I, and the whole universe are but one, appearing as many. "As the
one f=
ire entering into the world manifests itself in various ways, even so
that =
one Self, the Self of all, manifests Itself in every form."

But the questi=
on is: If this Self is perfect and pure, and the One Being of
the universe,=
 what becomes of It when It goes into the impure body, the
wicked body, the=
 good body, and so on? How can It remain perfect? "The one
sun is the cause=
 of vision in every eye, yet it is not touched by the
defects in the eyes o=
f any." If a man has jaundice he sees everything as
yellow; the cause of hi=
s vision is the sun, but his seeing everything as
yellow does not touch the=
 sun.

There the sun shines not, nor the stars, nor the lightning flashes, =
what to
speak of fire? He shining, everything shines; through His light eve=
rything
becomes effulgent. When all the desires that trouble the heart ceas=
e, then
the mortal becomes immortal, and here one attains Brahman.

This Is=
 the one fundamental idea in the Vedas, that our search in the stars,
the n=
ebulae, the Milky Way, in the whole of this external universe leads to
noth=
ing, never solves the problem of life and death. The wonderful mechanism
in=
side had to be analysed, and it revealed to them the secret of the
universe=
; nor star or sun could do it. Man had to be anatomised; not the
body, but =
the soul of man. In that soul they found the answer. What was the
answer th=
ey found? That behind the body, behind even the mind, there is the
self-exi=
stent One.He dies not, nor is He born. The self-existent One it
omnipresent=
, because He has no form. That which has no form or shape, that
which is no=
t limited by space or time, cannot live in a certain place. How
can it? It =
is everywhere, omnipresent, equally present through all of us.

Then the ot=
her great source of misery is fear. Why does one man injure
another? Becaus=
e he fears he will not have enough enjoyment. One man fears
that, perhaps, =
he will not have enough money, and that fear causes him to
injure others an=
d rob them. How can there be fear if there is only one
existence? If a thun=
derbolt falls on my head, it was I who was the
thunderbolt, because I am th=
e only existence. If a plague comes, it is I; if
a tiger comes, it is I. If=
 death comes, it is I. I am both death and life. We
see that fear comes wit=
h the idea that there are two in the universe.

We have always heard it pre=
ached, "Love one another". What for? That
doctrine was preached, but the ex=
planation is here. Why should I love every
one? Because they and I are one.=
 Why should I love my brother? Because he
and I are one. There is this onen=
ess; this solidarity of the whole universe.
>From the lowest worm that crawl=
s under our feet to the highest beings that
ever lived =97 all have various=
 bodies, but are the one Soul. Through all
mouths, you eat; through all han=
ds, you work; through all eyes, you see. You
enjoy health in millions of bo=
dies, you are suffering from disease in
millions of bodies. When this idea =
comes, and we realise it, see it, feel
it, then will misery cease, and fear=
 with it. How can I die? There is
nothing beyond me. Fear ceases, and then =
alone comes perfect happiness and
perfect love.

That universal sympathy, u=
niversal love, universal bliss, that never
changes, raises man above everyt=
hing. It has no reactions and no misery can
touch it; but this little eatin=
g and drinking of the world always brings a
reaction. The whole cause of it=
 is this dualism, the idea that I am separate
from the universe, separate f=
rom God. But as soon as we have realised that
"I am He, I am the Self of th=
e universe, I am eternally blessed, eternally
free" =97 then will come real=
 love, fear will vanish, and all misery cease.
