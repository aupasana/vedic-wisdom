14th February, 1949

=93When mother came to live with me I was in the Virup=
aksha Cave itself. At
that place there was no water. She was, therefore, in=
convenienced on that
account. We used to go to the Skandasramam, to bathe a=
s there was a
waterfall.

She was too old, you see, and so she could not ac=
company us. We had at the
time two big kamandalams with us. We made one of =
them ourselves.

The other, some one brought and gave us. Each could hold a=
 small potful of
water. I used to bring water in both of them, carrying one=
 in each hand.

She used to sit down wearing a small cloth and I used to po=
ur the water over
her head just as we do abhishekam over an idol. That is h=
ow she used to have
her bath. There was no cooking. Some one used to wash h=
er cloth and bring it
back.

That was all. If water was brought in those tw=
o kamandalams all her
requirements used to be met.=94

=93The kamandalams s=
hould then be very large,=94 I said.=93Yes. They were large,=94
said Bhagav=
an. =93What has become of them now?=94 asked some devotee.

Bhagavan: =93On=
e of them must be here. The other disappeared even while we
were in the Ska=
ndasramam.

Vallimalai Muruganar used to visit us even while we were in Vir=
upaksha Cave.
After our residence was changed to the Skandasramam, he came =
again.

He had a loud voice and was very fond of chitchatting. He cast his =
eyes on
that
kamandalam. He knew it was no good asking Perumalswamy and oth=
ers and so he
approached Mother.

She was a simpleton. If anyone flattered =
her by saying that there was no one
equal to her in this world, she used to=
 give away whatever was asked of her.
He was clever enough to discover this=
. =91Mother, you have given birth to a
diamond of a son.

There is no one t=
o equal you in this world. Your son is a very great
personage, unparalleled=
,=92 and so on. After praising her like that for some
time, he finally said=
, =91If you give me one kamandalam, I will bring Ganges
water in it and wil=
l do you abhishekam with it.=92

No sooner he said that, than she was overj=
oyed and gave away the kamandalam.
He could not,however, bring Ganges water=
 during her lifetime.

But recently, that is about twelve years back, he di=
d bring Ganges water in
that kamandalam and performed abhishekam over Mothe=
r=92s image, thus keeping
his word. That was the first time she had abhishe=
kam performed with Ganges
water.

Subsequently, several people did abhishek=
am with Ganges water but they
brought it in small vessels whereas he brough=
t it in a large kamandalam. The
kamandalams that we have just received are =
small in comparison.=94
