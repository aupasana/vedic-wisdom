Namaste,
 
Yes, you can.
 
It is particularly useful to add the rishi/rishis of your gotra/pravara or any rishis that you may be attracted to.
 
Each being has a mind (Moon, water) and a soul (Sun, fire). Gods and rishis self-identify with the soul more than the mind, while pitris identify with the mind and its desires more than the soul. However, pitris too have souls and gods/rishis too have minds, however subtle they may be. Homam works at the soul level and tarpana at the mind level.
 
It is a useful do tarpana to minds that have an effect on your mind.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
