Namaste,
=C2=A0
Vishnu is the maintai=
ner of dharma and sustainer of 
the worlds. He maintains natural order in c=
reation. One may start chanting his 
names without understanding the meanin=
gs. After chanting those names for a few 
months or years, one will wonder =
about the meanings and learn the meanings of 
those 1000 names. Then, as on=
e chants, one's mind forms auspicious images based 
on those names. Frequen=
t occurrence of those images and thoughts in the mind 
purifies the mind an=
d strengthens certain tendencies of the mind and weakens 
others.
=C2=A0
Vi=
shnu sahasra naam is a very saattwik prayer that 
promotes dharma and sattw=
a in the person.
=C2=A0
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

          Honestly speaking, I am embarra=

or comment on the "worth" 
          of Vishnu sahasra naam, which was taug=

          However, that is not to say that everyone meditati=

 let me 
          return to a previous analogy, as I believe that analogie=

          understand concepts better.
          =C2=A0
        =
  Mantras are for protecting mind (from its enemies, 
          i.e. one's =
weaknesses like ego, pride, attachment, lust, anger etc). 
          Imagin=
e one's mind to be a person. Imagine one's weaknesses to be 
          enem=
ies charging at the person aggressively. Imagine mantra to be a 
          =
weapon (stick or stone or gun) in the hands of the 
person.
          =C2=
=A0
          One may have a nice stick that was used by thousand 
        =
  people before him to beat up strong enemies. Yet, he may not know how 
  =
        to use it and the weapon may become ineffective in his hands. If on=
e 
          taps an aggressive enemy gently with a stick, that will hardly=
 be 
          effective. One has to beat hard and with all the energy one =
can 
          muster. Similarly, one's will power should be strongly focus=
ed on 
          overcoming ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy=C2=A0etc and o=
ne should 
          make conscious and forceful effort.
          =C2=A0
 =
         If one with some experience in beating up enemies 
          with =
sticks tries to throw stones at them, he may not know how to aim

 and may fail. Similarly, one with experience in chanting other mantras

          making them work.
          =C2=A0
          If one not knowin=

          confidently as the enemy approac=
hes and tries in vain to shoot, one 
          will fail and be beaten by e=

          use powerful Veda mantra=

          sadhana=C2=A0and succumb to e=
go, pride etc. If one atleast realizes 
          that one cannot shoot, on=
e can atleast use the gun as a stick and try 
          to beat up the enem=
y. Similarly, if one atleast realizes that one does 
          not know how=
 to put veda mantra to use, one can chant the veda mantra 
          hundre=

humility and try consciously to control negative emotions such as ego,

          Bottomline is this: Just as=
 how well a person puts a 
          weapon to use and overcomes enemies de=
pends on how strong and serious 
          the person is, how much training=
 and practice he has in using the 
          weapon, similarly how well a p=

          overcome internal weaknesses d=
epends on what kind of mental 
          conditioning one has, how strong a=
 desire one has for spiritual 
          progress, what kind of a guru one =
has and how much effort one puts 
          into spiritual sadhana. Thus, w=
e cannot make a blanket statement that 
          reading Vishnu sahasra na=
am, for example, everyday will help one 
          become pure and get moks=
ha.
          =C2=A0
          While one engages in various external practi=
ces as a 
          part of the spiritual sadhana, one should remember that=
 the internal 
          goal is to overcome ego and attain a spirit of com=
plete surrender and 
          detachment and try to cultivate that interna=

          beginning, things are difficult and this is a m=

          Eventually, one makes sufficient progress=

     Whatever mantra or stotra or ritual was given to you
