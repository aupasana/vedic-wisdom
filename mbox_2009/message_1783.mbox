"Ju=
st try to learn the Truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from h=
im submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can imp=
art knowledge unto you because he has seen the Truth."

(Bhagavad Gita, 4:3=
4)



The concept of practicing spiritual life under the guidance of an aut=
hentic and qualified guru, or spiritual teacher, has been central to the en=
tire Dharmic world-view from the beginning of time, down to our present day=
. So important has the role of the guru always been in Vedic culture, that =
there is no Hindu tradition or sampradaya (school of thought) in all of San=
atana Dharma that does not offer the greatest of respect to the importance =
of the guru. The great Vedantic text known at the Vedanta-sara paints the f=
ollowing dramatic picture in order to convey the importance of having a gur=
u in one's spiritual pursuit:

janana-maranadi-samsaranala-santapto dipta-s=
ira jala-rasim iva
upahara-panbm sotriyam brahma-nistham gurum upasrtya tam=
 anusarati

"Just as a person whose head is on fire runs to water, one who =
burns from the flames of birth, death, old age, and disease in the holocaus=
t of material existence must run to a genuine guru for relief. Such a guru =
must be fixed in the Absolute Truth and well-versed in the scriptures. One =
should approach him with all that is needed for sacrifice and submit to him=
 as a disciple, ready to
carry out his every instruction."

(Vedanta-Sara, =
11)


In our present era, the term "guru" has become very well known even t=
hroughout the non-Hindu world, in addition to being known within Sanatana D=
harma. Indeed, the very word "guru" has today become a part of the standard=
 English lexicon with such terms as "computer guru", "health guru", "econom=
ics guru", etc. being employed in daily usage. While the use of the word ha=
s become widespread, however, the sacrosanct importance of the station of g=
uru is not as deeply
understood in contemporary society as it once was. In =
the following work, I will be briefly explaining the traditional Dharmic un=
derstanding of the importance of the guru in the life of the spiritual prac=
titioner, as well as dispelling some of the more common myths often wrongly=
 associated with the principle of guru.

Interestingly, the very word "guru=
" itself is actually a somewhat generalized term that simply means a compet=
ent teacher of any kind. Any skilled expert who is authorized to teach a sp=
ecific subject can be considered a guru in the most general of senses. Thus=
, there can be a sitar guru, a martial arts guru, a medicinal sciences guru=
, or a fine arts guru. When the word is used in the overtly spiritual sense=
, however, then we are talking about a guru of a categorically different na=
ture. The spiritual guru is specifically designated as
a "sadguru" or a tea=
cher of Truth. It is the sadguru, the conveyor of Truth, who serves as the =
underlying model of any and all other types of gurus.

It has always been u=
niversally recognized that one can only learn a specialized field of import=
ant knowledge from a qualified and well-trained teacher, an expert on that =
particular subject who has both theoretical knowledge, as well as the acqui=
red experience necessary to bring that knowledge to life. If one were to st=
udy to become a medical doctor, for example, it is understood that the only=

way to truly understand medicine is to go to a recognized school, and lear=
n under the instruction of very experienced professors who themselves are r=
ecognized doctors trained and authorized to teach. If we attempt to learn t=
o become a doctor by merely reading books on our own without the benefit of=
 such expert guidance, we will be doing both ourselves and our later patien=
ts the greatest of disservices. Rather than curing our patients, in fact, w=
e will most likely harm them due to our not having learned medicine from a =
living authority.

Similarly, it has been universally recognized in our Hin=
du tradition since the most ancient of times that if one wishes to understa=
nd and make progress in the realm of spirituality, one must also seek guida=
nce under the most able spiritual professionals available. Such a spiritual=
 professional is the guru.

According to the Bhagavata Purana:

tasmad guru=
m prapadyeta
jijnasum sreyam uttamam
sabde pare ca nisnatam
brahmany upasam=
asrayam

"One who is searching for the Ultimate Truth must surrender unto a=
 spiritual master, a guru. A guru knows the inner meaning of the Vedas, is =
fixed in the Absolute Truth and is expert in the shastra, the revealed scri=
ptures."

(Bhagavata Purana, 11.3.21)


Of all types of gurus, the scriptur=
es (Shastras) of Sanatana Dharma have recognized the Acharya as the most im=
portant form that the principle of guru can take. Acharyavan puruso veda, "=
Only one who has an Acharya can know the Truth." (Chandogya Upanisad, 6.18.=
2) It is only under the guidance of an Acharya who knows the Truth that a s=
eeker can in turn know Truth.

The sadguru is a spiritual teacher. The Acha=
rya, moreover, is considered to be a sadguru who has attained a much higher=
 stage of personal spiritual development, and who thus has more responsibil=
ity in the realm of Dharmic leadership. An Acharya is a spiritual preceptor=
 who represents a living lineage (sampradaya) of Sanatana Dharma, and who e=
mbodies the teachings of Dharma in his own life, thus
teaching the world by=
 his own personal living example. While every Acharya fulfills the function=
 of a guru, not every guru can be considered an Acharya.

More than merely =
being a teacher in the formal academic sense, however, the Acharya guru is =
recognized as also being someone who possesses divine qualities due to his =
own years of practice and inner realization, and who thus perfectly personi=
fies the fruit of spiritual teachings in his own life.

acinoti yam sastrar=
tham
acare sthapayaty api
svayam acarate yasma
acharyas tena kirtitam

"An =
Acharya is one who fully understands the conclusions of the revealed script=
ures. His own behavior reflects his deep realization, and thus he is a livi=
ng example of divine precept. He is therefore known as an Acharya, or one w=
ho teaches the meaning of the scriptures both by word and deed."

(Vayu Pur=
ana)


The qualified and authentic guru is not merely someone who teaches t=
he Truth verbally, but who also lives that Truth perfectly, and who then re=
flects that Truth to his students in a living and dynamic way.

In the pres=
ent Age of Conflict (Kali Yuga), unfortunately, we often encounter unqualif=
ied and self-anointed individuals who claim to be gurus while often falling=
 very far short of the true meaning of this term. Often such unqualified pe=
rsons do not possess the prerequisite qualities, training, and characterist=
ics necessary to call themselves a guru in the authentic and scripturally-b=
ased sense of this term. The scriptures of Sanatana Dharma have given us ve=
ry clear and unambiguous guidelines of many of the most important qualities=
 necessary in order to recognize whether or not a person is in fact an auth=
entic and qualified guru. Some of these guidelines are outlined in the Bhag=
avad Gita:


duhkhesv anudvigna-manah
sukhesu vigata-sprhah
vita-raga-bhaya=
-krodhah
sthita-dhir munir ucyate

"One who is not disturbed in spite of th=
e threefold miseries, who is not elated when experiencing pleasantness, and=
 who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mi=
nd."

(Bhagavad Gita, 2:56)


Thus, the sadguru (true guru) is inwardly det=
ached and transcends the sufferings of this world, accepting material pleas=
ure and pain, suffering and pleasantness with equal demeanor. It is as a re=
sult of the true guru's transcendent status - and the consequent calm, peac=
e, and gravitas that the guru exudes at all times - that the true guru has =
the ability to help his student to similarly transcend the darkness of igno=
rance.

More, the true guru exhibits certain necessary inherent qualities t=
hat are a reflection of the fact that he is presencing the Divine in his ow=
n life. Again, the Bhagavad Gita gives us several lists of these important =
transcendental qualities of the true guru, or the liberated sage, including=
 the following important characteristics:

"The Blessed Lord said: Fearless=
ness, purification of one's existence,
cultivation of spiritual knowledge, =
charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, auster=
ity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renuncia=
tion, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from co=
vetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgivenes=
s, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor--the=
se transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed =
with divine nature."

(Bhagavad Gita, 16:1-3)


In this way, the guru perso=
nifies the fruit of a sattvic (spiritually positive) lifestyle and of years=
 of meditative practice.

A true guru is known, not merely by how much char=
isma they may possess, or by what cheap supposed miracles they seemingly pe=
rform, or by how popular they have become with the gullible masses due to w=
ell-formulated PR and marketing campaigns. Rather, true gurus are known by =
whether or not they personify the qualities of a guru that are clearly outl=
ined in the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma. Any person who claims to be a tr=
ue guru, but who does not exhibit all the qualities of a true guru that are=
 revealed in the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, is a false guru and must be=
 immediately rejected as a charlatan if the student is going to make any pr=
ogress toward the goal of transcendental realization.

It is precisely beca=
use the true guru both personifies the very highest philosophical teachings=
 (siddhanta), as well as the moral and yogic behavior described in our scri=
ptures that the guru has the ability to deliver us from ignorance to wisdom=
, from darkness to the light, and from bondage to freedom.

According to ou=
r scriptures, when we find ourselves in the presence of such an authentic g=
uru, it is almost as if we are in the very presence of God Himself; because=
 like God, the sadguru has the ability to show us Truth, and to thus set us=
 free. In the Bhagavata Purana, Sri Krishna confirms this in His instructio=
ns to His great devotee Uddhava:

acharyam mam vijaniyam
navamanyeta karhic=
it
na martya buddhyasuyeta
sarva-deva mayo gurum

[Krishna told Uddhava] "K=
now the Acharya as My very Self. I am the Acharya. Never envy the Acharya; =
never blaspheme him or consider him to be an ordinary man. Because the Acha=
rya channels the infinite, He is greater than the sum total of all the fini=
te. Thus, he is more important than all the gods."

(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.1=
7.27)

Further, Sri Krishna explains in the same sacred text that to even v=
iew the liberated Acharya as an ordinary man, and to not offer one's due re=
spects to such an exhalted guru, is considered by Him to be a great offense=
 (guru-maha-aparadha):

yasya saksad bhagavati
jnana-dipa prade gurau
marty=
asad-dhim srutam tasya
sarvam ku-jara-saucavat

"The guru must be considere=
d to be like the Supreme Lord Himself, because he bestows the light of tran=
scendental knowledge upon his disciples. Consequently, for one who maintain=
s the material conception that the guru is an ordinary human being, everyth=
ing is frustrated. His attempts to make progress in spiritual life - his Ve=
dic studies and scriptural knowledge, his penances and austerities, and his=
 worship of the deity - are all as useless as the bathing of an elephant wh=
o rolls in the mud after his bath."

(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.20.17)


Confirm=
ation of these Vedic instructions on the nature of sadguru is found through=
out the length and breadth of the Hindu scriptures. For example, in the Pad=
ma Purana it is explained that: gurus nara-matir yasya va naraki sam, "One =
who thinks that the guru is an ordinary man is said to live in ignorance." =
In this way, we see that the totality of the scriptures speak in one, unifi=
ed and authoritative voice on the importance of the guru and the unique rol=
e of the guru is the life of one who claims the desire to know Truth.

Late=
r in this same conversation, Uddhava replies to Sri Krishna's instruction i=
n the same vein:

naivopayanty apacitim kavayas tavesa
brahmayusapi krtam r=
ddha mudam smarantam
yo'ntar bahis tanu-bhrtam asubham vidhunvann
acarya-ca=
ittya vapusa sva-gatim vyanakti

[Uddhava said to Sri Krishna] "O my Lord! =
Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual science could not fully expre=
ss their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the lifetime o=
f Brahma, for You appear in two features - externally as the Acharya and in=
ternally as the Paramatman, the Supreme Self - to deliver the embodied livi=
ng beings by revealing to them your devotional service and teaching them ho=
w to approach you on the path of divine love."

(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.29.6)=



In addition to explaining both the nature and the qualities of the sadgu=
ru, the scriptures also explain that it is likewise very important to under=
stand the important qualities that must be present in a sincere and qualifi=
ed student. In the Katha Upanishad, for example, we read the following:

sr=
avanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyam
srnvanto 'pi bahavo na vidyum
acharyo 'sya=
 vakta kusalo 'sya labhda
acharyo jnata kushala nushishtam

"Many cannot ev=
en hear about the soul, and even after hearing about the soul, many cannot =
understand it; this is because it is hard to find an Acharya who is a genui=
ne seer of the truth. Such a qualified Acharya is a great soul and is very =
rare. At the same time, realization of the truth can be had only by those d=
isciples who carefully follow the qualified Acharya's teachings and become =
expert in the science of God. Such disciples are also very rare. Thus it is=
 that only a few ever come to know the soul in truth."

(Katha Upanisad, 1.=
2.7.)


To find a sincere and worthy student is thus explained as being jus=
t as difficult as finding a qualified and worthy sadguru. The highest attai=
nment of transcendent Truth, and the personal spiritual liberation (moksha)=
 that results from such a realization, is the most difficult goal to realiz=
e. Thus, Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita:

Manushyam sahasreshu
Kashchi=
d yatati siddhaye
Yatatam api siddhanam
Kashchin mam vetti tattvatah

"Of m=
any thousands of men, one will attempt to reach perfection; and of the few =
who reach this goal, only a rare soul will perhaps know Me as I am."

(Bhag=
avad Gita, 7:3)


When a sincere student and a qualified sadguru finally do=
 find each other, and unite in the eternal process of spiritual exchange =
=96 the guru sharing his insight, instruction, and empowering presence with=
 the student; and the student learning and growing spiritually with humilit=
y, sincerity, openness and eagerness =96 we then witness the perfect condit=
ions necessary for the celebration and living of Truth. If you are seeking =
Truth, then seek the guidance of one who has seen the Truth. Seek the sadgu=
ru.
