Resp Guru Narsimhaji, 

Sire, for long  have been following your lectures p=
rovided online. So for me your are my Guru (least adrishya guru) from whom =
I receive (derive) guidance  

Lately i have decided to start reciting Nara=
yan Kavach. As usual i am in doubt as can i start such a practice with an i=
nitiation from a Guru.? 

Also my search through the webpages to get a copy=
 of Naryan Kavach lead me to confusion. 
On one site I got a version which =
is completely different from an sanskrit version available on site : http:/=
/sanskritdocuments.org/doc_1_index.html. 

Also this Sanskrit version menti=
ons the whole dialogue between the Rishi and the King. My confusion is for =
a sadhana shall i recite the Narayan Kavach as some dialogue between Rishi =
and King or is there a complete separate prayer as Kavach?  

To add to my =
confusion i found a paper by Robert Koch from a SJC conferece on Narayan da=
sa. In this he mentions about this kavach and  quotes three  mantras viz 1.=
 om viṣṇave namaḥ 
                          2. om namo n=
ārāyaṇāya
                          3. om namo bhagava=
te vāsudevāya 

and says that reciting them as daily sadhana will=
 help.  

So i request you to please guide me as what is Narayan Kavach, ho=
w shall one put it into sadhana and if possible could share a copy of this =
Kavach in the form it is to be recited. 


sincerely 
Ashutosh
