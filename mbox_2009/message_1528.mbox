Ravi,

I am surprised that there is a general rule that recommend us to rea=
d out mantra loud during homa. I thought the entire homam can be done with =
out making sound if we can do it. Once you get the mantra, it is much easie=
r when we pronounce it loud. It takes much more effort to pronounce it comp=
letely mentally while keeping the correct swara.

There were times when man=
y of the mantras were secret (one may recall the story of Ramanuja giving o=
ut Om Namoe Narayanaaya to all. It was kept a secret for a long time).

All=
 the mantras are making our conversation with the gods during the mantra. T=
he communication with Gods is at thought level and physical plane is not re=
quired.

In fact, if ones internal fire is very strong, then even physical =
fire may not be really required. How ever, the internal fire in most of us =
is perhaps very weak.

Best regards,
Vijay
Best regards,
Vijay
