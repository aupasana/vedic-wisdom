Dear ALL,

Namaste.

Super Mantra Gayatri and Yajnas are like an inseparabl=
e couple. One is the
mother of Indian culture and the other is the father o=
f Indian spirituality.
Both are mutually dependent on one another. Without =
executing a Yajna at the
end of a Gayatri Mantra chanting program (Anushtha=
an) the latter remains
incomplete. One portion of Japa or Mantra chanting i=
s in the form of Havan
or fire sacrifice. In ancient times when people were=
 materially well off a
tenth portion of Mantra chanting program was devoted=
 to Yajna. But looking
at today=92s circumstances a 100th portion of the nu=
mber of Mantras chanted is
offered as Ahutis (sacred materials to the Yajna=
 fire saying =91Swaahaa=92) to a
Yajna. Without this an Anushthaan remain i=
ncomplete. A question may arise
that what happens to those who are not mate=
rially very well off? The answer
is that such individuals should chant extr=
a Mantras amounting to a 10th
portion of the number chanted during an Anush=
thaan. For them this extra
Mantra Japa is considered equivalent to performi=
ng a Yajna. By giving this
option it is not as though Yana is being ignored=
 but that its importance
albeit indirectly has been highlighted. Again it s=
hould be noted that this
arrangement is only for the poor strata of society=
.


 A dialogue between Janak and Yajnavalkya regarding the non availabilit=
y of
Yajna materials took place. Janak insisted the problems of Yajna perfo=
rmance
are many and Yajnavalkya kept giving solutions to those problems thu=
s
insisting that Yajnas were a very important aspect of Vedic culture. Jana=
k
asked: Suppose Yajna materials like Charu are not available what is to be=

done? The answer was: Conduct Yajnas using materials eaten by a person dai=
ly
(rice, wheat, millet etc grains). Janak asked: Suppose there is no food =
what
happens then? The answer is make-do with plants. Janak asked: Suppose =
there
are no plants? The answer was that use only Samidha (wood based fuel)=
 for
the Yajna. Janak asked: Suppose fire itself is not available? The answ=
er is
that mentally execute a Yajna using the fire of faith in a meditative=

manner. This is the gist of the long conversation that had taken place.

F=
rom the above it becomes clear that along with Gayatri Mantra Japa
conducti=
ng a Yajna is a must. Further in an Anushthaan both these are
mutually conj=
oined. Gayatri Japa and 5-fold Yajna are imperative. We all
know that conjo=
ined to meditative methods are the Balivaishwa rites and it
is nothing but =
a mini Yajna. During dire times this Balivaishwa rite became
so miniscule t=
hat women after taking fire from their cooking pyre offered 5
small parts o=
f a Roti (Indian wheat bread) to it while chanting the Gayatri
Mantra. Thus=
 it was taken to be a Yajna. Further those who worshipped
Gayatri regularly=
 too performed this miniscule Yajna. Before partaking food
they would remov=
e 5 small portions of food from their plates and offer it to
a small bowl o=
f fire. Even today here and there this tradition can be seen
in India. Toda=
y Yuga Nirman Mission is trying to rejuvenate this tradion of
miniscule Yaj=
nas.

In ancient India great Rishi-Seers kept in mind at every step, wisdom=
,
subtle viewpoint, utility and state of facts before embarking on any worl=
d
welfare program. Despite giving due importance to Yajnas in religious
act=
ivities they have kept many other precepts in mind too. They could never
ma=
ke any endeavor which had no great utility value. They have always gave
due=
 emphasis to the results and attainments while giving more importance to
an=
y sacred endeavor. Thus they gave Yajnas more importance amongst all
spirit=
ual endeavors keeping in mind their capacity to bestow world denizens
both =
material and spiritual prosperity.
