Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.

Thank you so very much for your highly explici=
t response. This will really help me and others I am sure. At the risk of d=
riving you crazy and wasting even more of your time I have one last questio=
n pertaining to the "Pre-Gayatri" stanza.

How is the "v" in bhuurbhuvassva=
H pronounced? Is it a hard "v" or more like a "w" or some combo of the two?=
 My question applies to "Shivaya" as well. I read somewhere that there is n=
o hard "v" sound in Sanskrit and thus pronouncing "v" like "w" is more appr=
opriate, but I suppose this rule only applies in certain instances (As "Sav=
itur" does have a hard "v")?

Thank you so much again. I really do apprecia=
te the time and energy you put into your responses.

Best Regards

The vowel "R^i" as in (kR^iShNa or R^iShi or R^ici or R^itam) is mispronoun=
ced as "ru" by south Indians and as "ri" by north Indians (e.g. ruShi or ri=
Shi). Neither pronunciation is correct. Both are silly, as they contain a c=
onsonant and an vowel, instead of just one vowel.

or "la" or "va" (respectively). If you pronounce "R^i" as either "ru" or "r=
i" as south/north Indians do and pronounce "a" immediately following it, wi=
thout ANY break in between, you will end up getting "rva" or "rya" (respect=
ively) and definitely not "ra". That means both are wrong.

de edge of the top line. If you trisect the distance between them, you can =
locate "R^i" and "L^u" (in the order i, R^i, L^u and u). If you do this and=

 logical and natural. If you pronounce i, R^i, L^u or u and then a, you ind=
