Dear Rajarshi,

I trust so. My knowledge of Ramayana is limited to my readi=
ng of Hanuman story from story book Chandamama. How ever, in past, I have f=
ound it to be an accurate translation of Valmiki ramayana.

Chandrasena com=
es in the part after Meghanatha dies, Ravana invokes his friends Ahiravana =
and Mairavana who take Rama to patalaloka.

Hanuman goes there to riscue Ra=
m and Laksham. In order get the secret to kill one of those demons, Chandra=
sena helps and in return Hanuman promises to bring Rama to her. This inside=
nt happens at that time. In the same story, Hanuman takes form of pancha mu=
kha anjaneya avatar (five faces).

Best regards,
Vijay

lly appreciate your explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama =
was capable of manipulating realm of Maya (Miracle worker) like Lord Krishn=
a BUT the role assumed by him in that incarnation was of that 'Maryaada Pur=
shottam' and that is why he demonstrated 'Maryaada' in every aspect of life=
.he abided himself by the general rules of society. But i do not think that=
 he had not Mastered the Duality. where as Krishna didn't bound himself in =
any boundry whatsoever.
