 only after being gradually trained to be so. Mind begins to be really help=

 You have heard the saying, "The Devil can quote scriptures for its purpose=

 This will be valuable to sincere aspirants who are eager to study their mi=
nds and eliminate defects and shortcomings. These are extremely useful tips=
 specially in the working field, for aspirants engaged in active Seva in th=
e midst of other people.

> Sadhaks are told, "Keep up Matri-bhava or Dev=
i-bhava when you move with women." This is a grand principle to safeguard y=
our purity and spiritual progress. But this does not tell you, "Move with w=
omen." Nor does this advice mean that if you try to have this attitude then=
 you may go on freely mixing with the opposite sex without any limit or res=
traint. The mind will ask, "Why not? What if I do? To retreat from their pr=
esence is sheer timidity? No fear when you do so with Devi-bhava!" Beware, =
O Aspirant, beware of this tendency! Divine Bhava is not a license to throw=
 away all restrictions of the Sadhaka's path. The permanent injunction for =
Sadhakas is to totally eschew all contact with the opposite sex. When unavo=
idably such contact becomes necessary, then, "Have Matri-bhava; have Devi-b=
hava" etc., are prescribed. Also this is to caution the aspirant not to hat=
e women or become a misogynist. Women should be reverenced but from a safe =
distance. Let not Devi-bhava etc., be taken to mean that you should be all =
the time in the midst of them. Watch your mind!
> 
> Then there is the advi=
ce which says, "You may hiss but not bite." This safe counsel was given to =
a fabulous snake which in a too extreme access of piety became so totally d=
ocile and harmless that it got severely mal-handled by a set of mischievous=
 urchins. It was given as an example to over-timid householders and people =
struggling in the very midst of the harsh realities of competitive `vyavaha=
ric' life. Here an overdose of `Avanty-brahmin'-like humility might well ma=
ke life impossible amidst the Asuric elements abounding in the world. There=
fore, just an outward show of pugnacity may be countenanced in so far as th=
is does not affect your basic goodness and brotherhood. But this policy is =
not for the spiritual aspirant in the path of Sadhana and Nivritti. Definit=
ely not. Let aspirants take heed of these words. The Sadhak is neither to '=
bite' nor is he to `hiss' even. This 'hissing' business will soon become a =
part of your nature. You will soon find yourself hissing for everything, at=
 everything, at everyone, in and out of season. This hiss will include ever=
y variety of rudeness ranging from hot argument, sharp retort, curt reply t=
o angry glaring, shouting and abuse. In short of physical violence and figh=
t, every type of verbal brutality will be put into the "hissing" category. =
This will ultimately lead to spiritual ruin. The mind is ever waiting to ta=
ke advantage of even the least concession shown to it. Its natural tendency=
 is to go downward. O Aspirant, do not bite or even 'hiss'. Be humble, be s=
weet, be gentle. Be firm but be soft, polite and courteous. If you wish to =
'hiss' then 'hiss' at your own mind. Thrash the ego. Fight the Shad-ripus. =
Watch the mind!
> 
> Another victim to perversion is the piece of advice, "=
Be resolute. Stick to your priniciples. Never budge an inch." The best poss=
ible advice to a sincere Sadhaka; but unfortunately often made the basis fo=
r the worst possible trait i.e., obstinacy. This is a Tamasic trait. But th=
e mind will make believe that you are manifesting Atma-bal or a divine dete=
rmination. This is its work=97to make him cling tightly to his ego. Hence t=
his deception. But the careful aspirant must discern the difference between=
 Sattvic Nishta and sheer stubbornness. Atma-bal is not a cheap commodity t=
o be got without a great deal of earnest struggle, discipline and Will-cult=
ure. Determined adherence is advocated in respect of truly high and noble p=
rinciples and not of self-conceited notions. By all means stick to spiritua=
l Yogic Niyamas but avoid becoming obdurate in nature. Do not be deceived. =
Watch your mind!
> 
> "Speak the Truth always. Be frank." Thus is the Upade=
sh. This means when you are required to talk then speak only the truth. It =
does not at all mean that you must go about telling everyone to his face wh=
at exactly you think of him or her. This is unwarranted behaviour. Under th=
e garb of frankness to give free expression of opinions without caring for =
other peoples' feelings is not `Aarjava' or frankness or straightforwardnes=
s. At the least it is thoughtlessness; at its height it is sheer brutality.=
 It does not bespeak well of an aspirant. The same teacher who tells you "S=
peak truth; be frank!" also tells you to have "Mita Bhashan, Madhura Bhasha=
n" moderate and sweet speech. Mind can even make you to utilise frankness i=
n order to express mild insult. An unpleasant truth is better left unsaid. =
If it becomes absolutely necessary and unavoidable then say it sweetly and =
with humility. "Not to hurt and wound others' feelings" is as equally impor=
tant as speaking truth. Satyam and Ahimsa must go together. Study thyself. =
Watch the mind!
> 
> Then there is the truism i.e., "Vairagya is really a m=
ental state, mental detachment." The mind takes hold of this definition to =
justify a heedless sensual life without self-restraint, or principle. The a=
rgument will always be, "O! I am not attached to all this. I can rise above=
 it in a moment. I enjoy it as a master. Mentally I am detached." Contact w=
ith Vishyas have toppled down even Tapasvins like Vishwamitra. Therefore, d=
o not take Vairagya lightly. Culitvate Vairagya diligently. Safeguard your =
Vairagya carefully. Be vigilant. Watch the mind!
> 
> The caution not to go=
 to extremes in Tapasya also gets a like fate. Man's normal nature is sensu=
ous. The mind wants comforts and hates austerity. The indiscriminating aspi=
rant conveniently ignores the qualifying adjective "extremes" in the advice=
 quoted above and views all `Tapasya' with disfavour. The result is to dege=
nerate into luxury, lose even the minimum of Titiksha and become a slave to=
 hundred wants. The warning is against foolish extremes but to a Sadhaka in=
 the early stages a certain degree of austerity is essential for developmen=
t. The mind will suggest so many justifications. It will bring Gita to its =
side and show that the Lord condemned Tapas. O aspirant, the Lord condemned=
 'Tamasic Tapas.' He recommended Sattvic austerity of body, speech and mind=
. Reflect carefully. Always watch the mind!
> 
> "Take care of essentials. =
Do not pay too much attention to non-essentials." The above too serves as a=
 handle for the mind to deceive the aspirant. If you have to follow this ad=
vice, first try to understand what is essential and what is non-essential. =
The idle nature of man is to loath following any sort of `Niyama' and set-l=
ines of Sadhachara. Therefore, everything is dismissed at a stroke as `non-=
essential.' Then what remains, God only can say. The only `essential' would=
 seem to be to do what the mind likes. The Sadhak must think what a Spiritu=
al instruction really means and then why it is given. Moreover, essentials =
and non-essentials vary according to the stage of development of the spirit=
ual aspirant. What may be unnecessary to an aspirant at a later stage may w=
ell be essential to him now. Do not throw away precious grain with the chaf=
f. Watch the mind!
> 
> Finally the most dangerous deception played by the =
mind is in connection with Sadhana itself. The very Sadhana that is adopted=
 by the aspirant to transfigure and divinise his life is converted into a p=
rop and a field for the play of ego and senses. It is very difficult to bre=
ak out of this ensnaring net without great earnestness and sincere endeavou=
r. It is this vitiation of Sadhana that keeps the Sadhak `stuck', as it wer=
e, on the path, arresting progress for years together. For example, youthfu=
l Sadhaks with sweet voice and musical talent naturally take to Kirtan and =
Bhajan as their Sadhana. Art always attracts admirers. He is in demand at a=
ll auspicious functions. He gets popular amongst Satsangis. The subtle mind=
 now spreads the net. The Kirtan becomes sweeter day by day. New songs and =
tunes are added to his musical repertory. Without his being aware, the Kirt=
an has become a means to attract others to himself and to maintain the popu=
larity. Thus the `Sadhana' becomes double-purposed=97primarily for God's Da=
rshana and side by side for worldly attraction. The result is the extraordi=
nary phenomenon of the Sadhak caught in his Sadhana. Instead of Mochana, th=
e quality of Sadhana becomes Bandhana. Maya is wonderful, indescribable. He=
r ways are mysterious and inscrutable.
> 
> Take Nishkama Karma Yoga. Servi=
ng and helping others for no return is something unheard of in the purely V=
yavaharic world. Naturally the disinterested Sevak is regarded as an except=
ional being. All doors are open unto him. Many bring their troubles to him,=
 open their hearts and freely confide even intimate problems. They, of cour=
se, take it for granted that the spiritual aspirant is perfectly pure in ev=
ery respect. Here the Sadhak walks upon the `razor-edge' of life. The mind =
is the devil. Through the very intimacy of contacts in the Seva field, plea=
sure centres are created and sensuousness gets scope in this Seva 'Sadhana'=
. Vanity and carnality get catered to and the aspirant appears to take a ke=
en interest in the Nishkama Seva. But a ruthless search of the mind will re=
veal that the keenness and interest in the Karma Yoga Seva is as much for t=
he sense-indulgence to be had in the Seva as for the Seva itself. So the mi=
nd destroys the Sadhana.
> 
> Aspirants practising Titiksha many a time sti=
ck on to the Titiksha for similar subconscious reasons. His endurance will =
earn for him a reputation. He will be regarded as extraordinary. So even af=
ter the Titiksha Sahdana has served its purpose he will keep on with it for=
 continuing the status it has granted him. Another Sadhak will under the id=
ea of being indifferent towards the body and its needs, neglects to shave e=
ven. This will be quite sincere and bonafide in the beginning. But the long=
 hair and beard that results out of this 'udaseenata' will prove the instru=
ment for Maya to lay hold of the aspirant. The hair will be found to beauti=
fy his appearance. He is loath to part with it. Thus the former "udaseenata=
" will be replaced by careful combing of the hair, application of oil, peep=
s into the mirror, dressing to suit, the style of the hair, new mannerisms,=
 etc. Thus in a trice will delusion spring upon you and overpower you like =
the tiger does its prey. Likewise Hatha Yogic exercise get misused to susta=
in gluttony; Vajroli is used for Vybhichara and Yoga is made to serve Bhoga=
. All these perversions arise out of the mischief of the unregenerate mind.=
 Therefore watch the mind!
> 
> The most extraordinary part of all this is =
that the mind will not allow you to take the above lessons seriously. It wi=
