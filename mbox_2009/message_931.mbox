Namaste Ashwin ji,

=C2=A0
Honestly speaking, I am embarras=
sed that somebody thinks a fool like me can certify or endorse or comment o=
n the "worth" of Vishnu sahasra naam, which was taught by Bhishma to Dharma=
raja at the onset of Kali yuga to help human beings in Kali yuga in=C2=A0fo=
llowing their dharma.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Mantras like Vishnu sah=
asra naam (1000 names of Lord Vishnu), Hanuman chalisa, Chandipath, Mahaman=
tra (Hare Krishna), Gayatri mantra, Rudram, Arunam, Pavamana sooktam, Mrity=
unjaya mantra, panchakshari, ashtakshari, dwadasakshari etc are well-establ=
ished and many people achieved spiritual progress with them. One cannot que=
stion their worth.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
However, that is not to sa=
y that everyone meditating with them will make fast spiritual progress. To =
explain this, let me return to a previous analogy, as I believe that analog=
ies help one understand concepts better.
=C2=A0
Mantras are for protecting =
mind (from its enemies, i.e. one's weaknesses like ego, pride, attachment, =
lust, anger etc). Imagine one's mind to be a person. Imagine one's weakness=
es to be enemies charging at the person aggressively. Imagine mantra to be =
a weapon (stick or stone or gun) in the hands of the person.
=C2=A0
One may=
 have a nice stick that was used by thousand people before him to beat up s=
trong enemies. Yet, he may not know how to use it and the weapon may become=
 ineffective in his hands. If one taps an aggressive enemy gently with a st=
ick, that will hardly be effective. One has to beat hard and with all the e=
nergy one can muster. Similarly, one's will power should be strongly focuse=
d on overcoming ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy=C2=A0etc and one should ma=
ke conscious and forceful effort.
=C2=A0
If one with some experience in bea=
ting up enemies with sticks tries to throw stones at them, he may not know =
how to aim and may fail. Similarly, one with experience in chanting other m=
antras tries beejaksharas, one may not succeed in aiming them correctly and=
 making them work.
=C2=A0
If one not knowing how to shoot a gun aims a gun =
confidently as the enemy approaches and tries in vain to shoot, one will fa=
il and be beaten by enemy. Similarly, one not knowing how to use powerful V=
eda mantras is overconfident, he may fail in sadhana=C2=A0and succumb to eg=
o, pride etc. If one atleast realizes that one cannot shoot, one can atleas=
t use the gun as a stick and try to beat up the enemy. Similarly, if one at=
least realizes that one does not know how to put veda mantra to use, one ca=
n chant the veda mantra hundreds or thousands of times everyday with sincer=
ity, surrender and humility and try consciously to control negative emotion=
s such as ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy etc.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=
=A0
Bottomline is this: Just as how well a person puts a weapon to use and =
overcomes enemies depends on how strong and serious the person is, how much=
 training and practice he has in using the weapon, similarly how well a per=
son puts a mantra to use use to overcome internal weaknesses depends on wha=
t kind of mental conditioning one has, how strong a desire one has for spir=
itual progress, what kind of a guru one has and how much effort one puts in=
to spiritual sadhana. Thus, we cannot make a blanket statement that reading=
 Vishnu sahasra naam, for example, everyday will help one become pure and g=
et moksha.
=C2=A0
While one engages in various external practices as a part=
 of the spiritual sadhana, one should remember that the internal goal is to=
 overcome ego and attain a spirit of complete surrender and detachment and =
try to cultivate that internal spirit. In the beginning, things are difficu=
lt and this is a mere thought. But, as one progresses and crosses a threshh=
old, external practices promote stronger internal focus and purity and stro=
nger internal focus and purity promote better and more effective sessions o=
f external practice.=C2=A0A kind of=C2=A0synergy develops between them. Eve=
ntually, one makes sufficient progress internally, which is the goal after =
all.
=C2=A0
Whatever mantra or stotra or ritual was given to you by a guru =
that you *surrendered* to, you should follow it while engaging in internal =
contemplation on an ongoing basis.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
