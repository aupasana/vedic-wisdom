Dear Narasimha ji, Namaskar,
  You've mentioned in your last post about not=
 focusing too much on 
technicality/theory and actually start doing it was =
an eye opener. I 
was really afraid of doing it wrong (esp. my ishta devta =
is nrisingha 
deva and I wanted to be careful)
 I have a problem though, I =
am trying as much as i can, but two 
things are happening that are not unde=
r my control and your guidance 
will be kindly appreciated.
1. I try really=
 hard to feel bhakti but i try to keep my mind as 
distraction less as poss=
ible , but neither i feel bhakti and as i am 
aware of all the distractions=
 throughout the japa, i really feel bad 
at the end of it. What else should=
 i be doing to atleast feel my 
attachment toward my ishta devta.

2. the l=
aya of mantra changes slowly. after some purascharans, the 
melody changes =
and different characters starts getting different 
emphasis e.g. when sayin=
g nrisihgha , gha comes out more vocal no 
matter what i try. should i be s=
ticking to one laya , should i let it 
mold as i keep doing it?

Regards
