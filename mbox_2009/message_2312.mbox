A disciple once asked Bhagavan, who was then at Skandasramam, =93What is me=
ant
by desireless action?=94

Bhagavan did not give a reply but kept quiet.=
 A little later, he went out
for a walk accompanied by the questioner and s=
ome others. Bhagavan saw a
branch of a tree, cut it and spent one hour shap=
ing it into a nice walking
stick. At about that time, an elderly shepherd w=
ho had no walking stick came
that way walking slowly and with difficulty.

=
Bhagavan gave him the stick which he just made and said =93Action is over s=
o
also desireless action=94 and thus showed by example what the phrase mean=
t.
