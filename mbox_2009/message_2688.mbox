Dear Devotees, 

If anyone has a copy of the Bhairava Ashtottharam, (in Sanskrit or English) kindly share it with me.

As far as my abilities i can find the english transliteration and meaning of "LakshmiNarasimha Karavalamba stotra" on the net which I am posting here.But as respected members may acknowledge that for proper pronounciation and recitation the original Sanskrit dialect is of utter importance.Hoping anyone could lend a helping hand to the matter.

Sri Lakshmi Nrsimha Karavalamba stotra
