Dear Utpal,

I sincerly apologize if my mail offended you.
=C2=A0

 is a common word used even to this day.=C2=A0If I am mistaken, please corr=

n't know if the word has any other possible meanings. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I shal=
l only request you to think about this verse in cool, calm manner, and=C2=
=A0not emotionally. Leave it for now.
=C2=A0
Again, sorry if the previous m=

Dear Rajarshi,

I a=
ppreciated your previous message but i am a bit taken a back by this messag=
e.

Ramakrishna was not Ganwar
Dhirubhai Ambani was not ganwar though he di=
dn't go to even secondary school education.

Did you not get ENGLISH Transl=
ation for 'Shudra' from your source? Shudra =3D Shudra in English? did you =
mean SHUDRA JATI because you haven't given any equivalent meaning in englis=
h.

I'll not write anything now as i am saddened by your message. I doubt y=
our intention and it is not good to write further at this moment.

Best Reg=
ards,

Utpal

derstand this better,=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0we have to think - scientifica=

 of the communication is through the words, 64 percent through body languag=
e and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or sub conscious communication. This l=
ast three percent is the most powerful. When a person can use this 3 percen=

Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=
=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go =
into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temp=
le, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his=
 watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time w=
ent. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple=
 sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement=
. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea =
why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.

 anything -:). He only=C3=82 woke up=C3=82 people to what ever de=
gree was necessary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, one can alwa=
ys contend that a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Saradananda=
=C3=82 could very well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving
 a=
 freewheeling talk is different from creating a composition. When one write=

sibilities of different shades of meanings for the simple reason that the a=
udience is large, unknown and spread out=C3=82 over huge spans of time=

bsp;we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication happens =
in three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the word=
s, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or s=
ub conscious communication. This last three percent is the most powerful. W=
hen a person can use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can=
 move masses of people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so =
(IMO). If
 you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find =
it uninspiring. But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you w=
ill definitely feel an energy and get swayed.=C3=82  <BR>> =C3=82&n=
bsp;<BR>> Then comes body language which is so important.=C3=82 For=
 example,=C3=82 if you enter a Govt office in India, you may find that=
 the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with their spine re=
clining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. That is why =
the files in Govt. of India offices move at a=C3=82 snail's pace.=C3=
=82 If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C3=82 is sit=
ting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the=
 person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure t=
hat there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing o=
ut the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, =
once you leave his presence he
 probably=C3=82 won' t bother about wha=
t you said.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> And last is spoken word. When two =
people speak with each other, both words and body language come into pictur=
e. Sometimes sub conscious communication too can happen. Therefore there is=
 a LOT of the energy exchanged/communica tion not through words but through=
 other means. <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> When you write down something, =
body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious whil=
e writing something in order to convey the correct sense. That is why there=
 are so many more rules to be followed=C3=82 for writing anything.<BR>=
> =C3=82 <BR>> So therefore, if Ramakrishna is "talking" to some=
one he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he were t=
o write a book and mention "Kamini and Kanchan" without further explanation=
 of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. But he =
never wrote any books, and the authors who
 did, made sure they explained t=
he sense. <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Contrast this to that line from Ram=
acharit Manas, without any qualifications, that implies "women", "sudra", "=
