In this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the realisation =
of God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and of the Advaita-Si=
ddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan of Lord Krishna throug=
h Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The reputed Swami Vidyaranya, the aut=
hor of the Panchadasi had direct Darsan of Mother Gayatri through Japa of G=
ayatri Mantra.

At the present moment many educated persons and college-stu=
dents have lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence=
 of the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly de=
plorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed, proud and a=
theistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough overhauling and drastic fl=
ushing.

Life is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cu=
t the knot of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which you d=
o not perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat, drink and sl=
eep and do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings only.

A Mantra, in =
the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world; a metre which gov=
erns the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a supernatural being, hig=
her or lower, as its informing power. The Bija, seed, is a significant word=
, or series of words, which gives it a special power. Sometimes this word i=
s a sound which harmonises with the key-note of the individual using it and=
 varies it with individuals; sometimes this word expresses the essence of t=
he Mantra, and the result of the Mantra is the flower springing from this s=
eed. The Sakti is the energy of the form of the Mantra, i.e., the vibration=
-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man to the Devata that is wors=
hipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which supports and makes strong the=
 Mantra, or the pin which fastens the Mantra together; this is the ceasing =
of sorrow, by the freeing of oneself from imperfections.

Do not bother you=
rself about Mantra, Para and Pasyanti, etc. Do Japa of your Ishta Mantra me=
ntally with its meaning and right Bhava. You will realise the spiritual ben=
efits. Why do you waste your time in counting the pebbles on the bank? Take=
 a dip immediately in the Ganges and enjoy the bath. Become wise.

All Mant=
ras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that Om Namo Naraya=
naya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri Ram, and so on. You=
 can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any Mantra. Valmiki attained G=
od-consciousness by repealing even Mara-Mara. Some people think that Om or =
Soham is superior to Om Namo Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also is wrong.=
 The state gained by doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by doing Jap=
a of Sri Ram or Radhesyam also.

You should not doubt the teachings of the =
scriptures. Flickering faith will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who=
 has no faith in Japa, cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path=
. If he says, "I am practicing `who am I' enquiry"=97this is all wild imagi=
nation. Few are fit for "who am I" enquiry.

You must have the Bhava that A=
tman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one. With this Bhava you will have to repe=
at your Guru Mantra or Ishta Mantra. Then alone you will have Mantra Siddhi=
 or God-realisation quickly.

The Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practit=
ioner realisation of his highest goal though he may not possess knowledge o=
f the meaning of the Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more =
time in realisation than when it is practiced with a knowledge of the meani=
ng. There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If yo=
u repeat the Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will attain God-=
consciousness quickly.

Form a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lo=
rd. Then only it will be easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.=


To define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite obj=
ect. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the source a=
nd ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are limiting the li=
mitless one, you are confining Him with concepts of mind. God is beyond the=
 reach of the gross mind, but He can be realised through Japa and meditatio=
n with a pure, subtle and one-pointed mind.


Japa is the repetition of any=
 mantra or name of the Lord.In this iron age Japa is the easiest and surest=
 way for God-realisation.

Repeat 200 malas of Japa daily. Mala or rosary i=
s a whip to goad the mind towards God. Wear a mala on your neck. It is the =
most precious jewel or ornament as it reminds you of God.

Practice of Japa=
 removes the impurities of the mind, destroys sins and brings the devotee f=
ace to face with God. Japa must become habitual. Be regular in your Japa.
