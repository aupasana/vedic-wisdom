Namaste,
 
I am cc'ing your question to some yahoogroups anonymously, so th=
at others too can benefit.
 
Yes, if a person with an individualized consci=
ousness receives some benefit - including knowledge - it will create a kaar=
mik debt. If the person giving that knowledge also has an individualized co=
nsciousness, the kaarmik debt is formed between the two individualized cons=
ciousnesses and stored in the corresponding kaarana sareeras (causal bodies=
). The magnitude of the debt is based on a combination of how important the=
 receiver and the giver considered the thing that was exchanged.
 
On the o=
ther hand, if the giver of knowledge is a jeevanmukta without an individual=
ized consciousness, whose kaarana sareera has been completely burnt, then t=
he kaarmik debt of the person receiving knowledge is formed with the univer=
se and not with a single soul.
 
Do not worry much about the debt to me or =
other givers of knowledge who just put something out on the internet for th=
ousands to benefit from. The best way to pay back the little debt to me is =
to help others. Share your knowledge with others selflessly and without pri=
de. Help some people with the knowledge. I, for example, get a lot of peopl=
e who want chart readings and I cannot help all of them. I spend more time =
sharing knowledge than giving readings, because hundred people with the kno=
wledge can help more people than I can.
 
Gving Jyotish knowledge and spiri=
tual knowledge to as many people as you can serves another purpose. If you =
were to come back to earth again, there will be a safety net. Even if you a=
re born in a country/family where there is no exposure to such knowledge, N=
ature will send someone to you and put you on the right track. Your current=
 karmas become blessings in a future life. Create a huge safety net of bles=
sings!
 
We incur many debts to many people while on earth. Counting all of=
 them, accounting for them and planning in such a way that one is debt free=
 is nearly impossible. The best option is to be selfless, avoid pride, be h=
appy with what one has, help as many as possible and humbly keep rememberin=
g every now and then that the Lord is the real doer of all actions.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
BTW, one request to those who value my words: Never sell d=
ivine knowledge. Divine knowledge is a brahminical thing and selling is a v=
aisya trait. Do not mix them. Selling spiritual knowledge or Jyotish knowle=
dge is one of the terrible karmas. If anybody who received such knowledge f=
rom me is selling it, I too will get a small part of the bad karma, for tea=
ching to an unworthy person. I am taking a calculated risk by putting Jyoti=
sh/spiritual knowledge on internet where I do not even see/know most of the=
 receivers. If you do not sell or otherwise abuse that knowledge, you will =
be helping me and, of course, helping yourself even more.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

        Namaskaram Narasimha


        This is my firs=
t email to you. I am an intermediate learner of astrology. I learnt my init=
ial 
        basics of astrology from my grand father/father and books by B=
V Raman. I beleive my learning  was taken to the next level after listening=
 to some of the audio recordings posted on your/your astrology students web=
site.  I thank you and your students from the bottom of my heart for provid=
ing me an opportunity to learn astrology.


        I am keenly interested =
in spirituality as well and follow some of your posting on various 
       =
 yahoogroups. I have observed that you dwell upon karmic debt in some of th=
e postings and hence my query to you. The query's are -


        1) I have=
 benefited from using Jhora (free software) and learnt astrology by listeni=
ng to your
        free audio recordings of astrology classes. Does this cr=
eate a karmic debt towards you? 
        If yes, what  should I do to relie=
ve myself of this debt and also learn astrology from your recordings /usage=
 of Jhora.


        2) On a broader level, I use a multiple free software =
programmes and have also benefitted by listening to free lectures on variou=
s topics (Science, Math, Finance, Astrology, spirituality,Vedic rituals etc=
) available on the internet. Is such usage of tools/software / learning of =
knowledge karmic debt free. If not what should one do.


        I would ap=
preciate if you could answer this query of mine when you have time. I have =
written directly to you and not posted this on the group as I would like to=
 remain anonymous to the group as of now. 


        Kind Regards
        <=
