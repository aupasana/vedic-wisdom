Namaste,

I'll share few things if it can help. I am performing Homam in Ki=
tchen of my rented flat. It has a 'Hood' above cooking range area. and a sm=
all Exhaust fan as well.

Kitchen is fitted with 'Heat cum Gas Detector'. I=
 believe that Homa fire will not be stronger then heavy cooking. One more a=
dvantage is there when you seat on the floor of the kitchen for doing Homam=
. The fire in Homa kunda will be farther away from the Heat detector.

I ke=
ep Exhaust fan On during the entire homa session. start hood only when the =
fire extinguishes and more smoke start coming out. I also experimented once=
 by keeping Exhaust Fan off (Hood also off) and that too was also safe. The=
 Fire alarm did not trigger.

In your case, if you have a 'Hood' and Exhaus=
t fan arrangement then it would be quite safer to do the homa in the kitche=
n sitting on the floor.

If you have a `smoke detector' (Which is generally=
 not the case in kitchen) then you may think of covering it with some plast=
ic bag or such things during homam.

Hipe this helps.

Best Regards,

Utpal=
