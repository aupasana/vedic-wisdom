Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: DHARMA OF BRAHMIN---2

=A0 
Disassociati=
ng from lowercast people ...
If my understanding is correct, there is lower=
cast. There are 4 casts.
Brahmana - The knowledge seekers and knowledge pre=
achers
Kshatriya - The protectors
Vaisya - Business
Sudra - The laborers

N=
one of these were talked as lowercast people.

Untouchability is not advoca=
ted by our Rshis!
We ready commenteries written in English and make our jud=
gements.
I am not sure of the original verses (and I am not that qualified =
to interpret them even if I knew them), but, Manu may have meant, a Brahmin=
 who associates with other cast people (here association is not merely by t=
ouching or talking with them but doing what they do and behave like them) m=
ay not be fit to be called a brahmin.

How ever, I see exceptions ever for =
this. Parasuram did behave like a kshatriya. How ever, we still consider to=
 be a great brahmin.

Best regards,
Vijay
