Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
If you are asking specifically about Bulle Shah, he was=
 a Sufi saint of the 15th Century in area of modern Pakisthan. As you can w=
ell understand from his poetry, his realization was quite different from tr=
aditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his=
 time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.
=C2=A0
Most people consider Sufi=
sm or Sufiana=C2=A0to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is different. =
In most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=
=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that their personal r=
ealization was quite different from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of =
the Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of th=
ese areas, specially Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to pr=
otect their philosophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Othe=
rwise they would have faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self p=
reservation which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading =
a more sublime path - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths a=
nd the Koran proper.
=C2=A0
For example Rumi talks a about something simila=
r to=C2=A0reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does t=
alk about communion with God:
=C2=A0
I searched for God among the Christian=
s and on the Cross and therein I found Him not.
I went into the ancient tem=
ples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.
I entered the mountain cave of=
 Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.
With set purpose=
 I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only 'anqa's habit=
ation.
Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young;=
 God was not there even.
Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ib=
n Sina but found Him not within his range.
I fared then to the scene of the=
 Prophet's experience of a great divine manifestation only a "two bow-lengt=
hs' distance from him" but God was not there even in that exalted court.
Fi=
nally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.=

=C2=A0
Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. =
The creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is K=
ufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my in=
terpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Isl=
amic garb. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The person who changed the life of Rumi was also =
another Sufi called=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular l=
egend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One d=
ay the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went t=
o a dead body and said, "In the name of Allah, wake up!". But nothing happe=
ned. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, "In my=
 name, wake up!" and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him =
for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah=
 as per true Islam - and executed him.
=C2=A0
Same was with case with Mansu=
r-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means=
 I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional =
Islam. 
=C2=A0
Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaa=
lis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lo=
rd Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.
=C2=A0
Generally, except for th=
e famous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufi=
s saint. 
=C2=A0
Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective int=
erpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled=
. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not=
 blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you i=
n no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God comm=
union is unacceptable to Islam. I won't digress into my views of what ails =
Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and =
authentic version of Islam is to be followed.
=C2=A0
BTW, Sufi ideas are qu=
ite famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual hig=
her middle class. But like most things under the sun, they hardly know anyt=
hing about anything.

 their sufi style.

Warm Regards,
