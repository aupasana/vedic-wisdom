Dear Sir,
In your last mail regarding invoking you have said that we have t=
o invoke deity in fire.=C2=A0A foolish question I am asking. How can we inv=
ite God in fire? If the meaning is that the deity himself is accepting=C2=
=A0Ahutis in the form of Agni then it is convinced. God can come in any for=
m so if he himself is Agni while Homam it is ok. Kindly clarify sir.

Namaste,

(1) When you invoke the presence of a=
 deity like Ganesha or Krishna or 
Lakshmi or Durga or Vishnu or Shani or S=
hiva in a fire, it is one thing. 
When you invoke the presence of manes (de=
parted souls) in a water pot, it is 
a different thing. The manes who are i=
nvoked in pitri tarpana have some 
strong desires. Their ethereal bodies ha=
ve more restrictions than deities. 
To make it a bit easier for them to com=
e and leave, standard rules involve 
some place restrictions.

(2) I person=
ally do it also for the seven rishis of my gotra. You can add 
the 1/3/7 ri=
shis of your gotra if you know them. There is no need to do more 
times in =
one sitting.

(3) Yes, it is ok. Durva (sacred grass used for purification)=
 can be reused. 
Water can be thrown away at the base of a tree or a plant.=


(4) Only for pitri tarpana.

(5) Yes. If a deity has a desire, you are do=
ing your part in fulfilling it. 
Every embodied being (embodied in gross an=
d ethereal matter) has desires and 
stuck in maya to some extent or the oth=
er. You fulfil your duty towards them 
and repay your debt to them by offer=
ing tarpana to satisfy their desires.

Best regards,
Narasimha
