Namaste

The region around Ujjain is considered the heart of spiritaul=
 india.
A lot of Mahatmaas in Sookma Sareer stay in that Malwa Region and 
=
river Chambal.

Please pardon my spellings.

Amongst the famous Harisiddhi =
Mata Temple one of the Shakti Peets and 
ShivLinga Temples. Ujjain is also =
famous for Raja Bharathat Hari cave.
Raja Barathari is considered as one of=
 the 9 Naths from the Nath 
Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and th=
en he went south to
Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop =
of blood from 
Sati when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas t=
oo. And 
in the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lot=
 of 
great Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there, 
sta=
rting with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and then
Sheelna=
th Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th 
century. Over an=
d above the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj 
Dhuni Sanstan and also S=
wami VishnuTirth Maharaj's Ashram located in 
the valley of the hill where =
Mother Chamunda temple is situated.

Mother in this temple manifested many =
times and gave guidance and 
darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure =
there are others who 
benefited too.

They all stayed at the Temple in deva=
s. It is said even today many 
Mahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Cham=
unda Devi on a regular 
basis.

Best Regards
Mitesh
