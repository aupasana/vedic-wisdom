Every one aspires for a satisfied, cheerful, p=

life. But only a few seem to have it=E2=80=A6. Mo=
reover, most people are often
found complaining and suffering from varietie=
s of tensions, fears,
quarrels, jealousy, scorn, loneliness, infirmities, s=
carcities,
diseases, etc. It is said that =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cwhere there is=

without a cause; goals or ends can=
=E2=80=99t be achieved without appropriate
means. A wish alone remains only=
 a dreamy desire unless backed by
zealous and prudent efforts. 


For every=
 worthwhile goal there are some principles and some
disciplines that define=
 the optimal path to reach it. Every objective
has some specific prerequisi=
tes to be met, certain methods to be
followed to accomplish it. Half-hearte=

approaches prove to be futile and bring irrit=
ation, depression and
despair in return. Those dying to get a sky-flower ha=

life-long in vain. Their eyesight may freeze in staring to have =
a look
at it but they won=E2=80=99t get even a glimpse of this =E2=80=98mir=
age=E2=80=99 in reality.
Just feeling thirsty and crying for water does not=
 pour the drops of
water in our mouth.



Man burns and ruins himself in th=
e fire of unending cravings. His
dire desire for fulfillment always remains=
 unfulfilled. We want to be
happy but often find that the circumstances of =
life pull us back into
the mire of discontent, desperation and worries. Can=
=E2=80=99t we ever come out
of this vicious cycle? Is the aspiration for ha=
ppiness impossible to be
met? No! It can and should be fulfilled if pursued=
 rightly. But, How?
Let us look at the basic principles and the methods tow=
ards achieving
this goal. 


What is happiness? It is an emanation of inner=
 harmony and peace
reflected in a pure heart. What is sorrow? It is an outc=
ome of
infirmity, an image of ignorance. =C3=82nanda (bliss) is a divine at=
tribute.
The eternal complementarity of Shiva and Shakti, Krishna and Radha=
, Ram
and Sita, Vishnu and Lakshmi, Purusha and Prakrati described in the
V=
edic scriptures is absolute. So is the pair of ananda and anandamayi
shakti=
. 


Life-force cannot express itself without the physical body. The
Suprem=
e Creator would also remain =E2=80=98non-existent=E2=80=99 without its expr=
ession
in the creation and manifestation of Nature. We would not have been
=
able to conceptualize or realize the presence of God without having the
fac=
ulties of thoughts and emotions=E2=80=A6. 


The roots of unalloyed joy als=
o lie in the feel of art and culture.
Every expression, every entity, every=
 feeling has a basis, a nature of
its existence. The same is true of happin=
ess. The Upanishads describe
its source of expression as the vigour and rad=
iance of the (inner and
external) mind and the body: =E2=80=9CNayamatma Bal=
ahinena Labhyah=E2=80=9D; the weak
(emotionally, mentally, or physically) a=
nd ignorant ones cannot get the
delight of the soul, the experience of anan=
da. 


The Vedic Shrutis state =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9CBalamupasva=E2=80=9D: Wor=
ship
your bala =E2=80=93 strength, courage, inner power. The physically wea=
k,
coward, ignorant, lethargic and dull persons also miss the real thrills
=
of life. What to speak of happiness, even sustaining the normal life
itself=
 is too difficult for them. No one except the vigorous,
courageous, awakene=
d ones can attain and retain true happiness.



It should be noted that the=
 words =E2=80=9Cshakti=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cbala=E2=80=9D used here,
don=
=E2=80=99t denote only their literal meanings (power and vigor). Rather,
th=
ese refer to the grand majesty of human life, which is described in
the scr=
iptures to be expressed in seven faculties. The grand majesty
(maha bala) l=
ies in the harmonious combination of all these seven
facets of its expressi=
on. As the proper functioning of the human body
and operations of human lif=
e pertain mainly to the ten senses and the
mind, so does the sublime spring=
 of maha bala flowing through these
seven streams of power. If there were a=
ny impurity, shortcoming or
blockage in any one of these attributes, it wou=
ld, to that extent,
lessen or deform the total bala too. 


The seven attri=
butes for the expression of (maha)bala are =E2=80=93 (i)
Art: graceful arti=
stic mode of doing things, civilized etiquette,
cultured behavior, etc fall=
 under the art of living along with the
sense of appreciation for creativit=
y; (ii) Health: Mental and physical
health; energy, enthusiasm, tolerance, =
industriousness, vitality of
sense organs and alertness of mind;(iii) Knowl=
edge: Reading-writing,
essential information of use on the physical, mental=
, domestic,
economical, social, religious, political, geographical, interna=
tional
topics; rational thinking, sound reasoning, wisdom, etc are included=

here; (iv) Wealth: Income or resources to enable smooth transaction of
the=
 essential personal and familial duties through honest means; (v)
Prestige:=
 Respect, faith, cooperation, affection and benevolence of the
relatives, f=
riends and social acquaintances; (vi) Friendship:
Association and support o=
f the friends having integrity of character
and caring concern; (vii) Menta=
l Strength: Courage, valour, generosity,
compassion, feelings of service an=
d sacrifice, self-respect,
responsibility, inner confidence.



These seven=
 sources of inner strength are the key instruments for
achieving fulfillmen=
t and success in any domain of life. Human life
devoid of these powers is h=
elpless and insignificant like those of the
tiny insects. Only those, who p=
ossess this treasure of bala can boldly
face the ups and downs of the world=
ly life and steadily cross the ocean
of sorrows, adversities and ever new c=
hallenges. Perennial happiness is
a boon of these seven attributes of the =
=E2=80=98God=E2=80=99 named =E2=80=9Cmahabala=E2=80=9D. Success
crowns thos=
e endowed with the radiance of vigor, prudence, courage,
integrity, assidui=
ty, benevolence and majesty of spirit. Those lacking
in bala face failures =
and being unable to fight the Nature=E2=80=99s law of
=E2=80=98survival of =
the fittest=E2=80=99 are, sooner or later, cast away in the
=E2=80=98strugg=
le for existence=E2=80=99=E2=80=A6. 


Therefore, dear readers of =E2=80=9C=
Akhand Jyoti,=E2=80=9D arise and start
cultivating unalloyed happiness in y=
our life. The only way to do it is
to generate power from within. Be strong=
; only then you will be able to
cross the turbulent and turgid streams of a=
gonies and adversities. Also
remember that happiness and progress are not u=
nilateral; neither can
these be sustained in isolation. If you alone are st=
out, intelligent,
resourceful and satisfied but others around you remain do=
wntrodden,
weak and ignorant, how will you be happy? How will you digest an=
d enjoy
lavish food if you try eating it while sitting amongst those starvi=
ng
to eat even a meal of coarse grains and those dying from hunger=E2=80=A6=
?
Attempting to do so will be rather cruel on your part. The cry of their
s=
ufferings, their jealousy, their oppression would also have a negative
effe=
ct on your selfish attempts of =E2=80=98enjoyment=E2=80=99. The real taste =
and joy
of food appears when you eat it in a cheerful mood with your friend=
s or
family members=E2=80=A6. A healthy person cannot remain healthy for lo=
ng if he
is to live with the patients of cholera, plague, tuberculosis or o=
ther
contagious diseases. Likewise, the strength, affluence and abilities o=
f
a person cannot make him truly happy and calm if the people around him
ar=
e plunged in the filth of infirmities, scarcities and agonies. 


Know this=
, all aspirants for happiness! And therefore pursue the
motto of =E2=80=9Cl=
ive and let live=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cyou rise and uplift the oth=
ers too,=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9Cbe happy and make others happy=E2=80=9D=E2=80=A6=
. Sprinkle the shower of your
strength, talents, resources and joy upon oth=
ers as well=E2=80=A6. =E2=80=9CPower and
Service=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CCapabil=
ities and Altruism=E2=80=9D together should be the aim of
your life if you =
really seek for lasting delight and progress in your
life. This is the idea=
l of yoga. Literal meaning of =E2=80=9Cyoga=E2=80=9D is
combination of two =
things.You =E2=80=93 the sadhakas of yoga, the seekers of
supreme enlighten=
ment, should first recognize the key to accomplishment
of yoga-sadhana; it =
is hidden in the two-fold objectives of =E2=80=9Cknowledge
and compassion=
=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cpossession and generosity=E2=80=9D.



You should combi=
ne your selfishness with selflessness, cravings
with satisfaction. Your bod=
y finds joy in comforts but your soul always
seeks inner peace. The body ne=
eds vigor, the soul needs soothing
feelings of compassion and loving kindne=
ss. Selfishness is desired by
the body, by the worldly self, while altruist=
ic pursuits satisfy the
inner self, the soul. Try to integrate the two. Thi=
s yoga will enrich your life with enormous joy and light.  This will bestow=
 true happiness upon you.



A cart has two wheels. Our body also stands an=
d moves on two legs.
Clapping becomes possible with the active participatio=
n of both the
hands. Man and woman both together make a complete human. The=
 grand
chariot of happiness in our life also has two august wheels, two gol=
den
pillars, two marvellous horses =E2=80=93 one is =E2=80=9Cbala=E2=80=9D =
and the other is =E2=80=9Cseva=E2=80=9D
(compassionate altruistic service).=
 Cultivate and harvest your bala and
also employ it in seva. Connection of =
the powerful poles of negative
and positive charges generates a strong curr=
ent of electricity. The
commingling of the grand sources of potentials and =
social-service
similarly produces the nectar of unalloyed happiness=E2=80=
=A6. One experiences
immense delight, enchantment and enlightened empowerme=
nt through heart
after adopting this yoga in life. 



Consider yourself as=
 a soldier of the savior army of the Almighty,
which has descended on the e=
arth to generate and expand all round
happiness in this world. =E2=80=9CRis=
e and Uplift=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CBe Happy and Make Others
Happy=E2=80=9D sho=
uld be your theme songs in your march forward towards the
goal of universal=
 happiness, harmony and peace. Following these
sincerely in every dimension=
 of life is true devotion. God is pleased
with such devotees. HE looks afte=
r their wellbeing and bestows such
devotees with divine grace.
