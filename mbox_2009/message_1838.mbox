Namaste Shankarji,

Good Luck! I hope you are able to perform it regularly.=


1. I would suggest you to perform the homam first and then perform the Ga=
yatri. However, I do not have any scriptures to back it. Please talk to you=
r local priest, he may be able to provide vaidiki reasons for it.

2. You c=
an do it just like the procedure given for Chandi Homam, just replace the p=
rocedure for Chandi to that of Lakshmi. The details are given in the Chandi=
 Homam manual.

3. In my opinion any kind of material other than wood or co=
pra would not be suitable for homam. Moreover, wood tends to produce more s=
moke, and especially if you live in an apartment, this may not really be fe=
asible. Copra, in my personal experience is an excellent material.

Hope th=
is helps.
Narayan
