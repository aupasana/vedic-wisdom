In this brand new Youtube video, Sri Acharyaji speaks on the Spiritual
Art =
of Victory at the Omaha Satsangha.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DFF9kM-=
nTgic

In any of life's endeavors, the spiritual approach to victory is the=

most empowering kind of victory. The ideal victory is accomplished as
a se=
rvice to God rather than out of ego. This is true in any kind of
competitio=
n that is performed as a spiritual meditation, whether it is
in the office,=
 on the playing field, or in the battlefield. Everyday
life can be spiritua=
lized in this manner for students, soldiers,
athletes, and even office work=
ers. This is what it means to perform
Karma Yoga. Selfless spiritual servic=
e for God with devotion (bhakti)
is the very highest service that we can pe=
rform.
