Namaste,

Pradakshinam (going around the homa kundam) is not necessary.

Doing homam in a one-side open wood burning fireplace is perfectly 
acceptable and many priests do that way in US. I personally have a custom 
built 4-side open 2 ft x 2 ft x 1ft deep homa kundam with a chimney going 
up, supported by 4 pillars on 4 sides. I do homam in it using wood and with 
big fire. The video was not shot using that set up, as I wanted to 
demonstrate a setup that would work for most people.

Several people in US are doing without using wood and using only dry coconut 
pieces. That minimizes smoke and there is considerable smoke only at the 
end. Before smoke comes at the end, they move the homa kundam and put it 
under an exhaust fan in kitchen or outside. That minimizes the smoke.

If you have a wood burning fireplace, I suggest placing a copper homa kundam 
inside the fireplace and doing homam in it.

Modakas are perfectly acceptable in Ganapathi homam if one has fire big 
enough to completely burn them. If one is doing homam with a few dry coconut 
pieces, one cannot burn modakas. Homam can be performed before or after 
sunrise on any day. But the one hour before and after sunrise is a really 
really good time for homam.

Important thing is that you should have faith and devotion. Outside of the 
homam time, keep watching your thoughts and actions, identify egoistic 
motives behind them and suppress the egoistic instincts. Homam will aid in 
that process and that process will help you do a better homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
