A SA=
NNYASIN dwelt by the side of a temple.There was the house of a harlot in fr=
ont. Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute's house, th=
e sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: "You are a gr=
eat sinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot herea=
fter."=A0<br>


<br>The poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her=
 misdeeds, and with genuine inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching =
forgiveness. But as prostitution was her profession,she could not easily ad=
opt any other means of earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh s=
inned, she always reproached herself with greater contrition of heart and p=
rayed to God more and, more for forgiveness.=A0<br>


<br>The sannyasin saw=
 that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon her, and thought, &=
quot;Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the course of her=
=A0life." And from that day forward, whenever any person entered the h=
ouse of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble aside=
,and in course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.<br>


<br>One day=
 the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: "Woman, d=
on't=A0you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission=
 of the deadly sin you have been indulging in since. I advised you last to =
desist from the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil deeds=
!" The poor wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation o=
f her sins, and she prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness, inw=
ardly repeating, "Lord, wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life =
that I am leading?" The prayer was heard, and on that very day the ang=
el of death passed by her house, and she ceased to exist in this world. By =
the strange will of God, the sannyasin also died on the same day.<br>


<br=
>The messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body=
 of the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers o=
f Yama bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether=
 world. The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud:=
 "Is this the subtle justice of=A0God? I passed all my life in ascetic=
ism and poverty,and I am carried to hell, while that prostitute,whose life =
was a whole record of sin, is going to Heaven!"=A0<br>


<br>Hearing t=
his, the messengers of Vishnu said: "The decrees of God are always jus=
