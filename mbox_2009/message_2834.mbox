Anti-Dharmic Caste Bigotry Must End
A Message from Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya

Caste discrimination has been one of the most evil and=
 damaging activities ever to be falsely associated with the beautiful relig=
ion of Sanatana Dharma.  The mistaken notion that a person is born with a g=
enetically-inherited "caste" is an inherently anti-Dharmic, anti-Hindu, and=
 anti-human fallacy that is not supported by the scriptures of Sanatana Dha=
rma, and that has repeatedly led to Sanatana Dharma being wrongly accused o=
f being backward and unjust.  Sanatana Dharma is neither.

If we, as Hindus=
, refuse to vociferously denounce such ludicrous and anti-Dharmic theories =
as the caste system within our own ranks, then we have lost all rights to d=
enounce those anti-Hindu bigots who, in turn, wish to tarnish our religion =
with unfounded stereotypes.  If we support bigotry against our very own peo=
ple, then we must fully expect to become the victims of bigotry ourselves. =
 Such is the nature of karma.  If we wish to be treated justly, then we mus=
t treat others with justice.  Let us be worthy of our Dharmic heritage and =
end all caste-based bigotry against our fellow Hindus now.

I would urge an=
yone who considers themselves to be Hindu, who has any modicum of pride in =
our religion, or who cares in any way about preserving Sanatana Dharma to d=
enounce the anti-Hindu caste system once and for all, and to support the ba=
nning of all caste discrimination globally.

UN Set to Treat Caste as Human Rights Violati=
on
Times of India
Manoj Mitta, TNN 28 September 2009, 06:10am IST

-violation/articleshow/5063457.cms

NEW DELHI: If the recent genome study d=
enying the Aryan-Dravidian divide has established the antiquity of caste se=
gregations in marriage, the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council =
in Geneva looks set to recognize caste-based discrimination as a human righ=
ts violation. This, despite India's opposition and following Nepal's breaki=
ng ranks on the culturally sensitive issue.

Nepal has emerged as the first=
 country from South Asia -- the region where untouchability has been tradit=
ionally practiced -- to declare support for the draft principles and guidel=
ines published by UNHRC four months ago for ``effective elimination of disc=
rimination based on work and descent'' -- the UN terminology for caste ineq=
uities.

In a side-event to the session on September 16, Nepalese minister =
Jeet Bahadur Darjee Gautam said his county welcomed the idea mooted by the =
UNHRC document to involve ``regional and international mechanism, the UN an=
d its organs'' to complement national efforts to combat caste discriminatio=
n. This is radically different from India's stated aversion to the internat=
ionalization of the caste problem.

Much to India's embarrassment, Nepal's =
statement evoked an immediate endorsement from the office of the UN high co=
mmissioner for human rights, Navanethem Pillay, a South African Tamil. Besi=
des calling Nepal's support ``a significant step by a country grappling wit=
h this entrenched problem itself'', Pillay's office said it would ``like to=
 encourage other states to follow this commendable example''.

The referenc=
e to India was unmistakable especially since Pillay had pressed the issue d=
uring her visit to New Delhi in March. Pillay not only asked India to addre=
ss ``its own challenges nationally, but show leadership in combating caste-=
based discrimination globally''. The granddaughter of an indentured laboure=
r taken to South Africa from a village near Madurai, Pillay recalled that i=
n 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had compared untouchability to aparth=
eid.

Adding to India's discomfiture, Sweden, in its capacity as the presid=
ent of the Europeon Union, said, ``caste-based discrimination and other for=
ms of discrimination based on work and descent is an important priority for=
 EU''. If this issue continues to gather momentum, UNHRC may in a future se=
ssion adopt the draft principles and guidelines and, to impart greater lega=
l force, send them for adoption to the UN General Assembly.

The draft prin=
ciples specifically cited caste as one of the grounds on which more than 20=
0 million people in the world suffer discrimination. ``This type of discrim=
ination is typically associated with the notion of purity and pollution and=
 practices of untouchability, and is deeply rooted in societies and culture=
s where this discrimination is practiced,'' it said.

Though India succeede=
d in its efforts to keep caste out of the resolution adopted by the 2001 Du=
rban conference on racism, the issue has since re-emerged in a different gu=
ise, without getting drawn into the debate over where caste and race are an=
alogous.
