Dear Narasimha, pranaams

"There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I =
was taken to by a priest
who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tam=
il Nadu before we did the
Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never he=
ard of that temple before
and it seemed like a small temple. The name of th=
e form of the divine
Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I d=
id not understand it.
I do not even remember the name now. But, when I clos=
ed my eyes and started
meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I wa=
s dazzled by a vision of
a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays =
like Sun. I felt that
there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I=
 do not remember the
name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple w=
ithout roof over the
goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a f=
ew times, but the roof
came down in a fire accident each time and they fina=
lly decided that the
goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent on=
ly 5 min and left in a
hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone =
from Tamil Nadu probably
knows the name of the temple and goddess."

The te=
mple that you refer to is in Tiruchirappalli and is known as
Vek-Kali-Amman=
 temple. By a coincidence, I was talking to my wife yesterday
about this te=
mple where the sanctum sanctorum is without a roof.

best regards
Hari
