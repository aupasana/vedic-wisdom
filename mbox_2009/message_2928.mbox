Hi All learned members,
=C2=A0
"The work had to be done with that particu=
lar body, and it was done. Even Duryodhana was like that. Not that he was n=
ot aware of the correctness or otherwise of what he was doing."
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
The statement above is interesting.=C2=A0 
I've always learnt/heard tha=
t Duryodhana is a "Mana-Dhani" and full of ahamkara, always forcing=C2=A0fo=
r his=C2=A0wishful thoughts.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
If Duryodhana had a sense of wha=
t is right and what is wrong and is being pushed by a force on him to perfo=
rm actions, is there any message hidden in the process?
=C2=A0
Thanks

29th April, 1948

This morning, at about 9 o=E2=80=99clock, a lawyer from=
 Rayalaseema who came here yesterday, sat near Bhagavan=E2=80=99s couch and=
 asked, =E2=80=9CSwami, in the Gita, Lord Krishna first said that everythin=
g is embraced in the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 only, and one=E2=80=99s self p=
lays no role. Subsequently, He says that He Himself is the =E2=80=98doer=E2=
=80=99, the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 and the =E2=80=98deed=E2=80=99 (karta, =
karma and karyam); though =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma) is the most impor=
tant of the three, it is ineffectual by itself (jadam).=C2=A0If this is so,=
 then everything depends upon the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, who is Ishwara. W=
hy when He first created =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma), did He create dif=
ferent karmas for different people? It is said that afterwards everyone is =
made to function according to his karma. How did this difference come about=
 in the very beginning? How did it arise?=C2=A0Not only that, if everything=
 is left to the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 and to the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99 w=
ho is Ishwara, where does personal effort (purushakaram) come in? If there =
is
 no personal effort, why is it said that we ourselves must attain Realiz=
ation? What does it mean?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan said,=E2=80=9CWho is it that i=
s asking? To whom has this doubt arisen? Why has it arisen? First think tha=
t over and find out.=E2=80=9D

The devotee: =E2=80=9CSwami, I am only enqui=
ring why Lord Krishna said that.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CThat is what =
I am referring to. What exactly did Lord Krishna tell Arjuna? He told him, =
the deed will get done according to the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99. I am the =
=E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99 watching the whole thing from above. Why do you worr=
y? It is your body which does the killing of your relatives. Are you the bo=
dy?

No! Why then this bondage for you?=C2=A0Renounce the idea, He said. Th=
is means that He asks Arjuna to do the thing but to give up the feeling tha=
t it is he that is doing it. That is personal effort.=C2=A0

The feeling th=
at one is, or is not, the body, comes from one=E2=80=99s own ignorance. One=
 only has to give up that feeling; that which one has, one must oneself rej=
ect. Who=C2=A0else can do it? If by personal effort that bondage is removed=
,action, under the orders of the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, Ishwara, goes on o=
f its own accord.=C2=A0

Every one has his work allotted to him and he will=
 do it automatically. Why should one worry? Arjuna, when he felt that it wa=
s not proper to kill his relatives, was only told to give up the feeling th=
at he was the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, yet it was Arjuna himself who ultimat=
ely fought.By listening to the Gita, he lost the feeling of being the =E2=
=80=98doer=E2=80=99 and the doubt he had had was no longer there.=C2=A0

Th=
e work had to be done with that particular body, and it was done. Even Dury=
odhana was like that. Not that he was not aware of the correctness or other=
wise of what he was doing. He knew that what he was doing was not right, bu=
t some force was leading him on to that work. What could he do? That work h=
ad to be done in that way by that body, and it was done. He is reported to =
have said so at the time of his death. Hence it is clear that some Force is=
 making all people to do things. Getting rid of the feeling that =E2=80=98I=
 myself am doing=E2=80=99 is personal effort (purushakaram) . All spiritual=
 practices (sadhanas) are towards that end.=E2=80=9D

Another devotee: =E2=
=80=9CThat is all right. For this karma there must be a beginning, but how =
it began, no one has mentioned.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CYes, but it is=
 the same thing. If you are asked =E2=80=98how did you get this?=E2=80=99 y=
ou say you have got it by =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma). How were you bor=
n? By =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma) that is all that could be said. If, h=
owever, you ask how was this karma born, you are told you should not ask su=
ch questions.=C2=A0

This is known as the Law of the seed and the tree (bij=
a ankura nyayam). The tree is born of the seed; again from the tree a seed =
is born. Where is the origin of that seed? That is a question which you are=
 told is not to be asked. What can we say to that? That is why I always ask=
 people to find out first how they were born and where they were born.=E2=
=80=9D

O Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all beings who are mounte=
d upon the automation of this body, causing them by His illusive power to s=
pin round according to their actions.

-- Gita XVIII: 61

Seek refuge in Hi=
m alone, with all your being, O Arjuna! Through His grace, you shall obtain=
 supreme peace and the eternal abode.
