Namaste,

I made a boo boo. :-(

Ravi pointed out to me that Hanuman homam manual, which I asked you to use 
as a template, is not uploaded yet. Because we worked on it a couple of 
weeks back, I was thinking it is uploaded. Ravi is right and we are yet to 
finalize and upload it.

Use Vishnu homam as the template. Change the following key words (in ITrans 
notation):

viShNuH or mahaaviShNuH to savitaa
viShnoH or mahaaviShNoH to savituH
viShNum or mahaaviShNum to savitaaram
viShNave or mahaaviShNave to savitre
viShNu or mahaaviShNu to savitR^i

Best regards,
Narasimha
