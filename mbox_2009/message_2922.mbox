Shri Devbrato Sarkar,
still i have not got a guru to guide me
i read and browse through the internet
if you visit http://www.swamij.com/ they give scientific explanation for meditation , yog nithra etc and i like that
Shri Ravishankarji has written a number of books and I read one book and I know he is a wonderful man
I have not got scientific explanation about Sudarsana kriya as through internet i find in countries outside india people have to sign a nda or similar thing
Iam a scientist in the spiritual field with out a proper guide
a chemical scientist will on some occassion have to spill acid by  mistake( swami Vivekanada quotes somewhere)
this happened to me due to the strange powers which i experimented by meditation
I do lot of mistakes but I learn from mistakes
had i had a guru i could have taken a short cut 
I have recommeneded AOL to many people 
still iam wondering how sudarsana kriya works
One day may be i will meet Shri Ravishankarji (a very busy saint)
and clear my doubt
thanks

Namaste Mahalakshmiji,

Faith & Trust makes a person, body system or anything for that matter makes us to move forward. It makes us receptive & optimistic so that we as humans can benefit from it. Its more like a positive feeling which gives us happiness. Its like pouring tea in an empty cup.

Whereas Skepticism & Distrust are the ante to the above which puts you & your system into a defensive mechanism, thereby leading to pessimism and disbelief. Its like pouring tea in a cup which is already filled with tea, the more you pour in the cup it spills over as there is no more space in the cup. Since our mind is already filled with skepticism & disbelief it is not allowing new matters to get into our mind. Hence you do things as someone told you to do and not that you wanted to do something out of your own interest.

I have great respect to the person Shri Ravishankarji, though I have not done the AOL. I was told that the system they teach really helps the person - forget about that group of people which makes money out of such activities. Lets concentrate on what we want to learn and leave the rest. 

It reminds me of PVRji's (author of JHora software) message -  "when people make money using his software brings bad karma to him as his software is absolutely free to everyone who want to learn / use it ". 

So Lakshmiji, please do the Hata yoga sincerely with an open mind and let the cup be empty so that all the info's you can grab it and use it for your benefit. Once you have completed it why not share your experience with us.

Let GOD bless you and each one of us with a wonderful body & mind.


Jai Maa Kaali, 

Devbrato Sarkar
