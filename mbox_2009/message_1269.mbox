Dear Amitji 
Namaste

The voice is of Shree Maa, a very realized soul, who =
lived for a long 
period of time in the North east India, near Assam.
She d=
id a lot of penance in that north east region.

She lives now in California=
, USA.


She has done Chandi Paath for many thousands of time. She in her 
=
prevoius birth was born along with RamaKrishna Paramhans.

Their books on p=
oojas and chandi paath are one of the best, very 
methodical, correct, and =
a detailed process oriented. I like it very 
much. Good explaination and Tr=
anslation in english.

Their site have a lot of material on chandi paath an=
d many doubts can 
be resolved by reading or searhing their site or even as=
king 
questions to her or swamiji too. They do respond via email.

She has =
a bengali/assamese accent. I think all of us have an accent 
and it is ok.
=

This is the only rendering I knew of, if others have better rendering 
ple=
ase share.

Best Regards
Mitesh
