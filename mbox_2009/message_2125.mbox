 Much appreciated! I'm certain the priest was facing East, however, I'm les=
s certain of the direction in which he threw the darbha (which very well ma=
y have been Southeast as indicated by you).

hat Nirritti's position is Southwest. This is how I understand the 8 Dikpal=
a's directional positions (again my knowledge is limited and clarifications=
 from people like you who have traversed the path much longer than I are al=
ways welcome!):

 Can you confirm if that priest wasn't facing North, in which case the left=
 shoulder would be Southeast or Nirritti direction.
