Namaste Amitji,

Very true. I mentioned name of Shivaji as he was =
having all that 
characteristics required to really create edifice from scr=
atch. he 
possessed tact, shrewdness, maneuvering, velour, organizing abili=
ty, 
flexibility to respect situation, etc... and could create, 
Effectivel=
y, the Hindvi Swarajya during times of total Darkness. 
Shivaji could achie=
ve that because he was mentored by Samarth Ramdas, 
Jija Mata and supported=
 by sooooo many.. Bajiprabhu, Tanaji,Dadoji 
Kondadev, Murarbaji to name fe=
w.

On the contrary, The Great Maharana Pratap, couldn't achieve for us 
wh=
at Shivaji achieved because of the contemporary Traitors in 
Rajputana land=
. Most infamous example is Mansingh. Disputes of 
Egoistic brave Rajput Kin=
gs has cost our motherland so horribly.
Here, it is my personal opinion tha=
t Maharana actually could n't 
succeed in uniting The Rajput kings against =
the great Akabar.

***
as you rightly mentioned, Sikhs must be highly respe=
cted. they have 
given their lives for saving Hindus. if they wouldn't have=
 come 
forward voluntarily, I fear, what would have been left in Punjab are=
a?
and we crack jokes on them. I try my best not to entertain any jokes 
wh=
ich are on Sardarjis.


Arya Samaji movement of Swami Dayaananda Saraswati =
was one noteworthy 
thing happened which was also effective in checking con=
version.
*** 

Finally i mention here that Vedic Sanskruti (Sanaatan Dharam=
a) has 
survived the test of times (Unlike Babylon, Greek culture) because =
of 
Spiritual strength. Spiritualist of all the level has born in this 
lan=
d in plenty every time, known & unknown. Ramdas was there so 
Shivaji came,=
 Thakur, Vivekananda, Sainbaba, Raman Maharshi were 
there so we got Tilak =
maharaj, Sardar, Gandhiji, Subhash chandra, and 
band of people who struggl=
ed for Independence.

lastly, if Sanaatan Dharma people, in the current tim=
es also doesn't 
care and doesn't invest their resources to Convert people =
from other 
faith, if they maintain this one principal steadfastly, lives 
=
spiritual life as much as possible, i am sure, Santan Dharma will 
never ev=
er be finished.

yours 

utpal
