THE CENTER FOR DHARMA STUDIES (CDS)
Omaha's Dharma Ashram with a Global Mis=
sion

http://dharmacentral.com/ashram.php

Be a Friend of Dharma Today!

Si=
nce the very first time that Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharyaji began his teac=
hing mission as the Resident Acharya of the Hindu Temple in Omaha two years=
 ago, he has always mentioned to his students that the Omaha/Iowa area was =
destined to become one of the most important centers of Dharma culture, edu=
cation and practice in the nation.

"Omaha?" many of us thought curiously a=
t the time. Well...

Today, as a direct result of Sri Acharyaji's presence =
in Omaha for the last two years, Omaha finally has a large and thriving Dha=
rma community for the very first time in this area's history, and Sri Achar=
yaji's prediction about the future of Dharma in Omaha is now on the verge o=
f becoming a concrete reality!

By God's grace, and under the qualified gui=
dance of Sri Acharyaji, we will be establishing a large teaching center and=
 ashram in the Omaha area by this Fall that will serve as a one of a kind, =
globally renowned resource facility for the dedicated study and practice of=
 pure and authentic Sanatana Dharma.

Designed to serve both the local Hind=
u community, as well as be a preferred destination for Dharma students from=
 throughout the world, all of Sri Acharyji's classes, satsangs, Hindu Youth=
 Celebration events, and seminars will be shifted from the Hindu Temple of =
Omaha to our new ashram. In addition, the center will host seminars, talks,=
 and workshops by many of the world's leading Dharma teachers; house one of=
 the nation's best Sanatana Dharma libraries; as well as operate a natural =
health facility and school offering such traditional Hindu healing modaliti=
es as Ayurveda and Yoga.

The initial first-phase goal is to purchase a hom=
e in the Midtown area of Omaha. We are currently seeking, at the minimum, a=
 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom building, with a large gathering space on the ground=
 floor. Our capital budget for the purchase and remodeling of the building =
is $200,000, with the immediate goal of raising $50,000 by November 25, 200=
9. Please see the Center for Dharma Studies Business Plan for more details.=
