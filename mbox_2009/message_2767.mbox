PRINCIPLES AND THEIR PERVERSIONS

(H.H. SRI SWAMI SIVANANDAJI MAHARAJ)

The=
 path of the spiritual aspirant verily lies through a bewildering jungle of=
 difficulties and dilemmas of problems and paradoxes. One of such vexing pa=
radoxes is that your mind is both your best friend as also your most bitter=
 enemy. Mind becomes a true friend, only after being gradually trained to b=
e so. Mind begins to be really helpful after the aspirant has progressed su=
fficiently in spiritual Sadhana. Until then it should be regarded as a trou=
blesome and treacherous enemy inside us. It is extremely diplomatic, cunnin=
g and crooked. It is an arch-deceiver. One of the master-strokes of the min=
d's artfulness is to make the aspirant feel and smugly imagine that he know=
s his mind perfectly well and cannot be led away by it and at the same time=
 to delude him totally. The mind has the knack of making the unwary aspiran=
t confidently think himself its master, while it makes a hopeless fool of h=
im. Its deceptions are subtle.

You have heard the saying, "The Devil can q=
uote scriptures for its purpose". Similarly the mind can use a virtue to in=
dulge in a vice. It has an inborn inclination to perversion. It can even ta=
ke the support of a perfectly good principle to seemingly justify the most =
unprincipled sort of action. Unless it is scrutinised dispassionately, its =
tricks are never fully discovered.

Certain of the perversions usually noti=
ceable are described below. This will be valuable to sincere aspirants who =
are eager to study their minds and eliminate defects and shortcomings. Thes=
e are extremely useful tips specially in the working field, for aspirants e=
ngaged in active Seva in the midst of other people.

Sadhaks are told, "Kee=
p up Matri-bhava or Devi-bhava when you move with women." This is a grand p=
rinciple to safeguard your purity and spiritual progress. But this does not=
 tell you, "Move with women." Nor does this advice mean that if you try to =
have this attitude then you may go on freely mixing with the opposite sex w=
ithout any limit or restraint. The mind will ask, "Why not? What if I do? T=
o retreat from their presence is sheer timidity? No fear when you do so wit=
h Devi-bhava!" Beware, O Aspirant, beware of this tendency! Divine Bhava is=
 not a license to throw away all restrictions of the Sadhaka's path. The pe=
rmanent injunction for Sadhakas is to totally eschew all contact with the o=
pposite sex. When unavoidably such contact becomes necessary, then, "Have M=
atri-bhava; have Devi-bhava" etc., are prescribed. Also this is to caution =
the aspirant not to hate women or become a misogynist. Women should be reve=
renced but from a safe distance. Let not Devi-bhava etc., be taken to mean =
that you should be all the time in the midst of them. Watch your mind!

The=
n there is the advice which says, "You may hiss but not bite." This safe co=
unsel was given to a fabulous snake which in a too extreme access of piety =
became so totally docile and harmless that it got severely mal-handled by a=
 set of mischievous urchins. It was given as an example to over-timid house=
holders and people struggling in the very midst of the harsh realities of c=
ompetitive `vyavaharic' life. Here an overdose of `Avanty-brahmin'-like hum=
ility might well make life impossible amidst the Asuric elements abounding =
in the world. Therefore, just an outward show of pugnacity may be countenan=
ced in so far as this does not affect your basic goodness and brotherhood. =
But this policy is not for the spiritual aspirant in the path of Sadhana an=
d Nivritti. Definitely not. Let aspirants take heed of these words. The Sad=
hak is neither to 'bite' nor is he to `hiss' even. This 'hissing' business =
will soon become a part of your nature. You will soon find yourself hissing=
 for everything, at everything, at everyone, in and out of season. This his=
s will include every variety of rudeness ranging from hot argument, sharp r=
etort, curt reply to angry glaring, shouting and abuse. In short of physica=
l violence and fight, every type of verbal brutality will be put into the "=
hissing" category. This will ultimately lead to spiritual ruin. The mind is=
 ever waiting to take advantage of even the least concession shown to it. I=
ts natural tendency is to go downward. O Aspirant, do not bite or even 'his=
s'. Be humble, be sweet, be gentle. Be firm but be soft, polite and courteo=
us. If you wish to 'hiss' then 'hiss' at your own mind. Thrash the ego. Fig=
ht the Shad-ripus. Watch the mind!

Another victim to perversion is the pie=
ce of advice, "Be resolute. Stick to your priniciples. Never budge an inch.=
" The best possible advice to a sincere Sadhaka; but unfortunately often ma=
de the basis for the worst possible trait i.e., obstinacy. This is a Tamasi=
c trait. But the mind will make believe that you are manifesting Atma-bal o=
r a divine determination. This is its work=97to make him cling tightly to h=
is ego. Hence this deception. But the careful aspirant must discern the dif=
ference between Sattvic Nishta and sheer stubbornness. Atma-bal is not a ch=
eap commodity to be got without a great deal of earnest struggle, disciplin=
e and Will-culture. Determined adherence is advocated in respect of truly h=
igh and noble principles and not of self-conceited notions. By all means st=
ick to spiritual Yogic Niyamas but avoid becoming obdurate in nature. Do no=
t be deceived. Watch your mind!

"Speak the Truth always. Be frank." Thus i=
s the Upadesh. This means when you are required to talk then speak only the=
 truth. It does not at all mean that you must go about telling everyone to =
his face what exactly you think of him or her. This is unwarranted behaviou=
r. Under the garb of frankness to give free expression of opinions without =
caring for other peoples' feelings is not `Aarjava' or frankness or straigh=
tforwardness. At the least it is thoughtlessness; at its height it is sheer=
 brutality. It does not bespeak well of an aspirant. The same teacher who t=
ells you "Speak truth; be frank!" also tells you to have "Mita Bhashan, Mad=
hura Bhashan" moderate and sweet speech. Mind can even make you to utilise =
frankness in order to express mild insult. An unpleasant truth is better le=
ft unsaid. If it becomes absolutely necessary and unavoidable then say it s=
weetly and with humility. "Not to hurt and wound others' feelings" is as eq=
ually important as speaking truth. Satyam and Ahimsa must go together. Stud=
y thyself. Watch the mind!

Then there is the truism i.e., "Vairagya is rea=
lly a mental state, mental detachment." The mind takes hold of this definit=
ion to justify a heedless sensual life without self-restraint, or principle=
. The argument will always be, "O! I am not attached to all this. I can ris=
e above it in a moment. I enjoy it as a master. Mentally I am detached." Co=
ntact with Vishyas have toppled down even Tapasvins like Vishwamitra. There=
fore, do not take Vairagya lightly. Culitvate Vairagya diligently. Safeguar=
d your Vairagya carefully. Be vigilant. Watch the mind!

The caution not to=
 go to extremes in Tapasya also gets a like fate. Man's normal nature is se=
nsuous. The mind wants comforts and hates austerity. The indiscriminating a=
spirant conveniently ignores the qualifying adjective "extremes" in the adv=
ice quoted above and views all `Tapasya' with disfavour. The result is to d=
egenerate into luxury, lose even the minimum of Titiksha and become a slave=
 to hundred wants. The warning is against foolish extremes but to a Sadhaka=
 in the early stages a certain degree of austerity is essential for develop=
ment. The mind will suggest so many justifications. It will bring Gita to i=
ts side and show that the Lord condemned Tapas. O aspirant, the Lord condem=
ned 'Tamasic Tapas.' He recommended Sattvic austerity of body, speech and m=
ind. Reflect carefully. Always watch the mind!

"Take care of essentials. D=
o not pay too much attention to non-essentials." The above too serves as a =
handle for the mind to deceive the aspirant. If you have to follow this adv=
ice, first try to understand what is essential and what is non-essential. T=
he idle nature of man is to loath following any sort of `Niyama' and set-li=
nes of Sadhachara. Therefore, everything is dismissed at a stroke as `non-e=
ssential.' Then what remains, God only can say. The only `essential' would =
seem to be to do what the mind likes. The Sadhak must think what a Spiritua=
l instruction really means and then why it is given. Moreover, essentials a=
nd non-essentials vary according to the stage of development of the spiritu=
al aspirant. What may be unnecessary to an aspirant at a later stage may we=
ll be essential to him now. Do not throw away precious grain with the chaff=
. Watch the mind!

Finally the most dangerous deception played by the mind =
is in connection with Sadhana itself. The very Sadhana that is adopted by t=
he aspirant to transfigure and divinise his life is converted into a prop a=
nd a field for the play of ego and senses. It is very difficult to break ou=
t of this ensnaring net without great earnestness and sincere endeavour. It=
 is this vitiation of Sadhana that keeps the Sadhak `stuck', as it were, on=
 the path, arresting progress for years together. For example, youthful Sad=
haks with sweet voice and musical talent naturally take to Kirtan and Bhaja=
n as their Sadhana. Art always attracts admirers. He is in demand at all au=
spicious functions. He gets popular amongst Satsangis. The subtle mind now =
spreads the net. The Kirtan becomes sweeter day by day. New songs and tunes=
 are added to his musical repertory. Without his being aware, the Kirtan ha=
s become a means to attract others to himself and to maintain the popularit=
y. Thus the `Sadhana' becomes double-purposed=97primarily for God's Darshan=
a and side by side for worldly attraction. The result is the extraordinary =
phenomenon of the Sadhak caught in his Sadhana. Instead of Mochana, the qua=
lity of Sadhana becomes Bandhana. Maya is wonderful, indescribable. Her way=
s are mysterious and inscrutable.

Take Nishkama Karma Yoga. Serving and he=
lping others for no return is something unheard of in the purely Vyavaharic=
 world. Naturally the disinterested Sevak is regarded as an exceptional bei=
ng. All doors are open unto him. Many bring their troubles to him, open the=
ir hearts and freely confide even intimate problems. They, of course, take =
it for granted that the spiritual aspirant is perfectly pure in every respe=
ct. Here the Sadhak walks upon the `razor-edge' of life. The mind is the de=
vil. Through the very intimacy of contacts in the Seva field, pleasure cent=
res are created and sensuousness gets scope in this Seva 'Sadhana'. Vanity =
and carnality get catered to and the aspirant appears to take a keen intere=
st in the Nishkama Seva. But a ruthless search of the mind will reveal that=
 the keenness and interest in the Karma Yoga Seva is as much for the sense-=
indulgence to be had in the Seva as for the Seva itself. So the mind destro=
ys the Sadhana.

Aspirants practising Titiksha many a time stick on to the =
Titiksha for similar subconscious reasons. His endurance will earn for him =
a reputation. He will be regarded as extraordinary. So even after the Titik=
sha Sahdana has served its purpose he will keep on with it for continuing t=
he status it has granted him. Another Sadhak will under the idea of being i=
ndifferent towards the body and its needs, neglects to shave even. This wil=
l be quite sincere and bonafide in the beginning. But the long hair and bea=
rd that results out of this 'udaseenata' will prove the instrument for Maya=
 to lay hold of the aspirant. The hair will be found to beautify his appear=
ance. He is loath to part with it. Thus the former "udaseenata" will be rep=
laced by careful combing of the hair, application of oil, peeps into the mi=
rror, dressing to suit, the style of the hair, new mannerisms, etc. Thus in=
 a trice will delusion spring upon you and overpower you like the tiger doe=
s its prey. Likewise Hatha Yogic exercise get misused to sustain gluttony; =
Vajroli is used for Vybhichara and Yoga is made to serve Bhoga. All these p=
erversions arise out of the mischief of the unregenerate mind. Therefore wa=
tch the mind!

The most extraordinary part of all this is that the mind wil=
l not allow you to take the above lessons seriously. It will still say, "O =
you are all right. This is not meant for you. Don't mind all this. Carry on=
 as you are." O aspirant do not listen to it! Non-cooperate with the rogue.=
 Take the lessons to heart.

To know where exactly one stands on the path i=
s very difficult. The tricks of the mind are most subtle. Only constant Vic=
har will keep you alert and safe. Deep introspection alone can reveal a lit=
tle of the mysterious workings. Probe and probe into the mind. Do not be le=
nient to the mind. The mind will try to compromise with you. Relentlessly h=
unt out its hidden motives. Subject yourself to keen self-analysis everyday=
 without fail. Oust all sentiment in this process. Become an intelligent, s=
erious and earnest self-C.I.D. Carry on a ceaseless search and a vigorous e=
nquiry inwardly. Put your mind on the dissecting table of Vichar. Pray for =
the Grace of the Guru who alone can vanquish the mind and enable you to mas=
ter it. Pray to the Lord to illumine your intellect with the light of knowl=
edge. Watch the mind. Watch and pray. Thus alone, through introspection, an=
alysis, discrimination, vigilance and prayer can you understand the subtle =
jugglery of this wonderful thing called 'mind' and transcend its deceptions=
 and tricks.

May the Lord enable you to realise the importance of the disc=
ipline of the mind. May He crown your spiritual life with success and highe=
st attainment!
