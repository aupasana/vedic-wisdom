JAI MAA

Narsimha ji & others

Namaskar

i am sharing one thing, but don't =
want to disturb you.
my native village is in Kurukshetra and there is a wat=
er pond in almost every village the elders told us that you can worship or =
meditate any devta or devi standing in these ponds, your spiritual progress=
 will magnifying by many folds. one day a old village prist also told that =
when the fire homa is not possible due to rain (in our tradition the homa d=
one in open) then you can invoke the deva in water and perform the ahuti in=
 it.

thanks

Namaste Ram ji,
=

Shraaddham is an offering of balls of solid food 
for deceased ancestor=
s on special occasions.
=A0
Pitri tarpana is an offering of water for pitri=
s 
(deceased ancestors who are stuck with some desires) to satisfy them. No=
t so 
long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarpana every=
day, as a 
part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.
=A0
*=A0=A0=

=A0
The thoughts of the minds aro=
und us do have a 
subtle impact on our mind. When too many depressed, sad o=
r frustrated people are 
around you, it will have a negative effect on you.=
 Similarly, when some peaceful 
and blissful=A0people or elevated souls are=
 around you, it will have a 
positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the =
minds around you does have an 
impact on you.
=A0
This is particularly true=
 with respect to the minds 
of people who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts =
with you. When minds of such 
people are in great distress or great excitem=
ent, it has an impact on your 
mind.
=A0
If a deceased ancestor to whom you=
 have a kaarmik 
debt has some strong desires and unable to progress to a h=
igher loka or be 
reborn, his thoughts and desires will have an impact on y=
our mind.
=A0
Thus, we invest our mental energy praying for their 
relief. =
While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, 
pray =
that the ancestor may get an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining 
de=
sires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor's desir=
es 
may be satisfied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By pr=
aying for 
helping an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, by rem=
oving a powerful 
negative influence on=A0your mind and getting rid of some=
 
weaknesses.
=A0
Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri 
tarp=
ana is out of fashion today. However, so many people will benefit 
tremendo=
usly if they do it atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda 
says=
 that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can 
perfor=
m.

=A0
Not long ago, e=
very orthodox Braahmana used to 
perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (=
tarpana) everyday. Rituals use 
external symbols to induce internal changes=
. These two rituals are really 
important and useful rituals.
=A0
A small c=
omparison of homam and tarpana is 
reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup =
archives:
=A0
------------ --------- -----
One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In=
 homam, you are 
calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you ar=
e calling pitris and 
the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to =
all people irrespective of 
whether watery signs/planets are strong or fier=
y signs/planets in their 
horoscope.
=A0
In homam, devatas come in fire and=
 burn your blocking 
karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water=
 and free you from vasanas 
(conditioning of the mind) that were karmically=
 inherited from them. If you have 
genes from (and rina with) an ancestor w=
ho was lustful or angry or jealous and 
the consciousness of the deceased a=
ncestor is still having those thoughts, you 
will also suffer from such tho=
ughts due to the connection and may even commit 
some bad karmas because of=
 the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina 
by working on giving =
a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness 
is attached to=
 a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will 
not affe=
ct your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a 
str=
ong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad 
k=
armas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual 
progress.
=A0
Devata=
s are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their 
self-identification is to =
what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They 
work on your individual=
 soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are 
grosser forms of =
consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their 
self-identificati=
on is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You 
may note tha=
t Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora 
chart of a=
strology. Fire and water are the natural media for them 
respectively.
=A0
=
Devas and pitris have different ways of working and 
influencing us and hel=
ping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all 
of us and have a=
 role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in 
fire and sa=
tisfying pitris in water are very important.
