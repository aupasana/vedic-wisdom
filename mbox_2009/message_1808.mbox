Namaste Narasiharao garu,
                          Who invented "God" firs=
t? None of the primitive aboriginal ancestors  of the presentday race on th=
e Earth like the European,Negroid, Mongoloid, or the Vedic Aryan, or the Hi=
ndu race could have been the first inventor of the  idea of Godhood.  How t=
hen, could it come to be inherited by the human race on the Earth?
       B=
ut still the idea of God as a supreme, World-Transcending Universal Mind  w=
ho  has created all that exists.,Can not be discovered by Cave Man say abou=
t 80,000 years, So when it Happened? Beacuse such an idea dose not get into=
 Cave Man thinking or his Mind during his day to day Life of Eating, Huntin=
g, Fighting, and Mating, and sleeping. The daily life of a cave man as equa=
l as an animal in that period. The daily Life of a Cave Man nor his daily l=
ife drive him towards the  discovery of a World Spirit--.  
Whom he can cal=
l as the "Father of Heaven" or as  the Asiatics still love to worship as "M=
other Nature" of all her children, including Mankind. 
So where the God com=
es? First who find the Supreme God? Why He Looks in different "Rupas"? What=
 is his intension finally? Why creating and Why distroying the world?

"Udb=
hava Ksobhano Deva" Narayana 

              Is it a legacy handed down fro=
m a very remote past in the Earth's History -- many ancient cultures have d=
isappeared without leaving a trace like the Atlantianas and so many sunk de=
ep below to the bottom of the Sea.!!!!
Where is the Begining and what is th=
e Ending?
