Namaste,

Here is my view on this.

As one does enough sadhana with a mantra, one accumulates some shakti with 
that mantra. As one meditates with a mantra initially, one's account starts 
with a zero balance. As one controls senses and focuses the mind on a mantra 
without any desires, slowly the account starts to increase. The rate at 
which shakti accumulates is very slow at the beginning, but ramps up after 
crossing a thereshhold. However, if one is unable to control the mind and 
focus on the mantra without any desires, shakti does not accumulate. It 
keeps leaking.

If one is initiated by a guru who has already accumulated some shakti with a 
mantra, some of it is transferred to the person. Thus, it is beneficial to 
be initiated by a guru. However, if one is unable to control the mind and 
focus on the mantra without any desires, one will slowly leak and waste the 
shakti of the mantra that was transferred by one's guru.

Thus, I consider it far more important to develop the right attitude, 
devotion adn the ability to focus the mind without any desires, than to be 
initiated by a guru.

If you find a good guru who actually has some shakti with a mantra and is 
willing to initiate you, that is excellent. But don't think that the job is 
done. It is only means a good start and you still have a lot to do.

If you do not find a guru to initiate you, do not worry and just work hard.

I gave an analogy for this in homam manuals. A young man who started a bank 
account with a starting balance of one million dollars, thanks to a rich 
father, can eventually waste all the money and become a pauper. A young man 
who started a bank account with a zero balance can work hard and eventually 
become a billionnaire.

As far as homam is concerned, those who are particular about having a guru 
can think of me as the guru. Listen to my mp3 and/or see my youtube video 
and think of me as a guru and start doing homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha

> A disciple asked the Maharishi whether mantras could be

> He then narrated a story which I paraphrase:
> A king asked a similar question of his minister and asked for

> The king gets angry at the minister's insolence and asks the
> guard to arrest the minister, which the guard promptly does.
> The minister laughs and tells the king: See, this is the answer
> to your question, it is a matter of authority. The same command

> On the other hand, we can assume that someone or some saint

> Can you please give your insight on this topic?
> Which mantras do we need initiation in?
> Are these all the veda mantras used in homams?
> What about the mantras used in the pradhana homam?
