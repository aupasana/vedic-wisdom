Namaste,
   This is an extract the from the Pirtri Tarpana Manual.

"By thi=
nking of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to give them an e=
mancipation, one is actually trying to free oneself
from various kaarmic pr=
edispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) with sever=
al people. One can view this as an
external event of satisfying and emancip=
ating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view this as an in=
ternal event of
satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition=
. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to externalize first and=

perform external rituals, while thinking of what it means internally. This=
 builds up one=E2=80=99s visualization and slowly brings about internal
cha=
nges and eventually the desired internal change itself. One with living par=
ents also can perform pitri tarpanas for departed
ancestors of this life an=
d previous lives."
    
        The ritual specified in this manual (Pitri =
Tarpana) is to relieve you of your karmik debts that you may have rina with=
, who passed away in this life, but also in your various lives in the past.=
 

Regards
Ravi
