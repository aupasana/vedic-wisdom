Dear ALL,

Namaste.

By itself there are scores of research laboratories all over the world.
Billions of dollars are used up to construct these well equipped research
institutes. In them medical sciences and material sciences are researched
into scientifically. Great scientists right from the discovery of penicillin
to a test tube baby have persevered hard to serve mankind in an amazing
manner. They have lived lives akin to that of great saints, sages and Rishis
who were known for their penance and austerities. Many research papers have
been published and many more will be published in future. Every scientist
while taking up a research project accepts in his/her heart of hearts that
theirs is a humble effort. They may face disappointment or attain their goal
after undergoing many failed experiments. Thus each scientist like a sports
person takes up scientific projects gamely. Scientific research is nothing
but a spiritual endeavor. Their underling aim is nothing but service to
world humanity/beings. But alas that seriousness and focus shown towards
research of material science was not shown towards proving the scientific
nature of spiritual principles by modern day scientists. It serves no
purpose by either eulogizing or demeaning spiritual precepts in a
superficial manner. It is hence that Brahmavarchas Research Institute took
up this onerous task of testing ancient spiritual tenets in well equipped
scientific research laboratories. We have realized that without giving
scientific proof of the great importance of spirituality no one in this
modern age of information technology is going to imbibe it. Thus the world
will miss at their own peril great spiritual principles that can uplift
world humanity both materially and spiritually.

Within this realm stray and scattered efforts have been made. Special
emphasis has been laid on Parapsychology. In the western world the
scientific basis of Extrasensory Potential (ESP) hearing sounds from great
distances, seeing things at great distances etc is being researched into on
a very gigantic scale. If the aim is merely idle curiosity the principle can
never be understood deeply. Indian Spirituality not only proclaims the
powerful nature of such capabilities but has also elucidated well designed
methods (Yoga etc) that basically cover spiritual practices (Sadhana). In
reality this arena is very widespread. The mysterious subtle layers of the
human body and the wondrous aspects of this gigantic cosmos stand before us
with infinite aspects of research. The need of the hour today is to place it
in front of world humanity using sound logic, precepts and scientific proof.
Our Brahmavarchas Research Institute has taken up this great challenge and
will prove the same after intense experimentation and research studies.
