I had tried Baraha 8.0 and I could not find the support for vedic swaras. I=
 would appreciate if you can advise more details how it can be done.

nsliterating Maha Ganapathi Homam mantras in Tamil, similar to the work don=
e in other languages. I am using Baraha Unicode software. Any way, I have t=
o type completely, since Baraha is not supporting vedic swaras for Tamil la=

containing only mantras and no instructions. I will send the same to Narasi=
mha before end of the week so that he can publish it in his website. He can=
 also add it to the main manual.
