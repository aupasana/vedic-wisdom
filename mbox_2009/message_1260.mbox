Dear Narasimha,

Can you please help me reconcile the superiority of homam with the place
that japa finds in the nityahnika procedure?

As part of nityahnikam, the prescribed method for dvijas is to perform japa
followed by the nitya homam (in the form of aupasana). This ordering is
followed in ahnika texts followed by various communities. If homa is much
more effective, I would expect there to be *some* dharma shastra
prescription which prefers performing _this_ required daily japa as homa.
The rishis / grihya-sutra-kartas would never have left such an opportunity
alone. At the very least, I would expect these texts to prescribe the
performance of japa after the aupasana, in front of the kindled fire. Do you
know of any smriti texts / shishtachara which follows such a procedure? If
not, can you please help me understand such an absence?

Is there any benefit in performing japa in front of a lit fireplace, where
no agnimukham has been performed.

bhavadIyaH,
