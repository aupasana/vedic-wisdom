Dear Sundeep,
=A0
With all due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how =
does it matter? Can anyone here really know for sure which came after which=
? We can only speculate and guess and retrofit logic and quote one scriptur=
e vs another scripture. 
=A0
Only practical way to really find out the trut=
h is sadhana. That too if we are destined to find out we will, or else no.

=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi


The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shi=
va Sutra

Dear Na=
rasimhaji and others,

In Taittiriya Upanishad (http://www.sacred- texts.co=
m/ hin/sbe15/ sbe15034. htm), the following is the order of creation (Max M=
ueller interpretation) :

"From that Self 2 (Brahman) sprang ether (=E2k=E2=
sa, that through which we hear); from ether air (that through which we hear=
 and feel); from air fire (that through which we hear, feel, and see); from=
 fire water (that through which we hear, feel, see, and taste); from water =
earth (that through which we hear, feel, see, taste, and smell)"

This soun=
ds logical to me in that I expected Akasa to be first and earth to be last.=
 I have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji's Brhat N=
akshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I cant confirm. Do y=
ou agree with the interpretation above, if not what is your belief, source =
and justification?

Thank you,

Sundeep
