Dear Mitesh and Friends,
=A0
In view of Narasimha=92s mail in this connecti=
on and Mitesh=92s personal email to me, I will restrain from responding to =
this thread, except to make one request to Mitesh and one observation. Plea=
se bear with me.
=A0
I request Mitesh to go through the exchange with Naras=
imha one more time with the hope that he will be able to see where the conf=
usion has set in, in the first place.
=A0
=93When anyone does more sincere =
sadhana and is progressing, a state of 
joyfullness engulfs that person int=
ernally and externally. He non-
voluntaryly starts sharing it

I am afriad =
to state that atleast I fail to see in Narasimha many of 
the times.=94
=A0=

I can write a very long response to this statement but instead, will just =
state that Narasimha has voluntarily and involuntarily shared his knowledge=
 - his actions speak for itself, =A0of that no one can have a shred of doub=
t, even his most ardent critic!!
=A0
With this, I thank everyone for being =
patient through this exchange.
=A0
Regards,
RJ

Dear RJ

Namaste

Interesting, My goodness=
, what a mess!

Dear RJ I suggest you need to be a silent reader in both pr=
iase and 
lighter moments or exchange of disagreements,

it really takes ti=
me :-).....

What good is observing Narasimha for long time .....

I am jus=
t kidding here, camn down!

We are all grown ups we donot need to give gent=
le reminders to 
ourselves and others...

We need to enjoy the moment, be j=
oyful, laugh atleast 20 times a day 
and most important make others laugh t=
oo. We all need to be less 
sensitive and more accomodating, this one is fo=
r me, be joyful in 
pleasure and pain or praise and criticism. I am trying =
now to do this 
and learning to be the best.

Please you or others don't sh=
oot miseales at me from whereever you 
are :-) and please don't butt me too=
 :-), I have one wife who does it 
full time and I have no more quota in my=
 karma bank balance to the 
best of my knowledge, ouch it seems now that th=
ere may be more ...

I am not going to be defensive but now I shall shed mo=
re light on 
things for the benefit of all.

When anyone does more sincere =
sadhana and is progressing, a state of 
joyfullness engulfs that person int=
ernally and externally. He non-
voluntaryly starts sharing it

I am afriad =
to state that atleast I fail to see in Narasimha many of 
the times.

I wan=
ted to influence him indirectly about that and all of us, He and 
all of us=
 need to be more joyful and cheerful. Also we do a lot of 
things mechanica=
lly like drinking water, taking shower etc. you know 
what I mean. So all I=
 was trying to influence indirectly to Narashima 
that
for quoting shastras=
 i.e. where the names are described one does not 
need mother's direction, =
it is for the sake of completeness and it 
also helps others if they want t=
o do more research. One can always 
describe their own experiance or teachi=
ng acquired from others.

As Narasimha states our email exchange was confus=
ing to him first and 
his response to me, am not sure about others or you, =
more confusion 
to ....

Now I have added even more confusion, but I promis=
e on this subject 
it is the last one from my side.

Have a joyful day.
Bes=
t Regards
Mitesh
