Namaste

Interesting post, about ista devata and Bhadkesh.
How can ista dev=
ata be negative? It cannot be the case?

Ista devata only helps in bringing=
 out sanchit sankaras of a person,
if they are negative, the native goes th=
rough some negative 
experiances. It is always good to experiance them and =
be over with.

Badhakesh can only delay, but that to is in line with the sa=
nchit 
sanskaras of the native, it does not deny.

Best Regards
Mitesh
