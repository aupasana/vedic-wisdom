|| OM TAT SAT ||
Dear Sundeep,

   I have not read VC, no use telling me al=
l that.

   Enumerating what I know about it :

1. "SuperEther" - a term co=
ined by Paramahansa Yogananda for

2. an infinitely finer "non-material" ta=
ttwa, of which the causal cosmos - Isvara - is composed of.

3. It dissolve=
s and creates Aakash tattwa, which constitutes and separates various layers=
 of vibratroy material as the astral and physical cosmos.

4. It is support=
ed by Sankhya in the creation of the 4 antahkarana principles - Buddhi, Man=
as, Ahamkara, and Chitta. These are non-material conscious principles, whil=
e any of the rest of 20 principles do not carry consciousness.

5. It is cr=
eated as a result of "Satvic-Tamas" Guna Combination.

6. Whether you find =
a mention to this non-material tattwa or not, is immaterial. The indescriba=
ble consciousness of Soul, reflects through the help of this tattwa alone -=
 you call it Mind-ether as Sri Ramana Maharishi or superEther as Yogananda,=
 it doesn't matter. Thats it.

7.  For your interest, I am giving you the r=
eference of talks with Sri Ramana Maharishi - please, don't drag me in a di=
scussion because am clear about it, but you may resolve all your doubts by =
reading the talks. Here is an Excerpt (Page 560):

"...Chidakasa (chit-ethe=
r) is Pure Knowledge only, It is the source
of mind. Just at the moment of =
rising up, the mind is only light;
only afterwards the thought "I am this" =
rises up; this `I-thought'
forms the jiva and the world.

   The first ligh=
t is the pure mind, the mind ether or Isvara. Its modes manifest as objects=
. Because it contains all these objects within itself it is called the mind=
-ether. Why ether? Like ether containing objects it contains the thoughts, =
therefore it is the mind-ether.

   Again, just as the physical ether thoug=
h accommodating all the gross objects (the whole universe) is itself the co=
ntent of the mind-ether, so also the latter is itself the content of Chit-e=
ther. The last one is Chit Itself. There are no things contained in it. It =
remains as Pure Knowledge only...."


ON 3 GUNAS

Satva is the light,
Rajas=
 is the subject, and
Tamas is the object.

  Even the satva light is only r=
eflected light. Were it pure, original Light, there would be no modificatio=
n in it. The manokasa (mind-ether) is reflected as bhootakasa (element-ethe=
r) and objects are seen as being separate from the subject.

Regards,
Nitis=

sarira.
