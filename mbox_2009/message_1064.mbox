Respected Narasimhaji,

Pranaam,

For the first time in my life I have real=
ized that all my life I was wrong
in pronouncing "Shiva as Shiv" and so on =
as you have rightly pointed at the
understanding of Devanagri had been so h=
ard-wired in my senses that I could
never realize the mistake. Thanks for c=
orrecting us.

One more humble request if you may kindly upload the correct=
 pronounciation
mp3 for all the four words in the JPG. This will make it ab=
solutely clear
for me (and also for many of my friends) the correct key to =
sanskrit recital
/ pronounciation.

thanks & regards
Hari Om,

Jitu
