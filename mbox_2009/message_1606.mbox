one's dharma, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Moksha (liberatio=
n) is attained when one is free from desires, attachments, attractions and =
aversions. As long as there are some karmik debts that need to be settled, =
Nature will keep some attractions and some aversions alive in the person an=
d keep one away from liberation. Thus, there is a big difference between fo=
llowing dharma and not following dharma. While following one's dharma does =
not guarantee liberation, not following one's dharma does guarantee not get=
ting liberated and keeps liberation further away.

making spiritual progress is to follow one's dharma, without identifying wi=
th the actions too much. If one fulfils one's dharma but identifies with th=
e actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of "I am doing it" and feels proud),=
 that creates new karmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performed w=
ith a sense of "I" involved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Each s=
uch action keeps one further away from liberation.

 it is difficult to perform actions without a sense of "I am doing it". So,=
 to start with, atleast remove an action and its doership from your thought=
s once the action is finished. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (=
because it helps you do it better), but remove it from your mind once the a=
ction is complete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an action for a =
long time and that creates a strong self-identification.
> > >  
> > > As a=
n example, suppose you build a temple. You may do it with a sense of "*I* a=
m doing some important work" while the building work is going on, because t=
hat thought and resultant attachment motivates you overcome problems. But, =
once the temple is finished, learn to say "krishnaarpanamastu" (surrendered=
 to the Lord) and think no more of it as your work or your "achievement". I=
f people praise you for the great thing you have done, learn to not dwell o=
n it mentally and not feel proud. There may be no need to demonstrate your =
humility by lecturing or saying something, but, you can just smile and keep=
 your mind from dwelling on that compliment and feeling proud.

> We cling on to our good and bad actions for too long, by thinking of them=
 ("I did it") for too long. If we learn to cut off doership in the mind onc=

to not have the sense of "I am doing it" even as one is doing it.

while identifying with the actions, what karmik debts were created and what=

y. One who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of people with a sense of "I=
 am doing it", "I am taking revenge", "I am punishing them", "I will go to =
heaven because of it" is doing an action with a strong self-identification.=
 Whether this act is expected from one by Nature as a result of previous ka=
rmik debts to the victims or not is unknowable, but what we can know for su=
re is that this person has created new karma and new debts. Any action perf=
ormed with self-identification causes new karma, new debts and new bondage.=
 The bondage will pull him in a future life into situations where one will =
be paid those debts back.

dharma. That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what=
 his "gurus" may have asked him to do, and that is what his ideals/principl=

        Can there is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important =

 I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, wa=

way to tell men that we are all different and yet we are not incorrect in a=

ny reality and claim everything and everyone is born equal. It is not so.

         Also, as Narasimhaji's mail shows correctly, following Dharma is n=
o gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. =
But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way continu=

 To know teh simple truth that that which goes out will come back to you an=

o you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life based on and bein=
g on the right side of karma, is much easier and profitable  than trying to=
 find that elusive dharma which anyway won't help one in the long run.
