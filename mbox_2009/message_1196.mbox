Dear Mitesh,

=
>responsibilities and other things, we donot say then oh mother told
>me to=
 do this or that.

:)It was hilarious comments. I thoroughly enjoyed these =
criticism on 
my Guru. i am sure he would also have a good laugh.

Actually=
, in my opinion, Narasimha has gone to an emotional zone 
where he thinks a=
bout Mother all the time. I think his love for 
mother jagadamba makes him =
to write the way he wrote last message.

Regarding SaptJihva explanation, l=
ike you, i too got confused.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
