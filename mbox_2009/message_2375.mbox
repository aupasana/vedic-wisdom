THE VEDANTA (Delivered at Lahore on 12th November, 1897)
Volume 3, Lectures=
 from Colombo to Almora

If the Buddha is the evolved amoeba, the amoeba wa=
s the involved Buddha
also. If this universe is the manifestation of an alm=
ost infinite amount of
energy, when this universe was in a state of Pralaya=
, it must have
represented the same amount of involved energy. It cannot ha=
ve been
otherwise. As such, it follows that every soul is infinite. From th=
e lowest
worm that crawls under our feet to the noblest and greatest saints=
, all have
this infinite power, infinite purity, and infinite everything. O=
nly the
difference is in the degree of manifestation. The worm is only mani=
festing
just a little bit of that energy, you have manifested more, another=
 god-man
has manifested still more: that is all the difference. But that in=
finite
power is there all the same. Says Patanjali: =97 "Like the peasant i=
rrigating
his field."

There is no such thing as individuality in this litt=
le world of ours, the
Jagat. Thought and feeling, mind and body, men and an=
imals and plants are in
a continuous state of flux. But suppose you take th=
e universe as a unit
whole; can it change or move? Certainly not. Motion is=
 possible in
comparison with something which is a little less in motion or =
entirely
motionless. The universe as a whole, therefore, is motionless, unc=
hangeable.
You are therefore, an individual then and then alone when you ar=
e the whole
of it, when the realization of "I am the universe" comes. That =
is why the
Vedantist says that so long as there are two, fear does not ceas=
e. It is
only when one does not see another, does not feel another, when it=
 is all
one =97 then alone fear ceases, then alone death vanishes, then alo=
ne Samsara
vanishes.

If there is a wrestling match, who enjoys it, those w=
ho take part in it, or
those who are looking on =97 the outsiders? The more=
 and more you are the
witness of anything in life, the more you enjoy it. A=
nd this is =C2nanda; and,
therefore, infinite bliss can only be yours when =
you have become the witness
of this universe; then alone you are a Mukta Pu=
rusha. It is the witness
alone that can work without any desire, without an=
y idea of going to heaven,
without any idea of blame, without any idea of p=
raise. The witness alone
enjoys, and none else.


Believe, therefore, in yo=
urselves. The secret of Advaita is: Believe in
yourselves first, and then b=
elieve in anything else. In the history of the
world, you will find that on=
ly those nations that have believed in
themselves have become great and str=
ong. In the history of each nation, you
will always find that only those in=
dividuals who have believed in themselves
have become great and strong.

Th=
is is teaching on the practical side. Believe, therefore, in yourselves,
an=
d if you want material wealth, work it out; it will come to you. If you
wan=
t to be intellectual, work it out on the intellectual plane, and
intellectu=
al giants you shall be. And if you want to attain to freedom, work
it out o=
n the spiritual plane, and free you shall be and shall enter into
Nirvana, =
the Eternal Bliss.

Young men of Lahore, understand this, therefore, this g=
reat sin hereditary
and national, is on our shoulders. There is no hope for=
 us. You may make
thousands of societies, twenty thousand political assembl=
ages, fifty
thousand institutions. These will be of no use until there is t=
hat sympathy,
that love, that heart that thinks for all; until Buddha's hea=
rt comes once
more into India, until the words of the Lord Krishna are brou=
ght to their
practical use, there is no hope for us.

What matters it if th=
is little life goes? Everyone has to die, the saint or
the sinner, the rich=
 or the poor. The body never remains for anyone. Arise
and awake and be per=
fectly sincere. Our insincerity in India is awful; what
we want is characte=
r, that steadiness and character that make a man cling on
to a thing like g=
rim death.

When the Mohammedans first came into India, what a great number=
 of Hindus
were here; but mark, how today they have dwindled down! Every da=
y they will
become less and less till they wholly disappear. Let them disap=
pear, but
with them will disappear the marvellous ideas, of which, with all=
 their
defects and all their misrepresentations, they still stand as
repres=
entatives. And with them will disappear this marvellous Advaita, the
crest-=
jewel of all spiritual thought. Therefore, arise, awake, with your
hands st=
retched out to protect the spirituality of the world. And first of
all, wor=
k it out for your own country. What we want is not so much
spirituality as =
a little of the bringing down of the Advaita into the
material world. First=
 bread and then religion.
