Namaste Narsimhaji,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts. They have helped me =
a lot on the query. Actually, I recently visited few (not to name any but a=
lso including 1 or 2 from your list) places with my parents. But, my experi=
ence was really bad. I could see lot of commercialism and greed invloved am=
ongst everyone there including those in position over there. And spirituali=
sm was difficult to find. I could feel spiritual vibes more outside (slight=
ly away from the main building and crows) the temples than inside. And to m=
y believe, these places would not have been like this always. So, I kept wo=
ndering, that if these famous and energised idols have the power to raise t=
he spiritual energies, then why did "locals" who have always been here, are=
 getting corrupted. But, then probably the tamas energies of people coming =
day in and out have overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incens=
e disappear over the period of time.

I have one experience to share, which=
 is somewhat on similar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certa=
in "Amavasya". After taking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as=
 per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around=
 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd=
 people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have =
already fed them per their "Custom". Now, does it really make sense to forc=
ibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her=
 to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my paren=
ts not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt ba=
d about it.

In general, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly =
found it spiritual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I alwa=
ys happen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that t=
o keep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these=
 places. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.

Best Regards,
Sriram

Namaste,
=C2=A0
If an =
incense stick with intense smell was burnt in 
a place, the air there will =
be filled with that smell long after the stick 
completely burns. However, =
eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes 
to disappear depends =
on how strong the smell was when the stick was 
burnt.
=C2=A0
Similarly, wh=
en a great saint meditates in a place, 
the air there will be filled with t=
hat saint's spiritual energy. Even after the 
saint leaves that place or le=
aves earth altogether, that energy will linger 
there. Slowly it becomes we=
ak and disappears.
=C2=A0
In many famous temples these days, priests have 
=
become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performe=
d 
every few years to re-energize the idols 
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0=

It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do 
not have much divine =
presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At 
the same time, =
some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine 
presence.
=
=C2=A0
I was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple 
in Mayapur (ISKCO=
N head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and 
Arunachalam hills in =
Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's place). There is a 
tremendous amount of =
spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples 
where the idol=
 is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after 
Ramakrishna Param=
ahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did 
not get the=
 same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in 
Calcutta.
=
=C2=A0
There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was 
taken to by a p=
riest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu 
before we =
did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that 
templ=
e before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of 
t=
he divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not=
 
understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my=
 eyes 
and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was da=
zzled by a 
vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays lik=
e Sun. I felt 
that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I d=
o not remember the 
name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple wi=
thout roof over the 
goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a f=
ew times, but the roof 
came down in a fire accident each time and they fin=
ally decided that the goddess 
likes open air and no roof. Though we spent =
only 5 min and left in a hurry, I 
was very pleased with that temple. Someo=
ne from Tamil Nadu probably knows the 
name of the temple and goddess.
=C2=
=A0
Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a 
powerful divine pre=
sence across India.
=C2=A0
Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, on=
e 
of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple=
 at 
Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditati=
ng in the 
underground chamber there.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Even =
the middle of a busy road in India is better 
for meditating than a temple =
in USA. These western countries are so filled with 
rajas and tamas. There =
is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of 
sattwa there. Thus, a=
ny temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my 
view is that t=
here is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are 
really good.=

=C2=A0
If one has a chance to spend a few months doing 
spiritual sadhana =
near a temple, I suggest the following:
=C2=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri=
 and Kamakhya in east 
India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=
=C2=A0and 
Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi,=
 Aalandi, 
Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Vara=
nasi, Vrindavan 
and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralaya=
m=C2=A0and Ujjain in 
central India.
=C2=A0
There are many other good place=
s, but the above 
come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and =
staying there for 
several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and =
doing a spiritual 
sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.
=
=C2=A0

Narasimha
