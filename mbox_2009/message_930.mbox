namaste,

Look for books on temple agamas. You might approach temple archak=
a-s /
Agama-pAThashAlA-s, who will know about such books, as well as the
su=
bject at hand. Here are the books that I have come across.

(1) http://www.=
swarnapuri.org/SwarPUBList.html -- Look for the tamil
book "sivaalaya utsav=
angal" which covers brahmotsava and pavitrotsava.
I haven't seen the book, =
so I don't know anything else about it.

(2) The rituals followed in Chidam=
baram as codified by Patanjali have
been published in the 1970s in a two bo=
ok set
"chidambara-kShetra-sarvasvam". The details are in Sanskrit
(devanAg=
ari), and some of the mantras are only indicated by leading
words.

(3) The=
 entire shaivAgama prayoga, as codified by aghora-shivAcharya
has been codi=
fied in a 11 book set, one per deity / topic. This is
published in grantham=
 / tamil.

iti bhavadIyaH,

       ajit
