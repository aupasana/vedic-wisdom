Narasimha Garu,

for almost 5 years now, i am at loss to understand few thi=
ngs which i put forth to you and other members.
since i've read Gospel and =
leela prasanga of Thakur, i was feeling sad about Hazara Mahashaya and Hrid=
aynath (Hridu). it was and still is, unsolved painful mystry for me. i purc=
hased "They lived with God" a couple of days back and at least i am satisfi=
ed with the situation of Hazara mahashaya at his death and i am now happy f=
or him and there is no more surprise for him but when i came to know later =
life account of Hridaynath in good details, the painful feeling has grown m=
ore and so the surprise, for his misfotune even serving Thakur Ramakrishna =
for 25 years or so.

How can a person, who was chosen to serve such a Maste=
r during his sadhanaa days  have such an end? (talking of spiritual perspec=
tive here).
it is not at all convincing to think that he developed pride, b=
ecame harsh and haughty, started controlling Ramakrishna, started taking mo=
ney from visitors, started scolding Thakur etc...and that is why he suffere=
d. Thakur, who spiritually transformed many lives, could have easily transf=
ormed Hridu. why he didn't do that? why the poor Hridu got trapped in Shadr=
ipu so badly even staying so close to Thakur? Even Hazara Mahashaya was fin=
ally saved. where is the compassion of thakur when we see Hridaynath's late=
r life?

any thoughts?

Yours,
