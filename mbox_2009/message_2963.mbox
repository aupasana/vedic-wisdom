 3-1-46 Afternoon

When I entered the hall Bhagavan was already answering a=
 question which, I
gathered, was to the effect =93Is the theory of evolutio=
n true?=94

Bhagavan said:

=93The trouble with all of us is that we want t=
o know the past, what we were,
and also what we will be in the future. We k=
now nothing about the past or
the future. We do know the present and that w=
e exist now. Both yesterday and
tomorrow are only with reference to today. =
Yesterday was called =91today=92 in
its time, and tomorrow will be called =
=91today=92 by us tomorrow. Today is ever
present. What is ever present is =
pure existence. It has no past or future. Why
not try and find out the real=
 nature of the present and ever-present
existence?=94
