 GOD cannot be seen without yearning of heart,and this yearning is
impossible unless one has finished with the experiences of life. Those who
live surrounded by 'woman and gold', and have not yet come to the end of
their experiences, do not yearn for God.

When I lived at Kamarpukur, Hriday's son, a child of four or five years old,
used to spend the whole day with me. He played with toys and almost forgot
everything else. But no sooner did evening come than he would say, "I want
to go to my mother." I would try to cajole him in various ways and would
say, "Here, I'll give you a pigeon." But he wouldn't be consoled with such
things; he would weep and cry, "I want to go to my mother."

He didn't enjoy playing any more. I myself wept to see his state.

One should cry for God that way, like a child. That is what it means to be
restless for God. One doesn't enjoy play or food any longer. After one's
experiences of the world are over, one feels this restlessness and weeps for
God.
