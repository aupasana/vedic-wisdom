I performed Ganapathi homa for a 2nd time 2 days back,=
 this time 
with less mistakes, feel more comfortable, was able to handle t=
he 
fire without any problems, i had bought fire wood from the local 
store=
. This time I also used very little Ghee, less than 100 gms for 
1hr of hom=
a. I found that the audio (Mp3) does not cover a few 
sections like Bali.Na=
ivedya.
Talking to a local expert he advised that normally they would assig=
n 
one individual to add ghee, one to add samith, one to add modaks etc.
In=
 the write up the impression is that it is all done by the same 
person, is=
 this correct?
Does it matter if the homa is preformed outside the house in=
 open 
air, is it done inside to keep the positive vibrations internal to 
=
the hosue? Please advise
