*SRI =
VAMANA AVATHARA*
**
**

*Significance
*

*Sri Vamana Avathara was fifth in =
the line of Dasavatharas of Lord Sri Maha
Vishnu. This avathara took place =
during Treta Yuga before Sri Parashurama
Avathara. Lord Maha Vishnu took th=
is avathara in order to suppress the
arrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor=
 Bali (Bali Chakravarthi) and to
restore the glory, power and authority of =
Lord Indra over the Heaven who had
lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to K=
ing Bali. Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama
Sthothra describes in sloka # 17 and 56, =
the Lord asUpendro Vaamanah and
Trivikramah.*
*Lord in this avathara was kn=
own as Vamana because he was dwarf in form at
the beginning. He was known a=
s Trivikrama because he is the one who has
conquered the three worlds, Eart=
h, Upper worlds and Nether worlds. He grew
to a gigantic size while suppres=
sing the King Bali and conquered the
Universe with just three paces of his =
foot. He was also referred as Upendra
as he was known to be the younger bro=
ther of Indra. We find all the three
names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendra w=
hile reciting 24 Kesava Namas. An
exclusive Purana named after Lord Vamana =
called Sri Vamana Purana scripted
by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms part of=
 18 great Puranas called Ashtadasa
Puranas.*

*Lord Vamana was born as the =
son of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa Prajapathi) and
his wife Aditi in accordance=
 to the penance done by the couple and prayers
of Indra and other Deities. =
He was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi day
under the star constellation of=
 Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year is
celebrated as Vamana Jayanthi th=
e day on which Lord Sri Vamana was born. As
soon as he was born He took no =
time in attaining the boyhood becoming a Vatu
(Brahmachari). Lord Brahma hi=
mself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to Sri
Vamana. His attire was that of =
a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing a
Koupeena (Loin cloth), a sacred th=
read, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella) in one
hand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick=
 and water jug) in the other, his upper body
covered with Deer skin, wearin=
g a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his third
finger.*
**

*Significance of=
 Three Steps*
*Lord Vamana went to King Maha Bali and asks for three steps =
of land
measured by his foot as charity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate=
 just
three paces of land as it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty =
to give
such charity. But later agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and p=
romised
to give three paces of land as charity measured by Sri Vamana=92s f=
oot. When
Maha Bali completed the ritual process of donating the land, Lord=
 Vamana
assumed his cosmic form (Trivikrama), measured the entire Earth inc=
luding
the nether worlds by his first step.*
*
With his second step He meas=
ured the entire upper worlds. When his foot
reached the zenith it crossed t=
he Sathya Loka where Lord Brahma stays.
Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu=
, Lord Brahma offered abhishekam and
washed the Lord=92s foot and the water=
 that fell from His foot sanctified the
entire Universe. We find in the ver=
ses of great composer and Saint Sri
Annamacharya referring to the foot wash=
ed by Lord Brahma (Brahma Kadigina
Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri=
 Venkateswara.*
*
When the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces =
of Lord Sri Maha
Vishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe to=
 keep Vamana=92s
third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to =
keep his third
pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished and=
 he had no
hesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Having reali=
sed the
Supreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own head to keep the Lord=
=92s third
step. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his foot) o=
n the head
of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ahankara (eg=
oism) of
Maha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with his kingdom.*=

**

*Uniqueness*

*Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Avathara where Lord Sr=
i Maha Vishnu took
complete human form though dwarf at the beginning. The u=
niqueness of this
Avathara is that the Lord did not use any weapon. The onl=
y weapon he used
was that of begging in front of King Bali in accordance to=
 the Brahmanic
(Brahmachari) form he had attained. The Lord did not kill th=
e King Bali even
though he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way wi=
th his
intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik
=
Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strategy due to the promise he had mad=
e
to his beloved devotee Prahlada not to kill any of his descendants.
Astro=
logically Jupiter (Guru) is said to be the Paramatma Amsa of Vamana
Avathar=
a.*
**
*Message from Vamana Avathara
*

*Hidden behind every Avathara of Pa=
ramatma there is a message/moral
conveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the =
message is total surrender to the
God however mighty one may be. When once =
you shed your ego and surrender
totally with devotion at the feet of the su=
preme Lord there is nothing one
can worry about and will get total protecti=
on. This is what exactly has
happened in case of Bali who had no other alte=
rnative but to surrender to
the Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three=
 worlds.*
*When King Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total de=
votion, the
Lord was very much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily witho=
ut being
asked by King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether w=
orld
Suthala but also assured him that He would always protect his kingdom.=
 He
also assured Bali that he would become the Indra in the next Manvanthar=
a. By
the touch of Lord=92s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got =
cleaned
up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi). This is what one should under=
stand
that we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you=
 will
get only what you had asked. It you don=92t ask you will get everythi=
ng that
you require.*
*
The story of Bali also bring out the reality that, =
there is nothing
permanent and nothing to be taken for granted in this worl=
d be it wealth,
beauty, power, status, position or family and nothing belon=
gs to anyone.
Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the other. We have=
 several such
historical examples that we are also seeing in this modern wo=
rld.*
**

*Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:
*
*The day on which Lord V=
amana was born is celebrated every year on
Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi Day as =
Vamana Jayanthi.*
**

*Temples of Vamana Avathara: Some of the famous templ=
es of Lord Vamana are,

 Sri Maha Vishnu in
Trivikrama roopa (Vamana Avathara). The statue is 35 ft=

nu appeared to King
Bali at this place. It is also said that the Lord showe=
d his Trivikrama
roopa to Lord Aadisesha at this place. This temple is loca=
ted in Shiva
Kanchi (Kaancheepuram) in Tamil Nadu state.
