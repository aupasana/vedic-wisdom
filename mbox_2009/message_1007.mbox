Namaste,
 
Enhancing martian traits may help one and checking such traits m=
ay help another. One wanting to take Interstate highway I-95 to go north ma=
y have to first go a little east or west to get onto that highway. Similarl=
y, in order to fulfil one's dharma and ready oneself for serious spiritual =
progress, one person may have to enhance martian traits and another person =
may have to suppress them. Homam or japam with Mars mantra can do both.
 
B=
ottomline is this: You follow the signs to I-95 without worrying about whet=
her you are going east or west. You will eventually end up on I-95 and star=
t going north fast. Similarly, start doing homam or japam with the mantra o=
f a chosen deity without worrying about the effect on you. You will eventua=
lly end up making spiritual progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Namaste,

          Mars can give diseases, debts =
(including financial debts), enemies, litigation, quarrels, wars etc and al=
so the energy to fight and overcome those problems. Propitiation of Mars is=
 useful to a lot of people these days.

          Compared to meditating wi=
th the mantra of any deity or worshipping an idol or a kalasha, it is more =
powerful to offer the mantra in fire. I was instructed by my spiritual mast=
er, who was told by the divine Mother, to teach simple procedures for worsh=
ipping various deities in fire and spread the ritual of homam in the world.=
 As the world goes through an interesting phase in the coming years, it wil=
l be good to have a large number of people performing homam to various deit=
ies on a regular basis around the world.

          Several manuals for doi=
ng homam (fire ritual) to various deities in 30-40 minutes are already ther=
e on my website. More manuals will be added in the course of time.

       =
   Now, I have added a manual for a short Kuja homam for Mars that can perf=
ormed everyday or once every week (Tuesday or some other day) or once every=
 month. It is hoped that some people will take advantage of this manual, ge=
t some relief from the material troubles given by Mars that block their spi=
ritual progress, make some spiritual progress and also contribute to the we=
ll-being of the world in a small way.

          Best regards,
          Na=
rasimha
