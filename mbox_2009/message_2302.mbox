Dear Members,
     I'm not sure wha=
t everyone's opinion is about the recent 'daily cut and paste from web' kin=
d of posts appearing on this forum, but I think this has to be discouraged.=
 Otherwise, each member may soon start posting verbatim from their favorite=
 books or websites or gurus or philosophies and with such 'daily spam' ther=
e would not be many posts meant for reading/discussion. It is one thing to =
quote a relevant passage from a book or url or Master on a currently runnin=
g topic and another to post along the recent patterns. One can always start=
 a discussion sharing a piece of writing or speech by any Master/Book and o=
pen it to the forum for discussing issues, problems or clarifications by ra=
ising them explicitly along with the relevant material. If other members sh=
are my feeling on this then we can request the moderator to act accordingly=
. 
Regards,
-Prasad
PS: I was thinking of turning some of my group subscrip=
tions to direct email mode and evaluating the volume in each of those group=
s in recent past and I hit upon this in the process.
