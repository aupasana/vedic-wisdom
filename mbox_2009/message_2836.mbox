Rajarishi Ji and Uptal Ji

Many thanks for sharing your views. I absolutely=
 agree , just did not want to put it strongly.But you guys have given me co=
nfidence to speak without fear.

Also the Concept of Asura which you recent=
ly mentioned is one of the topics of research by a few historians on the co=
nnections between the Fire worshippers of Iran and Atharvans of India ...th=
e imagery gets reversed , the asuras are the gods and daievas according to =
them take the place of the daityas.  Soma becomes Hauma.... In general S ge=
ts replaced with H and so on and so forth.

( I do not beleive in the false=
 Aryan Invasion theory which finally died its death by Genetic Proof of Ste=
phen Oppenheimer of a million subcontinent gene samples proving a route out=
 of africa to South India and then migration out  ) 

Now as far as the dis=
cussion on Wrong Presense coming into a Idol and Original MahaKali being Go=
lden Splendour in colour.I think Aurobindo is saying the truth.

The below =
link by  Yoga of Sri Chinmoy 

Glimpses From The Vedas And The Upanishads

=
http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/vedasupanishads

Agni, fire, expresses=
 itself in seven forms and it has seven significant inner names: Kali the b=
lack; Karali the terrible, Manojava, thought-swift; Sulohita blood-red; Sud=
humravarna, smoke-hued; Sphulingini, scattering sparks; Visvaruci, the all-=
beautiful. 

Kali, the black, is not actually black. Kali is the divine for=
ce or fire within us which fights against undivine hostile forces. Mother K=
ali fights against demons in the battlefield of life. In the vital plane we=
 see Her as a dark, tenebrous Goddess but, in the highest plane of consciou=
sness, She is golden.

RamKishore
