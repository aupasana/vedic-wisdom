You are absolutely right.

Suppose one needs to travel in hot Sun and the rules say that one should use 
an umbrella. Yes, shade of an umbrella is helpful in hot sun, but one can do 
without it too. If one has an umbrella, it is a good idea to use it and 
start walking. If one has no umbrella, it is a bad idea to not cancel the 
travel because of it. Technicalities are there to help, but, they need to 
compromised when they start to block one. One needs to know what is primary 
and what is secondary.

Best regards,
Narasimha
