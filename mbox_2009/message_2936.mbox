Please tell me where to learn sanskrit from web page or pdf files
two great saints from tamilnadu told no need to learn sanskrit
vallalar and maraimalai adigal say tamil is older than sanskrit and no need to learn north indian langauage - hindi
during ancient times there were only two languages sanskrit and tamil
but ramanar and swami vivekanada say learn sanskrit
iam sometimes consumed
all books equivalent to sanskrit are there in tamil also
sanskrit is more advanced than tamil as it has been refined a lot and sanskrit is younger than tamil

Hello,
          For several week/months before I did the AOL  course, I had a friend who was a healer/medium. Once she went back to her country Austria and said some simple prayers in her church for me. I did not know about it and also had not asked her. 

One night Jesus Christ appeared to me in dream. He was very tall and there were others  with him as well. He asked me to follow him. I completely refused him and said, that I am following the Path Of Love.He smiled and left.

In the morning I was very puzzled why I had this dream. Then the post card from from my friend solved this mystery for me.

Then the 4 day AOL course started. In the group was man wearing the priest collar. I do not know which was his church. On coming back home on the train, in my innocence I told him the above story. He did not say a word but did not come for the rest of course.So did not learn Kriya. 

The facilitator was a Indian man who was quite aggressive. As he was a lawyer, he thought he knows best and his language and manners were full of anger. The rest of group were middle age white people. The energy in the room was so tense without any outward reason. Also they would not give or sell that tape which was played during kriya so you could practise at home.They gave no reason for their refusal.
All these things stopped my contact with them.

I hope you will become a kind and caring sort of facilitator who respects other human beings.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan
