Namaste, 
=A0
There was a beautiful mail from Sri Narasimha regarding the S=
piritual Sadhana and Free Will. I shall use it as my reference and try to c=
larify your doubt. Learned members in this group, please correct me if I am=
 wrong. 
=A0
>> also the mental conditioning represented by chitta influenc=
es what entity one
can identify with. 
(Mental conditioning are our habits =
and in karma theory, unless chitta is overwritten with and made it into a d=
iamond (die-mind) state, spiritual evolution is difficult to achieve)

>> A=
 regular person's free will is not strong enough to bend the curve of habit=
 resulting from previous actions and change the course.
=A0
And all the spi=
ritual sadhanas (japa, homam, satsanga, kriya yoga etc)=A0that one undertak=
es are to increase the free will. 
=A0
e.g, Costant Satsanga(singing devoti=
onal songs in groups, where in you forget who are you...i.e.,=A0ego dies do=
wn for a moment)=A0leads to detachment, which inturn leads to removal of de=
lusion and hence gain in wisdom. That is why Nagara Sankirtana, Singing son=
gs in praise of lord had been part of village culture in India=A0for a long=
 time. 
=A0
Japa causes chitta to be written into a die-mind state and henc=
e change in habits. 
=A0
Spiritualists say that in any sadhana(s), self-dis=
cipline, detachment with vichara (with regard to permanence and impermanenc=
e)=A0 are necessary to evolve (i.e., to change habits) oneself. 
=A0
And no=
w coming to Kriya yoga, it's also one of spiritual sadhanas. Scriptures say=
 that there are seven layers of existence. Body, Breath, Mind, Buddhi, Chit=
ta, Ego, Self.(refer to=A0Narasimha's mail on antahkaranas)=A0Breath connec=
ts body to the mind, like when one is angry, the breath is fast. When one i=
s happy, the breath is different and when one is normal, breath is normal. =
So breath reflects your state of mind. 
Kriya yoga works on breath. With th=
e rhythmic control of breath, the mind is controlled(quite reverse of the e=
xamples that were mentioned earlier, where-in if X is the state of mind, Y =
is the breath pattern. So what if Y is the breath pattern, can we get X sta=
te of mind??), hence the thoughts that originate in mind.
=A0
For any sadha=
na to work, it has to become an habit, ofcourse Bhava/Contempation is a mus=
t during the course of Sadhana, without which it's just a waste of time. Th=
at's why you have 40 day sadhana for Ayyappa devotees, that's why Sri Naras=
imha suggested recitation of 2 malas of Savitur Gayatri for 100 days, with =
the reason being=A0they become=A0into a habit during the course of time and=
 hence benefits are=A0felt.=A0(When one is a child learning numbers, we nev=
er understood the benefit of learning numbers until the mind is matured eno=
ugh=A0to use=A0them and by then, numbers have become an habit for us)=A0
=
=A0
And as for complimenting of different sadhanas, All I can say is it's i=
ndividual's choice. Some do japa+satsanga, some homam+satsanga, some yoga+h=
omam and some any other combination or just japa or homam alone and which e=
ver may be the case, right effort and self-discipline is a must from sadhak=
a to make progress. 

=A0
Thanks & Regards,
