 D.: How are they to disappear?

M.: They are the ego. If the ego goes they=
 go with it. The ego is itself
unreal. What is the ego? Enquire. The body i=
s insentient and cannot say =91I=92
. The Self is pure consciousness and no=
n-dual. It cannot say =91I=92 . No one
says, =91I=92 in sleep. What is the =
ego then? It is something intermediate
between the inert body and the Self.=
 It has no locus standi. If sought for
it vanishes like a ghost.

You see, =
a man imagines that there is something by his side in darkness; it
may be s=
ome dark object. If he looks closely the ghost is not to be seen,
but some =
dark object which he could identify as a tree or a post, etc. If he
does no=
t look closely the ghost strikes terror in the person. All that is
required=
 is only to look closely and the ghost vanishes. The ghost was never
there.=
 So also with the ego. It is an intangible link between the body and
Pure C=
onsciousness. It is not real. So long as one does not look closely it
conti=
nues to give trouble. But when one looks for it, it is found not to
exist.
=

Again, in a Hindu marriage function, the feasts continue five or six days.=
 A
stranger was mistaken for the best man by the bride=92s party and they
t=
herefore treated him with special regard. Seeing him treated with special
r=
egard by the bride=92s party, the bridegroom=92s party considered him to be=

some man of importance related to the bride=92s party and therefore they t=
oo
showed him special respect.

The stranger had altogether a happy time of=
 it. He was also all along aware
of the real situation. On one occasion the=
 groom=92s party wanted to refer to
him on some point. They asked for him.
=

He scented trouble and made himself scarce.So it is with the ego.If looked=

for, it disappears. If not, it continues to give trouble.How it is to be
l=
ooked for is learnt from those who have already done so. That is the reason=

why the Master is approached.
