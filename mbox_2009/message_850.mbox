Dear Dhiraj Bhai,

following are answers for most of your questions to the =
best of my 
expereince of Chandi Homam. these are for 'One time' Chandi Hom=
am 
only.

1) 1 kg Dry Coconut Halves are sufficient. You can break each 
c=
oconut Half with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.

2) A very sma=
ll bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is 
sufficient as 'Ghee Aah=
utis' are to be given as only a single drop 
whenever it is mentioned in th=
e Manual.

3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can off=
er 
Aaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya 
et=
c... Now one can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for 
offering a=
s aahuti or can use single stuff.

to elaborate, at each Swaha, one can tak=
e One Kishmis or Few Mamara 
or one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya =
and offer to Agni.

If you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of=
 some stuff 
which can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offer=
ed as 
Aahuti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take 
v=
ery little 'Havan samgri powder and offer it.

Thus one person can easily p=
erform homam as explained above because 
firstly, one doesn't need to give =
Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff 
simultaneously. secondly, Counting of any =
mantra can be done with 
left fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.=


2 kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms 
will be=
 sufficient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..

4) The Homa Fir=
e represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. 
hence it is suggested th=
at Aahutis are only offered by You alone 
while mother and others can sit b=
eside you and concentrate. they 
will gain lot of spiritual benefit just by=
 attending.

5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one=
 can 
also be used.

6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who of=
fer ghee 
aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i've also s=
een 
that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it 
a=
lso must be one of the right ways. however i have complete faith in 
what N=
arasimha has given in Manual and that also must be the other 
right way of =
many ways. although you can choose between the above 
two, i recommend to g=
o as per the Manual if you are going to do as 
per the manual given by him.=


Lastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself with much 
technicalities =
and burden of perfection. in the first few runs, 
there are many things dur=
ing Havan which can go imperefct. do as per 
manual and enjoy you Homam wit=
h your mother & others and offcourse 
with the mother of universe !!!

I ho=
pe, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
