Narasimhaji,

Thank you for your advice.  I look forward to the detailed Ga=
napati Homam manual one day.  

I have been using this guide in the past fo=
r various pujas.  It may be of benefit to others. I cannot vouch for the ac=
curacy of the procedures as my knowledge in these matters is limited.  

ht=
tp://www.sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/completevidhi.pdf

I tried to combi=
ne a simple 16 upchara puja of Ganesha in an idol prior to the 16 upchara h=
omam manual provided by you and received good results.  A simple guide (chi=
ldren's guide) for doing 16 upchara Ganesha puja on an idol is available he=
re, again people will need to decide on the accuracy of this manual on thei=
r own 

http://www.balagokulam.org/ganesh/resources/ganeshpoojavidhi.pdf

T=
here are several resources on the internet for pujas which vary in content =
but very limited manuals for Homam and none comes as close to the work that=
 you have done.  I hope we can continue to refine these and make them avail=
able in short, regular, and detailed formats for sadhakaas depending on the=
 interest and time available with each.  

Best regards

Veenu
