Namaste Utpalji
=A0
A very (belated) happy birth day to you too! -:)
=A0
Bu=
t i strongly feel that there will be much more depth in all that which we a=
re not aware and events are just on the surface, which generally look at an=
d form our opinions. 

I entirely agree with this proposition.I was merely =
looking and trying to=A0analysing the epic from the scriptural point of vie=
w as it appears. And yes, these cannot have a solution, but if we discuss t=
his with=A0an open mind, all can gain from this. I am sure you would agree =
with this Utpalji.
=A0
Let me put down some thoughts.
=A0
=A0I find idealis=
m to be the central theme of Ramayana. In Mahabharata by comparison, aligni=
ng oneself with a higher Dharma beyond lesser dharmas is the aim.
=A0
Being=
 a master of all possible celestial weapons, Rama could have challenged Bal=
i in a direct duel and killed him straight; for, the boon on Bali -- that h=
e would automatically get half the strength of his opponent in course of an=
y duel -- could not have affected the efficacy of celestial weapons.

Rama =
could also have...

(1) dried the Indian Ocean on the very first day when i=
t did not give him way to cross over to Lanka; instead he invoked Shiva and=
 prayed to the sea god till his patience couldn't sustain more;

(2) killed=
 Ravana with a Brahmastra right from the day and right from the spot where =
he stood at the time of coming to know who abducted Sita, without needing t=
o get into a war. He had in his arsenal what can be deemed that era's versi=
on of an IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile)!

But he did none of t=
he above because he thought there was a certain way established by dharma t=
o go about each act. This principle was breached on three occasions. Killin=
g of Bali in that manner was one IMO.
=A0
Considering the above, it does no=
t make sense to me why Rama killed Bali in that manner.
=A0
-Regards

arshi

Namaste Rajarshi,

>at that point of time Lord Rama was unaware of his div=
ine nature at >that time and acted in the mould of any other human being.

=
If you go through Yoga Vaasishtha, in the concluding part it is mentioned t=
hat Raama went in to Samadhi and Vasishtha Rishi then declares in front of =
the whole gathering that he is the Incarnation of all pervading Vishnu.

I =
understand fully when Narasimha says that Rama realised his true nature lat=
er (During Vasishtha's discourse) and not from the birth. but once he reali=
sed, then he realised. i fail to appreciate your argument that he forgotten=
 his true nature during some course of events and acted against dharma or M=
aryaada. Bali's episode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama's Maryaada =
and conduct is questioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event,=
 Sita's Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita Mata etc...

But i strongly feel th=
at there will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and eve=
nts are just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions.=
 however people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above eve=
nts for which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali's killing, =
i may say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way h=
e was killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against D=
harma towards his brother. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma o=
n himself in the later life during Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use=
 of all these arguments? I have seen that (from my experience in Astrology =
as well as other areas) they never end.

you said "we conclude that at that=
 point of time Lord Rama was unaware of his divine nature at that time". i =
am sorry Rajarshi, but i am sure we can never conclude especially in case o=
f Realised souls and when they are incarnations of Lord Vishnu.

plese corr=
ect me if my understanding is wrong.

Belated Happy birthday.

Warm Regards=
,

Utpal

 An arrow, a simple chain and a necklace with an elaborate work may all be =
made from the same 22 caret gold. You may call an object made with 22 caret=
 gold to be purer than an object made with 14 caret gold. But if the arrow,=
 chain and beautiful necklace are all made of 22
 caret gold, they are all =
equally pure. Simply because the necklace required more work, it is nore pu=
rer.<BR>> > <BR>> > Similarly, Rama and Krishna were both from =
Vishnu - pure sattwa. One is not more "evolved" than the other. They just s=
erved different purposes (like the arrow and necklace made of the same 22 p=

e I said, earlier, Rama and Krishna are from the soul and mind principles o=
f the cosmic being. Soul is not bothered about the duality and maya, but mi=
