dear shri Narasimha Raoji,
I would request ur clarifi=
cations on the following areas regarding
performing of Shrardam for pitrus.=

Suppose there are four sons, can each one of them perform shrardam
separat=
ely in the event of the sons placed at different location?
Is it not suffic=
ient that shrardam performed by the eldest karta?
shud every son perform it=
 in spite of being at different locations?

My doubt in the above question =
is shrardam is performed on the thithi
when the father or mother would have=
 died and shrardam is performed
inviting the pitrus to accept the pindam an=
d bless the kartas.
Under such situation suppose shrardam is performed in t=
hree different locations,
how will the pitrus identfy and where will they g=
o? will the pitrus go to all the
three or four locations and accept the pin=
dam?
=A0
In olden days shrardam was performed mostly at the place where=A0 =
the native had
passed away and all the kartas use to assemble and jointly p=
erform. But in today's
scattered living when it is difficult to congregate =
at the place of the eldest karta,
can the other kartas do this shrardam at =
their respective residences?
Today sastrigals who perform this they say tha=
t it canbe done at different places 
individually, of course many times the=
y deviate because of the income involved 
in it.
=A0
I will be thankful to =
u if u can spare sometime to answer to the above queries.
=A0
regards,
k.go=
pu
