Namaste Rajarshi,
 
I believe he did.
 
Once Kundalini is perfectly purifie=
d, there is no difference between sahasraara chakra and moolaadhaara chakra=
. Kundalini is nothing but one's self-awareness. Chakras are realms of awar=
eness. When self-awareness has some conditioning, different realms of aware=
ness have different properties and are different. But, when the self-awaren=
ess is perfectly pure and there is no conditioning whatsoever, all realms o=
f awareness are the same. Kundalini may be spontaneously moving through var=
ious chakras, but it does not matter.
 
Many siddhas and vijnanis are not i=
n sahaja samadhi. They may operate with a very limited amount of ego and co=
nditioning. For embodied beings to not have even a little ego and condition=
ing is very very tough. Sahaja samadhi is not at all easy to achieve. Only =
saints of the caliber of Trilinga Swami, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,=
 Ramana Maharshi were in that state. It is ruled out for most people.
 
Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimha,

        When =
Ramakrishna came out of his nirvikalpa samadhi, did he spend his life in Sa=
haja samadhi or was in some other state of conscinousness?

        Is Saha=
ja Samadhi equivalent to the idea of Kundalini going to Sahashra Chakra and=
 then coming back again to Mooladhara to rule? This being entirely differen=
t from teh normal stay of kundalini in mooladhara. Like in the spiritual ex=
planation of the Ganesha story you gave.

        Is a Siddha, a Vigyani an=
d a person in Sahaja samadhi equivalent?

        I know that all these que=
ries are quite useless, from my point of view at least, because I am still =
tightly caught in the mesh of my own weaknesses. But since this topic was b=
eing discussed, I thought of asking.

        -Regards
         Rajarshi

Namaste Utpal,

          Your understanding of nirvikalpa samadhi is not q=
uite correct. Some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi may not come back, bu=
t some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi do come back and live their lives=
. In other words, some people jump from the "relative" side of the wall to =
the "absolute" side and stay there forever, while some people come back to =
the "relative side" to tell others about it.

          Sahaja samadhi is a=
 state where one is simultaneously on both sides and does not even see them=
 as two different sides.

          One more thing.. The absolute and the r=
elative are not really two, but one. The relative is just a modification of=
 the absolute. Shiva and Shakti are not two, but one. Normally we are in th=
e field of Shakti and not aware of the underlying Shiva (we see various obj=
ects, but not the underlying Reality). In nirvikalpa samadhi, one is in the=
 field of Shiva and not aware of the Shakti that manifested (i.e. one is ab=
sorbed in the underlying Reality, but not perceiving various objects). In s=
ahaja samadhi, one is simultaneously aware of Shiva and Shakti and aware of=
 them as One.

          Normally, when the mind is perceiving the objects =
of dual polarities using jnanendriyas and the mind is engaging in actions o=
f dual polarities using karmendriyas, it is difficult to not accumulate any=
 conditioning such as likes, dislikes and impressions, and keep the conscio=
usness absorbed in the Absolute.

          Best regards,
          Narasim=

 Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the mind, while c=
reational variety or objectification still exists in the mind. One perceive=
s that there is an "I" and there are "other" objects (e.g. deities, demons,=
 people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one object (e.=
g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object. Even reaching sav=
ikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also cannot go be=
yond savikalpa samadhi.
          > > 
          > > In nirvikalpa samadhi,=
 the creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=3D nir+vikal=
pa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no perception of =
I and "other" objects. One's consciousness is absorbed in supreme conscious=
ness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. T=
his state is reached by very very few yogis.
