Dear Members

Wish you all a very happy new year.

I had a few questions to=
 people who use wood for homa. Sometimes the 
wood bursts in the fire with =
a loud crack. Is it because of trapped 
air in teh wood? If so, is there an=
ything that can be done to reduce 
this cracking. 

Sometimes I have seen p=
eople offering pieces of cloth in fire during 
poornahuti. What does cloth =
indicate?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
