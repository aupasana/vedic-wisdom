Namaste !

>Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the correct=
 term 
>is "sanatana dharma", i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness

Intre=
stingly, last week i was in Oman and i had a same discussion 
with one of t=
he client's representative. He was Aarab national and 
wanted to know somet=
hing about Hindu religeon. First thing i told him 
that 'Hindu' is a foreig=
n word and none of our scripture uses this 
word.

***

This is my long tim=
e belief that Sanaatan Dharma will never perish. 
my logic is simple. in th=
e recorded history, People from Sanaatan 
Dharma has never attacked the oth=
er religion. The glorious example 
(which i am very proud of quoting) is Pa=
arasi Community. They came to 
India for saving their community and religeo=
n and our people niether 
rejected them nor influenced them to convert in t=
o our religeon. they 
flourished in our country in trade.

***

When Sanaat=
an Dharma was in great danger, Lord sent Shivaaji to 
control it. earlier A=
ddi Shankara camedown for it. Now it is our 
responsibility to see to it th=
at we live its value in our life. and 
we need not forget the famous assura=
nce "Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!"

but is everybody's duty to do their bit so th=
at this glorious 
Tradition of Sanaatan Dharam never gets diminished.

best=
 Regards,

Utpal
