Dear Narsimha,

Some very valuable insight by Manish ji. Does he imply Savi=
tur Gayatri  
by ' Savitri' and what does he mean when he says the real Gay=
atri is  
hidden?
I reckon for this type of ' sadhna' one can use any other=
 prasidha  
mantra as well.
Would value your response.
By the way, although=
 you do not need any support from list members,  
your cool and collected r=
esponse on the thread is really admirable.
As this is not relevant to soham=
sa list I have posted this only on  
this group.
Many thanks
Best
Sharat
