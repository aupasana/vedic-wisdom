Hi,
do you think plants does not have life?
I thought plants(all vegetation=
) also needs food and dies, rotten like human bodies when they are taken/pl=
ucked from the soil or water, the only difference is they don't have voice =
to shout like other living beings.
not only blood shed is violence, killing=
 of a life is=C2=A0also violence..

so here my point is people who are eati=
ng vegetarian=C2=A0and non-vegetarian people doing their dharma, from my kn=
owledge=C2=A0there is no=C2=A0need to worry or feel sorry=C2=A0here.

//a P=
lant and tree has a life. I agree. Let me ask=C2=A0what to eat then?

if we=
 have to worry about doing our own dharma - then Lord Krishna have to come =
to each and everyone to tell=C2=A0upadesa. Our duty is to do our dharma - d=
o=C2=A0the dharma and clear your karmic debt,=C2=A0moreover we are not we w=
e are all=C2=A0Krishna, the thing that we should understand is Lord Krishna=
 is playing the role, so nothing to worry/confuse about ourself.

Dear Rajarshi and =
everybody else,

>(Non-violence is the ultimate dharma. So too is violence =
in service >of Dharma.)
=C2=A0
>This I find very acceptable. Now if the que=
stion arises what is >Dharma, I would request going back to the mails of Na=
rasmiha on >Dharma, because no one has 
Let me clear few things explicitly.=
 We are confusing and Mixing different things here. I am taking 'Ahimsa' in=
 the context of Food habits/preferences and Hinsa involved in that. Hinsa (=
Injury/Killing) involved in that is quite different than say for instance, =
Injury and killing involved in Military Wars.
If a Tiger is attacking human=
 societies every now and then and killing people then it is required to be =
captured or Killed. That Hinsa is different.
So now if we talk about Swa-Dh=
arma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or Collective society Dharma or Rasht=
ra Dharma, The Killing which happens during Military war can fall in Swa-Dh=
arma of a soldier who kills solders of the other side. It can be called Dha=
rma of Group of people (Society) to kill a Man eater Tiger.
What i am refer=
ring to again and again is the Killing involved for the reason of Food habi=
ts and THAT is what which can not fall under Swa-Dharma of people eating me=
at. Its possible that the karma of people working in Butchery shops may not=
 be that heavier then the people who eat meat.
In my opinion, references to=
 Swadharma is not proper here.
***
It is also correct that Most have cravin=
gs for the palate. Vegetarian people also have cravings for Spicy, Hot, Swe=
et, etc.. food. The Major difference however is that Craving for the Veg fo=
od is far better in comparison because craving for a Chicken or Mutton amou=
nts directly to a loss of life.
Again, I think that it is not required to g=
o in to philosophical discussions here.
***
I understand that people are bo=
rn with the Karma baggage of past lives. they will get the culture, family =
background, habits etc... due to that. Mental conditioning will vary. BUT i=
f a person comes to know about certain things then it is no use blaming or =
taking shelter under the circumstances. His/her will is always there. Discr=
imination is always there. I dare give an advise here. if somebody wants to=
 change Habits which one feel to be disastrous, one can try as much possibl=
e (Like Rajarshi tried for 108 days) and at the same time surrender to God.=
 pray every day to almighty to help and over a period of time, help will co=
me. will surely come.
I do not boast or take any pride in eating Vegetarian=
 food and=C2=A0my intentions are never to insult the people who eat meat. M=
y only concern here is=C2=A0*Killing of Animals, Birds etc...* for=C2=A0NOT=
 justifiable reasons.=C2=A0
***
a Plant and tree has a life. I agree. Let m=
e ask=C2=A0what to eat then? Because if you stop eating vegetables and grai=
ns then it'll be a vital questions of Survival.=C2=A0 Somebody suggested th=
at It is not useful to discuss Veg and non veg. i respectfully disagree wit=
h that. Discussions were required and this thread will prove to be immensel=
y useful.=C2=A0 even a single person changes his/her Mind and turns=C2=A0aw=
ay from Nonveg eating.

ost of these are sure shot arguments from the people who eat Meat/fish. But=
 I have often feel that they are themselves are not convinced when they arg=
ue. they are 'hollow' arguments. However , I'll honestly say that i have no=
 answers for 'life in a Plant'.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > &=
gt; The people who argue such as': Most eat meat in the world, Egg is veget=
arian, Plant also has life, One will not get required nourishments only wit=
h vegetarian food, If we don't eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), =
Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if ever=

look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. Pe=

chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchere=

 a young girl from Germany came to work in my office for 6 months. once i c=
asually asked her as to what she eats during lunch. what she said was not a=
t all expected. she said that she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food=
 since 3 years now and wants to continue that way whole life. As expected, =
i was very happy and i further asked the reason. The answer she gave so muc=
h happiness. She said that She does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I salute =
her from my heart.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > Best Rega=
