Namaste Anup ji,

My Daily Homam is still Ganapati Homam. I recite Chandi P=
aath daily. To clarify, i didn't move from Ganapti Homam to Chandi Homam (I=
 think you wish to ask the same). However i perform chandi Homam occasional=
ly.

Regarding your query of switching from Ganapati Homam to some other ho=
mam, i can only say that it depends upon individual. once can have strong i=
ntuition/urge to switch to some other deity. some people might get indirect=
 or direct indications. i do not know about the criteria to fix a time fram=
e for switch. peronally for me, i am not having any such urge/intuition/ind=
ications till date and i have left it to my guru to suggest if at all there=
 needs a shift from Ganapati Homam to some other homam (say Chandi Homam). =
however, i must say that i've liking towards Chandi homa.

warm regards,
Ut=
pal
