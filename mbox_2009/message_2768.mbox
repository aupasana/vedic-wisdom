 Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=
al body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=

ea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in=
 Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) w=
here Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted=
 to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay =
permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-conscio=
usness which is associated with Manas.

 That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after obje=
cts, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-a=
ttachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freed=
om.

<DIV>On a different note, ther=

 In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of t=

ga is a path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual analysis. One pur=

with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or=
 an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not bei=

 is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of eliminat=
