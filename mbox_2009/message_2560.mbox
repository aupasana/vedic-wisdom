Namaste,

On the occasion of Navaraatri, i first time tried two Homas (Gana=
pati and Chandi) at the same sitting. (just finished the Homam).

e 1 hour 22 Minutes (Including Meditation)

The sequence is -
Anujnaa, Aach=
manam, Vigneshwara Pooja, Praanaayaama, Sankalpa (Ganapati and Chandi -ment=
ally said that will perform Chandi pradhaan homa with chapter 4&11), Kalash=
shudhhi, Agni Pratishthaapana, Dikapaalaka Pooja, Poorvaangama, Praanpratis=
hthapana of MahaGanapati,Panchopachara Pooja, 10parts Ghee Ahuti for Root M=
antra, Aahutis with 12 times root Mantra, 12 times Veda Mantra, 3 times Ath=
arvashirsha, Punah Pooja and Pradakshina.
Praanpratishthapana of Chandi,Pan=
chopachara Pooja, Parivaar devta Aahuti with Single mantra, Aahutis with 4t=
h & 11th chapter of Durga Spatashati, Punah Pooja and Pradakshina. Uttraang=
am, Tarpana, Suddhaana Bali (common for Parshads of both the deities), Vaso=
rdhaaraa, Poornaahuti (with Root Mantra of Ganapati and Navaarna mantra), M=
