Dear Narasimha ji,

Thank you very much for the clarification of the nasal =
ending of beeja mantras. I have been seeking answers about this for years b=
y asking various scholars in India, but no-one could clarify it like you. M=
y hat off to the depth of your knowledge.

You mention that the 'ka' conson=
ant group corresponds to fire (as it does to Mars) and 'pa' consonant group=
 corresponds to air (Saturn). This fits to Parashara's assignment of Bhutas=
 to the Grahas (BPHS 3. 20 / Ranjan publ.). So my question is: Would it be =
right to assign each element to the consonant groups as per the Graha assig=
ned to it (as per Parashara)?

So would this be correct?:
'ka' group -> Agn=
i (Mangal)
'ca' group -> Jala (Shukra)
'Ta' group -> Bhumi (Budha)
'ta' gro=
up -> Akasha (Guru)
'pa' group -> Vayu (Shani)

The nasal (anunaasika)in ea=
ch group represents Akasha, which makes sense as it is all-pervading. Howev=
er, I wonder if it is correct that the 'ta' group (Guru) would also be assi=
gned to it.

I don't mean to go off topic.
I would love to hear more about =
the correspondence between the various beeja mantras, their corresponding d=
eities, Grahas and the Sanskrit alphabet.

Best regards and thanks,

Andri

, the five letters in the group represent the sub-influence of the five ele=
ments. The nasal (anunaasika) in each group shows the element of space (aak=
aasa). Thus, "n(g)" is a combination of space and fire and "m" is space and=
 air. Both are fine and serve different purposes. However, when g becomes e=
xplicit, the space influence becomes less and that is undesirable.

 differently, but both are valid.

er is that most people cannot pronounce it correctly. The correct pronuncia=
tion is to start saying "hreeng" and stop just when you are about to say "g=
". The sound "g" should not be explicit at all. To pronounce that nasal "n(=
g)" correctly, you have to think that you are going to say "ng", but stop j=
ust short of "g". It is not easy. Most people end up pronouncing the "g" so=
und a bit. Instead of making that mistake, it is better to just stick to "h=
reem".

both fine. But hreeng with an explicit g is a bad idea.
