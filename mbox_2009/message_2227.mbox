Namaste Balasubramanian ji,

Thank you for your straight forward response.
=

>>>Simply because half coconut burns faster than full coconut,<<<

I humbl=
y wish to point out here that Half coconut is not substituted 
because it b=
urns faster. it is substituted because the fire in a small Homa kundam can =
overwhelm it and burning is complete most of the times. as the fire is rela=
tively much smaller and weaker in tiny Homa kundam used by many of us in ou=
r regular homas, a full coconut (dry one off course) Purnaahuti has all the=
 chance of extinguishing it.

It is my strong faith that in this yuga (or m=
ayone be in any yuga), Bhakti and Bhavana in rituals are much much more imp=
ortant than following the instructions literally prescribed for rituals. Th=
at is not to discount on the methods, materials and other things but we can=
 certainly compromise those if our Bhavana and bhakti is strong.

To clarif=
y further, I=E2=80=99ll provide some examples-

* if one is run out of Flow=
ers and could not get it on some day, one can offer 'Akshataas' to the deit=
y by making Bhavana and requesting the deity to accept it as flowers.

* As=
 Narasimha has mentioned so many times in his Homa manuals such things.
   =
  - wear Pavitra (Ring) of Darbha, if not then wear any ring, if that is no=
t available then continue without it.

Finally, Purnaahuti is symbolical of=
 our ego as we all know. The coconut offered in any Homa represents head of=
 the Sadhaka. it in its essence means Ego, Intelligence, pride, attachments=
 etc...,

I wish to humbly ask a question to you here. Due to serious const=
raint(s), if some one is not able to offer full coconut as Purnaahuti, then=
 can he not offer Half coconut or even a piece of coconut making a 'Bhavana=
' that it is his/her head which is offered and request the deity in the fir=
e to accept it? What will be wrong in that and how it can be a big mistake =
even if that differs slightly at gross level from the prescription of Shast=
ras?

Thanks again for your post.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 point out that if a Coconut half used as Purnaahuti (Final offering symbol=
ic of ego) is placed like a CAP (white portion remains inside and not visib=
le), it burns *very* brilliantly and the burning is *COMPLETE*. i am doing =
this for a week and observed that not only the purnaahuti ofering, it helps=
 in complete burning of everything in the Havan Kunda.
