 15th May, 1935

Talk 3.

A question was asked as to the nature of happines=
s.

Maharishi:

If a man thinks that his happiness is due to external cause=
s and his
possessions, it is reasonable to conclude that his happiness must=
 increase
with the increase of possessions and diminish in proportion to th=
eir
diminution.

Therefore if he is devoid of possessions, his happiness sh=
ould be nil.What
is the real experience of man? Does it conform to this vie=
w?

In deep sleep the man is devoid of possessions, including his own body.=

Instead of being unhappy he is quite happy. Everyone desires to sleep
soun=
dly.

The conclusion is that happiness is inherent in man and is not due to=

external causes.One must realise his Self in order to open the store of
un=
alloyed happiness.
