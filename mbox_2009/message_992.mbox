Dear ALL,

There are several methods of conditioning the mind for the Nada=

Yoga Sadhanas (of the Shabda tanmatra). One such method, experimented at
S=
hantikunj, Hardwar is so simple that anybody can easily adopt it. In the
re=
gular training programmes of spiritual refinement organized at Shantikunj,
=
Hardwar, the trainees are given exposure to the Nada Yoga every evening fro=
m
6 p.m to 6:15 p.m. During this practice, the students are supposed to sit=
 in
sukhasana in a calm and and cheerful mood. A special kind of music
(res=
embling a superb combination of Krish=CC=F1a's flute, Shiva's damaru and
Sa=
raswati's Vi=F1a or Sitara) is played in this time-period. The divine music=

flows across the serene atmosphere of the ashram. The sadhakas (students)
=
are given instructions to let their minds get immersed in the divine music
=
through deep mental and emotional absorption. As the snakes are attracted b=
y
the typical sound of a lyre (bina) and begin to dance in the tune of its
=
music, similarly, during the above practice, the sadhakas' thoughts and
emo=
tions begin to flow with the melodious currents of the special musical
mani=
festation of Nada.

Those endowed with the piety of character and are emoti=
onally soft or have
strong control over the mental power of imagination, us=
ually get rapid
success in linking their consciousness with the subtle form=
 of Nada. Others,
who do not have such qualities, should not feel depressed=
 because the
above-mentioned practice is based on the principle of the inhe=
rent
relationship between divine music and the human consciousness and ther=
efore
brings fruits in every case. If they were honestly trying in their
da=
y-to-day life to inculcate purity and strength of character, they would
als=
o be able to illuminate their mental and emotional levels and train
themsel=
ves for Nada Yoga by this simple 'exercise' of listening to the
special com=
position of spiritually sonorous music. The sadhanas of Bindu
Yoga also hel=
p increase mental concentration.

The simplest kind of Bindu Yoga Sadhanas =
begins with trataka - concentration
on the tip of the flame of a lamp or a =
candle for a few seconds then to
'visualize' its illumination in the centra=
l part of the forehead (little
above the middle of the eyebrows) with close=
d eyes; again open the eyes to
focus at the flame's tip and repeat the same=
 cycle several times. In a
similar manner, the ears and the mind together c=
ould also be trained to
listen to the divine music. The elementary steps of=
 Nada Yoga consist of -
meditating upon the internal sounds of the body by =
closing the ears and
keeping the other sense organs in a relaxed condition =
under properly
controlled, silent surroundings. One gradually begins to per=
ceive clearly
the sound of gaseous flows, heartbeats, the flute-like sound =
of the breath,
subtle sound of fluidic flows inside the body, etc. With dee=
per
concentration, the lab-Aab sound of heartbeats begins to sound louder l=
ike a
Aamaru. Successively one hears the sounds that resemble that of tinkl=
ing of
bells, blow of a conch shell at a long distance, etc.
Those who find=
 it difficult to concentrate upon the internal sounds of the
body should ta=
ke support of external sound of soothing music. After playing
musical instr=
uments like sitara or ikatara or flute etc, or, after listening
to their so=
ft, soothing music with the help of a tape recorder for about 10
to 15 minu=
tes in a quiet room, the sadhaka should close his ears and attempt
mental p=
erception of the echo of the same musical sound. He should repeat
this cycl=
e several times every day for gradually longer durations (not more
than an =
hour). He should keep the mind stress-free. Slowly and steadily, the
mind w=
ould get trained to naturally 'play or listen' this music internally
withou=
t the help of any external devices.

The Pacific Ocean remains calm because=
 of lighter pressure of air and more
concentration of salt as compared to t=
he Atlantic Ocean, where the currents
of water usually rise very high and a=
re prone to storms. The hard-hearted
people are like the Pacific Ocean; the=
ir emotions remain dull in spite of
mental inspirations. The soft and compa=
ssionate ones are just the opposite.
Like the waves in the Atlantic Ocean, =
their emotional currents are easily
activated and rise high by the force of=
 divine inspirations. The emotional
piety and mental determination together=
 lend extraordinary support in the
sadhanas of different tanmatras.

The sa=
dhakas who have aggressive mentality or who are emotionally rude,
often fin=
d it difficult to perform the sadhanas of mastery over the
tanmatras. The t=
raining with the help of music that is specifically designed
for the Nada Y=
oga Sadhanas (of the shabdatanmatra), however, works
wonderfully on such sa=
dhakas too. It is said that the poisonous 'snake' of
the vicious, agile min=
d also begins to 'dance' in the tune of the bina of
holy  Nada and comes un=
der proper control by musical practices of Nada Yoga.
This is because sonor=
ous, soft music generates a soothing impact on the
sentimental core of the =
listener. The simple exercises associated with the
practice of Nada Yoga in=
deed offer peace and stability to the sadhaka's mind
and help in enlighteni=
ng his intrinsic emotional and mental qualities
necessary for higher-level =
sadhanas.

During the initial stages of success in this practice, one hears=
 varieties
of sounds ranging from the physiological tremors to those of the=
 types of
thunderbolts to the divine music of a vi=F1a or a sitara inside t=
he body. By
further training and meditation, the mind begins to identify an=
d remember
these sounds. It is at this stage that one can analyze the types=
 and
durations of the physiological tremors to 'know' the condition of the =
body
exactly like the doctors do by analyzing the sonic patterns heard with=
 the
help of a stethoscope or an echocardiogram.

At the higher stages of t=
he sadhanas of Nada Yoga, the specific sounds
experienced during meditation=
 could be correlated with the state of mind and
sentiments. At further adva=
nced stages, the subliminal sounds of the etheric
vibrations are heard from=
 within and recognized. A spiritually elevated mind
can grasp the divine me=
ssages (if any) hidden in such occult sounds. An
accomplished yogi of the N=
ada Yoga can activate the subliminal communication
links of his inner self =
with the divine energies. Eventually, comes the
ultimate realization of the=
 omnipresent, eternal sound of Om.
