Sri Narasimha Garu,

Thanks you for the beautiful explanation. 

I'm not ve=
ry clear on some of the points you have mentioned:

is it that everything t=
hat is happening to us in this life is all reaction to some of our past act=
ions?it is difficult for me to understand this. 
To me, it can also be that=
 someone is pushing this suffering onto us as his action than a reaction of=
 our old karmas. 
In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know it cle=
arly why should we sit back and just let things happen against us, why shou=
ld we not fight back?

Thanks
KK

 When you karmically push an object with some force and that object pushes =
you back karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it is not=
 necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to push again. You =
pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That is reacti=
on. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has nothing to do =
with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and apply some forc=
e NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction later.

nd stability does have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness=
) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who lo=

Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If th=
e binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound from tha=
t limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So any em=
bodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets reborn,=
 this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and environment and re=
-attached to another body and environment. Nature tracks this change. Just =
as post office delivers all mail addressed to your old apartment to your ne=
w apartment when you change address, Nature delivers the reactions of all p=
revious life actions to the sense of I-ness in this life.

one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver =
the reactions to various previous actions from that being. Death of wife in=
 an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an election, being criticized =
by thousand people, being hit by wife, being abused by husband, being kille=
d by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions=
 to previous actions. As long as one's sense of I-ness is bound to a body, =
Nature will continue to deliver reactions to previous actions. If one gets =
an Oscar award as a result of previous good karma, it is not necessary that=
 one should be happy or excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction fro=

happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necess=
ary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Na=
ture to one's bad karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him=
. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you=
 now. How you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old action-re=

way. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new karmas=
. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged =
for that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction to =
your own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the action=
, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you). =
If you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off your =
karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from che=
ating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you will =
have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts without i=
ncurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described below. =
Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with=
 a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the righ=
t thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of "=
I am doing this") as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts=
 and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.
