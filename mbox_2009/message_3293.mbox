2. Silk - I am not really sure if it is mandatory to kill the cocoons for m=
aking silk. This may very well be the way silk is extracted now! Every thin=
g is so commercialised. Once, people used to cut only the dry branches and =
was concerned that they do not want to make a tree loose its green branches=
. Now a days, world leaders argue poluting the environment is their right a=
nd only negotiate on the amount of polution that may be allowed!

3. Prayer=
 and Mantra are two different things! Prayers does not have any language ba=
rriers. Mantras on the other hand are composed by/revealed to great sages a=
nd passed on. If a great sage belonging to your language has passed on mant=
ras in local language, they can very well be used.

Pronounciations and Vib=
rations are important, but, the involvement and concentration are perhaps m=
ore required. I feel more bliss full when I sit silent with out any mantra =
and try my best to avoid thoughts.

Best regards,
Vijay
