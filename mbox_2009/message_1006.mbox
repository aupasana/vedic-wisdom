Dear ALL,


*The Science of Sleep-2*
   In this wonderful creation of God =
there are many creatures who do not
sleep at all and yet remain healthy and=
 happy, and are able to perform all
their activities perfectly well. Ants d=
o not sleep; nor do blackbucks, and
antelopes. Horses take their nap in sta=
nding postures. There have been some
humans too who did not sleep in their =
entire lives. There is a case of one
particular lawyer who never slept righ=
t from his childhood to death.
Contrariwise, there is a 'Kumbhakarni sleep.=
' Kumbhakaran, a character in
the Ramayan, used to sleep for six months at =
a stretch. These are some of
the puzzling aspects of sleep which yet remain=
 unsolved.

The yogic concept is that sleep undergoes a transformation at t=
he apex level
of Samadhi. Here occurs the final resolution of sleep, which =
comes as a
climax of the yogic progression. But where is its starting point=
? Which are
the factors which hamper sleep, and which ones are helpful? Mod=
ern
psychologists are making inroads into the hidden layers of sleep and ha=
ve
come out with interesting results. According to them excessive brooding =
is
inimical to sleep, and so is negative thinking.

Lack of sleep is extrem=
ely injurious to mental and physical health.
Statistics reveal that one sle=
epless night reduces work efficiency by the
same extent as is caused by hig=
h level of alcohol in blood. Lack of sleep
disturbs the rhythm of internal =
biological cycle and the body consequently
is restricted to utilize only 60=
 =96 75% of its capacity. One sleepless night
can bring about a reduction o=
f up to 30% in our thinking capacity. Inability
to take a correct decision,=
 irritability, uncontrolled anger, temporary
lapses of memory =96 all these=
 are some other ill-effects of insomnia.

Prolonged lack of sleep has a dir=
ect bearing on diseases like heart aliment,
hypertension, diabetes etc. In =
extreme cases, even sudden cardiac arrest may
occur. Lack of sleep means me=
tabolic and hormonal imbalance. It results in
obesity, acidity and even ulc=
ers. The immune system is weakened, and the
body falls prey to many kinds o=
f viral and other infections. According to
doctors, pain below the waist an=
d headache are a result of insufficient
sleep. It slows down the reaction t=
o situations of depression, frustration
and anxiety. Continued lack of slee=
p puts the nervous system in a high state
of agitation. It hampers the func=
tioning of neurotransmitters and thereby
starts a cycle of multiple nervous=
 and mental disorders with serious
complications. Not only the lack but als=
o the excess of sleep is harmful.
Studies show that women who oversleep dam=
age the functioning of their
hearts. During sleep, the coronary veins shrin=
k and its excess may invite
cardiac arrest.

Researchers of the Harvard Med=
ical School claim to have identified the
precise link in the chemical chain=
 that regulates the sleep cycle of the
body. This is the T.G.F. Alpha chemi=
cal found in either side of the brain.
The leader of this research team say=
s that the sensors in hypothalamus catch
signals from not only the brain bu=
t also retina of the eyes. This is because
T.G.F. Alpha is formed in the re=
tina too. Its implication is that the
quantum of light that enters the eye,=
 and its duration both affect the
biological clock of the body. For this re=
ason the sleeping-waking pattern
keeps changing with the gradual change in =
seasons.

We can rid ourselves of the problem of insomnia by a proper under=
standing of
the art of living. If the life style is orderly, food and diet =
is satwik,
and thinking is positive there will not be any problem of sleep.=
 What is
more, with the help of various techniques of yoga sleep can even b=
e mastered
and harnessed into some extraordinary uses.
