 loans, i have started writing script for Television serial as a part time =
job. I am doing this script writing work since past 4-5 years. Considering =
my creative talents and good language control (not praising myself)I am get=
ting good assignments of writing TV serials.



All daily soap television s=
erials are glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.. enemities.. So=
metimes i am feeling guilty of writing scenes which shows  Conflicts betwee=
n SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts between BROTHE=
