Namaste,

The best will be to do it as a separate thing using its manual.

If you look at the regular procedure in homam manual, you will see a section 
for invoking deity in fire. In the super-short procedure, we just invite the 
deity into fire and request to be established in fire. In step 5 of the bare 
minimum procedure, you think of a deity and start offering into fire 
assuming the deity is already in fire.

*        *        *

I want to clarify one thing. You can invite someone to your house by writing 
a formal invitation letter. You can invite someone by sending a small note. 
You can invite someone by a small word orally. There are many ways. Whether 
one actually comes to your house or not and how long one stays is not 
necessarily dependent on how detailed and formal your invitation is. One 
guest receiving a detailed invitation letter may drop by for just a few 
minutes. Another friend may come and stay for a day even if you casually ask 
"what are you doing this Saturday" and not formally invite.

Similarly, how much of divine presence your homam (or any ritual) attracts 
is independent of what procedure you used to call the deity. It depends on 
your purity, the nature of the place and time and, above all, the kindness 
of the deity at that particular time. Based on the best of your learning and 
ability, use a procedure that you think is appropriate. But do remember that 
procedures are secondary and devotion and faith are primary.

Best regards,
Narasimha
