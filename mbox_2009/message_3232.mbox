Namaste,
 
I have been extremely busy at work for a while now and will cont=
inue to be, working long hours everyday. I just saw a few mails from the ve=
getarianism thread. Just a few quick points.
 
*        *        *
 
Self-i=
dentification of human beings and animals with body and body parts is much =
much stronger and denser than that of plants and trees. Self-identification=
 of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is pluc=
ked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very =
subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a huma=
n being, the emotion experienced is much stronger. Even after death, an ani=
mal may identify with the body and think of it as "I".
 
The kaarmik debt f=
ormed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal's mind considers a=
s a part of "I" and is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik =
debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or =
killing bacteria.
 
As long as we live in a physical body, creation of new =
kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create =
newly.
 
*        *        *
 
You are what you eat. Our body and various c=
hemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.
 
Meat is high=
ly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and ident=
ification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all,=
 if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, =
the quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not condu=
cive to spiritual progress.
 
*        *        *
 
It is possible that a s=
piritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However,=
 it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identific=
ation with the body and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saatt=
wik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).
=
 
If a meat-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, gre=
ens and lentils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read=
 spiritual literature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see t=
hat it makes a big difference.
 
*        *        *
 
Someone mentioned th=
at Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like thi=
s, there is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not b=
acked by specific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified b=
y scholars are best ignored.
 
Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have giv=
en a clarion call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that =
does not require eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of m=
eat eating.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
