Namaskar Narsimha,

I have a further doubt on the silk cloth query.In some =
Pooja texts, they explcitly mention cotton or silk .The reason the texts ci=
te is that cotton and silk are more receptive to sattvic energies from the =
idol or Pooja etc. All synthetics like nylon, polyester etc, they say will =
attract only rajas guna.

Please throw some light on this aspect.

Thanks
S=
uchitra

 (1) In practical physical terms, cow milk is a simple and nutritious food =
with plenty of poteins and easy to digest. It is very saattwik and has many=

 Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. When one's self=

 Sanskrit captures that well.

hat is because one's shakti works through one's words and other tangible ac=

y great yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of th=
eir shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of tha=
t shakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras compose=
d by great souls like Adi Shankara.

w can milk be considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being a=
