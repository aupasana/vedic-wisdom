Dear Sir,
Thanks a lot. For years together we are reading these words in Ma=
ntras but now the vision is clear. I remember, once I had decided to start =
one Anushanam to please Lord Hanumanji in my worst days. The Mantra I had s=
elected was=C2=A0 -"Aum Ham Hanumate rudratmakaya Hum Phat"-. But before I =
start, some experienced person stopped me saying that if you can not mainta=
in Brahmacharya you do not start Anusthanam with this mantra as this is a s=
trong live-wire Mantra. Instead do only Hanumat VadVanal Stotra daily 11 ti=
mes. I then had done Vad Vanal Stotra with Hanuman Chalisa and got protecti=
on from evil forces created by my bad period that time. I was happy with th=
e grace of Lord Hanumanji. Thanks Sir.

Dr.Ashwin Rawal

Namaste,
=C2=A0
Namah simply refers to bowing to a deity.
=C2=A0
Swaah=
aa is from the word su. It refers to hailing a deity and=C2=A0surrendering =
to the deity. It is used when making offerings to various deities.
=C2=A0

=
Swadhaa is from the root swad, which means to taste and fulfill a desire. I=
t is used when making offerings to pitris (ancestors), who have strong unfi=
lfilled desires.
=C2=A0Vashat is from the root vash, which means to control=
 and command. It is used when one wants to control the energy and channeliz=
e it.
=C2=A0
Hum refers to creating a cover. It=C2=A0is used when=C2=A0seek=
ing a protective cover of some nature.
=C2=A0
Vaushat is also like vashat. =
It is used when one wants control over one's vision and observation.
=C2=A0=

Phat is the sound of leaving an arrow. It is used when seeking something s=
pecific and leaving a mantra towards the target like an arrow.
=C2=A0
Some =
mantras ending in phat also have a hum and end with "hum phat". It is used =
when one seeks to strike a target while protecting self.
=C2=A0
Mantras end=
ing in Vashat and Phat should be used carefully. They are inappropriate for=
 most people in this age.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
BTW, do not write =
phat as fatt. The sound "f" (as in "fan") does NOT exist in Sanskrit. It ca=
me to Indian languages through the Arabic influence on Hindi and now many I=
ndians get confused between ph and f. The sound ph in Sanskrit words such a=
s phat and phala is pronounced as a strongly=C2=A0aspirated p. It is not pr=
onounced as f in fan.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

Dear Narsimhaji,
Certain Mantras are ending with Nam=
ah
Certain ending with Swaha
Certain with Vashat, some with Vaushat, some w=
ith Hum and some with Fatt.
Sir, I would like to know in details as to what=
 is the real meaning of each word.=C2=A0 What they indicate? When they shou=
ld be uttered?
It is general belief that Swaha is used only for Homam. But =
it is not so as certain Mantras are ending with Swaha.=C2=A0=C2=A0 e.g. --A=
um Hram Hrim Hraum Sah Suryaya Swaha.-- Even in Tarpanam we are using Swaha=
. - Aum Tarpayami Swaha, Gam Tarpayami Swaha, Glaum Tarpayami Swaha and lik=
e. 
Your valuable comments will enrich our knowledge.
