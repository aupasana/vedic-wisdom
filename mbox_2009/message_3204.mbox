Namaskaram.

I recently visited youtube videos while I was searching for a =
homa vidhanam manual for Lord Subrahmanya. I was wondering - whether you co=
uld kindly make one for Lord Muruga? I would very much appreciate it. I hav=
e had a long desire to do homam for him but am unable to find anyone or mea=
ns to do so. Also, a video on youtube showing how to do one be a wonderful =
addition too. Kindly consider my request.

Thanking you in advance,

sincer=
ely,
