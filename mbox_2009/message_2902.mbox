Respected Narasimhaji

Maybe I am wrong but I heard that Sri Ramakrishna su=
ffered coz he undertook the bearing of sins of many of his disciples specia=
lly Girish Ghosh.If this be true is it not that the disease was intentional=
ly suffered when he could have healed himself if he wanted.
Can we really j=
udge a spiritual monument like Sri Ramakrishna astrologically?
We often ana=
lyse analyse charts of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna.Though I am a firm believer=
 an student in astrology i often doubt is it viable to judge avatars astrol=
ogically as they themselves are prayed for 
propitation of some planets?

n. Similarly, some experiences from past lives remain in chitta as subconsc=
ious memories that influence our thinking in future lives, but many specifi=
c memories are lost.
