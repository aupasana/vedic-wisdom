Dear Utpal,

You don't have to say long vowel "aa" at the end. A short vowel "a" is 
correct at the end of "Shiva", "Raama" etc. If you are already pronouncing 
like that, then you are fine. I am not sure of the conventions in your part 
of India. But, many north Indians do pronounce it as "Shiv" or "Raam" and 
end the word in a consonant (v or m) without an "a" at the end. THAT is 
wrong.

Best regards,
Narasimha
