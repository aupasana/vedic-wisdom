Namaste,

Veda is for self-realization. Veda deals with various aspects of dual a=
nd non-dual self. There are hardly any good translations or commentaries on=
 Veda in today's world. Aurobindo's commentary (on a small number of riks) =
is the only intelligent commentary I have come across.
=C2=A0
Just as Adi S=
ankara devoted his life to commenting on some Upanishads, someone like him =
needs to come and devote life to commenting on Veda, if we are to have a go=
od commentary. Actually, Vivekananda commented on his last day (1902 July 4=
) on the commentaries on Veda. He had his disciples read a verse from Sukla=
 Yajur Veda, read the commentary by Mahidhara and said that Mahidhara's int=
erpretation did not appeal to his mind. He connected the verse to some late=
r day tantra concepts and wished that his disciples would make an attempt a=
t fresh independent interpretation of mantras from Veda, as the existing=C2=
=A0commentaries=C2=A0were not good. This was one of the last few desires ex=
pressed by Vivekananda before he gave up his body.
=C2=A0
Aurobindo said th=
at he had a vision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda e=
xplained some things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with =
a sublime commentary on some Vedic verses in later years.

Do not trust any commentary on Veda. More so the one at the we=
bsite you mentioned. I checked out a few verses. The translations given by =
them are usually quite silly. Ignore that website.

Commenting on a verse from Veda is different. It is not merely an in=
tellectual activity requiring scholarship and logical thinking.
=C2=A0
I=C2=
=A0cannot give a complete sense of what this verse is saying (will try late=
r), but can give an overall big picture first. The verses around this verse=
 alternate between having Pururava as the rishi (seer) and Urvashi as the d=
evata (deity) and having Urvashi as the rishi (deity) and Pururava as the d=
evata (deity). This is an exchange between Pururava and Urvashi as they pur=
sued each other. You can read various puranic stories about Pururava, the g=
reat king from Chandra vamsha, and Urvashi, the beautiful apsara (celestial=
 nymph). They were attracted to each other and lived together on earth. The=
y are personifications of some qualities inside us.
=C2=A0
Urvashi comes fr=
om ura and vasha. It means one who has the power to control and pull the he=
art. Urvashi is personification of the attraction that pulls one's heart to=
wards various objects in the field of duality. As a sadhaka does great tapa=
scharya and starts to overcome duality, Urvashi is sent to test one. Urvash=
i successfully seducing a sadhaka and disturbing his tapascharya means that=
 the sadhaka succumbed to the power of attraction that pulled his heart tow=
ards objects and his heart desired something.
=C2=A0
Pururava means a cryin=
g a lot or crying majestically. He is a personification of the emotional na=
ture and compassion within us. No wonder he is a king in the Chandra vamsha=
. The solar and lunar lineages that are popular in the scriptures have to d=
o with the solar and lunar channels - Pingala and Ida (respectively) . Ida =
nadi is the channel of emotions, intuition, feeling, compassion etc. So Pur=
urava is from that lineage.
=C2=A0
While everyone is charmed by Urvashi - t=
he power of attraction that binds one's heart, Urvashi herself was charmed =
by Pururava, the majestic and noble king. Pururava rescued Urvashi from a d=
emon once. The majestic and noble quality of compassion saves the power of =
attraction from having to combine with meaner motives. One's heart=C2=A0can=
 be pulled towards various objects out of the spirit of self-gratification =
(a demon) or out of kindness and compassion (Pururava). When compassion ari=
ses in one's heart, then the heart's attraction to others is driven by comp=
assion rather than the spirit of self-gratification.
=C2=A0
The verses you =
referred to are a dialog between the personification of compassion and pers=
onification of the power of attraction that pulls one's heart towards vario=
us objects. This whole series of verses has to be interpreted in abstract a=
nd internalized terms. It is not a commentary on men and women at all.
=C2=
=A0
More later..

Dear Narasimhaji and others

Can you kindly=
 explain the meaning of the following verse from the Rig Veda:

Is this tran=
