Namaste Narasimhaji,

In some books they outline agni chakra, and they also=
 indicate that homam done on certain days is good i.e. if the fire resides =
on earth. But if the fire of the havan resides is in heaven (loss of life) =
or patal loka (loss of wealth). Should we be concerned with this or can we =
go about doing homam at any day and time?
