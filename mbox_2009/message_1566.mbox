We can offer taranam to any diety.

For Mahaganapati, we say mahagaNapatim =
tarpayaami
For Narasimha, we can say narasimha: tRpyataam
Like wise we can =
use dwitiya vibhakthi and say tarpayami or say prathama vibhakhti and say t=
Rpyataam

I suppose it is 
... swaahaa| Om Sri Mahalakshmi: tRpyataam
... s=
waahaa| Om Sri Sanaischara: tRpyataam
... swaahaa| Om Sri Kuja: tRpyataam
.=
.. swaahaa| Om Sri Sadasiva: tRpyataam

so on so.

When I invoke multiple d=
eities, I do tarpanam for each.

Best regards,
Vijay
