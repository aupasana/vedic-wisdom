 Such was his love for the young sadhaka from a lower caste. Ramakrishna al=
so freely associated with fallen drunkards (e.g. Girish and Kalipad) and tu=
rned them into devoted men of god. He once took the "karmik power of attorn=
ey" from Girish and told him, "you are free to do whatever you want. Drink,=
 pursue women and do whatever you want. Nothing will happen to you. Each ba=
d karma performed by you will come to me." Girish continued his debauched l=
ifestyle for some more time, but reformed later. Whenever he did something =
bad, he could not stand the thought that Ramakrishna was to receive the kar=
mik punishment. So he reformed. In later days, Swami Vivekananda held Giris=
h in great respect and Girish touched many lives. Though some believe that =
Ramakrishna's throat cancer was because of taking on Girish's karmas, obvio=
usly he thought it was worth it. It had several purposes.
