 A cow can produce more milk than what is needed by its calf. People in the=
 old days never deprived calves of mother's milk and took milk after the ca=
lf was fed. Instead, if one deprives the calf and steals all the milk (like=
 many factories may be doing), that karma will follow the milk and go to va=
rious people handling, using and consuming that milk, in different proporti=
ons.

 Putting so many worms in boiling water and killing them is negative karma.=
 I feel far more comfortable putting in homam fire a cotton cloth made from=
 a tree than putting a silk cloth made by killing many worms. Though silk c=
lothes are fashionable in religious ceremonies now, one cannot be sure whet=
her this was a custom in ancient times or the current silk is a substitute =
for another kind of cloth made non-violently in ancient times.

ot clearly understand the motivation/rationale/spirit behind a custom, they=

ng idols with nice looking plastic flowers and plastic flower garlands. Pla=
stic is a really bad substitute for a real flower. People only use them for=
 decorating idols and do not put them in homam fire, but who knows, people =
may start offering plastic flowers in homam fire after a few hundred years.=

ocus point). As one tries to focus the mind on a deity/mantra and give up a=

hours or days or years or lives) when mind will let all other thoughts go. =
Mind will then reverberate with the mantra, with no other thoughts in it wh=
atsoever. One forgets oneself completely and gets absorbed in the mantra *f=
ully*. That is when one *experiences* a mantra and a deity.

 by many great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. If you want=
 to tie a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope was tested=
 before, it may be good to use that rope.

sounds in Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation to the =
subtle body. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the subtl=

experience other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with different =
sounds. Sanskrit captures that well.

> Thirdly, each tangible article=
 (such as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy o=
f persons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of word=
s, it may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination of=
 words with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence on=
e writes when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have any =
impact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind after=
 a lot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more
> =A0
> Th=
at is because one's shakti works through one's words and other tangible act=
ions. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or used by=
 great yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of the=
ir shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of that=
 shakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras composed=
 by great souls like Adi Shankara.
