Namaste,
 
I was reading a small interview by Deepak Chopra on Michael Jack=
son. Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into prescription =
medicines and how that ruins some people's lives. That somehow reminded me =
of a story.
 
Sometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show his c=
hart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brilliant fro=
m the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations. I de=
clared, "this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of a san=
nyasi (ascetic/monk)." She broke down into tears and gave me some backgroun=
d. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mother d=
oes not want him to.
 
This boy had been calm, peaceful, contented and an i=
ntrovert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he had an inter=
esting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was teaching mat=
h to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices. Suddenly, h=
e stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for a while. Hi=
s mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind returned to norm=
alcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense of bli=
ss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.
 
He real=
ized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in front of what he ex=
perienced then. He did not want to study or do anything anymore. He only wa=
nted to experience that state. His parents became worried and took him to d=
octors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found nothing. He w=
as also confined to a mental facility for one month. They put him on powerf=
ul drugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doctors that t=
here was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understand what he =
experienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he was normal and had n=
o problem. The powerful drugs he received during the month wreaked havoc on=
 him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doctors. He says he und=
erstands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He does not want=
 to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but does not know how to=
 get it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material life will n=
ot get him what he wants.
 
When I chatted with him alone, I realized that =
he is a brilliant young man with clear thinking. He is certainly not a mad =
person. He just needs someone to show him a spiritual path to make somethin=
g permanent, which temporarily came to him and left him! To get it permanen=
tly now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also took him to many =
so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice given anyone. =
He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and liked some of them.=
 But he is still without a clear direction.
 
Interestingly, just when I wa=
s about to chat with this person after making his parents leave, my guru Ma=
nish called me. He asked me what was going on. I mentioned that I was about=
 to talk to a teenager who had a nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, ch=
ecked it out and confirmed my feeling that this boy had great spiritual pot=
ential.
 
Unfortunately, the system we have in place looked at him with sus=
picion and gave powerful drugs to mess up his mind for one full month! He i=
s lucky and survived the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live in tha=
t someone who realizes, albeit momentarily, the essence of scriptures, is l=
abeled as a mentally disturbed person and powerful drugs are given to him, =
instead of clear spiritual direction to make that realization more permanen=
t.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
