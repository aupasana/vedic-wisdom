Namaste, 

For the past few days, few questions as listed below are confusi=
ng 
me. Hoping to get this blockages cleared from learned gurus. 

-----
"N=
othing in this world moves without the will of God"
-----

1. I can underst=
and this with regard to action/reaction philosophy 
but with regard to free=
 will, how do we interpret the above 
statement? e.g., murdering innocent p=
eople is an action done by 
one's free will (agami karma) How to understand=
 this "murder" 
incident with the "Will of God". 

2. How to understand/int=
erpret the "will of God" in a natural 
catastrophe kind of situation ? (E.g=
., Tsumani disaster or 
EarthQuake disaster, leading to mass deaths of hund=
reds of lives?)

Thanks & Regards, 
--Murahari

There is n=
o single correct answer. The answer appropriate for one 
person is inapprop=
riate for another. If I say "God is the doer of 
all things. When Arjuna ki=

unfortunate. But that will be a very ap=

 ownership over his 
actions and need to give it up.

In the world of
