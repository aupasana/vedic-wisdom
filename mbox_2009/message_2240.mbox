Namaste,
 
It is all a matter of shakti. If one controls mind for enough time and resists all impulses, one can do unbelievable things. However, if shakti accumulated by controlling the mind for many years is wasted on a silly impulse, that will be foolish.
 
Bottomline is this: Most people who can still perform black magic in today's times are small sadhakas with very low amount of shakti and hence very little capability. More advanced sadhakas who have accumulated a lot of shakti also know its value and do not waste it on useless things.
 
Remember one basic fact. Selfish actions with heavy self-identification bring heavy karma to bear in future. Selfless actions still containing self-identification (i.e. you are not doing for yourself and doing for your guru or king or country etc, but still have an idea that "*I* am doing this") also bring karma, though a bit lighter, to bear in future. Only actions with zero self-identification bring no karma. If one completely overcomes self-identification and roams around as a jeevanmukta (liberated while living) with no individual will, one will then become a vessel for fulfilling Nature's will. Any destructive acts performed by such a person are Nature's will. Such people are of course rare.
 
If someone performs black magic on you, accept it, surrender to the Lord and take it as a payback for some of your previous karmas. And, as far as you yourself are concerned, realize that it is foolish to think of doing black magic and harming or controlling anyone. First, focus on your spiritual sadhana and on your liberation. If Nature wants you to do some important negative work, Nature will arrange for it. This being Kali yuga, all sensitive knowledge that has potential for abuse has been corrupted by Nature. You cannot learn it from books. If you have a rina with some knowledge, it will come to you. Most important thing is to work on your attitude and strive for liberation.
 
I guess the simple answer to your question on why such knowledge exists is that Nature may need it to correct some imbalances now and then. However, stay away from such things at any cost, as long as you have an individual self-identification and ego.
 
A word on destruction:
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once had an interesting vision of the Mother. He first saw her as a beautiful lady who gave birth to a child. Then he saw that she brought up the child. When the child grew up, he saw that she put a cruel face and ate him up. This whole vision summed up the cycle of creation and destruction to him. The *Shakti* of Supreme Cosmic Being gives rise to the Trinity and acts through them to create, sustain and destroy. What Ramakrishna saw was that Shakti in action.
 
Destruction is as important a function in this dual world as is Creation, though people are afraid of it. After all, what is being created and what is being destroyed? The true Self, as Krishna taught in Bhagavad Gita, is neither created nor destroyed. It is an illusion, within the field of duality, that is being created and destroyed. Like an object being created and destroyed in a dream.
 
Thus, destruction is not to be feared. However, as long as you are bound by duality, all of your actions will receive their corresponding reactions later. If you are afraid of your own destruction (when bound by duality), do not cause destruction to someone else.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Recently I was chatting to someone online that mentioned indrajal. I gathered 
from our chat that it was something to do with black magic. 
> 
> When I got home today, I asked my grandmother and she refused to tell me what 
it was. I googled it and came across as it being a book of tantra dealing with 
the darker aspects- potential to damage others. 
> 
> On one of the books, there is a picture of Ma Kali. And one shop that sells it 
online mentions Das MahaVidya. 
> 
> So my question is, if all these mantras that exist that can harm other people, 
who empowers these mantras? I really find it hard to believe that Ma will give 
power to people to harm others. 
> 
> I do know from Vedic stories about devas granting boons to demons, for 
example- Hiranyakashipu's story. But, considering we are in Kali Yuga, does this 
still happen? People are more likely to die from AIDS, cancer etc, so whats the 
big deal with black magic? Is this just childish superstition or all part of a 
larger work of karma?
