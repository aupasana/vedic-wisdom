Subject: Proper Ganesha Bija Pronunciation?

Hello Narasimha,

If have a quick but maybe not so simple question. I have =
heard various
versions of the Ganesha bija. According to my knowledge, the =
two most
common iterations are "Gam" and "Gang". However, I was recently
sp=
eaking with someone who is somewhat well versed in Sanskrit and he
told me =
that that the aforementioned two versions are both incorrect,
at least from=
 a phonetic viewpoint. 

So my question then: How should one pronounce the =
Ganesha bija while
doing Japa? I would really like to know the technically =
precise way,
if at all possible to learn via this medium.


Many Thanks.
