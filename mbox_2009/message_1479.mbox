Dear Utpalji,

I completely "ECHO" with you, the words from sri PVRji are e=
ver enlightening.

In the past, I have read lot of books, some with doubt t=
hat is what these guys explaining is really "REAL"? or????.....well that wa=
s when i ws in my initial stages about a decade back ..still in teens..

An=
d then slowly started reading more and more and got convinced that "probabl=
y" this is all for "REAL" and people are really experiencing the bliss with=
in..

Now got to a stage that no amount of reading is helpful unless you re=
ally sit and "EXPERIENCE" this bliss "WITHIN YOU"..and right at that junctu=
re i came accross PVRji's astrology lectures and started listening to them.=
.infact more than astrology i was lured to his spiritual bent of mind and t=
hinking and his lucid explanation of various things..that's when i decided =
to drop everything else..and just follow his advice and got seriously embar=
ked on the spiritual path..i have been doing homama over the weekends regul=
arly..and sincea about 1 month i'm doing it everyday...true to to his words=
.. i can see lot of change in myself..the way i feel and react etc..

I kno=
w i'm still at the rockbottom of the path and have my way to uphill as comp=
ared to many learned and spirituallly advanced souls even in this list..i j=
ust want to follow the advice of PVRji and perhaps be able to to loose "mys=
elf" in the "god".

Thanks
Krishna Kanth
