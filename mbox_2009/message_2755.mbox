Namaste,
=C2=A0
Was going through some writings of Aurobindo=
 and found a very interesting and apt piece on what can be called as the in=
termediate zone in sadhana. This is precisely the area where one would find=
 the maximum amount of spiritual wreckage. Without a strong sense of the fu=
nadamentals or a good guru, most spiritual people tend to fall prey to this=
 area of psychological hallucinations. Read below.

>From Wikipedia:

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through =
an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination,=
 light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible,=
 which can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions =
of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted a=
s full spiritual realisation. He asserted that one can pass through this zo=
ne and the associated spiritual dangers without harm by perceiving its real=
 nature and seeing through the half-lights and tempting but imperfect and o=
ften mixed and misleading experiences. But he taught, those who go astray i=
n it, following false voices and mendacious guidance, may end in a spiritua=
l disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whol=
e truth or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional plan=
es, which he stated happens to many sadhaks and yogis. 
=C2=A0

This is in =
fact an intermediary state, a zone of transition between the ordinary consc=
iousness in mind and the true yoga knowledge. One may cross without hurt th=
rough it, perceiving at once or at an early stage its real nature and refus=
ing to be detained by its half-lights and tempting but imperfect and often =
mixed and misleading experiences; one may go astray in it, follow false voi=
ces and mendacious guidance, and that ends in a spiritual disaster; or one =
may take up one=E2=80=99s abode in this intermediate zone, care to go no fa=
rther and build there some half-truth which one takes for the whole truth o=
r become the instrument of the powers of these transitional planes, - that =
is what happens to many sadhaks and yogis.
=E2=80=93 Sri Aurobindo, The Rid=
dle of the World, 36-7

The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with hum=
an wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer=
 but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man a=
nd the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psyc=
hological region which has been given various names in mystical literature.=
 It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of il=
lusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, med=
itation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once he=
re their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, t=
heir emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginat=
ive power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of fa=
ilure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious =
credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild...
