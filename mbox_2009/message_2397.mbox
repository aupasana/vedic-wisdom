THE CLAIMS OF RELIGION (Sunday, 5th January)
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses

This world is neither good nor evil. It is the Lord's world. It is beyond
both good and evil, perfect in itself. His will is going on, showing all
these different pictures; and it will go on without beginning and without
end. It is a great gymnasium in which you and I, and millions of souls must
come and get exercises, and make ourselves strong and perfect. This is what
it is for.

Not that God could not make a perfect universe; not that He could not help
the misery of the world. You remember the story of the young lady and the
clergyman, who were both looking at the moon through the telescope, and
found the moon spots. And the clergyman said, "I am sure they are the spires
of some churches." "Nonsense," said the young lady, "I am sure they are the
young lovers kissing each other." So we are doing with this world. When we
are inside, we think we are seeing the inside. According to the plane of
existence in which we are, we see the universe. Fire in the kitchen is
neither good nor bad. When it cooks a meal for you, you bless the fire, and
say, "How good it is!" And when it burns your finger, you say, "What a
nuisance it is!" It would be equally correct and logical to say: This
universe is neither good nor evil. The world is the world, and will be
always so. If we open ourselves to it in such a manner that the action of
the world is beneficial to us, we call it good.

What again is the goal of mankind? Is it happiness, sensuous pleasure? They
used to say in the olden time that in heaven they will play on trumpets and
live round a throne; in modern time I find that they think this ideal is
very weak, and they have improved upon it and say that they will have
marriages and all these things there. If there is any improvement in these
two things, the second is an improvement for the worse. All these various
theories of heaven that are being put forward show weakness in the mind. And
that weakness is here: First, they think that sense happiness is the goal of
life. Secondly they cannot conceive of anything that is beyond the five
senses.

Now comes the question: Can religion really do anything? It can.

Babies think that the happiness of the senses is the highest thing they can
have. Most of you know that there is a keener enjoyment in man in the
intellect than in the senses. No one of you can feel the same pleasure in
eating as a dog does. You can mark that. Where does the pleasure come from
in man? Not that whole-souled enjoyment of eating that the pig or the dog
has. See how the pig eats. It is unconscious of the universe while it is
eating; its whole soul is bound up in the food. It may be killed but it does
not care when it has food. Think of the intense enjoyment that the pig has!
No man has that. Where is it gone? Man has changed it into intellectual
enjoyment. The pig cannot enjoy religious lectures. That is one step higher
and keener yet than intellectual pleasures, and that is the spiritual plane,
spiritual enjoyment of things divine, soaring beyond reason and intellect.
To procure that we shall have to lose all these sense-enjoyments. This is
the highest utility. Utility is what I enjoy, and what everyone enjoys, and
we run for that.

We find that man enjoys his intellect much more than an animal enjoys his
senses, and we see that man enjoys his spiritual nature even more than his
rational nature. So the highest wisdom must be this spiritual knowledge. With
this knowledge will come bliss. All these things of this world are but the
shadows, the manifestations in the third or fourth degree of the real
Knowledge and Bliss.
