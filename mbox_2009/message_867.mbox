Namaste!!!

* I have just performed 7 Chandi Homam during Navaratri Days. T=
he 
first Chandi Homam took 4 Hours (Which included almost everything 
give=
n in Manual)

* When I took little short cut, it took 3 hours.

* It Takes =
me 1 hour 25 minutes to read Chandi Paath (13 
chapters).   

* In my opini=
on, Loud or Mental, it depends as to which way one is 
comfortable and enjo=
ys the Homam. As for me, i enjoy little loud 
chanting.

* If i write, does=
n't really mean gain of knowledge. I have done 
homam for say around 40 tim=
es. There may be members who are doing 
Homam for last 1 or 2 years without=
 making any fuss. I am not trying 
to be *artificially humble* but giving y=
ou the facts. My father 
often says `Bahu Ratnaani Vasudhara' . I am sure t=
here would be many 
Ratnaas on this group who likes to remain silent. On th=
e contrary I 
like to write if I feel like writing, without worrying about =

anything.

i would request you and others to address me as just Utpal.

* =
`Garu' is a Respectful word in Telugu Language.  Like `Shree'. I 
am addres=
sing Narasimha with `Garu' since some 3 years now. But I 
don't put `Ji' be=
cause it gives me feeling of distance. It is his 
greatness as he doesn't m=
ind even if I write his name without any 
pre or Suffix.  I address him var=
iedly as Garu / Narasimha Garu/Rao 
Garu/Narasimha. There is no consistency=
 in addressing him :) but I 
want to be consistent in following his spiritu=
al instructions.   

I apologize to the list if there were lot of valueless=
 writings in 
this message.

Best Regards,

Utpal
