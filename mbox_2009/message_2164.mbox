Namaste,

There are two ways - treat it as a homam to Mother Gayatri or treat it as a 
homam to Savita (Sun).

In the former, use Mahalakshmi homam as a template and replace Mahalakshmi 
with Gayatri. Both have same grammatical forms (e.g. 
Mahalakshmyai/Gayatryai, Mahalakshmim/Gayatrim etc) and it should be quite 
easy.

Technically, Gayatri is the chhandas (metre) and the deity of Savitru 
Gayatri mantra is Savita. So the latter approach makes more sense. For that 
approach, use Hanuman homam as the template and replace hanumaan, hanumataH, 
hanumantam, hanumat, hanumate and hanumaddhoma with savitaa, savituH, 
savitaaram, savitR^i, savitre and savitR^i gaayatrI homa respectively 
(ITrans notation). Replace "om ham hanumate namaH" with simply "om savitre 
namaH". For beeja, shakti and keelaka in invocation, use "om bhuuH", "om 
bhuvaH" and "om suvaH". For anga nyaasam and kara nyaasam also, use the same 
three repeated.

When I did daily Savitru Gayatri Homam for several months before settling 
down with Chandi homam finally, I used the latter approach. I actually 
invoked "saavitrI sameta savitaa" in fire (i.e. savitaa with his shakti, 
i.e. saavitrii), but that is not necessary. One can call Lakshmi and 
Narayana together or just call Narayana. Not much difference really! In any 
case, if you want to do the same thing I did, you can add "saavitrI sameta" 
before all of the above keywords.

Most important thing is to pronounce the main Gayatri mantra accurately and 
slowly. My gut feeling is that this homam will suit you. Good luck!

Best regards,
Narasimha
