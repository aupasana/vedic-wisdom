Dear ALL,
Namaste.

Human life is bound by inner duties and external respon=
sibilities. In order
that human greatness proliferates in both these areas =
culture and
civilizations have come into being which lay down the =91do=92s=
 and don=92ts=92 of
thinking and character carving. Culture is internal, Ci=
vility is external,
Spirituality is internal and Ethics is external. Spirit=
ual aims are attained
via its philosophy and a disciplined character helps =
in adherence of ethics.
The peripheries of all religious precepts that infl=
uence human glory in a
big way are limited to these 2 aspects. It has alrea=
dy been said that the
inner core of religion is spirituality and its outer =
shell is wholesome
social behavior laced with ethical activities. These are=
 the 4 pillars of
religion. If anyone requires more clarity on these the fo=
llowing paragraphs
can do the needful.

1) SPIRITUALITY: True spirituality =
exists where the psyche oozes with sacred
beliefs, faiths, aspirations, sen=
timents, zest and habits. The fount or root
source of man=92s personality a=
nd character lies here. It is that inspiration
which gives direction to the=
 mind=92s thinking process. If prejudices exist
they result in imaginations=
, arguments and logical proof. These in turn help
the intellect to take inf=
ormed decisions. The brain obeys commands emanating
from the deep recesses =
of our psyche. It finds ways of fulfilling that which
is pleasurable, it fi=
nds solutions for various problems and thus commands
the body to act as per=
 the directions of the inner psyche.

In a nutshell we can say that this in=
ner designing of the psyche decides
man=92s past history, endeavors of the =
present and destiny of future times.
This designing helps us measure man=92=
s inner stature. It is as a reaction of
this area that other individuals ap=
proach us as foes or friends. This is the
focal point that decides the dire=
ction of man=92s life. On its basis man
experiences a downfall or otherwise=
, joy or sorrow and success or failure.
Spiritual philosophy came into exis=
tence solely for the purpose of
overcoming demonic tendencies of the psyche=
 from their very roots and
replacing them with sacred qualities like divine=
 wisdom etc.

Spiritual philosophy is the foundation stone of attaining spi=
ritual
grandeur/greatness. The gigantic mould of Brahma Vidya (Divine Wisdo=
m) has
been cast so as to attain this divine glory. The fundamental aim of =
precepts
that talk of God, soul, demigods, other world, heaven, reincarnati=
on, fruits
of ones actions, salvation, hell, liberation, emancipation, devo=
tion,
spiritual practices, Sidhis (Divine Powers) etc. is to dissuade man f=
rom
imbibing lowly aspirations and instead aspire for higher peaks of human=

glory. For this various religions ordain mankind to absorb sacred thinking=

and act ethically in their day to day worldly transactions.

The fundament=
al basis of spirituality is refined faith. True faith is
certainly not the =
figment of ones wayward imagination. It should not be
labeled as =91doubt=
=92. Hence spiritual precepts are given a sound footing by
giving proof in =
the form of various scriptural injunctions, great speech of
Rishis, saints =
etc, divine inspirations, God=92s commands, discourses and
mythology. It is=
 left to Spiritual Philosophy to prove all this via logic,
precepts and sou=
nd arguments.


2) ETHICS AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR: Wholesome behavior enco=
mpasses
observations of ethics, integrity etc in ones professional and soci=
al life.
The chief aim of all religious scriptures is to make laws based on=
 ethics,
ideals etc. Smritis (Indian scriptures) have detailed man=92s inne=
r and
external (social) duties and responsibilities. It can be said to be a=
 vow or
resolve of imbibing sacred actions and duties. Duty is emphasized u=
pon and
rights are said to be secondary. Further mankind is urged to ignore=
 worries
related to enticements, fear, pressures etc and instead focus one =
pointedly
on an ethical and righteous way of living.

Ethics based scriptur=
es (Neeti Shastra) urges world humanity to imbibe
oneness of soul with all =
living beings, gentlemanliness, sacred character,
self control and simple l=
iving-high thinking. We must celebrate birthdays of
great people of the wor=
ld who renounced their all for the sake of great
ideals. Hence sermons and =
discourses that describe the lives of such great
souls are given so that ma=
n too gets inspired to follow in their footsteps.
In this manner the layman=
=92s self control can be nourished and he will
willingly imbibe a sacred wa=
y of living. An important point to be noted is
that when man vows to lead a=
n ethical life hardships do come his way. At
such times material lures and =
enticements have to be curbed via self control
(Sanyam). This control is ca=
lled Laya sadhana. Why is a man of true
austerities very powerful mentally?=
 The answer is that he gives up desires
for selfish gains and instead chann=
els his energy in the direction of world
welfare. In this manner he himself=
 attains soul fulfillment, respect from
the world, love and cooperation and=
 divine grace without even having an
inkling of such desires in his mind. M=
eaning all this comes his way, unasked
and unsolicited. Ethics can be nurtu=
red only when greatness enters every
pore of our mental character, actions =
and inner qualities. In this manner
our character and personality touch hei=
ghts of human grandeur and glory.

Ethics and ideals have been classified a=
nd described from many standpoints.
Manu Smriti describes 10 characteristic=
s of ethics. Almost all these have
been elucidated in the Yama-Niyama aphor=
isms of Raja Yoga. In other
religious texts all this has been covered albei=
t with minor variations here
and there. It is these common principles of et=
hics in various religions that
makes us say that fundamentally all religion=
s are one. Of course the mode of
application and methods of imbibing these =
ethics in day to day living do
vary amongst various religions. The outer sh=
ells of tradition in various
religions have come to being depending on the =
circumstances prevailing in
those times when a particular religion was esta=
blished. These traditions
change when times and external circumstances chan=
ge. It is but natural that
when these traditions become worn with age disto=
rtions and taints enter
them. Under such circumstances it becomes imperativ=
e that they be
transformed and reformed in a wholesome manner. Despite this=
 the fact
remains that the principles of ethics that urge mankind to live a=
 life of
human greatness remains intact. It is hence in this context that w=
e proclaim
that all religions are eternal in nature.
