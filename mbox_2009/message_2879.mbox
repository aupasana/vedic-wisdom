WHAT IS DVAITA? 
Dva=
ita, also known as Bheda-v=C3=A2da, Tattva-v=C3=A2da, and Bimba-pratibimba-=
v=C3=A2da, is the doctrine propounded by Ananda T=C3=AErtha (1238-1317) tha=
t asserts that the difference between the individual soul or j=C3=AEva, and=
 the Creator, or =C3=8Eshvara, is eternal and real. Actually, this is just =
one of the five differences that are so stated -- all five differences that=
 constitute the universe are eternal. The five are given by:

                                            =
-- paramashruti

"The difference between the j=C3=AEva (soul) and =C3=8Eshv=
ara (Creator), and the difference between jaDa (insentient) and =C3=8Eshvar=
a; and the difference between various j=C3=AEvas, and the difference betwee=
n jaDa and j=C3=AEva; and the difference between various jaDas, these five =
differences make up the universe." 
>From the Paramopanishad a.k.a. Parama-s=
hruti, as quoted by Ananda T=C3=AErtha in his 'VishNu-tattva-vinirNaya' 
Th=
is is the reason why some refer to the doctrine of Tattvav=C3=A2da (the pre=
ferred name) as 'Dvaita'. However, 'Dvaita' is thought to be inadequately r=
epresentative of the true grain of Tattvav=C3=A2da. 
The doctrine of Tattva=
v=C3=A2da is considered to be eternal (in a flow-like sense, just as Creati=
on is eternal); in historical times, it was revived by Ananda T=C3=AErtha, =
who is also known as Madhv=C3=A2ch=C3=A2rya. Because of this, followers of =
Tattvav=C3=A2da are called M=C3=A2dhvas, meaning followers of Madhva. 
What=
 is "Dvaita"?
Dvaita, or M=C3=A2dhva siddh=C3=A2nta, is the name for the do=
ctrine of Vedanta that asserts the eternal and immutable difference between=
 the individual soul, or jiiva, and the Supreme Lord, or Iishvara (also kno=
wn as Vishnu).
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Isn't Dvaita the mere opposite of Advaita?
Suc=
h misperception is one of the reasons why some reject the use of 'Dvaita' t=
o refer to the doctrine of Tattvav=C3=A2da. While it is true that Advaita a=
nd Tattvav=C3=A2da have had many debates over hundreds of years, and that t=
he latter denies the jagan-mithyatva (illusory nature of the universe) that=
 is one of the fundamental tenets of Advaita, it is certainly not the case =
that there is disagreement everywhere, nor is it the case that one can deri=
ve Tattvav=C3=A2da merely by taking the opposite of everything claimed by A=
dvaita. But it can be said with full certainty that on most fundamental iss=
ues such as the nature of =C3=8Eshvara, j=C3=AEva, attainment of mukti, etc=
., the two have total and irreconcilable differences.
Even so, the doctrine=
s are not polar reciprocals in the conventional sense=E2=80=94it is not the=
 case that they assert logically opposite tenets at every point.
Isn't Dvai=
ta the first step towards learning Advaita?
If it is, then it is a quite la=
rge, reverse, first step! While adherents of Advaita say that by nature and=
 everyday experience one believes in the reality of the universe, etc., and=
 that such belief must be got rid if one is to attain complete union with t=
he nirguNa-Brahman, no serious scholar of Advaita claims that studying Tatt=
vav=C3=A2da is a first step towards learning Advaita. For one thing, it is =
a rule of all learning that things learned first must not contradict things=
 learned later; for another, Tattvav=C3=A2da specifically examines and deno=
unces many Advaita concepts, and hence, one who has learned Tattvav=C3=A2da=
 first cannot possibly accept Advaita later. In fact Advaita has not built =
up a credible system of analysis where the p=C3=BBrva paksha or the initial=
 proposition of Tattvav=C3=A2da is examined and rejected thereby establishi=
ng Advaita. The exact reverse obtains today.

Even the argument which says, =
=E2=80=9CDuality (dvaita) during practice (sadhana) =E2=80=93 which one und=
ertakes (due to) not knowing (the truth that one is always Brahman) =E2=80=
=93 and nonduality (advaita) after attainment (that is, duality is true dur=
ing the time of practice and non-duality becomes true only after the attain=
ment of Self-realization)=E2=80=9D , is not true. Who else is one except th=
e tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) and w=
hen one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).

Sri Bhagavan says that even t=
his is not true, because nonduality (advaita) is always the truth and duali=
ty (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one non-dual=C2=A0Self alone exi=
sts and is real=C2=A0even when in the ignorant outlook of the individual it=
 seems to appear as this unreal world of duality and diversity.

In order t=
o emphasis that duality is unreal even during the time of its seeming exist=
ence, Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the =E2=80=98lost=E2=80=99 tenth ma=
n.=C2=A0Ten foolish men forded a river, and on reaching the other side they=
 wished to make sure that all had crossed safely. So all of them began to c=
ount the number of persons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count=
 himself, they all counted only nine. Believing that one of their companion=
s must have drowned, they all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who u=
nderstood the situation asked each one to count himself, whereupon they rea=
lized that they were always ten men, both during the time of their seeming =
loss and after their =E2=80=98finding=E2=80=99 the missing man. Similarly, =
when we attain Self-knowledge we will realize that non-duality (advaita) is=
 always the sole truth,both during the time of our seeming ignorance (when =
nonduality appears to be lost and duality appears to prevail) and after our=

 =E2=80=98attaining=E2=80=99 Self, the non-dual reality.

It is to be note=
d here that, though non-duality is the truth even during the time of seemin=
g ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual practice (sadhana) is nec=
essary,as some theoreticians/ theorists have wrongly concluded.So long as t=
he tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for each one of the ten to=
 enquire and find out =E2=80=98Who is lost?=E2=80=99 , for then only will t=
he truth be realized that the so called =E2=80=98lost=E2=80=99 tenth man is=
 only oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as the e=
xperience of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to enqu=
ire and find out =E2=80=98Who am I, who have lost the experience of non-dua=
lity?=E2=80=99, for then only will the truth be realized that the seeming i=
ndividual =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 who does not experience non-duality is merely=
 an unreal appearance, and that the real =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has in fact ne=
ver lost the experience of non-duality.
