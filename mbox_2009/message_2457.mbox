So Vishnu awakened Prahlada, blessing him with eternal life and jivanmukti.
Deva-asura fight was resumed and the old order of things was restored so
that the universe continues in its eternal nature.

Devotee:

How could God Himself wake up the asura element and bring about constant
warfare? Is not Pure Goodness the nature of God?

Bhagavan:

Goodness is only relative. Good always implies bad also; they always
co-exist. The one is the obverse of the other.
