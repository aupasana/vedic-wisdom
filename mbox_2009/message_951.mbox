Namaste,
 
Mantras work beyond the physical sound energy level and work at =
the mind level. Mind connects the material and non-material realms of exper=
ience. So all experiences of mind cannot be studied by physics or modern sc=
ience in general.
 
I want to narrate a small incident. At this time, the p=
erson in question prefers not to be explicitly identified.
 
*        *    =
    *
 
One man was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, he woke up=
. When he was still on the bed and partially awake, his shakti rose. In oth=
er words, his self-awareness got refined. He first perceived a tremendous b=
olt of electricity going up in his back. Then, in a split second, his perce=
ption of that electricity changed from "shakti inside me" to "I inside shak=
ti". His changed perception was that there was a tremendous amount of shakt=
i that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that w=
as there and that he was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. More=
over, he also "heard" a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by mil=
lions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverb=
erated with the sound of that beejaakshara and he perceived that he too was=
 chanting that beejaakshara along with all. His mind was filled with that s=
ound and a kind of bliss. His self-awareness was that of a tiny particle fi=
lled with that sound and joy. He was in that state for a while. Suddenly a =
thought that can be loosely expressed as "I am on the bed in a room. How am=
 I hearing all this? Are there people in the room" came to his mind. That t=
hought disturbed the state of his mind and his shakti came down. In other w=
ords, he returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceive=
d that he was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind =
was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.
 
He mentioned this in=
cident a few days later to his spiritual guru, who lived thousands of miles=
 away and a few hours ahead of him. When this happened, it was the middle o=
f the night for him and morning for his guru. When he mentioned the inciden=
t and said that he heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the w=
ave in which he was a small particle, his guru said he knew it and also men=
tioned the specific beejaakshara and asked "that is what you heard, right?"=
 That was indeed correct. When he confirmed, his guru shed some light: "I w=
as at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and=
 filled my consciousness. I then went into samadhi. Some people close to me=
 may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should realize t=
hat this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does and why sh=
e does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing what comes o=
ur way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire anything to ha=
ppen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything."
 
=
*        *        *
 
If you are talking about the mystical experiences per=
ceived by a single mind, the possibility of hallucination cannot be discoun=
ted. However, when two people independently experienced something similar a=
nd one of them knew that the other one experienced it, it shows that there =
is something here. It shows that the ultimate Reality is *beyond* the reali=
ty that can be perceived by senses and studied by modern science.
 
Mind is=
 the connection between the material and non-material worlds.
 
Ego, the se=
nse of "I", is what blocks one from higher things. Notions like "I am the b=
ody", "I should be safe", "I should be happy" etc block one and limit one's=
 self-awareness to a gross body and its gross external senses. When the sel=
f-awareness changes to that of a tiny particle at His/Her feet, it is a lot=
 more blissful state to be in. But, we are kept away from that because our =
self-awareness is different and more gross and we cannot let it go! We just=
 hang on to an undesirable self-awareness.
 
*        *        *
 
I want t=
o make one thing clear. When I write about any mystical experiences, there =
is a chance of influencing someone wrongly. Luckily for me, the first thing=
 my guru did with me was to de-emphasize the value of mystical experiences.=
 I was prepared by him to look at them as just any other experiences in the=
 material world. They really are. When one goes on a road, one sees nice sc=
enery on the side. Some scenery on a normal road may be accessible to every=
one and some scenery at a high altitude hill road may be seen by very few. =
But the bottomline is that both are sceneries and one should learn to just =
see it, appreciate it and move on. If attachment is built with a scenery or=
 one becomes proud of oneself for having seen a scenery, it is foolish. Suc=
h feelings can distract one from the final goal and slow down one's journey=
. Nothing in the 14 worlds needs to be desired or feared. Just observe what=
 comes your way and continue your journey.
 
A mystical experience can prom=
ote pride in one ("I am good and I got this", "I did good sadhana and so I =
got this", "I deserve this" etc) or attachment or possessiveness or a sense=
 of entitlement. That can trap one and slow down spiritual progress. The ul=
timate goal of spiritual sadhana is to kill pride and overcome ego complete=
ly. That should be remembered at all times.
 
I know that I mention this ag=
ain and again. But internet and e-archives are a nonlinear medium. I want t=
o make this key point in every relevant mail.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
