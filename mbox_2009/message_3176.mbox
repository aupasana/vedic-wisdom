Namaste everyone,

=C2=A0
I think this is a reference to a statement o=
f Ramakrishna that the physical body of a sadhak contains some signs. When =
these signs are present in the physical body, it indicates that person to b=
e a sadhaka or one who has done serious sadhana in past lives.=C2=A0 If tho=
se signs are not present, the person will not be able to achieve realizatio=
n in that birth. And these signs are so subtle only an expert yogi or reali=
zed man like Ramakrishna can decipher them. We ordinary people cannot. The =
shape of the eyes, the shape of the skull, the forehead, weight of the arm =
below the elbow, pattern of body hair, color of the nipple in a male body e=
tc etc indicate the various signs whether the soul in the body is taht of a=
 sadhaka or not. 
=C2=A0
Taking care of the body or not taking care, there =
cannot be a single rule applicable for everyone. For some their path includ=
es taking care of teh body, for others it does not. Both are right. Its lik=
e taking sanyasa. For some realization may come by taking up sanyasa, for o=
thers by doing sadhana at home. What is good for one, may not be good for a=
nother. 
=C2=A0
Interestingly, there was=C2=A0a mail which was forwarded by=
 Narasimha to this group some months ago. The mail was written by Manish. T=
here it was mentioned a lot often depends on the kind of deity whos sadhana=
 is being done. A really ugra deity like Prachanda Chandika, or Mahakali or=
 Chinnamasta won't let the sadhaka think too much about his/her body. In hi=
gher stages of sadhana he will not worry about his body at all. But a relat=
ively soumya roopa of a deity will make sure the sadhaka takes good care of=
 his/her body.
=C2=A0
So finally, the idea of taking care of the body or no=
t taking care is a non issue. One should do what one feels most comfortable=
 with, IMO.

How do you define a defectless body? Is there su=
ch a thing? Some people, with defects from birth, went on to become famous =
sages. Examples include Ashtavakra and Rishyashringa.
