Pranam, Narasimhaji,

i read postings selectively and therefore have missed=
 several useful information on tarpana. the message u have posted is indeed=
 very informative. though one knows that sun symbolises the soul and moon t=
he mind i never thought in terms of "subtle" karmas being burnt thru homam =
and "gross" karmas of pitris being burnt thru tarpana.

There have been yea=
rs of trying one thing after another in the hope of dissolving karmas. Some=
times i doubted my own sincerety...sometimes i thought my karmas must indee=
d be very deep rooted. 

In my years of trying to find answers thru astrolo=
gy i blamed 3 retro planets for the deep rooted karmas. In terms of your po=
sting from the archives i see things in a slightly different light. 

Sun i=
s conjoined with combust retro Mercury which in turn is closely conjoined w=
ith Ketu making it a malefic. Sun is aspected by retro Mars and of course R=
ahu. The only saving grace is that Jupiter is also there with Sun. So maybe=
 there are lots of subtle karmas to be burnt.

As for the Moon it is aspect=
ed by retro exalted Saturn from the house of rin (6th) as well as retro Mar=
s (8th H) and conjoined with lagnesh Venus (self). So maybe there are lots =
of gross karmas to be dissolved thru tarpana. And because Moon is with Lagn=
esh maybe tarpana is even more necessary.

i sincerely believe in the energ=
ies around us and a whole subtle world waiting to be accessed / experienced=
. Even though at present there is no direct experience of such a world, may=
be as things progress...there may be tranformations...to enable a better un=
derstanding of these things...

Sorry, for asking who is Rama at the end of=
 Ramayana...but i would still like to know how deities are invoked in fire.=
 I have been performing the bare minimum homam that u described in one of y=
our messages. i follow all the 7 steps described there. In step number 5 wh=
ere u say "pick any deity and any mantra", i recite "om gam ganapataye nama=
h". In step no.6 while pouring ghee i recite "om bhuh swahaa, om bhuvah swa=
haa, om suvah swaaha, om bhurbhuvahsuvah swahaa, om shri vishnave swahaa, o=
m namo rudraaye pashupataye swaaha". Then i place a piece of dry coconut in=
 the hom and sit for meditation.

Is the deity invoked at this point?

If i=
 want to include pitri tarpana also in this, how do i go about it?

Don't k=
now if i am done! There is a long way to go....


Best regards,
vinita

dhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whether watery signs/pl=
anets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.
>  
> In homam,=
 devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpa=
na, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the min=
d) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have genes from (and ri=
na with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousn=
ess of the deceased ancestor is still having those thoughts, you will also =
suffer from such thoughts due to the connection and may even commit some ba=
d karmas because of the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by =
working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousne=
ss is attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousne=
ss will not affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims t=
o cut off a strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously c=
ommitted bad karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progres=
s.

y note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora c=
hart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respective=
ly.
