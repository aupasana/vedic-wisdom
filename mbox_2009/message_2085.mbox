Dear Utpalji

Now if ONE BEING knows everything including EXACT action a=

Years ago I had read an awesome book called "Mr Thomp=
kins in Wonderland" by George Gamow (he had won the Nobel Prize in physics)=
.

There, using a fictional character named Thompkins, George Gamow expl=

a toss if there is even a slight change in the nth=A0decimal place of any o=
f the standard universal constants, like the charge of an electron. What is=
 the common sense understanding, but one gained from observation of life up=
till the age of say 18!
=A0
Something moving at an extremely fast pace does=
 not observe space-time as you or I do. Inside an atom there is not a well =
defined path for a electron to revolve around. but merely clouds of probabi=
lity ! Which means what someone can say at best is the probability of findi=

And all these have been derived from hardcore mathematical process. Not=

=A0
After reading Narasimhaji's mail I realized the pr=

Th=

=A0
So this idea of l=

Namaste Narasimha garu,

There are few thin=

1) >there is nothing that is unknown to Him. P=
ast, present and future; >here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, th=

 time.

The above are main two points if understood and linked can give cla=
rity.

you have brought to me a very FRESH Knowledge that most of Yogi's ca=
n find out one or two possibilities of future depending upon the space-time=
 cycle zone in which their consciouness can access. a really advance yogi c=
an see more possibilities of future events due to their access of more time=
 cycles. BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who is a s=
ole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (pl. ref=
er to no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to him and=
 not only every possibility but even every action going to be taken in a pe=
rticular Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him by Naraa=
yana/Shiva/ Bhagavati/ GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and many =
such names depending on our faiths. 

The point no.1 indicates that HE is a=
ll knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly there at our=
 Spac-time level. Now if ONE BEING knows everything including EXACT action =
and EXACT REACTION, then would it be really called free will ULTIMATELY? i =
know that it can be argued that HE ONLY KNOWS but DOES NOT INTERFEAR and he=
nce Free will exist but then what is the meaning of the verses in the conte=
xt of the topic...
"Mohyante Mohitaashchaiv Mohameshyanti chaapare..."
"Mam=
atvagartetimaha andhakaare Vibhraamayatyetadat iv Vishvam"
"Tannatra vismay=
 kaaryo yoganidra jagatpate
Mahaamaayaa Hareshchaishaa tayaa sammohyate jag=
at"

"....Mrigtrushna bhramayati" of Gita

please forgive me for wiritng al=
l these things but it is very difficult for me to really reconcile and i th=
ink you are the only help for me.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

<BR><BR>The above are main two points if understood and linked can give cla=
rity.<BR><BR>you have brought to me a very FRESH Knowledge that most of Yog=
i's can find out one or two possibilities of future depending upon the spac=
e-time cycle zone in which their consciouness
 can access. a really advance=
 yogi can see more possibilities of future events due to their access of mo=
re time cycles. BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who=
 is a sole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (=
pl. refer to no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to =
him and not only every possibility but even every action going to be taken =
in a perticular Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him b=

 that HE is all knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly=
 there at our Spac-time level. Now if ONE BEING knows everything including =
EXACT action and EXACT REACTION, then would it be really called free will U=
LTIMATELY? i know that it can be argued that HE ONLY KNOWS but DOES NOT INT=

 Both are correct, but at differen=
t levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically complex and th=
ose who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.<BR>> <BR>> =
* * *<BR>> <BR>> Non-dual self has no division of self into various o=
bjects or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time=
 continuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no se=
nse of space or time or objectification.<BR>> <BR>> Supreme cosmic be=
ing is the link between duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arisi=
ng in this non-dual self captures the entire field of duality within Him. A=
ll beings, entire space and all space-time continua within the field of dua=
lity exist within Him. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all be=
ings of the dual world are His parts and all their individual wills are par=
ts of His cosmic will. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is =
nothing that is unknown to Him.
 Past, present and future; here, there and =
everywhere; I, you and others, this possibility, that possibility and yet a=
nother possibility - all are accessible and fully "known" to His self-aware=
ness.<BR>> <BR>> Now, let us come lower and into the field of duality=
. The field of duality consists of infinite divisions of space, time and sp=
ace-time continua. There are infinite possibilities within this field.<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sen=
se of time and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However, f=
ield of duality also contains planes of consciousness where different sense=
s of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at various =
points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum in such a=
 plane of consciousness may experience a point of time that maps to a futur=
e time in a regular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Also, wh=
at is 1 minute in one
 space-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-=
time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one may think.=
 Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-time continua and =
what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousness that one's self-=
awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a specific =
space-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality. But rel=
aity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each other. Th=
ese are all different possibilities and you chart out your course based on =
your actions and Nature's reactions to your actions.<BR>> <BR>> * * *=
<BR>> <BR>> From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different spac=
e-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in "future" as =
per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective =
of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future time=
 is not yet
 known and depends on your current action.<BR>> <BR>> If =
a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state in future, h=
is observation is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It ha=
s no causal relationship to your current action or your future state. He is=
 merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen. His observati=
on is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-ti=
me pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair =
where he observed you (if at all you do!).<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <=
BR>> Let us go further. Is there only one future possible for you? Or, d=
oes the path traversed by you in space-time continuum not fixed but variabl=
e based on your actions? Can your actions at important cross-roads alter th=
e course you traverse?<BR>> <BR>> If so, what is the meaning of a yog=
i observing you at a space-time pair? Is his observation only a possibility=
 or a
 certainty? One may say "how can one observe a possibility? Anything =
we observe must be a certainty." But is that correct? Aren't the field of d=
uality and the infinite space-time continua contained in it merely a set of=
 infinite possibilities?<BR>> <BR>> Some great rishis can see not jus=
t a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same time, i.e. th=
ey can see various possibilities based on various possible actions. However=
, visions seen by most yogis about "future" are just one possibility.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Bottomline: At the level at which we exi=
st, there is certainly something called "freewill". Within the limits impos=
ed by the reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do ha=
ve a scope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depending on whi=
ch action you engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions=
 can even make the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to
 =
chart out a significant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e=
.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 m=
oves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for=
 future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing=
 a future position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of=
 possibilities, as they all exist within Him.<BR>> <BR>> However, you=
r actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your co=
nsciousness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilit=
ies quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition,=
 but it is your actions that actually make some of those possibilities a re=
ality.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> -----------=

I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This wa=
s abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; I asked what he was thinking. He said, "it is not that the future that i=
s to come has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but=
 it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?" I guessed=
 what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, "no. What do yo=
u mean?"<BR>> <BR>> He said, "I don't know how to say what I am think=
ing." This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His mai=
n characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, cont=
ented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could
 not =
express himself.<BR>> <BR>> I helped him, "do you mean to say that fu=
ture has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people l=
ater? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in =
a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the=
 screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying s=
omething like that?"<BR>> <BR>> He exclaimed, "exactly. That is what =
I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen when=
 future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, beca=
use it has already happened."<BR>> <BR>> Though he did not mention it=
, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man rid=
ing the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come,=
 he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understan=
d things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he
 should see so=
mebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible =
and came to some important conclusions about "time" in his own way.<BR>>=
 <BR>> Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However,=
 in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It =
even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahma=
n or Self.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> The same boy once perfor=
med a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali wi=
th beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahut=
i, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from t=
he energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied =
and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as "I am =
done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave" filled my entire =
consciousnss.<BR>> <BR>> I had experienced the
 same kind of intense =
energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was med=
itating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in Indi=
a. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside =
the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Ka=
ali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the=
 past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no oth=
er time did I feel that intense shakti.<BR>> <BR>> Interestingly, aft=
er we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all t=
he different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam." I asked him wh=
y. He said, "I don't know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and diffe=
rent."<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> This boy performed a really =
simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it see=
med like he was successful in making a
 powerful energy manifest there. The=
 bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.<BR>> <B=
R>> Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and =
get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep do=
ing it until one breaks through.<BR>> <BR>> Keep performing your chos=
en spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you enga=
ge in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress=
 and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you ca=
n resist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal e=
nemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better.=
 Ego - thinking that this is "I" and this is "mine" - is the root cause of =
all problems.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Overcoming ego using =
jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think tha=
t all that is around you -
 including your house, money, cars, spouse, chil=
dren and your own body - is god's property and that you are a temporary car=
etaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but with=
out entertaining the notion "this is mine". A faithful servant takes very g=
ood care of his master's properties, but without thinking of all those thin=

gs as "mine" is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who l=
