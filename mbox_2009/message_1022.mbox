Namaste Aparajita & others,

If one is performing Homas for spiritual advan=
cement and not for any 
material benefits, then why worry?

let Guru be bad=
 or worst. let all the Nine planets are so placed as 
to discourage one fro=
m doing Homas, if one leaves everything to Hari 
and marches on, "Graha bic=
hare kya karenege?"

Best Regards,

Utpal
