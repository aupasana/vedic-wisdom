Namaste Utpalji
=A0
I have had the same experiences. Most of our puranic st=
ories are made fun of by others. 

Well in most of the cases these question=
s are of malicious intent, those don't bother me much, but at some point so=
meone ask's these questions genuinely.
=A0
I tried reading different opinio=
ns of different respected saints and I found one explanation in the introud=
uctory chapters on Sri Aurobindo's "Secrets of the Vedas".
=A0
He opines in=
directly that the Puranas are definitely a toned down version of what used =
to be the Vedic knowledge. This was made this way for the oridinary people =
to understand and not leave the folds of Hinduism. The threat then was Budd=
hism. That is why not only these stories were "made" which were based on de=
eper spiritual symbolism generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was =
modified and made easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the s=
anskrit of the puranic age.
=A0
The reason Buddism could become such a thre=
at to Hinduism was because the people (priests)=A0had reducded the Vedas to=
 a book of mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the =
priests took over the religion from the sages/mystics and reduced/neglected=
/forgot the internal and=A0relied solely on the external. That is why Buddh=
a rejected the Vedas.
Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was =
a wrong step in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice=
 after Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. However=
, the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall s=
piritual evolution of this world by increasing the distance between God and=
 man. 
=A0
So essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywo=
od movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art films.
=A0
My persona=
l take on this: As far as they are able to induce spirituality in an very a=
verage ordinary person from a village they are excellent. But at the same t=
ime, if a Hindu who is not aware of the comprehensive nature of his own scr=
iptures, a poor, uneducated man,=A0is told that his idols are mere stones a=
nd his stories are cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily much beyon=
d all this, the idea of a single God, would be enough reason to make him sw=
itch religions. It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it =
often happens.
=A0
Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to le=
arn our religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on televisi=
on would do well to try and educate their followers about the comprehensive=
/all inclusive=A0nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting the stories fr=
om teh Puranas.

Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,

Rajarshi'=
s question was in some aspect similar to one question i was asked about a m=
onth ago. while traveling back to home from office, one person asked me tha=
t what is these stories of our Gods such as Ganapati and his story of being=
 Shiva's son and cutting of head and replaced by elephant head etc...
Stori=
es of Vishnu and like wise many gods and goddesses. The person told me that=
 people from other make fun about all these various gods and their *mytholo=
gical* events which is recorded in our Shastras.

I wish to ask here a nagg=
ing question. what is the truth. for instance, did Ganapati and shiva's epi=
sode actually happen? Stories in Devi Mahatmay are true?. Episode of Daksh =
Yagya and Uma's self killing in yagya vedi out of anger and origin of Shakt=
i pithas are true?

Stories of Indra and other many gods and goddesses are =
true?

Do they really exist? (Even if at the different plane of existence) =
or the people who criticize are right when they say that yours is a full of=
 stories which are only mythological and you pray those imaginary Gods whic=
h are nothing but characters of Stories of some writer.

I could not answer=
 the question as i was not sure.

Spiritually yours,

Utpal

e may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspects of=

en or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, bu=
t may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated th=
rough many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following message:=

d not read about some of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But =
he saw them and could describe them. This is because those forms represent =
a personification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in =
that form in a previous life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not c=
onsciously) and it can come back anytime. So, though he did not know about =
that form, that form appeared before him.

aid (paraphrased) , "a human being imagines god as a super human being with=
 many hands and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a s=
uper buffalo with many horns". Though he is right in a sense, it is mislead=
ing too. It may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external form=
s are a work of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.
>

ne learns how to feel sorry and show that feeling, saying "I am sorry" as a=
 ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot=

r Similarly, though the energy represented by a form is more basic than a s=
pecific external form associated with that energy, many people will reach t=
hat energy only by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if on=
e's mind tends to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship t=
hat form.

 real and not created by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the min=
d over the time. If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an im=
agination of the mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is conn=
ected to its field of experience. Various minds in its field of experience =
are connected to it. For example, the experience described in the following=
 message was independently "observed" by two people. Human mind can imagine=
 things and hallucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is differen=
t from a typical hallucination:

eive it as a deity Y. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeli=

ng of one's mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.

 one person who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls bac=

kumkum (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision=
 and opened his eyes. But the person who did homam perceived only some nice=
 energy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by dif=
ferent people in a different form. One person may perceive only some energy=
 and another may perceive a specific form. Yet another may
 perceive a diff=
erent form. The exact perception is based on the conditioning of the mind. =
But the energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.

 context of the language used. For example, the English expression has "I" =
as the subject and one is talking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu=
 expressions have the other person as the subject and asking him to forgive=
. The amount of respect shown is different in different expressions. Thus, =
the exact meaning is slightly different. Thus, children speaking different =
languages may visualize something slightly different as their understanding=
 of the languages improves. However, these differences are minor. As one de=
lves deeper, the basic emotions associated with these different expressions=
 is the same in different languages and one will feel those emotions with c=
ompassion as one masters the
 language.<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, deities=
, rituals and mantras used in different religious traditions may be differe=
nt, but they may represent the same divine energy and the same spiritual ex=
periences. Just as the immeidate visualization of an expression in the mind=
 of a child may change based on cultural context and grammar that one is ex=
posed to, the immeidate imagination of a deity's gross/external form in the=
 mind of a sadhaka may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal=
 context that one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As o=
ne delves deeper, the basic energies and experiences represented by various=
 deities and rituals are the same in different religious traditions and one=
 will experience the same spiritual truths as one masters one's path.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> No wonder Rigveda says "ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti" (Trut=
h is One, but the learned say it differently) .<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> One
 language may have a lot of different words for an object =
with slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. As an =
example, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for "snow", =
"ice", "dew", "mist" etc, whereas English has so many words. Native languag=
e of Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many more wor=
ds than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls=
 all of them as "snow".<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, religious traditions th=
at explored slightly different kinds of the same divine energy may have per=
sonified those energies as different deities. So some religions may have mo=
re deities than some other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deit=
ies for different variations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion=
 may have only one deity.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> If commun=
ication can be internalized and we can communicate with our emotions, we do=
 not need
 language and we will all be on the same page always. But we cann=
ot communicate with our internal emotions and need an external method. So l=
anguage is needed. But language can divide.<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, spi=
ritual truths are internal (like our emotions). In order to express them an=
d transmit them to others, we need deities, mantras, rituals and religion. =
But religion can divide.<BR>> <BR>> One child may say "I am sorry" an=
d another may say another expression meaning the same thing and they may ar=
gue who is right. One may say "my father said this is correct" and another =
may say "my mother said this is correct" and they may fight on who is corre=
ct. People fighting over whose religion is superior and trying to "convert"=
 others are like such children. Unfortunately, my "child and language" anal=
ogy is too mild in this area and the fights between religions have been far=
 worse than two children arguing about their language. Countless people hav=
e
 been murdered in the name of religion.<BR>> <BR>> Instead of argui=
ng which expression is correct and finding fault with others, children lear=
ning should focus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to unders=
tand what exactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions when=
 they say things. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, o=
ne should try to understand one's own religion better and experience the sp=
iritual truths represented in that religion.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>>=
 <BR>> One may think there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu g=
od etc and they are responsible for respective religions and societies. Tha=
t is not true.<BR>> <BR>> If one believes that there is a supreme dei=
ty (whatever the name you use to describe) who creates all beings, then one=
 has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira w=
ere sent to this earth by that same supreme deity and different
 religions =
came into being only because that supreme deity willed so! Each religion se=
rves a useful purpose at a given place and a time. When a religion's time i=
s up, it goes.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Some may say that ex=
ternal forms of deities who personify different aspects of divine energy ru=
nning the universe are a creation of the mind. However, they are not a crea=
tion of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of cond=
itioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or thought abo=
ut or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, but may have a visi=
on of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated through many lives.=
 An example is the boy mentioned in the following message:<BR>> <BR>>=
 <A href=3D"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761" target=
=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow>http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/mess=
age/ 761</A><BR>> <BR>> He had not read about some of the
 avataras o=
f Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could describe them. Th=
is is because those forms represent a personification of a certain energy a=
nd his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previous life. The memor=
y stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it can come back anytim=
e. So, though he did not know about that form, that form appeared before hi=
m.<BR>> <BR>> Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphrased) , "a huma=
n being imagines god as a super human being with many hands and heads. If a=
 buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffalo with many horn=
s". Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It may incorrectly=
 trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a work of the mind, t=
hat does not make them unimportant.<BR>> <BR>> Until one learns how t=
o feel sorry and show that feeling, saying "I am sorry" as a ritual is an i=
mportant habit. Not teaching a child words because he
 cannot anyway unders=
tand their correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he =
does not understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, t=
hough the energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific extern=
al form associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy onl=
y by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one's mind tends=
 to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> Though we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences a=
re a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifes=
ted universe is a creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is r=
eal and not created by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind =
over the time. If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imag=
ination of the mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connec=
ted to its field of experience. Various minds
 in its field of experience a=
re connected to it. For example, the experience described in the following =
message was independently "observed" by two people. Human mind can imagine =
things and hallucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is different=
 from a typical hallucination:<BR>> <BR>> <A href=3D"http://groups.ya=

 Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of var=
ious religions have been independently experienced by multiple people.<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> When someone looks sad, one person may =
say "he is sad". Another person may say "woh dukhi hai". Another person may=
 say "vaadu baadha padutunnaadu" . Similarly, when a divine energy is prese=
nt in a place, one may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perce=
ive it as a deity Y. Just as the expression
 one uses to describe the feeli=
ng one perceives is based on the language one knows, similarly the form men=
tioned by one to describe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioni=
ng of one's mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.<BR>> <BR=
>> I know one person who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, =
he calls back the Divine Mother into his heart by showing the fire with his=
 hands and motioning the hands towards his heart (with eyes closed). When h=
e does it, he just perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful an=
d happy. When he was doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and sittin=
g right behind him. His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When the ab=
ove happened, he was baffled and opened his eyes to see what was going on. =
He had a vision of a dark goddess who was jumping towards him along with a =
big pile of kumkum (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed b=
y the vision and opened his eyes. But
 the person who did homam perceived o=
nly some nice energy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be per=
ceived by different people in a different form. One person may perceive onl=
y some energy and another may perceive a specific form. Yet another may per=
ceive a different form. The exact perception is based on the conditioning o=
f the mind. But the energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.<BR>&g=
