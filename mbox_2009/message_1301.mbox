Namaste,

Not all "clean places" are equal. Vibrations do vary from place to place. 
The vibrations of the place do not matter to some, but do matter to many.

Places with taamasic vibrations are not necessarily bad for sadhana for 
everyone. When one is pure and succeeds in sadhana at such places, one can 
make faster progress.

A smashaana (cemetary) has decidedly stronger tamasik vibrations than 
basements completely under ground. But several great yogis in some 
traditions did sadhana in smashana and realized self. Nevertheless it is not 
conducive to fruitful sadhana by most people.

An average person is better off doing sadhana in places without such 
vibrations, atleast initially. So I do not recommend doing spiritual sadhana 
in underground basements. There will be exceptions, but this is a safe and 
prudent position to take.

Best regards,
Narasimha
