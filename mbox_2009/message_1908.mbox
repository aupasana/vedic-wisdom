Namaste,
 
The same website also talks of "armageddon" and "world war 3" et=
c. See
 
http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/articles/id/spiritualre=
search/spiritualscience/armageddon

Well, there are othe=
r people and traditions suggesting major changes on earth in this timeframe=
. For example, Sri Achyutananda Dasa, who was one of the associates of Chai=
tanya Mahaprabhu, apparently wrote that a Satya yuga like sub-period within=
 the major period of Kali yuga would start around 2000 AD. Some people thin=
k that Mayans believed that a new age of peace would be ushered in after 20=
12.
 
The conclusions on the website you mentioned are based on the visions=
 of someone in deep meditation. The only thing I can say confidently about =
such things is that you cannot be confident of anything you experience or s=
ee, including in so-called "deep meditation". Mind is very powerful. It is =
easy to hallucinate.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
