Namaste,

> Samadhi literally means absolute focus and concentration<

Goo=
d coincidence! I was actually thinking on the word 'Samadhi' y'day
night af=
ter seeing Rajarshi's message. Though, i've never studied
Sanskrit language=
 formally, i was trying to understand 'Samaadhi' word.
I said myself, Sama =
+ Adhi - Sama means 'still' and Adhi Means 'Very' /
Intimate (Derived the u=
nderstanding from 'Adhi Mitra') hence i tried to
derive meaning like *Very =
Still*. W.r.t. Mind, it can mean that when
mind is 'very still' however, on=
e thought also came during that time was
that 'Absolute' word is not sugges=
ted here and then i fell asleep.

Today i just saw Narasimha's first line a=
s if answering my thought of
yesterday night.

***

>observation of an I-ne=
ss as it is being torn down or being
reconstructed<

This is very interesti=
ng! The word 'Reconstructed'.

This means that 'I' ness is either completel=
y made 'Unconscious' during
Nirvikalapa Samaadhi and is being 'Awoken' afte=
r certain duration which
means the Nirvikalapa Ends.

OR

If 'I ness' is co=
mpletely dissolved and even then it is 'Reconstructed'
or 'Reproduced' with=
 all the memory back, means that Chitta was not
completely dissolved. The C=
hitta (memory) was still there.

If the later one is the correct logic, doe=
s it mean that 'Chitta' can
reproduce the 'I ness'?

Best Regards,



Utpal=

Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: "When I am in=

Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about
the=
 "experience" of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an
I-nes=

or afte=
r Nirvikalpa samadhi but not *during* it."

Another may think "all that I perceive is actually a minute par=

Once=

one ca=

When=C2 we say that we enter the middle of t=

no more, then how can it=C2 be experienced diff=
erently by different
people? Shouldn't it be=C2  the same? I thought, which=
ever face of teh
diamond you chose as your entry point, the middle of teh d=
iamond should
feel and look exactly similar. Please correct me if I am wron=
g in my
understanding.=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual gaints have spo=
ken
differently of their realizations. If duality itself does not exist,
th=
en how can the field of possiblity at all arise? Which means, how can
there=
 be a difference in the "perception" of the same One final Truth?

transcendental in i=

diamond),=C2 can=C2 at all be=C2 d=

duality? Then I wonder why these three pe=

r. Please correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2 =C2 An=
d yet these three spiritual gaints have spoken differently of their realiza=
