Dear Utpa=

=C2=A0
I slightly disagree with your below mail. Without offence, let me=
 state a few counter point for the sake of a discussion from a non-vegetari=
an' s point of view.=C2=A0You said:
=C2=A0
=C2=A1=C2=A7I don=C2=A1=C2=A6t w=

mother-nature has provided en=
ough alternate food. 
=C2=A0
Even plants are living. The air we breath is l=
iving (organisms). Death is part and parcel of natural law. One cannot avoi=
d it however much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are heavy on non-veg f=
ood. The areas where they grew, arid, desert land, you need to have (at lea=
st during those days) animal flesh to survive specially considreing irrigat=
ion options were so scanty.=C2=A0If you live in the Artic region, you need =
to have fish oil to survive the cold. The=C2=A0point is, death is a part of=
 life. One does not survive without death. That is how the world has been d=
esigned by the grand designer.
=C2=A0
What right I have, to snatch away eve=
n a single life in
the universe for my selfish reasons. I consider that as =
very very
cruel and that is the personal thinking why I am a vegetarian and=
 not
strictly due to any religious or cultural reason=C2=A1=C2=A8
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Please understa=

adhana, no doubt vegetarian food is best. Otherwise, I am not sure if it ma=
kes in any difference at all.

Its possible this may ch=

Even if Shri Krishna has not mentioned a =

I ask any body to think for him/her self=
 in the light of what is right and what is not...
