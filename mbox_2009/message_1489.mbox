Dear Raju,

Few Ramblings as they say!


Co-relation of Demons described in=
 Durga Saptashati (Chandi Paath)

Shumbha -> Ahamkaar (I ness - Ego)
Nishum=
bha -> Aasakti (Attachment - Which hangs on Ego)

Both are brothers who are=
 inseparable. both are fond of each other so much that they can not live wi=
thout each other. I ness and Attachment are the same.

When Chandika attack=
s Shumbha he becomes unconscious. at that time Nishumbha attacks her. It in=
dicates that the final war for realisation is with our Ahamkaar & Aasakti (=
I ness & Attachment -me, my, mine). it may seem that Ahamkaar is dead but i=
t can be a deception. it may have been hiding (like Shumbha became unconsio=
us for some time). Aasakti (Nishumbha) is ready to attack even if I ness is=
 temporarily sleeping.

When mother completely destroys Nishumbha (Aasakti)=
, Shumbha is furious and even challenges the mother with the abuses such as=
 Dushte, Anyasa Balamaashrita. he is furious because he lost his brother wh=
ich is like a soul mate. Inseparable. once aasakti is finished, Ahamkaar be=
comes weaker and then mother finally mounts concluding attack on the demon =
Shumbha to finally liberate the soul. 

***
Raktabeeja -> Vaasanaas (Desire=
s, mental conditioning)

Raktabeeja is veru dangerous and powerful. He has =
a capacity to multiply and multiply and feel the entire universe. Our desir=
es are also like that. they multiply in no time. they are never finshes eve=
n if we satisfy them. they keep increasing and multiplying.

The most power=
ful demon after Shumbha & Nishumbha is Raktabeeja. it is so powerful that a=
ll the various forms of mothers (such as Indriyaani, Naarasimhi, Vaaraahi, =
Maaheshwari, Brahmaani) attack him simultaneously but still he is not finis=
hed. The multiplication ability of his, ceates danger for the whole world a=
nd Devas becomes worried (like Good virutes feel scared of danger from endl=
ess desires, like saintly people are always at danger from onslaught of mat=
erialistic and wicked people).

seeing that Devas are really worried, Chand=
ika and Chaamunda both attack him and destroy him. Chaamunda (Kali) actuall=
y sucks the blood of the demon and destroys all the multiplied demons insta=
ntly to the point that Raktabeeja becomes bloodless and then detroyed compl=
etely. Hence Kaali has capacity to destroy all the vaasanaas and the beeja =
of vaasanaas.

***
Chanda and Munda are like Greed & Appeasement. they both=
 fan the Ego (Shumbha). they lure him to go for possesing everything in the=
 world.
They successfully trigger Ahamkaar and propell us to go for the wro=
ng things/desires/possession.
***
DhumraLochan -> Krodha (Anger/fury which =
is unmindful but very weak)

Dhumralochan (Krodha) is aggressive but has fe=
et of clay, that is why Durga destroys Dhumralochan with just as 'Hunkaar' =
(just by a word 'Hum') and the chapter no.6 is over in few verses.
****

co=
nfused! not your fault. i couldn't explain it properly :)

Warm Regards,

U=
tpal
