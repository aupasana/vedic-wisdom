Namaste, 

I have encountered the same uneasiness when switching off the au=
dio too! I listen to audio paaths and stotras whenever I get the chance..lu=
nch-breaks, while travelling sometimes even when cooking..and if anything h=
appens to crop up before the end of the audio, I press on 'pause' but I try=
 to continue the chanting in my mind sub-consciously and then I resume the =
audio when I get to be free again. I hope that's okay.

It is perfectly ok. In fact, even if the original expert recorded it mechan=
ically and without much devotion, you will still get good punya from it if =
you listen to it with focus and devotion.

 However, as you become comfortable with it, try to chant it yourself at so=
