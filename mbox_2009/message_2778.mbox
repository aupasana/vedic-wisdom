A man went and asked him where his deceased sister had been reborn.

The Ma=
harshi requested him not to bother about such things, as they were
only man=
ifestations of his ego. The man persisted in saying that it was a
quest for=
 knowledge, pure and simple, devoid of the least egoism. The
Maharshi asked=
 him, =93Was she born first only as your sister?=94 On being told
that she =
must have had thousands of births before, he asked him if he had
ever cared=
 to find out what she had been born as,before she was born as his
sister. O=
n his replying that he did not, the Maharshi said, =93Do you not see
that i=
t is only your egoism which has prompted your questions, and not any
desire=
 for knowledge pure and simple?=94

To a man who stated that he could not u=
nderstand the world at all, Sri
Ramana replied, =93As you are, so is this w=
orld.Without understanding
yourself, what is the use of trying to understan=
d the world? People waste
their energies over all such questions. First, fi=
nd out the truth behind
yourself; then, you will be in a better position to=
 understand the truth
behind the world, of which yourself is a part.=94
