 17th January, 1946

One morning about September or October 1945, a devotee=
 from Bangalore, by
name Venkataswami Naidu,brought a pair of pigeons and g=
ave them to the
Ashram as an offering. Seeing that, Bhagavan said, =93We ha=
ve to protect them
from cats, etc., is it not? Who will look after them? A =
cage is required,
food must be given. Who will do all that here? It is bett=
er for him to take
them away.=94

The devotee said he would make all the re=
quired arrangements and requested
that they should be kept in the Ashram. H=
e placed the pair of pigeons in
Bhagavan=92s lap.

With overflowing affecti=
on and love, Bhagavan drew them near him, saying,
=93Come dears! Come! You =
won=92t go back? You wish to stay on here? All right,
stay on; a cage will =
be coming.=94 As he thus petted them with affection, they
became absolutely=
 quiet, closed their eyes as if they were in samadhi,and
stayed on there wi=
thout moving this way or that.Bhagavan thereupon keeping
them on his lap st=
opped petting them, and with his gracious eyes fixed on
them, sat in silenc=
e, deeply immersed in samadhi.

It took nearly an hour for the devotees in =
the Ashram to find and bring a
cage for them. The wonder of it is, all thro=
ugh that one hour, the pigeons
sat in Bhagavan=92s lap without moving one w=
ay or the other as if they were a
pair of yogis in samadhi. What could we s=
ay about their good fortune? Is it
not the result of their punya in previou=
s births that this great sage should
seat them on his lap, cajole them by p=
atting them from the head down to the
feet with his
hands, bless them and t=
hereby bestow on them divine bliss?

Not only that, when the cage was broug=
ht in, Bhagavan patted them cajolingly
and put them in the cage, saying,=93=
Please go in. Be safe in the cage.=94 Then
Bhagavan said,
=93In the Bhagava=
tham, pigeons also are stated to be in the hierarchy of
Gurus, in the chapt=
er relating to Yadu Samvadam. I remember having read that
story long ago.=
=94

While the pigeons were on his lap, one devotee came and asked, =93What=
 is
this?=94 Bhagavan said, without attachment but assuming responsibility,=
 =93Who
knows? They come, and decline to go back. They say they will stay h=
ere
only. Another family has come up on me, as if what I already have is no=
t
enough.=94

In Vedanta Sastras, in the Bharatham and Bhagavatham there ar=
e many stories
like this. Bhagavan had told us long ago:=93Any living being=
 that comes to me,
it is only to work out the balance of its karma. So don=
=92t prevent anyone
from coming to me.=94 When I looked at those pigeons, i=
t occurred to me that
they might be great saints who had fallen from their =
austerity in
meditation; otherwise, how could they get into the lap of Bhag=
avan, a
privilege which is impossible for ordinary people?

In canto V of B=
hagavatham there is a verse which says that people born in
Bharatavarsha ar=
e blessed,since Hari has come there a number of times as an
avatar and bles=
sed them by His precepts, help and guidance. The above
incident is an illus=
tration of this.
