Namaste,

Can anyone help me here?

In India, the sankalp contains followin=
g which is correct for India.

.....Kaliyuge pratham charane, Bharatvarshe,=
 Bharatkhande, Jambudwipe, Ramkshetre, Bouddhavatare, Dandakaranye Deshe, G=
odavarya: Dakshin Tire, Krishnavenyo: Uttar Tire, Shalivahan Shake, Virodhi=
 Naam Samvatsare.....

Now how do you customise the above correctly for Nor=
th America? Rest of the part can be found from Panchang.

Pranaam,

Jagmoha=
