Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
I have not read the Kathamrita - so I cannot comment on =
it really=C2=A0but I=C2=A0found=C2=A0Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga by Swami =
Saradananda to be an excellent book, exhaustive and detailed in the analysi=
s. Swami Saradananda takes so my pains to beautifully explain various aspec=
ts of Ramakrishna's spiritual behaviour and general explanations of spiritu=
al things as well.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
For example it is from this book that I fir=
st understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perform such severe sad=
hana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakrishna's Tantric s=
adhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.
=C2=A0
There is one point I ha=
ve observed with Ramakrishna's teachings.His advises are often specific to =
the person he was advising. For someone he may say=C2=A0study the Adhyatma =
Ramayana, for another he advised never to touch the Adhyatma Ramayana! Like=
 a perfect teacher he advised the specific medicine for the specific proble=
m=C2=A0in the path of spirituality that the specific person was facing.
=C2=
=A0
Second is his =C2=A0fantastic razor sharp intellect. No one gives bette=
r examples to explain some aspect of spirituality than=C2=A0Ramakrishna. Si=
mple yet perfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet does not get caught =
up in the mazes of words. 
=C2=A0
Third and most important, the range of sp=
iritual moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to respect to every=
 great master who has walked on this planet, I can't recall another name wh=
o has expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His spiritual jour=
ney is not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal where he reli=
shes every dish to the core.
=C2=A0
Juding purely from an intellectual pers=
pective, I believe there are=C2=A0some possibility of corruption in the tea=
chings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha to Shanakara to =
Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to=C2=A0Aurobindo . Corruptions not i=
n the teaching per se=C2=A0but corruption arising out of misinterpretation =
of the words over time. One cannot really blame them for this because it is=
 almost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to what kind of minds=
ets which can make their statements/advises defuct or even dangerous over t=
ime.
=C2=A0
For example, Jesus says I am the path. Obviously Christians hav=
e mistook this to understand that Jesus is the only path. What he ment by I=
 may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus the idea - of purity and of love.
=C2=
=A0
Buddha gave a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spir=
ituality is more important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that t=
o understand Budha was as atheist.
=C2=A0
Shanakara, the great man that he =
was, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in which =
we later day college educated Indians use the phrases like=C2=A0Aham Brahma=
smi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest movie =
in town. =C2=A0Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.
=C2=A0
=
Guru Nanak in order to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as well=
 as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises like id=
ol worship and pitri tarpan.
=C2=A0
Chaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of=
 spirituality. He was capable. Others less capable misunderstood the path t=
o feel that without shedding bucket full of tears you wont land at God's do=
orsteps. Emotions are good, but they can mislead too.
=C2=A0
Vivekananda - =
absolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at times wh=
ich are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretations late=
r on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days before sp=
eaking one=C2=A0 sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Viveka=
nada, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date spe=
cially if you are fantastic.
=C2=A0
Aurobindo, brilliant and rare analysis =
of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found in any other writing=
. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people wrongly believe tha=
t only by reading and intellectually comprehending Aurobindo;s writings one=
 can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute for raw old fashioned =
sadhana.
=C2=A0
Please note all these are great men were=C2=A0without quest=
ion, spiritually much realized. I am merely doing an intellectual analysis =
from a historial perspective.
=C2=A0
And then Ramakrishna, such a vast rang=
e of emotions and practices coupled with simple and pointed examples=C2=A0a=
nd advises, it is hardly possible for him to get misinterpreted. He uses Sh=
anakra's phrase "Brahma satya jagat mithya" but he also teaches Totapuri wh=
y Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems like a perfect assimilation of all idea=
s.
=C2=A0
Just my two cents.

 So many millions of Hindus would have felt the same feeling in that debate=
. I personally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have pl=
aced them to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i h=
ave same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Naras=

Truth/God and misleading the world, great teachers in the past stepped in a=
nd directed the debate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or rece=
ntly Aadi Shankaracharya or Swami Vivekananda. They had the knack of steeri=
ng the debate in a direction that they wanted - a direction that would help=
 establish sanatana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and ignorance wit=
h "polite words". They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the sword of de=
tached, and yet firm, actions.

<table cellspacing=3D"0" cellpadding=3D"0" border=3D"0" ><tr><td valign=3D"=
top" style=3D"font: inherit;"><DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>I have not read the Kathamrita - so I cannot comment on it really but=
 I found Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga by Swami Saradananda to be =
an excellent book, exhaustive and detailed in the analysis. Swami Saradanan=
da takes so my pains to beautifully explain various aspects of Ramakrishna'=
s spiritual behaviour and general explanations of spiritual things as well.=
 </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For example it is from this book that I=
 first understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perform such severe=
 sadhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakrishna's Tantr=
ic sadhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<D=
IV>There is one point I have observed with Ramakrishna's teachings.His advi=
ses are often specific to the person he was advising. For someone he may sa=
y study the Adhyatma Ramayana, for another he advised never to touch t=
he Adhyatma Ramayana! Like a perfect teacher he advised the specific medici=
ne for the specific problem in the path of spirituality that the speci=
fic person was facing.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Second is his  fan=
tastic razor sharp intellect. No one gives better examples to explain some =
aspect of spirituality than Ramakrishna. Simple yet perfect. He uses t=
he intellect to explain yet does not get caught up in the mazes of words. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Third and most important, the range of spiritu=
al moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to respect to every grea=
t master who has walked on this planet, I can't recall another name who has=
 expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His spiritual journey i=
s not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal where he relishes =
every dish to the core.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Juding purely from an =
intellectual perspective, I believe there are some possibility of corr=
uption in the teachings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha=
 to Shanakara to Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to Aurobindo . =
Corruptions not in the teaching per se but corruption arising out of m=
isinterpretation of the words over time. One cannot really blame them for t=
his because it is almost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to w=
hat kind of mindsets which can make their statements/advises defuct or even=
 dangerous over time.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For example, Jesus says =
I am the path. Obviously Christians have mistook this to understand that Je=
sus is the only path. What he ment by I may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus=
 the idea - of purity and of love.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Buddha gave=
 a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spirituality is mor=
e important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that to understand Bu=
dha was as atheist.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Shanakara, the great man t=
hat he was, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in=
 which we later day college educated Indians use the phrases like Aham=
 Brahmasmi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest=
 movie in town.  Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.<=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Guru Nanak in order to infuse more life into s=
pirituality of Hindus as well as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two id=
eas decried practises like idol worship and pitri tarpan.</DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>Chaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of spirituality. He was ca=
pable. Others less capable misunderstood the path to feel that without shed=
ding bucket full of tears you wont land at God's doorsteps. Emotions are go=
od, but they can mislead too.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Vivekananda - ab=
solute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at times whic=
h are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretations later =
on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days before spea=
king one  sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Vivekana=
da, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date speci=
ally if you are fantastic.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Aurobindo, brillian=
t and rare analysis of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found =
in any other writing. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people=
 wrongly believe that only by reading and intellectually comprehending Auro=
bindo;s writings one can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute fo=
r raw old fashioned sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Please note all t=
hese are great men were without question, spiritually much realized. I=
 am merely doing an intellectual analysis from a historial perspective.</DI=
V>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>And then Ramakrishna, such a vast range of emotio=
ns and practices coupled with simple and pointed examples and advises,=
 it is hardly possible for him to get misinterpreted. He uses Shanakra's ph=
rase "Brahma satya jagat mithya" but he also teaches Totapuri why Mahamaya =
is so powerful. He seems like a perfect assimilation of all ideas.</DIV>

here was a tantrik scholar of great repute in Calcutta named Gauri. The bra=

oma would last for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectl=

 in a debate=C3=82 against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice w=
hich Ramakrishna described as the "rumbling of clouds".<BR>> =C3=82 =

 When Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the=
 Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time=
 was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started=
 saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Ga=

 the mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just gi=

BR>> > > I don't remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by=
 his lecture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Ch=

 channels li=
ke 'Sanskaar' and 'Ashta' where a lot of religious pundits (most of them ar=
e Hindus) come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in =
they have attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold value=
s of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.<BR>> > > a=
fter that first lecture, i watched Zakir's other lectures and was convinced=
 that this person is not a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectua=
l who essentially is a fanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I=
 remember having a debate at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of=
 Islamic faith. we debated on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr.=
 Naik, an email, asking him that does he really believe that other religion=
s and faith are also true. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engin=
