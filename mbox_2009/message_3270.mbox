Dear(est) Rajarshi,

back engineering job to bail out

Vow! Refreshing phr=
ase.  Too good. It seems a season of debating.
Branches of threads are comi=
ng out.

'Kamini and `Kanchan' was the exact words which Ramakrishna used
f=
reely during his life time. Now Kamini means a woman and its possible
that =
several sections would have taken reservation at this. That seems
very obvi=
ous otherwise why Swami Sardananda required to defend Thakur in
his book ca=
lled Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. It seemed to me that
Paramahansa Yogananda a=
lso have referred to this issue without
mentioning Thakur's name directly (=
I may be wrong but i strongly felt
like that when i read the 'Autobiography=
 of a yogi' some 4/5 years
back). Sardanada in a sense did 'Back engineerin=
g job to bail out :)' .
If we go by 'Kamini' word literaly, then Thakur cou=
ld be portrayed as
Women basher.  but we all know that Thakur refffered to =
Lust and Desire
of worldly objects whenever he spoke those two words. Jumpi=
ng on
conclusion without properly studying/thinking about Thakur's life, ju=
st
on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.

Same way=
, I also thought about Sant Tulasi das ji. I was telling myself
that can a =
saint of his devotion and poetic skills and add to that
steadfastly devoted=
 to Lord Rama (Who never shown slightest dis-resepct
to  women) , utter suc=
h words and saggrigate 'Nari' for nothing. I was
not convinced.  One of the=
 'Dohas' of Tulasi Das goes like this -

[Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur P=
ar-stri Matusamaan|

Inase agar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||

(I=
 have given this doha out of memory and its quite possible that first
two w=
rods are wrong in the doha)

If a poet is asking to look at a woman as a Mo=
ther, how could he mean
'Nari' to be 'Tadan Adhikari'? As you pointed out, =
 on a look at surface
(at the levelof text), it means which many belives bu=
t you and me need
to look at little deeper. A person who did the world of G=
ood to Indias
ordinary masses by rewriting the whole Ramayana in a language=
 which
people (from north) could easily understand, The man who gave immort=
al
'Hanumaan Chalisa' can not be lebeled so casually as 'Nari basher' or
'S=
hudra Hater' (As Mayaavati brand poticians would capitalise).

Regarding yo=
ur questions of why Pashu are only Nari and not Nara....

I think he was re=
ffering to  Men with the words Ganvaar and Shudra and
Pashu Nari must be a =
joint statement. Again as you already know, Shudra
was not B.C., OBC, KBC, =
HSBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean
thinking man. I have to agree if y=
ou say that Ganvaar and Shudra can
also be said about Woaman however lookin=
g at the Doha and general
prevailing conditions of society, it seems that h=
e used those words for
Men.

Grammar...Hmmmm. i don't know if he has really=
 used proper grammer in
such Dohas.

There are verse in Bhagvad Gita which =
can be criticised by people from
other faiths if they are taken literaly an=
d without understanding
personality of Krishna.

***

Regarding Ramachandra=
, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend's
view and your detailed =
explanation by giving examples.  But again i
don't think that to consider R=
ama as God will actually be blockage
in leading life like him and that too =
when almost everybody in Sanatan
Dharma knows him as God. Tthat is not reve=
rsible in any case. And above
all, Incarnation of Lord Vishnu - He is a GOD=


***



You and I've notably common Astrological factors in our chart.
Ast=
rologer in me found out just few days back but I'll not give it
hear for th=
e obvious reason lest our own Mr. Narasimha should get mad at
me.

Warm Reg=
ards,

Utpal

PS: I am writing every reference from my memory so please cor=
rect me
when I am wrong in giving any reference

he first hea=

instead chose t=

per my friend, it i=
s more important to emulate Rama's ideas than to
worship Rama.
> > =C3=82=
=C2

hodge=
podge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An
author's=
 paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but
a critics =
nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women
with animals =
or something similar. He believes that was introduces in
the text because T=
ulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust.
Therefore, he ended up com=
posing a sentence derogatory to women.
Further, he argues that if Sri Rama =
is worshipped as God, then the
purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Ra=

way of life. Krishna was there to be worshippe=

maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be =
more God than
Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.

he has an uncompromising attitude when it com=

His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passi=
ng by
in=C3=82=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into t=
he
temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple,
bu=
t he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his
watch=
 it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time
went. W=
hen he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the
temple sat d=

movement. The =
priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend
had no idea why th=
is happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in
deep sleep.

got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact
mos=
t people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was
in sam=
adhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the
exact same p=
lace and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82=C2  Only
his wife and=
 close relatives know about this incident. I believe
nowadays when ever he =
sits for meditation he often enters the state of
Samadhi. When someone aske=

it feels as if the whole uni=

moon, the stars, the planets, th=
e animals, men, women, children, the
wind, the water, the space, smaller th=
an the atom and bigger than
everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=
=C3=82=C2 He considers Sri
Krishna to be God and=C3=82=C2 Lord Rama to be t=

he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he t=

man can and should aim to become like the=
 ideal. But a God cannot be
emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Kri=
shna, but one=C3=82=C2 can
try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued wi=
th him over this, but I
am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a=
 Guru - a human guru
at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus t=

Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.

hat Saint like 'Tulasi Das' would ever be so hard on women. <BR>> The ac=
tual poem is like this:<BR>> || Dhol Ganwaar Shudra Pashu Naari, Yah sab=
 Taadan ke adhikari ||<BR>> Some years back, i read an explanation that =
Tulasi Das ji meant "Pashu Naari" and NOT pashu and Naari. It means He feel=

=C2 That really makes good sense atleast to me.<BR>> =C2 <BR>&=
gt; I am no one to comment on an accepted saint like Sri Tulasidasji's spir=
itual level, but that sentence definitely looks like he clubbed "pashu" and=
 "naari" in same category, not pashu-nari. The highlighting is done by you,=
 not in the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some bas=
ic grammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the level of text, it is ind=
efensible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari who are pashu,=
 why not Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature t=
han Naaris in the world.=C2 This explanation=C2  that you found l=
ooks more like a back engineering job to bail out.<BR>> =C2 <BR>>=
; =C2 <BR>> Regarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable t=
o express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not reall=
y saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees =
that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C2&=
nbsp;God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descende=
d in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A=
 path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C2&nbs=
p; Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was=
 not named "Krishna+ayana". One cannot follow Krishna's path. <BR>> =C2&=
nbsp;<BR>> Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama,=
 our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper=
 and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama di=
d. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man,=
 a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a life.<B=
R>> An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the =
life of a great man.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Similarly, even today lot of=
 people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda, or that this=
 country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not =
mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C2 saint of highest calibre, b=
ut his life's image is like=C2 one who=C2 lived like a lion among=
 sheep of ordinary=C2 men, fearless and uncompromising and principled.=
 If every=C2 person would constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint=
=C2 who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spiritual=
ity or the blessing of a great guru,=C2 no one will ever make an attem=
pt to be inspired by him or=C2 emulate his way of living.Vivekanada wa=
s a spiritual giant, but=C2 the image he projected was one of a tirele=

 =C2 On the other hand=C2 you will never hear anyone advising tha=

impossible. He=C2  was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C2 <=
BR>> =C2 <BR>> Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C2=
 Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actio=
ns but one can never=C2 become Krishna. Therefore, my friend believes,=
 one should not consider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as a model to =

=C2 - but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the wa=

had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his w=

 to worship Rama.<BR>> > =C3=82=C2 <BR>> > 3) He considers=
 the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and =

ven a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school=
, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, =
he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more compre=
hensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since th=
at day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hind=
i and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading the<BR>> English=
 dictionary and<BR>> > one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart fr=
om reading=C3=82=C2 up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=82=
=C2 When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=
=C3=82=C2 equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can t=
ake a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=82=C2 which is =
more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude w=
hen it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a=
 Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to edu=
cation to journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks an=
d writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian=
, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above lan=
guages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While app=
lying for a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When t=
he clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,<BR>> h=
e asked<BR>> > my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrot=
e "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore=
 it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing H=
indu in the form would have been a lie. <BR>> > =C3=82=C2 <BR>&g=
t; > So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his fri=
ends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.<BR>> > =C3=82=C2=
 <BR>> > One day, long back, he was going to office for some urg=
ent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passin=
g by in=C3=82=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go in=
to the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple=
, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his w=
atch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time wen=
t. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple s=
at down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. =
The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea wh=
y this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.<BR>>=
 > =C3=82=C2 <BR>> > Then he started meditating at home, and =
it was there=C3=82=C2 that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not =
say much about these, infact most people who know him also do not know thes=
e things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his medi=
tation seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuou=
sly.=C3=82=C2  Only his wife and close relatives know about this incid=
ent. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters th=
e state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he j=
ust said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun,=
 the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the w=
ind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything=
. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=82=C2 He considers Sri Krishna =
to be God and=C3=82=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he do=
es not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated<BR>> Sri=
=C3=82=C2 Rama to the<BR>> > level of a God whereas the aim of t=
he orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=82=C2&=
nbsp;not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who =
can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the idea=
l. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna,=
 but one=C3=82=C2 can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued wi=
th him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a=
 Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus t=
hese days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.<BR>> > =C3=
=82=C2 <BR>> > Later he had once=C3=82=C2 mentioned he knew=
 the relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His =
mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a=
 lot of time on different internet forums interacting with people, speciall=
y=C3=82=C2 with those in=C3=82=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, disc=
ussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian hi=
story, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young pe=
