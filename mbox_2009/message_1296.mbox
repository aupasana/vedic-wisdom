Namaste

I would like to add more, there are some Vaastu rules and some of =
them 
may be followed, I am not very aware of them.

In my opinion any plac=
e is good when the intentions are good. clean the 
place and go from there.=


What I know is as follows:

Please start pooja with some basic mantras

1=
) Asana Shudhi
2) Sprinkle water on the both body and surrounding and there=
 is mantra 
for that and than do 3 achamans.
3) Bhut Shudi there is mantra =
starting with "Arpa .....
   This is a small mantra and it does work very w=
ell
4) Do some pranayams atleast 1 or 3 with a mantra of choice
Pray  to Ga=
napati, your Guru and other gods and goddeses of your choice.

5) Always do=
 a sankalpa of what you are doing, this is very important
   if say doing 3=
 malas, do a sankalpa or say sitting in meditation, 
say I will try to medi=
ate for 30 mintues whatever.
   This sankalpa doing and then following the =
sankalpa is most important
   This brings lots positive changes in a sadhak=
.
6) Dhoop of Guglu is the best for cleansing any environment
   We get it =
here in US too.
   This cleans up the place nicely

7) Use a clean asana of=
 wool prefrebly. As wool is a good conductor of 
energy.

Before you start =
request Lord Ganapati that there are no obstacles or 
request him to remove=
 the obstacles.

Keep the place clean, wash yourself the pooja items like t=
he divi etc.

When you do these things than automatically the place where y=
ou do 
pooja cleans up in a few days and good vibrations start to exist in =

the place. 

Most of the books have a similar process, please pick that.

=

Best Regards
Mitesh
