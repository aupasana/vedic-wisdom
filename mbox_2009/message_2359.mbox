Namaste

Actually just to clarify, there is quiet a bit of controversy a=
bout the Puri temple. During the days of Swamji, the western scholars unequ=
ivocally stated that Puri was build on a Buddhist temple, however today, th=
ere is contrary evidences which says that it was not a temple built by dest=
roying or converting another temple. Infact, there are some very old manusc=
ripts that pass on through generations of the main priests of the Temple, w=
hich also shed some light on this fact. It is from one of that manuscripts =
it was found that the Temple was orginally built as a Bhairava Temple with =
the pradhan deities being Mahakali, Tara and Bhuvaneshwari. The whole area =
of the temple was designed as=A0a Bhairavi Chakra, that is why the prasad o=
f Puri is called Mahaprasad - beyond all rules (even one who is fasting can=
 have the prasad of Puri).
=A0
To clarify, my mail was not at all a critici=
sm of the man that Swamiji was. Without the slightest iota of doubt, he sin=
gle handedly achieved what it would have taken a crowd of average calibre m=
en thousands of years. He was a leader of men. And about his spiritual cali=
bre, there is no question either. Thakur had himself certified Swamji, and =
Thakur's words on spirituality are like Gospel truths for me.
=A0
However, =
when it comes to judging/understanding material aspects of knowledge, it is=
 always a changing reality, therefore best is to keep oneself updated. Resp=
ect the past, learn from=A0the past and then use ones own reasoning to modi=
fy it for the present in the light of new evidences, if needed. 
=A0
Same t=
hing I find with Aghora books. Brilliant as they are, in places Vimalananda=
 uses hyperboles or approximations to build his story, an intelligent reade=

ith western style academics is that they are fixated with factual accuracy =
and do not understand the use of myth/hyperbole/story-telling as a way of p=
assing knowledge (which is so essential in the Indian context). That is why=
 they take every word as either true or false based on strict objective par=

After all, that is what Vivekananda himself =
did in his formative years! Do 
not accept something unless you understand =
and *digest* it. Accumulating a 
lot of undigested knowledge causes problem=
s later, just as accumulating a 
lot of undigested food in one's stomach do=
es.

At the same time, be mindful of the fact that a spiritual giant's view=
 may 
be unpalatable to you because of your own limitations, i.e. you may b=
e 
missing something. Give the benefit of doubt and try to understand 
resp=
ectfully.

Of course, when it comes to factual inaccuracies, it is a differ=
ent matter. 
If you know for sure that something a spiritual giant said was=
 a factual 
inaccuracy, you can of course dismiss and ignore it.

An active=
 man like Vivekananda, who accomplished so much in a life of 39 
years, may=
 sometimes use wrong facts at his disposal based on the 
understanding at h=
is time, to advocate what he wanted to advocate. But, 
blessed jnaanis and =
karma yogis like Vivekananda or Aurobindo would often 
end up advocating co=
rrect views even if they use wrong facts occasionally to 
support their vie=
ws.

If I am not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built around 10=
00 AD 
or so. I am not sure of what existed in that specific place before.

Narasimha
