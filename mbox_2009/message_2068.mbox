Hello All,

I read somewhere that japam done DURING grahan has huge effect=
. But now I read on a website that 

"Perform ritual bath, Puja, Japam, hav=
an and all other rituals ONLY AFTER Grahan Moksh Kaal (the time when grahan=
 is released)."

It says to do japa only after grahan is over.Is this true?=


How is this Grahan Moksh Kaal calculated? 

Thanks,
Manish
