Namaste Narasimha Garu,

You wrote in one of The messages:

very long time, but other religions too have seen >saints of high levels of=
 realization, though perhaps not at the same rate.
]

It seems very correct=
 that Bharat Varsha has always produced Mystics, Saints, Yogis and such peo=
ple who have walked on Spiritual path. They are many and in every age.

Wou=
ld you give your thoughts on this as to why this is so?

Regards,

Utpal
