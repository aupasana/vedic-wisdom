 29th April, 1948

This morning, at about 9 o=92clock, a lawyer from Rayala=
seema who came here
yesterday, sat near Bhagavan=92s couch and asked, =93Sw=
ami, in the Gita, Lord
Krishna first said that everything is embraced in th=
e =91doing=92 only, and
one=92s self plays no role. Subsequently, He says t=
hat He Himself is the
=91doer=92, the =91doing=92 and the =91deed=92 (karta=
, karma and karyam); though =91doing=92
(karma) is the most important of th=
e three, it is ineffectual by itself
(jadam). If this is so, then everythin=
g depends upon the =91doer=92, who is
Ishwara. Why when He first created =
=91doing=92 (karma), did He create different
karmas for different people? I=
t is said that afterwards everyone is made to
function according to his kar=
ma. How did this difference come about in the
very beginning? How did it ar=
ise? Not only that, if everything is left to
the =91doing=92 and to the =91=
doer=92 who is Ishwara, where does personal effort
(purushakaram) come in? =
If there is no personal effort, why is it said that
we ourselves must attai=
n Realization? What does it mean?=94

Bhagavan said,=93Who is it that is as=
king? To whom has this doubt arisen? Why
has it arisen? First think that ov=
er and find out.=94

The devotee: =93Swami, I am only enquiring why Lord Kr=
ishna said that.=94

Bhagavan: =93That is what I am referring to. What exac=
tly did Lord Krishna
tell Arjuna? He told him, the deed will get done accor=
ding to the =91doing=92. I
am the =91doer=92 watching the whole thing from =
above. Why do you worry? It is
your body which does the killing of your rel=
atives. Are you the body?

No! Why then this bondage for you? Renounce the =
idea, He said. This means
that He asks Arjuna to do the thing but to give u=
p the feeling that it is he
that is doing it. That is personal effort.

The=
 feeling that one is, or is not, the body, comes from one=92s own
ignorance=
. One only has to give up that feeling; that which one has, one
must onesel=
f reject. Who else can do it? If by personal effort that bondage
is removed=
,action, under the orders of the =91doer=92, Ishwara, goes on of its
own ac=
cord.

Every one has his work allotted to him and he will do it automatical=
ly. Why
should one worry? Arjuna, when he felt that it was not proper to ki=
ll his
relatives, was only told to give up the feeling that he was the =91d=
oer=92, yet
it was Arjuna himself who ultimately fought.By listening to the=
 Gita, he
lost the feeling of being the =91doer=92 and the doubt he had had=
 was no longer
there.

The work had to be done with that particular body, a=
nd it was done. Even
Duryodhana was like that. Not that he was not aware of=
 the correctness or
otherwise of what he was doing. He knew that what he wa=
s doing was not
right, but some force was leading him on to that work. What=
 could he do?
That work had to be done in that way by that body, and it was=
 done. He is
reported to have said so at the time of his death. Hence it is=
 clear that
some Force is making all people to do things. Getting rid of th=
e feeling
that =91I myself am doing=92 is personal effort (purushakaram). A=
ll spiritual
practices (sadhanas) are towards that end.=94

Another devotee=
: =93That is all right. For this karma there must be a
beginning, but how i=
t began, no one has mentioned.=94

Bhagavan: =93Yes, but it is the same thi=
ng. If you are asked =91how did you get
this?=92 you say you have got it by=
 =91doing=92 (karma). How were you born? By
=91doing=92 (karma) that is all=
 that could be said. If, however, you ask how was
this karma born, you are =
told you should not ask such questions.

This is known as the Law of the se=
ed and the tree (bija ankura nyayam). The
tree is born of the seed; again f=
rom the tree a seed is born. Where is the
origin of that seed? That is a qu=
estion which you are told is not to be
asked. What can we say to that? That=
 is why I always ask people to find out
first how they were born and where =
they were born.=94

O Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all beings wh=
o are mounted upon
the automation of this body, causing them by His illusiv=
e power to spin
round according to their actions.

-- Gita XVIII: 61

Seek =
refuge in Him alone, with all your being, O Arjuna! Through His grace,
you =
shall obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode.

-- Gita XVIII: 62
