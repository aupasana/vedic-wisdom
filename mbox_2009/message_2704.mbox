Dear Narasimha,
   Please Ignore my previous-mail, it was =
not completed - i will try to delete it.

   Am not mixing up the terminolo=
gies, though my mail didn't go in details. Your understanding is flawed.

1=
. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideation=
al or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body =
(See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/as=
tral body) don't have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.

> Aha=
mkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-
> ...they a=
re all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness 
> permeates thr=
ough all layers of one's individualized consciousness.

2. Where did you re=
ad this up ?

   There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attribute=
d to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea o=
f Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuali=
ty of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it =
has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.

  Ind=
ividuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara beca=
use "What exists as a part cannot be the whole". Thus, the idea of Ahamkara=
, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn't account for neither=
 controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, wi=
thout requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would a=
lways interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions=
 of life-forces and so on.

  Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are =
the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. =
Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived=
 from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their funct=
ioning as well as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived" in any way by=
 the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Bud=
dhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't =
work upon that particular idea.


>  But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very b=
asis of the entire 
> individualized consciousness.

3. Well, as most Physi=
cal-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn't=
 apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can=
 always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is=
 "the very basis" of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical=
-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodie=
d being.
  An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense-consciousness as th=
e very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.
  A Causal-bodied =
being thinks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousness as the very basis of the en=
tire individualized consciousness.
  However, that individuality is of the =
Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral=
 being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.

 =
 As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through =
all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh res=
ides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting =
controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular =
body is "my body" or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical b=
odies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so the=
y would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bou=
nd worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones' phy=
sical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.


> Out of the four antahkara=
nas, chitta (remembering or conditioned 
> mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ne=
ss) are parts of the kaarana 
> sareera (causal body) and remain till the e=
nd.

4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a =
Yogi -

  Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas compri=
sing Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge=
, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising=
 Physical body (16 chemical elements).

  Now, as we all know that Physical=
 body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising=
 it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whol=
e in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constitu=
ent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging i=
dea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the =
causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.

  T=
hus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, 
  Manas=
 with Subtle Astral vibrations and 
  Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal =
Vibrations.

  Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undevelop=
ed irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender =
to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...

  BTW, Chitta is =
not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all=
 the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn'=
t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just lik=
e a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn't automatically burn i=
t down. Sadhana is required for That.
  The Samskaras stored by Chitta, inc=
luding those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to t=
he Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the "Satvic - T=
amas" represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-pe=
rceiving Satvic Chitta doesn't get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras i=
t stores.
  Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions=
, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul refl=
ects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus reali=
zing its own nature as Brahman.

5. 
  In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:  
  drigad=
arshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6
  Egoism is the identification of the seer =
with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkar=
a.
  Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see,=
 hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense =
of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn't create A=
stral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense every=
thing.

   Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is a=
ssociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.
=

6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness, must be ov=
ercome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chap=
ter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot b=
e tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted=
 to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sens=
e-consciousness which is associated with Manas.

  In Patanjali Yoga Sutras=
 also it is mentioned in the same manner :

  dristanushravika vishaya vitr=
ishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-

  That effect which comes to these=
 who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and wh=
ich wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commen=
ted that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.

  This is to be accomplished=
 by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astra=
l Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.

7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:
=
   yogashchittavrittinirodhah -2-
   Thus, extinguishing all the movements =
of Chitta is called "Yoga". 

  This is to be accomplished by transferring =
the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherw=
ise as a causal-bodied being.

  I hope this clarifies.

Regards,
Nitish

ever, my understanding of this path differs a little from your understandin=
g. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptures or scholarly argumen=
ts, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is a state of bein=
g,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the universe. It is achieved t=
hrough sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discrimination between real =
and not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that whatever is finally left is=
 nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the marga called Gyan. But=
 sadhana it is without a doubt.

sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say, was an ex=

a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was a gyani be=
cause he had achieved a state of oneness.
