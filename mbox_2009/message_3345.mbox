Namste Narsimha,

In addition to this i have one more query.
Why do you say=
 that following method of homam is safer than the pranayam method, after al=
l both have duality in them bcoz if we burn something toxic it produces fir=
e of a different kind in comparison to if we burn sandalwood.

Kindly expla=
in.

Regards
Jitender
