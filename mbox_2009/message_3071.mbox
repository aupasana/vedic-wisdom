DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly
thi=
ngs?"

MASTER: "While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has=
 to
practise renunciation, applying the logic of 'Neti, neti'=E2=80=94'Not =
this, not
this', But after attaining the vision of God, he realizes that Go=
d alone has
become all things.

"At one time Rama was overpowered by the sp=
irit of
renunciation.Dasaratha,worried at this, went to the sage Vasishtha =
and
begged him to persuade Rama not to give up the world. The sage came to =
Rama
and found him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had b=
een
raging in the Prince's mind.

Vasishtha said: 'Rama,why should You reno=
unce the world? Is the world
outside God? Reason with me.' Rama realized th=
at the world had evolved from
the Supreme Brahman. So, He said nothing.

"B=
uttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes this
=
knows that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After
se=
parating the butter with great effort-that is to say, after attaining
Brahm=
ajnana=E2=80=94you will realize that as long as butter exists, buttermilk a=
lso
must exist.

Wherever there is butter there must be buttermilk as well.=
 As long as one
feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware that the =
universe, living
beings,and the twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well=
.
