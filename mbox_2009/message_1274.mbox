Namaste friends,

Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets from an 
interview posted on her website. Please see below.

It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
show what is truth" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

She told him that many people are and will be born who will perform a short 
fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. 
Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar 
lines.

My guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and 
can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of 
events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.

Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for 
3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings 
deities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine 
presence these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure 
souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which 
Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was 
taken on Ramakrishna's birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within 
a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. 
All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this significance when 
we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are 
similar to the words of Mother.

Best regards,
Narasimha
