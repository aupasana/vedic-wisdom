Some rich people brought a silver cup, saucer and spoon and placing them
re=
verentially before him, said, =93Bhagavan, please use these when you take
a=
ny liquid food.=94 Bhagavan examined the things and passed them on to his
a=
ttendants. As the attendants were placing them in the bureau in the hall,
h=
e objected and said, =93Why there? Let them be kept in the office itself.=
=94
=93They were given for Bhagavan=92s use, were they not?=94 said a devot=
ee. =93Yes,=94
replied Bhagavan, =93but those are things used by rich peopl=
e. What use can
they be to us? If required, we have our own cups and spoons=
. We can use them
=97 why these?=94 So saying, Bhagavan told his attendant,=
 =93Look, from tomorrow
we will use our own cups. Take them out.=94

A devo=
tee asked, =93What are those cups,Bhagavan?=94 =93Oh! Those cups are made o=
f
coconut shells,smoothed and preserved. They are our cups and spoons. They=

are our own. If we use them the purpose is served. Please keep the silver
=
articles carefully elsewhere,=94 said Bhagavan. =93Are not those silver art=
icles
Bhagavan=92s own?=94 asked the devotee. Bhagavan said with a laugh, =
=93Yes, they
are. But tell me, why all this ostentation for us? They are co=
stly. Should
we be careless, some one might steal them.So they must be guar=
ded. Is that
the job for Swami?

About the same time, a devotee brought a n=
ice walking stick with a silver
handle, and presented it to Bhagavan. Turni=
ng it this side and that, and
examining it, Bhagavan remarked to the devote=
e, =93Good. It is very nice.
Please use it carefully.=94 =93But it is not f=
or my use,=94 he said. =93I have
brought it thinking that Bhagavan would us=
e it.=94 =93What an idea!=94 exclaimed
Bhagavan. =93A nice walking stick wi=
th a silver handle should be used only by
officials like you. Why for me? L=
ook, I have my own walking stick. That is
enough,=94 concluded Bhagavan.

A=
s a rule, Bhagavan does not use costly things. He likes things which do not=

cost even a paisa.
