 IN a certain village there lived a weaver. He was a very pious soul.
Everyone trusted him and loved him. He used to sell his goods in the
market-place.When a customer asked him the price of a cloth,the weaver would
say: "By the will of Rama the price of the yarn is one rupee and the labour
four annas; by the will of Rama the profit is two annas.

The price of the cloth, by the will of Rama, is one rupee and six annas."
Such was the people's faith in the weaver that the customer would at once
pay the price and take the cloth, The weaver was a real devotee of God.
After finishing his supper in the evening, he would spend long hours in the
worship hall meditating on God and chanting His name and glories. Now, late
one night the weaver couldn't sleep. He was sitting in the worship hall,
smoking,now and then, when a band of robbers happened
to pass that way.

They wanted a man to carry their goods and said to the weaver, "Come with
us." So saying, they led him off by the hand. After committing a robbery in
a house, they put a load of things on the weaver's head commanding him to
carry them. Suddenly the police arrived and the robbers ran away. But the
weaver, with his load,was arrested. He was kept in the lock-up for the
night.

Next day he was brought before the magistrate for trial. The villagers
learnt what had happened and came to the court. They said to the magistrate,
"Your Honour, this man could never commit robbery." Thereupon the magistrate
asked the weaver to make his statement.

The weaver said: "Your Honour, by the will of Rama I finished my meal at
night. Then by the will of Rama I was sitting in the worship hall. It was
quite late at night by the will of Rama. By the will of Rama I had been
thinking of God and chanting His name and glories, when by the will of Rama
a band of robbers passed that way. By the will of Rama they dragged me with
them; by the will of Rama they committed a robbery in a house; and by the
will of Rama they put a load on my head. Just then, by the will of Rama the
police arrived and by the will of Rama was arrested. Then by the will of
Rama the police kept me in the lock-up for the night, and this morning by
the will of Rama I have been brought before Your Honour."

The magistrate realized that the weaver was a pious man and ordered his
release. On his way home the weaver said to his friends, "By the will of
Rama I have been released."

Whether you live in the world or renounce it,everything depends upon the
will of Rama. Throwing your whole responsibility upon God, do your work in
the world.
