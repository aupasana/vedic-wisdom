Namaste Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
In the "Gospel of Ma Saroda", which records vari=
ous conversations and incidents about her, she mentions that Thakur will be=
 working in the astral plane for 300 years.
=C2=A0
So I was wondering how c=
an Thakur reincarnate in 100 years time, which of these is more authetic..

The upsurge (of consciousne=

Hi PVR,

I disagree here. Intellect is disl=
iked because it questions. And when the answers are not comfortable with ou=
r existing beliefs we find excuse to quite our mind. There are many ways to=
 find God. Intellect never hinders. The same way pride also has many disgui=
se. One can be proud of humility or one's devotion to god as well. 

So say=
ing such a thing actually confuses people and set wrong beliefs in mind.

R=
egards,
Siya.
