Namaste,

You did not create confusion, but I wanted to make an important point. If a 
day is a special day and/or one has more time, one option is to repeat the 
same mantra used everyday more times. If one does a mantra 28 times everyday 
in homam, one can do it 108 times when one has time. If one has more time, 
one can do it 216 times. And so on. Mind always wants variety and finds it 
difficult to focus on ONE thing and wants variety. But it is a tendency we 
need to eventually overcome.

Also, Ramakrishna used to say "if you want water, dig 100 feet in one place 
instead of digging 5 ft in 20 places." All the energy one has for spiritual 
sadhana can be directed at ONE thing - one mantra, one deity and one 
sadhana.

Of course, those who have a taste for many things can do many things based 
on the occasion, but I want to point out the other option.

Best regards,
Narasimha
