Subject: Meditating on chakras (Re: Order of Creation...)

Dear Sundeep,

Heavens no, I wasn't suggesting meditating on any chakra at all. It is 
neither necessary not sufficient to focus on ANY chakra for Kundalini to 
rise. For example, a true Kundalini awakening experience was described in 
the following mail. That person was not meditating/focusing on ANY chakra 
and he actually never thinks in terms of chakras. He just meditated with a 
Veda mantra and focused the mind on the mantra and a deity that he is 
attached to.

On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas) - message 1476
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476

Irrespective of what one is focusing on, Kundalini goes from Moolaadhaara to 
Swaadhishthaana to Manipoora to Anaahata and so on. That order if fixed. 
Kundalini will leave a chakra and go to the next chakra if and only if one's 
notion of "I" is free from certain things at that time. Leaving each chakra 
has different requirements and has do with the corresponding element and 
limitations represented by it. As long as your self-awareness is 
characterized by the qualities represented by Moolaadhaara , Kundalini 
cannot advance from Moolaadhaara.

Intense focus on something (e.g. a mantra or a deity) may free one 
temporarily from the limitations represented by a chakra, enabling Kundalini 
to leave the chakra. If Kundalini left Moolaadhaara chakra, it does not mean 
the person was (or should be) meditating on Moolaadhaara chakra or 
Swaadhishthaana chakra. THAT is irrelevant. What is relevant instead is 
whether the person overcame the limitations represented by Moolaadhaara 
chakra. Same with other chakras.

*        *        *

Let us go back to the order of elements:

Apart from Upanishads, Vasishtha clearly mentions in Yoga Vaasishtham that 
creation order is ether, air, fire, water and earth and dissolution order is 
the reverse. When earth, water, fire, air and finally ether are dissolved, 
Vasishtha says that cosmic space remains. This is the same thing that Nitish 
was quoting as "super ether", but it is not considered as an "element" by 
Vasishtha. When that too is dissolved, one merges in Brahman. From Brahman 
comes the cosmic space and from it come the five elements.

Sahasrara chakra represents Brahman. Here there is no ego principle (I-ness 
or ahamkara) and no objectification. Aajnaa chakra represents the cosmic 
space which is accompanied by the concept of Time. The ego principle 
(I-ness) is active here and there is a sense of I, but it is very subtle and 
has not yet expanded. When this ego principle expands, element of ether is 
created from it and later air, fire, water and earth are created. Chakras 
from Visuddhi to Moolaadhaara represent ether to earth.

The creation of five elements from the cosmic space is explained by 
shastras, but how Brahman gave rise to cosmic space and Time (where there is 
objectification and I-ness) is mysterious. Cosmic space and Time represent 
the early stages of the field of duality, while Brahman represents 
non-duality. The transition between the two involves several stages that are 
mysterious.

Correspondingly, there are several secretive chakras in between Sahasraara 
chakra and Aajnaa chakra. They are at the top of the forehead and at the top 
of the head.

Whether it makes sense to you or not, some great yogis consider some of 
those chakras to be better than Sahasraara. In Sahasraara, there is no 
I-ness, no objects and no experience. In the secretive chakras just under 
it, there is a very subtle I-ness, there are objects and very subtle 
experiences. There is some "rasa" (juice/experience) to be had by I-ness 
here.

*        *        *

I cannot recommend any text on Kundalini as definitive. "The Serpent Power: 
Shat chakra Nirupana" by Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodruff - sp?) is 
considered a good text, but I honestly did not find it valuable. It is just 
theoretical. Manish values Vimalananda very highly and asked me to buy 
"Kundalini" by Robert Svoboda. He told me, "though not perfect, this is the 
best book you can find these days on the subject. Whether you read it or 
not, buy it so that you can later compare notes with what you experience." 
Whatever I have learnt experientially so far is quite consistent with the 
simple and lucid ideas represented in that book.

Of course, various upanishads and works of Shankaracharya will give you a 
clearer perspective on some issues and enhance your internal understanding.

*        *        *

Shankaracharya said in "bhaja govindam" composition: "O fool, pray to 
Govinda tirelessly. When your time's up, all this knowledge and these 
technicalities aren't going to save you." Moreover, different people 
sometimes think in different terms and misunderstand others. It is like a 
Pascal language programmer reading C language software, guessing what it 
means and reporting bugs based on wrong understanding of the language.

It is with a sense of discomfort and amusement that I write about these 
technical matters these days. I suppose I have to deal with these 
technicalities because some important people that I care about are 
interested in these technicalities at this point of time.

If people just do homam or japam or whatever sadhana they chose and focus 
all of their mental energy on their chosen deity, it will be more useful...

Best regards,
Narasimha
