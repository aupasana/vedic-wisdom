Namaste Rajarshi,

We need to be respectful to rishis, yogis and other seers who=
 passed down genuine knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda is a great yogi and a=
 person with a high level of realization, who came to earth for a specific =
mission and executed it so well.
 
If somebody quoting him is saying "fancy=
" things, please realize that it may be due to misunderstanding by that per=
son. For example, even Patanjali was being quoted and misused earlier, base=
d on a misunderstanding.
 
If one is pure and ready, just a single book by =
a good author may be sufficient to give perfect knowledge. But, otherwise, =
even a really good book may not stop one from forming some wrong notions. O=
f course, reading multiple good books may give a better perspective. Howeve=
r, let us not explicitly or implicitly put down any good book or author her=
e.
 
*        *        *
 
I want to make a philosophical comment.
 
Take a=
 simple question: What is the purpose of debate in a matter relating to kno=
wledge and when is a debate over?
 
One with kshatriya temperament may want=
 to assert one's supremacy and correctness and may want to see the opponent=
 kneel down and accept defeat. Such a debater may sometimes get personal an=
d pass personal remarks that are dismissive or condescending or disparaging=
 in nature/tone.
 
But, one with braahmana temperament does not care about =
assertions of supremacy, victory, defeat etc. Such a debater only wants cor=
rect knowledge to be spread and wrong knowledge to be contained, to the bes=
t of one's limited ability. Such a debater will stay away from personal com=
ments, focus on the subject matter and make only those comments that promot=
e further understanding and clarification of knowledge. If, for example, th=
e opponent changes his/her stand in the middle of the debate without acknow=
ledging his/her mistake and accepting defeat, it will not be a big deal for=
 a braahmana debater. As long as wrong knowledge is contained, the purpose =
of the debate is served! There is no need to put down the person. Moreover,=
 a true braahmana debater will display the same braahmana qualities *even w=
hen* he/she is confronted by a kshatriya debater.
 
I'd love to see some le=
arned members develop a braahmana attitude to debating here. Spiritual know=
ledge is essentially a braahminical pursuit and let us maintain a braahmini=
cal attitude in it.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
