Dear Narsimhaji,

Just I read Chandi Homam manual yesterday. You have writ=
ten that Devi
kavacha, Ratri Sukta and Devi Sukta (Namo Devyai....) is to b=
e omitted
before and after 13 chapters for Ahutis.

But sir in my routine d=
aily homam for different dieties, if I find some
time I am doing homam on R=
atri Sukta and Devi Sukta mantras also and
giving Ahutis. Some times I incl=
ude 4th Chapter (Shakradayah....) and
sometimes 11th Chapter also. Is it a =
mistake ? or it is  O.K ?

I mean,  can I give Ahutis for Ratri Sukta and D=
evi Sukta independantly 
when I am not doing whole Chandi path Homam ? Can =
I also give Ahutis for
4th chapter only?

Dr. Ashwin Rawal
