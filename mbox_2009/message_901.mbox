Dear Narasimha-ji, 
May I ask two questions to you ?

1) Is it advisable to=
 do any Homam (specifically MahaGanpathy homam)
during solar eclipse time ?=
 The annual solar eclipse, I believe, is on
the 26th of Jan 2009, and would=
 like to know if it is alright to
perform this homam then. I understand the=
 MahaGanapathy homam is
specifically suitable as a remedy for people with K=
etu dosha.  

2) I have an inexplainable affinity to the Sun God. I try to =
do a
simple Agnihotra Homam - although not religiously. 
My apologies in ad=
vance for inter-mixing Astrology in this forum. My
Atmakaraka Budh is in it=
s Moolatrikona rasi conjoined with Rahu in the
12th house in Navamsa. There=
fore, Leo is the sign which is 12th from
AK's placement. There are no plane=
nts in Leo, but its lordSun is
exalted in Mesha(but alongwith Moon and Satu=
rn) in 7th house in my
chart. So is Sun worship (Agnihotra Homam) advisable=
? Is a different
Homam advisable given the planetary combination in my char=
t (and a bad
phase wrt marital life that I am current going through) ?? 

F=
YI - My DoB particulars are 27th May 1975, Hyderabad, 00:05 (5
minutes afte=
r midnight). I have Gandanta Moola dosham/yoga. 
I am happy to donate a sma=
ll sum towards education of poor children
(instead of offering some money a=
t a temple) in your name, for any
help/advice that you offer me with my cha=
rt. 
 

Kind regards
Sharad
