Namaste Narasimhaji and all friends, 

First of all I would like to say a b=
ig thank you and how fortunate I feel to have come across this amazing yaho=
o group, where I find the answers to the questions which I've had for a lon=
g time but was afraid to ask!

:-)

I have a situation where the family pur=
ohit-cum-jyotish has advised for the japam of the Ketu beeja mantra, which =
he has given thus - "Om Sah Prom Prim Pram Om Ketave Namah". 

>From the lit=
tle that I know, I have only come across the "prom prim pram" beeja for the=
 Shani mantra and the Ketu mantra being thus "Om shram shreem shroum sah ke=
tave namah".

Now unless this is a NEW practice of mixing and merging of th=
e Navgraha beejas or a practice/tradition which I have not heard of so far,=
 I have doubts regarding its correctness. And I would not question the fami=
ly purohit for fear of appearing arrogant or causing any offence to them be=
cause aren't priests after-all, micro-Gods...in such a case should one cont=
inue doing a mantra which one doubts because:

1. one has to accept this is=
 one's karma for getting a 'wrong' mantra?
2. even if the mantra were to be=
 incorrect, does the fact that it was heard out of the mouth of a pious and=
 pure purohit automatically correct any blemishes of the mantra?
3. or shou=
ld one trust one's own judgement and auto-correct the mantra without inform=
ing the purohit about it?

I will be grateful for any input on this one as =
always.

Many thanks,
Somanathan
