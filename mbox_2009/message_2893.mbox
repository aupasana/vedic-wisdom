Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Several years ago I was living in a ashr=
am in Vrajbhoomi. One day a 80 year old sannayasin=A0 woman came to live in=
 the next room to me. She was from South and well educated and from a good =
family. She told me several of her spiritual experiences.
=A0 
One thing sh=
e said that in Sri Giriraj area some holy men are living who are nearly 400=
 hundred years old. They come out of their hidden cave once a year on the d=
ay after Depaavali. But on that day thousands and thousands are doing Parik=
rima. And with so many sadhus there, nobody pays them any attention.

She s=
aid when she learned about them she came to find them. No luck first and se=
cond year. Perhaps it was third year when she said, that she took a vow tha=
t she would not leave Sri Giriraj area till she finds them.

She said to me=
 that she saw them on that day from a distance. One lifted his hand in bles=
sing and she understood that he was saying to her---- keep doing the Bhajan=
s.
Then they mingled in crowd and disappeared.

I completely believed her s=
tory. Several times I have thought what sort of mantra or herbs they use to=
 remain alive for such a long time. Tomorrow they would be out again. Pity =
they are not members of this group otherwise good thing to know about.

Kin=
d Regards
LaxmiNarayan
