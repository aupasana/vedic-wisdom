Namaste,

Modern religions like Christianity and Islam almost completely wiped out 
native religions wherever they went (e.g. countries in Africa, South 
America, America etc). However, despite foreign invasion and complete 
foreign control of India for a millennium, Hinduism is still basically doing 
ok. True, some damage has been done, but it is still standing tall and firm 
enough. Isn't it amazing?

In fact, Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the correct term 
is "sanatana dharma", i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By definition, 
it is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it cannot be destroyed. Even if 
it seems close to extinction, it will come back up. That is the nature of 
this dharma. I am not worried about Sanatana dharma being damaged or 
destroyed.

I will continue to discharge what *I* believe nature expects from *me* and 
what I believe is *my* dharma, without any worry whatsoever that sanatana 
dharma is in some kind of danger of extinction. However, such a belief is 
vital for some people to discharge *their* dharma and hence we have some 
people driven by that sense of danger and the resulting fear and anger. That 
is ok too.

*        *        *

Sadguru Samartha Ramadas is not an ordinary soul. He is born with an amsa of 
Lord Hanuman. His words may be slightly misunderstood.

To somebody like him, it would not matter whether a nation calls itself 
Hindu or secular or whatever. What would matter is whether dharma is 
followed or not.

Right now, we do not have sanatana dharma being followed in any country, in 
secular India or in Hindu Nepal or in many other countries following 
secularism or various religions.

If it is indeed God's wish that sanatana dharma be established in the world, 
it will happen when its time comes.

Best regards,
Narasimha
