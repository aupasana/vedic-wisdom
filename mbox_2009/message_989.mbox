Dear Chandramouli, namaste

Consult the elders in your family on what is to be done and then take a
decision.

My opinion: if the wedding had been fixed BEFORE your father's death, you
can proceed with the wedding. Invoke the blessings of your ancestors for the
marriage.

Hope this helps.

best regards
Hari
