Namaste,

It is fine to do both successively. The following 2 approaches can be used:

(1) Do Ganapathi homam and then do Kuja homam, separately, one after the 
other.
(2) Take a combined sankalpa, do Ganapathi homam procedure fully until 
uttarngam. When you finish punah pooja, don't go to uttarangam, but go to 
Kuja homam procedure and directly invoke Kuja in fire. At the end, do 
uttarangam and do one combined poornaahuti.

Some people offer a separate poornaahuti to each deity before switching to 
another deity. After you finish Ganapati mantras, you offer punah pooja to 
him and then offer a poornaahuti and then proceed to invoke Kuja in fire. In 
this tradition, a poornaahuti is offered after punah pooja to each deity 
before switching to another deity, and a final poornaahuti is offered at the 
end after uttaraangam to all deities together.

However, it is perfectly fine to do a single poornaahuti.

If all this confuses you, simply do (1).

Best regards,
Narasimha
