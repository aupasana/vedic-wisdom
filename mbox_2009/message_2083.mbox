Nam=
aste,
=A0
I was reading a small interview by Deepak Chopra on 
Michael Jack=
son. Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into 
prescription=
 medicines and how that ruins some people's lives. That somehow 
reminded m=
e of a story.
=A0
Sometime back, mother of a young man came to me to 
show =
his chart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was 
brillia=
nt from the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale 
combination=
s. I declared, "this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but 
that =
of a sannyasi (ascetic/monk) ." She broke down into tears and gave me some =

background. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and hi=
s 
mother does not want him to.
=A0
This boy had been calm, peaceful, conte=
nted and an 
introvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, h=
e had an 
interesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father w=
as teaching 
math to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voi=
ces. Suddenly, he 
stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anythin=
g for a while. His mind 
was completely blacked out. After a while, his min=
d returned to normalcy and he 
saw and heard everything. But he felt a trem=
endous sense of bliss and 
contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he =
felt then.
=A0
He realized that what people pursue as happiness is 
nothing=
 in front of what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do 
anyt=
hing anymore. He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became 
=
worried and took him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brai=
n and 
found nothing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one mon=
th. They put 
him on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept=
 telling the 
doctors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they w=
ould not understand 
what he experienced. After a month, those doctors conc=
luded he was normal and 
had no problem. The powerful drugs he received dur=
ing the month wreaked havoc on 
him, but he was not angry or mad at his par=
ents or doctors. He says he 
understands his parents love him and hence the=
y did all this. He does not want 
to hurt them. He also says he knows what =
he wants but does not know how to get 
it. But he knows that regular studie=
s and regular material life will not get him 
what he wants.
=A0
When I cha=
tted with him alone, I realized that he 
is a brilliant young man with clea=
r thinking. He is certainly not a mad person. 
He just needs someone to sho=
w him a spiritual path to make something permanent, 
which temporarily came=
 to him and left him! To get it permanently now, he needs 
to do serious sa=
dhana. His parents also took him to many so-called swamijis, but 
he was no=
t satisfied with the advice given anyone. He started reading Ramana 
Mahars=
hi and a few others and liked some of them. But he is still without a 
clea=
r direction.
=A0
Interestingly, just when I was about to chat with 
this pe=
rson after making his parents leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked 
me=
 what was going on. I mentioned that I was about to talk to a teenager who =
had 
a nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed=
 my 
feeling that this boy had great spiritual potential.
=A0

Unfortunatel=
y, the system we have in place looked 
at him with suspicion and gave power=
ful drugs to mess up his mind for one full 
month! He is lucky and survived=
 the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live 
in that someone who reali=
zes, albeit momentarily,=A0the essence of 
scriptures, is labeled as a ment=
ally disturbed person and powerful drugs are 
given to him, instead of clea=
r spiritual direction to make that realization more 
permanent.
