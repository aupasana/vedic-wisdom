Dear Friends,

 I want to share some thoughts on Guru Kripa.  Scriptures proclaim that without the grace of Guru, it is not possible to attain Moksha or Darshan of God or Self-Realization which is  the summum bonum of life.  Irrespective of whether one deserves or not or whether the disciple does sadhana or not, Guru Kripa sets aside all normal laws that operate in the spiritual plane and takes one to transcendental bliss.   We can say that there is nothing but Gurukripa  which is needed for us to attain perfection in life.  The Guru is an infinite ocean of mercy. Gurukripa is undeniably a divine force that can turn even a stone into the infinite Satchitananda, what to talk of a conscious being? The Guru is always Gracious.  But then, GuruKripa has  not only to be bestowed but has also to be received.  In receiving it,we immortalise ourselves, divinise ourselves.
 
Jesus said,"Seek and it shall be found,knock and it shall open unto you, ask and it shall be given."  It is not as if there is dearth of divine grace or Guru Kripa.  We have to seek and we have to knock and having done that, we must be ready to receive it.  If this is present then Guru Kripa will flow into us and raise us to the highest realm of immortality and infinite bliss. For the Guru`s grace to flow one has to be a sishya and a worthy sishya.  Guru Bhakti and Guru Seva have to be maintained  constantly. Thus  we have to serve the Guru. What is meant by serving the Guru? It means not only doing personal service to Guru but also live upto his Upadesas(teachings).  Accept him as the leader and obey him completely.  There must be joy in the obedience to the Guru. Even in dream we should obey the Guru.  If this is done constantly without any let or hindrance we are on the path of receiving Guru`s grace.
