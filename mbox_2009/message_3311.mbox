Dear Members,

Sri Mandeswara (Saniswaraya) Temple is an ancient manument =
in
VillageMandapalli in East Godavari Distt of Andhra Pradesh.It is about
3=
5 Kms from Rajamundry on the Vijayawada-Vishakhapattnam route. You are
awar=
e that Saturn is also called Mandi, or Mandachari.  In legends, it
is known=
 as famous Siva Temple, which was built by Saturn, for atoning
his sin of B=
rahamhatya by installing and adoring his Ishta Devata, Lord
Shiva.  Another=
  legend, states that when Rakhsas  on the path of
destruction of Devatas, =
they  pleaded Sage Dadhichi for help. Sage
Dadhichi offered the Armours  cr=
eated from his body bones and gave to
Devatas to fight Rakshsas. But, devat=
as could not defeat the demons.
Then sage Dadhichi adviced them to approach=
 great Saturn ,as he was the
only capable entity to use these armoury  and =
kill the demons. When
approached by devatas, Saturn expressed his inability=
 to go on war, as
he was performing Yajna for his ishta devata, lord Shiva,=
 for atoning
the sin of brahamhatya. However, after forceful pleadings by t=
he all
devatas, Saturn consented to use the shastras of the bones of sage
D=
adhichi and fight demons, thus leaving his Yajna incomplete, and
destroyed =
the demons. The place where Saturn destroyed the demons is
known after the =
name of Saturn, Mandapalli.

After the victory Saturn built a great temple =
for his ishta devata Lord
Shiva by installing a black Shivling,then the tem=
ple of Parvatiji was
also installed, followed by temple of Narayana and Nag=
eshwaray. All in
the same premises.

In this temple. the pujaris priests pe=
rform pooja for removing the
severe effects and Graha dosham of all the pla=
nets, and the mantras are
also addressedd to Saturn ; to help the devotee t=
o free them from all
obstacles and bad times they are undergoing, due to af=
fects of kroor
grahas. This pooja takes about 45 minutes. The pooja can als=
o be
specific for mahamritunjaya , if one needs that way. After this,
ginge=
lli oil is offered on the Shivlinga through a long funnel,and
obeseience is=
 also paid to the other deities. After performing the
abhishekam ,the prasa=
d given to the devotee is Kumkum, called Sri
kumavari Kumkum.

I was underg=
oing very severe period in my life from 2004 onwards, and
Ihad done all the=
 upayas, whatever I could do to the best of my
knowledge,but of no avail.  =
Even I had stopped my astrology work. Then
in 2007, I happened to  read abo=
ut this temple on the internet ; and I
simply proceeded to Rajamundry and v=
isited the temple. After my return,
I had lot of feel good factor, and slow=
ly within 3 months my peace of
mind started returning, health improved, ast=
rology centre started
re-working with more vigour and inner energy. As a to=
ken of my gratitude
I again visited this ancient temple in November,2009, a=
nd now I feel
greatly energised and more at peace and and satisfied. Visit =
and pooja
at this ancient temple has been really a great experience for me,=
 after
visiting almost all the known temples and historical and popular
rel=
igious places  in the country during past 20 years.

The priests there are =
not at all greeedy or fleece anyone. The pooja
samagri costs Rs.40-50; and =
you can offer  any amount in dakshina to the
priests who performs special p=
ooja , say anything  between Rs.151 or
more, as per your wishes ! Offering =
to all deities are normally done in
cash to help the upkeep of the temple, =
and pujaris in 4 temples do not
look askance at the devotees for money.  Gr=
eat soothing spiritual
expereince indeed, as it is in a small village,with =
no hustle and bustle
and hardly 2-3 devotees come to the temple , except on=
 the Triyodasis(
which fall on Saturdays ) , 3 or 4 times in a year.
With m=
y best wishes to all members and especially to those for whom
nothing appea=
rs to be working right ! It is just the question of faith
in His powers.
