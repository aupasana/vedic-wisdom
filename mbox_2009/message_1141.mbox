Namaste Narasimha, 
=A0
I want to narrate an incident before I pose this qu=
estion. The excerpts are from "Living with Himalayan Masters" book. 
=A0
In=
cident: (Before the independence of India)
Swami Rama is a disciple of XXX =
guru (Guru's name is not mentioned in the book as Guru preferred secrecy) a=
nd is practicing the rigorous of spiritual sadhana=A0in the abode of serene=
 Himalayan mountains,=A0to feel the cosmic consciousness. 
It was during th=
is time, the independence movement was in progress in India and Rama too go=
t tempted to be a part of the movement. 
It was at this juncture, his guru =
advised him to continue with sadhana and not to take part in the movement a=
s India is destined to get freedom. 
=A0
=A0
Incident 2: 
We keep hearing/r=
eading from noble people like Gandhi, Chanakya,=A0Lord Krishna, Abdul Kalam=
 etc, that country is first before you. (Can we here imply "you" as=A0sadha=
na too?)
=A0
These two illustrations are quite contradictory?
What should w=
e give the first priority to? Country or understanding self? Isn't the comf=
ort of being in a country necessary to understand the self? 
=A0
Please do =
let us know your thoughts.
=A0
Thanks & Regards, 
--Murahari
