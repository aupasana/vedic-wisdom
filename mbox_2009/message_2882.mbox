Shri Narasimha ji,
Hari Om!
This is my first post, I had created a yahoo ac=
ct mainly for this group then forgot all about it for almost 3 months until=
 a few days back, maybe a week. In the past 2 days I've read over 100 posts=
 to try to get up to date and start posting.
I had also wanted to be blesse=
d with your presence while I was in MA, but I think I had the wrong e-mail =
saved which I got from the astrology site. I was close to Grafton, in Milfo=
rd.
I have learned a lot from your website and homam guides but was relucta=
nt to use them for some time until I did on Janamashtmi.

Some sources say =
Yama Deep should be on Dhanteras, 2 days before Diwali and some say tomorro=
w Oct. 16th?
Also in superstition, if someone loses gold on dhanteras, is i=
t bad luck?... should laxmi prarthana be done to rectify this?
Please shed =
some light...

Thank you, I look forward to your answer and taking part in =
many more discussions.

Vedic Sanatan Dharma Kee Jai!
Chetan
