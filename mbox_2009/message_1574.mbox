Namaste,

What is a significance of -

* Pratham Charitra Starting with "Om=
 Aim" and Ending Reversly with "Aim Om"

* Dwitiya Charitra Starting with "=
Om Hreem" and Ending Reversly with "Hreem Om"

* Trutiya Charitra Starting =
with "Om Kleem" and Ending Reversly with "Kleem Om"

It is understood that =
All the Three charitras are Attributed to Mahaakali, MahaLakshmi and MahaSa=
rswati respectively and hence Aim beeja, Hreem Beeja and Kleem Beeja are at=
 the starting and ending of of each charitra.

It is evident that All the 3=
 charitras are *Embedded* in Aim, Hreem and kleem at the same time everythi=
ng (Beejakshara as well as complete charitra) are embedded in OM.

What cou=
ld have been the reason?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
