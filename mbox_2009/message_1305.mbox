Namaskaaram Miteshji,
I think you have correctly named Sant Sri Gajaanan Ma=
haaraaja.In Maharashtra, there are many followers of him and Dattaatreya Up=
aasanaa ...
As you have mentioned Gayatri Parivar(through their Periodical =
Yugnirman Yojana publihed since very long-at least over 30 Years) have vigo=
rously propagated the Havana culture and benefitted many many millions.More=
 importantly,in Sri Ram Sharmaji's lineage -Dr.Pranavaji -tried to analyse =
the gaseous emissions form a Gayatri Havana using Gas Chromatography techni=
que and have scientifically proven that the emissions are benefic to the en=
vironment and people sitting nearby are actually benefitted healthwise. I d=
o not recall the reference since these expirements were made in early 1990'=
s.
Gayatri Parivaar generally performed Homam on Sunday.They have been doin=
g selfless service visiting uninitiated people's Homes for Gayatri Homam fo=
r decades now. 

As Utpalbhai had mentioned=A0 a few other spiritually elev=
ated persona have strongly recommended Homam techniques for 'Janakalyaana'.=
...
What I found to be unique and appealing on this forum and Sri Narasimha=
ji's Technique of Homam is the singular lack of complications... a very sim=
ple technique emphasizing on the meditation through Saatvika mantras. No el=
aborate preparations needed and no major expenditure or time. 
I am not sur=
e of many people who have published OR put on Internet a step-by-step proce=
dure for performing Homam -EVERYDAY.
Very honestly-I have never performed a=
ny Homa on my own -now I have started it.As the learned people on this foru=
m have been saying-even with my flows and incorrect handling-
I still find =
some positive changes in personality and thinking pattern.

Humble regards,=

amit

Namaste Ut=
pal

Very good post ...

There have always been some big proponents of Homa=
n and Agni pooja.
Pandit Shree Ram Sharma of Gayatri parivaar started it in=
 a big way 
many decades ago. This is a fantastic movement, where now they =
have 
done research on homan etc and the effects on the environment and 
bo=
dy.

In Maharastra, followers of dattatreya had a simple agnihotra process
=
of using cow dunk and ghee and cotton bud. I think this was Gajanan 
Mahara=
j, I may have the wrong name, but they are very authentic
Datta followers a=
nd that lineage.

In the south also Swami Ganapati Sachidanandji again a Da=
tta Avatar 
has been doing homans for many decades.

There may be more invo=
lved in Homam for many decades too, I am sure 
many people can add to this =
list.

I wanted to do homan for a long time but I had no clue and some 
mon=
ths back I saw Narashima's manual and I did a few myself too.

Best Regards=

Mitesh
