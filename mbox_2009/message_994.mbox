Pranaam Shri Narasimhaji and Rajarshiji,

Please forgive me for hijacking t=
his post. 

I would like to thank you for addressing this question. I have =
myself
noticed how one's worship to one's 'prescribed' Ishta devata is not
=
always straightforward. 

In one case, the planet (Budh) which represented =
the Ishta Devata was
combust in the native's chart and also the Badhakesh. =
Not only did the
native encounter obstacles in starting worship to Lord Mah=
aVishnu but
there were also problems (accidents, problems in workplace) whe=
n they
started a regular recitation of the VishnuSahasranaam which they hav=
e
have stopped now because of fear of more bad things happening. They
only =
continue their DurgaMaa/Chandi worship which they have always
felt naturall=
y inclined to. 

What is the significance of this and what can one do when =
Ishta Devata
is also the Badhakesh?

Thank you for taking the time to read =
my post.
