"The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of
sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for
that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment." (Gita III-9)

When we are born into a particular set up of circumstances which we call a
family, all the conditioning factors of the family are also born together
with us. The tradition of the family grows when we grow. The pattern of our
character and conduct is entirely determined by the idealogical background
that is at the very basis of the structure of that particular family. We are
born not merely in a family but also in wider circumstances called the
community, nation, world, universe, etc., to all which we owe obligations.
Our obligation to a condition into which we are born is sacrifice or
*Yajna* and
that is what Bhagavan Sri Krishna speaks of in the above verse.

When we are born, we are born with certain obligations. What are these
obligations? They are the allegiance that we perforce owe to those factors
that are responsible for our birth and maintenance. That is the sacrifice
which we are called upon to do. In the *Vedas*, which are antecedent even to
the Mahabharata and the Bhagavadgita, we are given the first primeval
concept of sacrifice. Supreme sacrifice is extolled in the *Veda*, according
to which the Absolute itself is the first performer of the *Yajna* and not
a *Pandit*. The Absolute did the first *Yajna* and then the others followed.
They are only imitating what the Absolute did, originally.

What was the sacrifice that the Absolute did and who was the performer of
that sacrifice? Where was the *Vedi* or the *Yajna-kunda* for that sacrifice
and what was the material that was offered in that sacrifice? *'Yajnena
Yajnamayajanta Devah'*, says the *Purusha-Sukta*. *Yajna* was the
sacrifice, *Yajna* was offered in *Yajna* by *Yajna* for the sake of*Yajna*.
Sacrifice was offered in the sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the sake
of sacrifice. What do you understand from this? You understand nothing,
except a jumble of words. Similar to this enigmatic statement of the *Veda*,
we have another statement in the Bhagavadgita also: *'Brahmarpanam
Brahmahavir-Brahmagnou Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma
Samadhina'*. Brahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of
Brahman. What does it mean? It seems as confusing as that *Vedic Mantra*.
But let us remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It is a
universal involvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the property
of the whole creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become the
property of everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us, and
we must give it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. That
obligation is the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the *
Yajna*.

Our obligation is not merely to our parents, brothers and sisters, not
merely to the government of our country that protects us, not merely to the
planet earth on which we live, not merely to the solar system which gives us
light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger demands upon us and if we
can think for a moment the obligations that we really owe to this wonderful
creation of God, we will not be able to breathe for a moment! Because we are
not able to fulfil all these obligations in a short span of life, we are
reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we have fulfilled or discharged
all our duties in this very life itself, why should we take next birth! But,
life is short, and also we have not got the least concept of what
obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Even when we are ninety
years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, naturally we die with
ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not able to discharge our
duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the duties and obligations
properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so long as we do not
understand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected to perform and
fulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our existence, we
cannot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.

What are the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning factor.
They have given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and educate us.
Society is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe to the
society. Though it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the society
protects us, takes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and the
international system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short,
the whole cosmos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to all
things in the universe. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a
part of our cloth gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a
thorn and move forward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us from
behind. When we try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find
ourselves unable to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are
caught from another side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we
will find that another obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have an
integral vision of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have a
very narrow vision of things and it is this narrow vision that is
responsible for our birth and death.

This mysterious law, the law of *Yajna*, operates in the world. *'Yajno vai
Vishnuh'*--Supreme Narayana Himself is called *Yajna*. The term '*Yajna*'
signifies the whole of the culture of *Bharatavarsha*. If you want one word
which can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture of India, '*
Yajna*' is that word. How meaningful it is, we can imagine. Every cultural
pattern and every presupposition of human existence is contained in this
pregnant term '*Yajna*', which means the universal sacrifice that the soul
performs. The performer of the sacrifice is the soul. It is not an *Acharya* or
a *Pandit*.

In the *Anugita* of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the Bhagavadgita,
this *Yajna* is described in a very beautiful form. It states what
*Yajna* actually
is. This *Yajna* is going on daily in this body and it is going on
everywhere in the world, outside and inside. It is sacrifice of all those
factors which tend to tether the soul to the bodily tabernacle into the fire
of the knowledge of the Absolute. This is called *Jnana-Yajna* which means
the offering of knowledge into the fire of Knowledge. Which knowledge is
offered into which knowledge? The knowledge of our individual existence in
all its aspects is offered in the knowledge of the Supreme Being. The
concept of this mysterious *Dharma* before us cannot be contained in our
minds. Our heads will burst if we start thinking deeply about these
implications of our life.

Knowledge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowledge
necessary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition,
intuition or forevision that people cannot contain the *Vedic* knowledge in
their heads. *'Ananta vai Vedah'*--*Vedas *are endless or infinite, which
means to say knowledge has no limit. People in this *Kali Yuga* especially
are so feeble physically, morally and intellectually, that this truth has to
be instilled into their minds through some other manner. This is why
*Vyasa* wrote
the great Epic Mahabharata. He found out that the *Vedas* are of no use to
poor human beings in this *Kali Yuga*. Whatever the *Vedas* say would not
enter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowledge. How
many of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in our way
of thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scientific
thinking as is contained in the *Vedas* is far from us.

When I say the *Vedas* are scientific, I am not making a joke. Masters like
Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the *Arya Samaj*; Sayana, the great
commentator of the*Vedas*; Aurobindo, of our own times; the Puri
Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all have struggled to
point out that every science is contained in the *Vedas*. Even subjects such
as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the highest type in
differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is in the *Vedas*. Sri
Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called 'Vedic Mathematics', and it
has been published by the Benares Hindu University. The *Veda Samhitas *contain
the highest reaches of Mathematics. Many think that the *Vedas* are only
some foolish chants of cowherds of Punjab, as British historians tell us.
The *Aryans* were regarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and
blabbering something and that became the *Vedas*. This is the British
interpretation of our culture, which has gone into our heads! The *Vedas* are
not blabbering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic
souls who had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this
vision-integral contains every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry,
biology, sociology, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy, *Ayurveda*, military
science and what not. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore,
bid good-bye to *Vedas*. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa,
wrote the Mahabharata and the *Puranas* to explain these very impersonal
scientific truths of the *Vedas* in personal Epic style.

In villages some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a
Sari. She cannot tell directly to her husband, 'I want a Sari'. So, she will
say: "The neighbour's wife has purchased a new Sari today; it is very good,
very nice; I saw it myself." Her husband understands her intentions. He will
say: "Why do you describe all these things? All right, I will purchase one
for you." And the poor man purchases a Sari. The Epics and *Puranas* follow
a similar indirect way of instructing the truths. But the *Vedas* directly
tell the truth openly: 'You must do this, it is like this.' This is
scientific. Science always plainly tells the truth as it is, without any
camouflage. The Epics and the *Puranas* do not say directly that you must be
a good man. They say: 'Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so
immense. He shared everything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous
that as a result he got so many things.' One who hears this feels: 'Oh, I
see, then I must also do like that.' These texts are called *Suhrit-Sammitas
*, while the *Vedas* are known as *Prabhu-Sammitas*. The latter command like
a master. Science always commands on principles. The Puranas and Epics give
stories, ancient history and make us think scientifically in an indirect
manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is why it is said *'Bharatam
Panchamo Vedah'*. While the *Vedas* are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata
is the fifth*Veda*. It is as important as the *Vedas*. Sometimes they say,
it is even more important than the *Vedas*.

Whatever it is, when knowledge gets adulterated through intense sensory
activity, weakness of will and lack of moral force, the understanding of *
Dharma* also falls. So we must have a whip to goad us to the path of *Dharma
*, spirituality and God-consciousness. The tradition of India,
Bharatavarsha, is full of such goading whips. While the *Vedas*, the Puranas
and the Epics may be said to be direct teachers in an institution or an
academy, the culture of India has also instituted many occasions for
bringing home to our mind facts of our eternal glory and our duties to God,
the world and mankind. We owe three kinds of duty which are mentioned in the
eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavadgita*, 'Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani
manishinam'*. They are *Yajna, Dana *and *Tapas*. *Yajna* itself contains in
its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethics. Still we are
told*Yajna*, *Dana* and *Tapas* constitute the highest necessity of
religion. While *Tapas* is the duty that we owe to our own selves, *Dana* is
that which we owe to others, and *Yajna* is that we owe to God. *Tapas* is
austerity. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life. *
Dana* is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in respect
of others, while *Yajna* is the self-dedication we make of our own self
wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.

We have various occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold
duty. They are called *Vratas*, some of which are annual, some monthly and
some daily. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day
(*Chaturdasi*) of the dark-fortnight in the month of *Kartika*
(October-November).
People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat delicious dishes.
Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. There is an
atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped and Divine
grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with this
celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon
Narakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka,
from where he brought the *Parijata* plant, to fulfil the wishes of
Satyabhama, his consort.

The Dipavali festival is regarded as an occasion particularly associated
with an ancient event of Sri Krishna overcoming the demoniacal force known
as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and Puranas. After the great victory
over Narakasura in a battle, which appears to have lasted for long, long
days, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabhama returned to his abode in
Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxious about the delay caused
in Sri Krishna's returning and it is said that they were worshipping
Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare of everyone and the quick
returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. And, after Sri Krishna
returned, the story goes that he took a bath after applying oil over his
body, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic work he had to do in
the war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected with Sri Krishna's
ritual is also one of the reasons for people necessarily remembering to take
an oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi, prior to the Amavasya,
when Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India remembers to take an
oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour of, Bhagavan Sri
Krishna's doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Having taken the bath,
they all joined together in great delight in the grand worship of
Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. This is the
traditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the worships
connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.

There is a third aspect of it which is called *Bali Padya*, the day
following Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly
connected with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another
background altogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as
Vamana, bestowed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when
He took a Cosmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can
read in the Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.

Bali Chakravarti was himself a great devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and
having submitted himself to being thrown into the nether regions by the
pressure of the foot of Narayana in the Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of
Him to have some occasion to come up to the surface of the earth and then be
recognised as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana Himself. This recognition, this
hallowed memory of Bali Chakravarti, is celebrated on the first day of the
bright fortnight following the Amavasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of
the terms used to designate this occasion, the day next to Amavasya.

So, the sum and substance of the message connected with Dipavali is that it
is a three day festival, beginning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to
Amavasya; then the main Lakshmi worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and
the third day which is Bali Padya connected with the honour bestowed upon
Bali Chakravarti as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion
for spiritual exhilaration, a lighting up of all darkness, socially as well
as personally, outwardly and inwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry
of the Supreme Light of God into the hearts of all people.
**

*Dipavali* means the line of lights. *Dipa* is light; and *Avali* means
line. So, *Dipavali* or the festival of the line of lights is the
celebration of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the
victory of the *Sattvic* or divine elements in us over the *Rajasic* and *
Tamasic* or baser elements which are the real *Asuras*, the *Rakshasas*, *
Narakasura* and others. The whole world is within us. The whole cosmos can
be found in a microscopic form in our own body. *Rama-Ravana-Yuddha* and *
Tarakasura-Vadha*, and all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside
us. This Dipavali is thus also a psychological context, wherein we
contemplate in our own selves the holy occasion of self-mastery,
self-subjugation and self-abnegation leading to the rise of all spiritual
virtues which are regarded as lustre or radiance emanating from
Self-Knowledge. *Bhagavati Mahalakshmi*, the Goddess of prosperity, does not
merely mean the Goddess of wealth in a material sense. *Lakshmi* does not
mean only gold and silver. *Lakshmi* means prosperity in general, positive
growth in the right direction, a rise into the higher stages of evolution.
This is the advent of *Lakshmi*. Progress and prosperity are *Lakshmi*. In
the *Vishnu Purana* we are told if *Narayana* is like the sun, *Lakshmi* is
like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Wherever *Narayana* is,
there is *Lakshmi*. Wherever is divinity, there is prosperity. So on this
day of *Dipavali* we worship the Supreme God who is the source of all
conceivable virtues, goodness and prosperity, which is symbolised in
illumination, lighting and worship in the form of *Arati* and gay joyous
attitude and feeling in every respect. So, in short, this is a day of
rejoicing over the victory of *Sattva* over the lower *Gunas*, the victory
of God Himself over the binding fetters of the soul.

e of words. Similar to this enigmatic statement of the=A0<i>Veda</i>, we ha=
ve another statement in the Bhagavadgita also:=A0<i>'Brahmarpanam Brahm=
ahavir-Brahmagnou Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma Sama=
dhina'</i>. Brahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of=
 Brahman. What does it mean? It seems as confusing as that=A0<i>Vedic Mantr=
a</i>. But let us remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It =
is a universal involvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the pro=
perty of the whole creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become=
 the property of everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us,=
 and we must give it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. Th=
at obligation is the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the=
=A0<i>Yajna</i>.</p>

<p>Our obligation is not merely to our parents, broth=
ers and sisters, not merely to the government of our country that protects =
us, not merely to the planet earth on which we live, not merely to the sola=
r system which gives us light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger =
demands upon us and if we can think for a moment the obligations that we re=
ally owe to this wonderful creation of God, we will not be able to breathe =
for a moment! Because we are not able to fulfil all these obligations in a =
short span of life, we are reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we h=
ave fulfilled or discharged all our duties in this very life itself, why sh=
ould we take next birth! But, life is short, and also we have not got the l=
east concept of what obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Ev=
en when we are ninety years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, na=
turally we die with ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not abl=
e to discharge our duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the dut=
ies and obligations properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so lon=
g as we do not understand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected=
 to perform and fulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our=
 existence, we cannot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.</=
p>

<p>What are the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning=
 factor. They have given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and edu=
cate us. Society is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe t=
o the society. Though it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the societ=
y protects us, takes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and t=
he international system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short=
, the whole cosmos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to al=
l things in the universe. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a=
 part of our cloth gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a=
 thorn and move forward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us fro=
m behind. When we try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find=
 ourselves unable to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are=
 caught from another side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we =
will find that another obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have a=
n integral vision of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have =
a very narrow vision of things and it is this narrow vision that is respons=
ible for our birth and death.</p>

<p>This mysterious law, the law of=A0<i>=
Yajna</i>, operates in the world.=A0<i>'Yajno vai Vishnuh'</i>--Sup=
reme Narayana Himself is called=A0<i>Yajna</i>. The term '<i>Yajna</i>&=
#39; signifies the whole of the culture of=A0<i>Bharatavarsha</i>. If you w=
ant one word which can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture=
 of India, '<i>Yajna</i>' is that word. How meaningful it is, we ca=
n imagine. Every cultural pattern and every presupposition of human existen=
ce is contained in this pregnant term '<i>Yajna</i>', which means t=
he universal sacrifice that the soul performs. The performer of the sacrifi=
ce is the soul. It is not an=A0<i>Acharya</i>=A0or a=A0<i>Pandit</i>.</p>

=
<p>In the=A0<i>Anugita</i>=A0of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the B=
hagavadgita, this=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is described in a very beautiful form. I=
t states what=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0actually is. This=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is going =
on daily in this body and it is going on everywhere in the world, outside a=
nd inside. It is sacrifice of all those factors which tend to tether the so=
ul to the bodily tabernacle into the fire of the knowledge of the Absolute.=
 This is called=A0<i>Jnana-Yajna</i>=A0which means the offering of knowledg=
e into the fire of Knowledge. Which knowledge is offered into which knowled=
ge? The knowledge of our individual existence in all its aspects is offered=
 in the knowledge of the Supreme Being. The concept of this mysterious=A0<i=
>Dharma</i>=A0before us cannot be contained in our minds. Our heads will bu=
rst if we start thinking deeply about these implications of our life.</p>

=
<p>Knowledge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowl=
edge necessary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition, =
intuition or forevision that people cannot contain the=A0<i>Vedic</i>=A0kno=
wledge in their heads.=A0<i>'Ananta vai Vedah'</i>--<i>Vedas=A0</i>=
are endless or infinite, which means to say knowledge has no limit. People =
in this=A0<i>Kali Yuga</i>=A0especially are so feeble physically, morally a=
nd intellectually, that this truth has to be instilled into their minds thr=
ough some other manner. This is why=A0<i>Vyasa</i>=A0wrote the great Epic M=
ahabharata. He found out that the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are of no use to poor hu=
man beings in this=A0<i>Kali Yuga</i>. Whatever the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0say wo=
uld not enter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowled=
ge. How many of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in=
 our way of thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scien=
tific thinking as is contained in the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0is far from us.</p>
=

<p>When I say the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are scientific, I am not making a joke.=
 Masters like Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the=A0<i>Arya Samaj</i=
>; Sayana, the great commentator of the<i>Vedas</i>; Aurobindo, of our own =
times; the Puri Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all h=
ave struggled to point out that every science is contained in the=A0<i>Veda=
s</i>. Even subjects such as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the=
 highest type in differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is i=
n the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called =
'Vedic Mathematics', and it has been published by the Benares Hindu=
 University. The=A0<i>Veda Samhitas=A0</i>contain the highest reaches of Ma=
thematics. Many think that the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are only some foolish chant=
s of cowherds of Punjab, as British historians tell us. The=A0<i>Aryans</i>=
=A0were regarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and blabbering so=
mething and that became the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. This is the British interpretat=
ion of our culture, which has gone into our heads! The=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are=
 not blabbering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic =
souls who had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this vision-integ=
ral contains every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry, biology, sociolog=
y, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy,=A0<i>Ayurveda</i>, military science and=
 what not. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore, bid good-bye=
 to=A0<i>Vedas</i>. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, wrote th=
e Mahabharata and the=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0to explain these very impersonal s=
cientific truths of the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0in personal Epic style.</p>

<p>In=
 villages some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a Sar=
i. She cannot tell directly to her husband, 'I want a Sari'. So, sh=
e will say: "The neighbour's wife has purchased a new Sari today; =
it is very good, very nice; I saw it myself." Her husband understands =
her intentions. He will say: "Why do you describe all these things? Al=
l right, I will purchase one for you." And the poor man purchases a Sa=
ri. The Epics and=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0follow a similar indirect way of instr=
ucting the truths. But the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0directly tell the truth openly:=
 'You must do this, it is like this.' This is scientific. Science a=
lways plainly tells the truth as it is, without any camouflage. The Epics a=
nd the=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0do not say directly that you must be a good man. =
They say: 'Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so immense. He s=
hared everything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous that as a resu=
lt he got so many things.' One who hears this feels: 'Oh, I see, th=
en I must also do like that.' These texts are called=A0<i>Suhrit-Sammit=
as</i>, while the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are known as=A0<i>Prabhu-Sammitas</i>. T=
he latter command like a master. Science always commands on principles. The=
 Puranas and Epics give stories, ancient history and make us think scientif=
ically in an indirect manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is w=
hy it is said=A0<i>'Bharatam Panchamo Vedah'</i>. While the=A0<i>Ve=
das</i>=A0are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata is the fifth<i>Veda</i>.=
 It is as important as the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. Sometimes they say, it is even m=
ore important than the=A0<i>Vedas</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, when knowled=
ge gets adulterated through intense sensory activity, weakness of will and =
lack of moral force, the understanding of=A0<i>Dharma</i>=A0also falls. So =
we must have a whip to goad us to the path of=A0<i>Dharma</i>, spirituality=
 and God-consciousness. The tradition of India, Bharatavarsha, is full of s=
uch goading whips. While the=A0<i>Vedas</i>, the Puranas and the Epics may =
be said to be direct teachers in an institution or an academy, the culture =
of India has also instituted many occasions for bringing home to our mind f=
acts of our eternal glory and our duties to God, the world and mankind. We =
owe three kinds of duty which are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of th=
e Bhagavadgita<i>, 'Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani manishinam'</=
i>. They are=A0<i>Yajna, Dana=A0</i>and=A0<i>Tapas</i>.=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0it=
self contains in its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethi=
cs. Still we are told<i>Yajna</i>,=A0<i>Dana</i>=A0and=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0con=
stitute the highest necessity of religion. While=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0is the du=
ty that we owe to our own selves,=A0<i>Dana</i>=A0is that which we owe to o=
thers, and=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is that we owe to God.=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0is aust=
erity. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life.=A0<i=
>Dana</i>=A0is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in =
respect of others, while=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is the self-dedication we make of=
 our own self wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>We have vari=
ous occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold duty. They =
are called=A0<i>Vratas</i>, some of which are annual, some monthly and some=
 daily. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day (<i=
>Chaturdasi</i>) of the dark-fortnight in the month of=A0<i>Kartika</i>=A0(=
October-November). People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat del=
icious dishes. Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. Th=
ere is an atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped =
and Divine grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with =
this celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon=
 Narakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka,=
 from where he brought the=A0<i>Parijata</i>=A0plant, to fulfil the wishes =
of Satyabhama, his consort.</p>

<p>The Dipavali festival is regarded as an=
 occasion particularly associated with an ancient event of Sri Krishna over=
coming the demoniacal force known as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and =
Puranas. After the great victory over Narakasura in a battle, which appears=
 to have lasted for long, long days, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabham=
a returned to his abode in Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxi=
ous about the delay caused in Sri Krishna's returning and it is said th=
at they were worshipping Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare o=
f everyone and the quick returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. =
And, after Sri Krishna returned, the story goes that he took a bath after a=
pplying oil over his body, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic=
 work he had to do in the war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected =
with Sri Krishna's ritual is also one of the reasons for people necessa=
rily remembering to take an oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi,=
 prior to the Amavasya, when Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India r=
emembers to take an oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour o=
f, Bhagavan Sri Krishna's doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Ha=
ving taken the bath, they all joined together in great delight in the grand=
 worship of Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. Thi=
s is the traditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the wor=
ships connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.</p>

<p>There=
 is a third aspect of it which is called=A0<i>Bali Padya</i>, the day follo=
wing Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly connec=
ted with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another background a=
ltogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as Vamana, bes=
towed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when He took a =
Cosmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can read in t=
he Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.</p>

<p>Bali Chakravarti was himself a grea=
t devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and having submitted himself to being t=
hrown into the nether regions by the pressure of the foot of Narayana in th=
e Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of Him to have some occasion to come up=
 to the surface of the earth and then be recognised as a devotee of Bhagava=
n Narayana Himself. This recognition, this hallowed memory of Bali Chakrava=
rti, is celebrated on the first day of the bright fortnight following the A=
mavasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of the terms used to designate this=
 occasion, the day next to Amavasya.</p>

<p>So, the sum and substance of t=
he message connected with Dipavali is that it is a three day festival, begi=
nning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to Amavasya; then the main Lakshm=
i worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and the third day which is Bali Pa=
dya connected with the honour bestowed upon Bali Chakravarti as a devotee o=
f Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion for spiritual exhilaration, a l=
ighting up of all darkness, socially as well as personally, outwardly and i=
nwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry of the Supreme Light of God i=
nto the hearts of all people.</p>
<i></i>
<p><i>Dipavali</i>=A0means the li=
ne of lights.=A0<i>Dipa</i>=A0is light; and=A0<i>Avali</i>=A0means line. So=
,=A0<i>Dipavali</i>=A0or the festival of the line of lights is the celebrat=
ion of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the victory of =
the=A0<i>Sattvic</i>=A0or divine elements in us over the=A0<i>Rajasic</i>=
=A0and=A0<i>Tamasic</i>=A0or baser elements which are the real=A0<i>Asuras<=
/i>, the=A0<i>Rakshasas</i>,=A0<i>Narakasura</i>=A0and others. The whole wo=
rld is within us. The whole cosmos can be found in a microscopic form in ou=
r own body.=A0<i>Rama-Ravana-Yuddha</i>=A0and=A0<i>Tarakasura-Vadha</i>, an=
d all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside us. This Dipavali is t=
hus also a psychological context, wherein we contemplate in our own selves =
the holy occasion of self-mastery, self-subjugation and self-abnegation lea=
ding to the rise of all spiritual virtues which are regarded as lustre or r=
adiance emanating from Self-Knowledge.=A0<i>Bhagavati Mahalakshmi</i>, the =
Goddess of prosperity, does not merely mean the Goddess of wealth in a mate=
rial sense.=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>=A0does not mean only gold and silver.=A0<i>Lak=
shmi</i>=A0means prosperity in general, positive growth in the right direct=
ion, a rise into the higher stages of evolution. This is the advent of=A0<i=
>Lakshmi</i>. Progress and prosperity are=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>. In the=A0<i>Vis=
hnu Purana</i>=A0we are told if=A0<i>Narayana</i>=A0is like the sun,=A0<i>L=
akshmi</i>=A0is like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Whereve=
r=A0<i>Narayana</i>=A0is, there is=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>. Wherever is divinity, =
there is prosperity. So on this day of=A0<i>Dipavali</i>=A0we worship the S=
upreme God who is the source of all conceivable virtues, goodness and prosp=
erity, which is symbolised in illumination, lighting and worship in the for=
m of=A0<i>Arati</i>=A0and gay joyous attitude and feeling in every respect.=
 So, in short, this is a day of rejoicing over the victory of=A0<i>Sattva</=
i>=A0over the lower=A0<i>Gunas</i>, the victory of God Himself over the bin=
ding fetters of the soul.</p>
