Miteshji Namaste!

Thank you very much for your post. 

I think I understan=
d what you mean. Thank you for including the key
word 'sanchit sanskaras' w=
hich was like a light bulb that just lit up
for me!! 

It reminded me of a =
post from Shri Narasimhaji that I read a while ago
about the 'expiation' of=
 one's negative karma. It said something like
- if you have a basket of tom=
atoes and some are rotten at the top, you
have to throw away the rotten one=
's first before you can get to the
bottom to the good ones. 

But I tend to=
 think that the purpose of Jyotish Vidya is Bhagwaan's
gift to us in order =
to alleviate the suffering of others and help them
reach Moksha. I think th=
at's why I find it hard to reconcile the
concept of Badhakesh and Ishta Dev=
ta being one and the same. But then
again, the Ishta Devta works in too mys=
terious ways for my limited
mortal mind to understand! :-)

Many thanks.
