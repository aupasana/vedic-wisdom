When you draw the six lines with a darbha on the base of the havan kund bef=
ore placing a camphor in the center and lighting it, what do yo do with the=
 darbha? I've sometimes used it in the homa and other times thrown it away.=
 I ask because I noticed a priest in our local tempple throw it over his le=
ft shoulder (southwest direction) when facing east.

Thanks,
Alok.
