Dear All,
=A0
What is the difference between self realization and God reali=
zation?=A0We often say=A0Buddha or Sri Ramanamaharishi or Sri Adi Shankarac=
harya were self realized masters, whereas a Ramakrishna Paramhamsa was a Go=
d realized master. What is the difference between these two states of spiri=
tual realization?
=A0
=A0
I presume=A0a person who is an atheist or agnost =
can also attain self realization (theoritically at least), but maybe not Go=
d realization.
=A0
-Regards
