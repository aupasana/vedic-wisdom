Dear Narasimha,

I was thinking in the same line as Rajarshi has expressed =
in the below message about Sain Baba. In the morning when i saw your messag=
e, first thing came to my mind is that How much influence Sain baba or Kabi=
r has on Muslims today? Immediately Shirdi temple and long queue came to my=
 imagination and can we find any Muslims there?

The fact remains that be i=
t Sain Baba or Kabir or another saint, unifying effect is only on Hindus an=
d their followers today are also only those.

>>>It was heartening to me wh=
en I saw it. I saw a ray of hope<<<

Honestly, I am not very excited with t=
his.

The Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentioned are true. and th=
ose are the very reasons which prevents even the broad minded Islamic indiv=
idual to succumb finally.

In my opinion, it requires a radical force from =
within the followers of Islam itself which can change their outlook for goo=
d.

Best Regards,

Utpal

Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muh=
ammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an attempt at d=
isguising Kufr with an Islamic garb.
