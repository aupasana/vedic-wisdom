 6th April, 1948

Bhagavan told the people near him: =93Namaskara means pro=
stration a number of
times according to some. What can be done? The real me=
aning of namaskara is
the dissolving of the mind.=94

=93What is the meanin=
g of sashtanga namaskara, Bhagavan?=94 asked the devotee.

=93It means that=
 eight limbs of the body, namely, two hands, two legs, two
arms, chest and =
forehead, touch the ground while saluting. The idea behind
this type of obe=
isance is that the person doing it says, =91the body which
touches the eart=
h, will resolve itself into that earth ultimately, and the
=93I=94 in me wi=
ll continue to be =93I=94 alone=92.

That idea must be known to oneself by =
enquiry.

Without knowing it, there is no use in doing these. With meaningl=
ess
namaskaras people want to secure all the benefits: =91Swami must give t=
hem
whatever they desire, be it a bag of clothes or money.=92
