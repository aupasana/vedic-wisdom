Dear ALL

Namaste.


5) SELF CONTROL: It is only via self control that we c=
an render our body and
mind healthy and balanced. Misuse of our sense organ=
s leads to diseases and
mental stress. If we refuse to observe the rules of=
 healthy eating and
resting our life force gets depleted quickly. To protec=
t our health it is
important to observe Brahmacharya (sexual continence). T=
he body becomes ill
because of misuse of the 5 senses and mind becomes dise=
ases because of
unwholesome thinking. Mental promiscuousness is even more d=
eadly than bodily
illnesses. Hence always urge your psyche to think positiv=
ely and in a sacred
manner. Along with the body and mind one should have im=
mense self control
regarding ones wealth too. If we succeed in desirably co=
ntrolling our body,
mind and wealth we will become strong, great thinkers a=
nd prosperous both
materially and spiritually.
6) UNITY: Success in any for=
m is totally dependent on our mental equipoise
and balance. A mental state =
wherein man remains calm and serene under all
circumstances is most require=
d today. Never despair when dire situations
glare at us and instead always =
think positively. Such a mind is extremely
well balanced and healthy. With =
due diligence and practice anyone can
develop this inner state of serenity.=
 All the great tasks executed in world
history and all great leaders and th=
inkers of the world definitely possessed
such a focused and sacred psyche. =
By taking recourse to it one can march
ahead in any chosen field of life wi=
th honor.
7) WORLD AS ONE FAMILY: The chain that binds an individual to soc=
iety is the
institution called a family. Society is nothing but a congregat=
ion of many
small units called families. No doubt efforts are required to i=
nduce
progress in every family and make every member cultured and great in
=
character. despite this one should not limit progress to this tiny unit and=

instead we must widen our mental horizon so as to encompass the entire wor=
ld
as our family. The Vedas say =91UDAAR CHARITAANAAM TU VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBA=
KAM=92
meaning one imbued with great character looks upon the entire world =
as
his/her family. Thus our sentiments towards our family should wax like t=
he
moon in such a way that the entire world becomes our beloved family. We =
must
use our bodily and mental potential for the advancement of the entire =
world.
Such cog in the wheel like contributions to the world will definitel=
y herald
a heavenly atmosphere on earth on an eternal basis.
8) SOCIALISM: =
Man obtains wealth and comforts from society so as to lead a
prosperous lif=
e. Hence it now becomes his duty to contribute humbly to
society=92s progre=
ss and peace. It is ethical duty to look after society=92s
well being and i=
s as important as his duty towards his family and relatives.
Society can be=
 well managed and made prosperous only if every world denizen
observes his =
duty towards his family and the entire society in an ethical
and honest man=
ner. We must behave with others exactly in the way we desire
other to behav=
e with us (if we do not like abuses from others stop abusing
others your se=
lf). Only on the basis of this test that principles of ethics
and social du=
ties will proliferate infinitely. Further it is as important to
weed out ta=
inted traditions, criminal leanings and blind beliefs from their
roots when=
 compared to imbibing ethical living. World society will attain
glory and g=
randeur only when every individual imbibes discipline, wholesome
behavior, =
sense of world brotherhood and sacred duty to society on a day to
day basis=
.
9) SACREDNESS AND PURITY: Sacredness is a shining ornament of man=92s
cha=
racter. Brilliance in various fields (art, music, industry, media etc)
can =
be given due respect only when it encompasses humility gentlemanliness
whil=
e dealing with others. It also means giving due respect to those who
deserv=
e it and never falling into the trap of vanity and arrogance.
Maintaining d=
ecorum as far as ones mode of dressing, body and other
accessories used to =
falls under its jurisdiction. Shabby or very gaudy
clothes and ill kept obj=
ects give a very bad impression to others. Hence opt
for a simple dressing =
style which adds to your inner aura. Our first
impressions of other people =
commence with their general appearance and their
way of dressing. Moreover =
if the objects used by us are well maintained
(watch, cell phone, car etc) =
it shows that our minds too are focused and
disciplined. Our external life =
should be well managed and inner life full of
gentlemanliness. This is the =
goal of good behavior.
10) PUNCTUALITY: The substratum of all types of whol=
esome success in life is
proper time management and balanced hard work. The=
 path of progress is laid
down when we regularly execute our daily routine =
and work hard optimally.
Every action, be it minute or great in importance =
should be dealt with in an
equally focused manner and thus success will kno=
ck on your door without
fail. Every action done with due concentration show=
s the diligence of its
doer. Wasting precious time is equivalent to wasting=
 our precious human
life. Those who truly understand the true importance of=
 a human life make
optimum use of time in their hands. Apart from family re=
sponsibilities time
and ones efforts should definitely be utilized for cont=
ributing to social
welfare.
11) INTEGRITY: Man is said to be ethical when h=
e is transparent and honest
as far as wealth generation and its expenditure=
 is concerned and that he
responsibly enacts all his duties. In material li=
fe only those prosper who
are full of integrity and responsibility. Profess=
ionally too only they
succeed who are ethical and full of transparency in a=
ll their transactions.
They respect accountability and commitment in their =
various professions.
There is a demand for candidates who responsibly and w=
ith commitment execute
jobs assigned to them. Even society honors and rever=
es them. In turn society
always stands by their side in a cooperative manne=
r. Not only should our
wealth creation be ethical but that a part of it mus=
t be used for social
welfare. One must keep ones expenses minimum and whate=
ver remains must be
used for world well being. Such pious sentiments of wor=
ld welfare zooms
mankind to the peaks of human glory.
12) SENSE OF RIGHT AN=
D WRONG: It is an enlightened discriminative intellect
that can tell us wha=
t is right and what is not. There prevail today
innumerable blind beliefs, =
lack luster traditions and blind practices which
when tested prove to be to=
tally useless. And yet because they have prevailed
over a very long time sp=
an it is difficult for people to give them up. Hence
it is only the light o=
f discrimination that can give man the necessary
strength to renounce them =
in totality. It helps man overcome narrow minded
thinking and instead works=
 selflessly for world peace and prosperity. Many
blind beliefs like death f=
easts, animal sacrifice, dowry system, ghost
mediums, sorcery, astrology fo=
r material pursuits, leaving everything to
fate etc have made our society w=
eak and demeaned. And yet because vested
interests label them as =91ancient=
 traditions=92 no one has the valor to give
them up. Thus the only way to u=
proot them is generating necessary daring for
this via an enlightened discr=
imination.
13) ATTAINING THE SPIRITUAL GOAL: Spiritual goals are attained w=
hen we use
our time, effort, wealth, skills and capabilities for rooting ou=
t sorrow and
downfall of society. The more one contributes their potential =
for this cause
the more one will progress on the path of spirituality. The =
goal of
devotion, meditation and penance is to manifest this spiritual view=
point in
our psyche/soul. When a compassionate heart helps those in need it=

experiences untold divine bliss which is not equivalent to even all materi=
al
joy of the world put together.
14) RADIANT SKILLS: When there is a lack =
of radiant skills other qualities
of ones psyche lose their utility sheen a=
nd importance too. Man can swim in
the infinite ocean of glory only if he d=
eeply imbibes gentlemanliness,
humility, generosity, sense of service (Seva=
 Bhava) and fearlessness. A weak
minded individual may be a gentleman and y=
et he never has the daring to
oppose undesirable trends in society. It is b=
ecause of this that he fails to
help benefit the world at large with his ge=
nerous and wholesome character.
Even minor hiccups in life make him tensed =
and thus out of fear bows down to
unruly and illegal elements. Thus simply =
because he lacks daring all his
other wholesome qualities become pale and u=
seless. A point to note is that
at any given point in time the number of di=
ctators, autocrats and criminals
has been in the minority and yet because t=
hey are fearless (in a demonic
way) they achieve their unethical goals. Hen=
ce it is most required that
along with other sacred qualities a spiritual s=
eeker must develop wholesome
enterprise, daring and valor.

The above 14 pr=
ecepts if imbibed by every layman will definitely reap
dividends of greatne=
ss of character and they are accepted by all religions
the world over. We c=
an say that they are universal, meant for every world
individual and is sui=
table for all times. Despite the disparity of time,
place and individual pe=
rsonalities everyone can follow the above 14 precepts
for material and spir=
itual prosperity (barring those very few exceptions of
a rare kind).
