Namaste Narasimha,


>Sahasrara chakra represents Brahman. Here there is no=
 ego principle >(I-ness or ahamkara) and no objectification..........

I am=
 thankful for this perticular message. you may ignore my previous question.=
 i am writing down my understandings as under.

1. Mulaadhaar Chakra - Eart=
h element, Swaadhishthaan - Water, Manipur - Fire, Anaahat - Air, Vishudhdh=
i - Ether, Agna - Super Ether (Cosmic space & time) and Sahasraar - Brahman=
 (Non Dual, undifferentiated Brahman). Chakras have peculiar characteristic=
s associated which regulates some qualities/emotions. some are binding and =
some are liberating to next chakra.

2. In between each chakra, there are s=
ome more chakras which may represents mysterious principle of evolvement fr=
om one element to the other. Like There are chakras between Sahsraar and Ag=
na which hold the mystry which can explain how Undifferentiated brahman pro=
jected Cosmic space and time stage by stage. Same way, Chakraas between say=
 Swaadhishthaan and Mulaadhaar hold the principle and explain evolution of =
Earth element from water element and so on and so forth.

3. Kundalini rise=
 experience does not depend upon which chakra one is mediatating (actually =
it does not require that one should meditate on those imaginery chakras). w=
hatever chakra one is meditating on, the order of kundalini travel will alw=
ays be from Muladhaar to Sahsraar.
Kundalini rise is relevent only to the *=
concentration of mind*. focus of mind on ANY one perticular object/thought/=
action.

4. Self awarness (Popularly known as Kundalini Shakti) reaching Sa=
hasraar ONCE means the soul is practically free from all the bondages. The =
soul may need to then only wait for the present body to drop away. The soul=
 may merge in to Brahman or may remain one step below participate in nature=
s play for helping other souls.

5. All these mapping of Brahman, Cosmic sp=
ace, Ehter, Air, Fire, water, Earth to the imaginery chakraas in body is th=
ough wonderful to know, does not help a person to actaully experience anyth=
ing higher. 

That is it. as you know i am not much intrested in technicali=
ties but it is good if that is also properly understood in a simpler way. w=
hy i say simpler way because different authors have used different terminol=
ogies to discribe the same framework (As nitish has written) but that has c=
reated bias and resultant debates, misunderstandings and confusions.

final=
ly as you mentioned, after all his superhuman knowledge, Shankara gives the=
 message of "Bhaj Govindam.....nahi nahi rakshati Dukrung Karane" !!! let's=
 engage in Homam/Japa/Dhyaan/Bhajan/Service/vichaara/... - one/more/all of =
them and findout ourselves if that is the desire.

Best Regards,

Utpal
