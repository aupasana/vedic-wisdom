 19th August, 1946

=93When I was in Virupaksha Cave, Sundaresa Iyer used t=
o go out into the town
for bhiksha and bring us food. At times, there used =
to be no curry or
chutney. People to eat were many while the food obtained =
was limited. What
were we to do? I used to mix it into a paste and pour hot=
 water over it to
make it like gruel, and then give a glassful to each,and =
take one myself.
Sometimes we all used to feel that it would be better if w=
e had at least
some salt to mix with it.

But where was the money to buy sa=
lt? We should have had to ask someone for
it. If once we begin to ask for s=
alt, we would feel like asking for dhal,
and when we ask for dhal, we would=
 feel like asking for payasam and so on.
So we felt that we should not ask =
for anything, and swallowed the gruel as
it was. We used to feel extremely =
happy over such diet. As the food was
satvic, without spices of any kind, a=
nd there was not even salt in it, not
only was it healthy for this body, bu=
t there was also great peace for the
mind.=94

=93Is salt also one of those=
 things that stimulates rajas,(passion)?=94 I asked.
=93Yes. What doubt is =
there? Is it not said so in one of the granthas (books)?
Wait, I will look =
it up and tell you,=94 said Bhagavan. =93Isn=92t it enough if
Bhagavan says=
 so? Why a grantha?=94 I said.

Not only do we not give up salt, but we alw=
ays feel that chillies also are
necessary for taste. That is how we have ou=
r rules and regulations about our
eating habits. Great souls eat to live an=
d serve the world, while we live to
eat. That is the difference. If we eat =
to live, there is no need to think of
taste. If we live to eat, the tastes =
are limitless. And for this purpose, we
undergo ever so many trials and tri=
bulations.
