Dear Sri G Balasubramanian Ji,
=A0
I appreciate your efforts of posting =
these material, but i'm not able to understand the motive or the reason beh=
ind these postings. Is it your concern that today there are no Brahmins who=
 live up to these stringent rules?
=A0
Also, what is in your opinion about =
who is a Brahmin? is it someone who took Birth in a caste called "Brahmins"=
 and is your concern is about them? 
=A0
I see some points to be good and s=
ome are non sense..i know that these are not the lines written buy you but =
still..and also some of practises were dispelled long back from the society=
 consdiering them as social evils ..so are you trying to re-establish them =
? (say for example: "If a=A0 Brahmana disassociates himself from=A0 lower c=
aste people and associates only with higher caste people, he attains greatn=
ess.") 
=A0
No offense meant.
=A0
Thanks
KK
