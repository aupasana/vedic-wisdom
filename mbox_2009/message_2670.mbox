Rajarshi,

With all due respect, I disagree.

There is no question that is =
useless and there is no answer that is not relavent. The reason we are not =
able to perceive God is not that God is not there, but, given our current w=
ay of thinking, he can not be perceived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm=
 your mind and infact, make your current knowledge influence irrelavent whi=
ch allows you to percieve thing you can not otherwise.

There are 4 known m=
argas for self realisation. My understanding of any of these limited.
1. Bh=
akthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought =
pertaining to God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in=
 completely to the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so=
, you are coming out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentio=
ns of this material world.

2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures =
and concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw your self away fro=
m the regular senses.

3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you can do it, you a=
re not even thinking about God, but, have got him.

4. jnana - By questioni=
ng available information, using logic and try to break out of current assum=
ptions and try to discover. Saying, this will not yield results is not a wi=
se thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficult. But, with so many =
others who are experiancing God, not sure, why the wrong in current axioms =
can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who are realised, do not perhaps=
 think it is relavent.

There is a soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can i=
t be seen? If not with naked eyes, to see it materialistically, what is nee=
ded?

We can see the difference between a body with prana and with out pran=
a. Can't we? Then, why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see prana/=
atma sceintifically? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a pat=
h, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse that path.
Be=
st regards,
Vijay
