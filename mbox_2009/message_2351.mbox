Dear Rao,
Thanks for providing this info. In fact, I was expecting criticism/brickbats from some learned members of this group who do not trust  the wisdom of our ancestors  and in whose household such practices have been thrown to the winds. There are many people who pooh-pooh such practices. They consider it as practice of untouchability at home which is not punishable under Indian laws. I am aware that there are some members who are waiting to pounce on me on my postings.Thanks again.
G.Balasubramanian

Subject: Rishipanchami/menstruation in ladies.

 Please refer to Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha's book on "Sanatana Dharma" published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan wherein he provides details of the research conducted in the United States on several women in Menses.
He states that The blood of the woman in menses generally contains a poisonous substances known as "menotoxin" and it harms any one going near her within a distance of 8 feet.   Surprisingly this distance is mentioned in the grihya sootras!!!!
He also provides of several other researches to prove many other Indian beliefs- like rules of chewing betel leaves, sleeping with head not towards north, fasting during eclipses etc. etc.
