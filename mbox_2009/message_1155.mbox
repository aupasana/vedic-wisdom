Namaste Narasimhaji,


=

I recently started doing tarpana using your manual.I have couple of querie=
s



1. In tarpana why is specific importance given to Sesame?



2. As I k=
now it one cannot do puja for some days when somebody in the family has exp=
ired. Similarly can one do Japa during that period? 



3. I collect water =
used during tarpana in a vessel. Now can that water be taken inside the hou=
se. The reason I am asking this is because I throw that water on plants and=
 for that I have to go through rooms in the house as the plants are kept el=
sewhere.



4.Restrictions are mentioned in the documents for certain days,=
 what happens if we could not follow that by mistake?



5. In one Gita pre=
ss book it is mentioned that those desiring servants, children and female s=
hould not do tarpan. I see that you did not mention this.

Is this really a=
pplicable ?



Thank you for the manuals !!



Thank you,

Manish
