Sri Narasimha Garu,

I think this is one of the most beautiful e-m=

=C2=A0
Ple=
ase comment on my thoughts /questions as below:
=C2=A0
Ultimately we may re=
alize that it is all the grace, but how do we ensure that we get to that st=
ate? 
=C2=A0
I believe that the grace of a sadguru / deity can definitely c=
hange the equation to reach to that state. But, from most of my readings I =
get a feeling that unless you are at a particular spiritual level to receiv=
e the guidance you will not receive it. 
=C2=A0
If someone is so deep with =
his bad karmas, he may not be in a position to think about god at all in th=
is life. Will he never get any help at this lowest level so that he can mak=
e progress in the path? =C2=A0
=C2=A0
Is the free-will (to pray the god) is=
 the only way that he can get to that level to receive some help? But with =

Namaste,

I am replying to the vedic-wisdom ya=
hoogroup without revealing your identity, as this may be relevant/useful to=
 some other people. I hope you won't mind.

* * *

Background for others:

=
This gentleman had a telephone conversation with me a few days back. He is =
an advaitin. He was doing some rituals earlier. He happened to read "I Am T=
hat" book by Nisargadatta Maharaj, an adwaiti and a liberated master. In th=
e weeks after reading that book, he had a series of mystical experiences th=
at revealed one idea after another to him. Based on his experiences, he tol=
d me that all that we perceive is an illusion and even knowledge and ignora=
nce are illusions. Is there a need to perform rituals and why? This whole t=
hing is like a dream and why do we need to do specific things in what we kn=
ow to be a dream?

I mostly listened to what he was saying without saying a=
nything, but said a few things at the end. He said that he sees everything =
for what it is during an experience, but back to normal at the end of it, e=
.g. worried about a sore throat and stuff like that.

I told him that that =
state of not having fear or likes or dislikes has to be permanent and not a=
 fleeting experience. I told him it is good to say duality is an illusion, =
but one needs to deal with it when one is immersed in that illusion most of=
 the time. A fleeting experience of reality and immersion in the illusion a=
gain is not liberation. One needs to strive for a state when one is in that=
 state all the time. To reach that state, it is necessary to pay back one's=
 karmik debts in the field of duality.

I told him that rituals like homam =
can be performed without an individual sankalpa, but just for the pleasure =
of the deity. Thus, one ends up giving something to the universe without co=
nsidering whether and what one gets in return. That is conducive to freedom=
.

He pondered on my words for a few days and replied. I will continue the =
discussion below with him on the list now.

* * *

Your question is a very =
important one and addressed by many scriptures such as Upanishads, Yoga Vaa=
sishtham, Bhagavad Gita etc.

Vasishtha taught in Yoga Vaasishtham that kno=
wledge (understanding) and action are the two wings with which the bird of =
soul flies. It is not possible for one wing to reach the correct speed at o=
nce. As the wings are flapped, one wing will take off, the other will take =
off accordingly, the first wing gains more speed and so on. Eventually, whe=
n there is balance between the two wings, bird flies off.

Perfect understa=
nding and perfect actions do not come by themselves suddenly. Actions and u=
nderstanding work together, balance each other and improve each other.

One=
 can start off with some understanding and engage in actions that imbibe th=
at understanding. As one engages in more and more actions that are aligned =
with one's dharma, one's understanding becomes better and better. As one's =
understanding becomes better and better, it enables actions that are more a=
nd more aligned with one's dharma. Better understanding results in better a=
ctions and better actions result in better understanding. You cannot separa=
te knowledge from actions. As I said, Vasishtha was very clear that knowled=
ge and actions are two wings. Some modern adwaitins erroneously argue: "You=
 are That. There is nothing to do. Even the notion that you are bound and y=
ou need to do something to become free is an illusion. You ARE That and you=
 ARE free already." They de-emphasize action. But Vasishtha was clear. As I=
 showed in the other mail today, Sri Krishna also taught in Bhagavad Gita t=
hat some actions aimed at paying off one's karmik debts are quite
 necessar=
y and should never be given up as long one is embodied.

If you experience =
fear or anxiety or like or dislike or pain or other such things in the fiel=
d of duality at any time, you are not really thinking like "That". The mean=
ing of being That is to be beyond such notions at *all* tismes.

* * *

Let=
 me give very simple and yet apt analogy.

If one is in a dream, there is n=
o point in coming in the dream and telling one "this is just a dream. This =
is not your natural state. Wake up". Merely asserting that to one in a drea=
m will not wake one up from the dream! One will continue to be in the dream=
. Even if one thinks "this dream is not my real state. I am actually awake.=
 What I perceive is wakefulness" , it will still be *in the dream*. One is =
merely awake *in the dream* and not really awake.

In order to really wake =
up from the dream, some things need to happen in the dream. One can try to =
do some things in the dream that are likely to end the dream and wake one u=
p. Thus, the notion that it is not real and merely a dream and hence there =
is no need to do anything is incorrect. Instead of doing stupid things and =
prolonging a dream, one can do the right things and wake up soon.

Thus, en=
gage in the right actions in the dream (that life in the field of duality i=
s), to wake up to the reality (experience of Absolute at all times)!

* * *=


As I mentioned in the other mail, constantly self-examine and contemplate=
. Remove all thoughts of self-gratification, pride and expectation from oth=
ers from the mind. Catch such thoughts at the root and cut them off. Focus =
your energy on engaging in actions that *give* things to others and the uni=
verse, without any considerations of self-gratification and with complete o=
blivion to what you receive in return. Keep doing selfless actions without =
any expectations. Eventually, your understanding will become perfect and yo=
ur actions will also become perfect. You will be free then.

* * *

Bottoml=
ine: Both understanding and actions are needed. Actions accompanied by corr=
ect understanding are the key. As actions become more perfect and detached,=
 understanding becomes more perfect. As understanding becomes more perfect,=
 actions become more perfect and detached. At the end, when actions and und=
erstanding become perfect, one becomes free. One then realizes that it was =
all actually grace.

Best regards,
Narasimha
