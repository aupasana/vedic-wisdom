Dear Narasimhaji, 

Namaskaram. Thank you for your quick reply to my query. I am encouraged to ask more of the questions troubling me from time to time. Please bear with me.

While reading Devi Bhagavatham I came across a passage which states that since Gayatri is AgniMukhi, one should not recite the holy Gayatri mantram while immersed in water. However I have come across the sayings of Bhagavan Sathya Sai Baba wherein he mentions the time of bathing as most suited for chanting the holy Gayatri mantram. Can both suggestions be true at the same time?

Regards
Hari
