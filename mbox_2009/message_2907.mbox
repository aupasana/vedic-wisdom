Namaste,
 
This reply is too late for this year, but I will reply anyway.
 
Dhana Trayodasi (2 days before Deepaavali) is the day for Yama Deepa. Also, 2 days after Deepaavali (i.e. Karthika Sukla Dwitiya - today) is known as Yama Dwitiya and this is a day to visit sisters.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
