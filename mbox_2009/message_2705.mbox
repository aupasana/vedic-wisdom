Dear Narasimha,
  "Reposting..."

  3 Gunas, by inherent d=
uality in nature, give rise to the 6 tattwas, that is as simple. Now, the s=
piritual law of duality is very well described by the two birds analogy, as=
 well as the 3 gunas are very well mentioned in the upanishads. Isn't it ?
=

> From visuddhi chakra to moolaadhaara chakra lie the elements of

 air, fire, water and earth as I mentioned. I only focused on > the last fi=
ve stages.

What do you mean by last 5 stages ? Where is the beginning and =
the end of the sushumna passing through 6 cerebro-spinal chakras ?

In the =
physical body, it appears as a linear movement from the lowest mooladhara t=
o the highest ajna chakra - but the nadis' emanating from these "Shad-chakr=
as" - meet in a circular manner inside the Sahasrara Chakra (See the diagra=
m of Astral Nadis' prepared by YogiRaj ShyamaCharan Lahiri, published in Gi=
ta Commentary by Yogananda).

Thus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lo=
west Mooladhara and the awakening of one of them affects the other, a fact =
rather well-documented in Yoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ga=
nesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipped first.

> In Sahasrara chakra lies=
 undifferentiated consciousness (Brahman or >Aatman), where there are no I-=
ness or any objectification. Just >below it, there are several lokas that p=
eople do not mention
> normally.

With every invocation of Gayatri Mantra, =
we mention 3 or 7 of these lokas. Don't we do it "Normally" ?

In any case,=
 we are not discussing about the actual experiences or undifferentiated con=
sciousness, the 6 tattwas that cause creation are still very much different=
iated in Nature.

Patanjalis' Chitta Vrittis' correspond to the 5 tattwas a=
nd are all happening on the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tat=
twa. The normal-human- experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement =
of Chitta (finest creation).

How would the Soul become aware of the more m=
aterial Aakash Tattwa (and thus a single coherent self pervading the materi=
al physical body), if it were not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?=


Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-material Chitta, and =
it doesn't imply that 6th tattwa doesn't exist. If you could calm all those=
 modifications of Chitta, you would have your self-realized.

> In Aajnaa c=
hakra lies the primordial state of the universe where

 and time, but no five elements.

Nothing comes out from nothing. How can t=
he lower tattwas evolve from higher tattwas, if even their subtle represent=
ations are purged from existence altogether ?

Greatest of the Seers have a=
lready put down the scriptures in writing, so that people like us can benef=
it.

Regards,
Nitish

of self ("I"), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.

 a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redunda=
nt. Though there is some correspondence between what happens in the causal,=
 subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one=
 mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be re=

!
