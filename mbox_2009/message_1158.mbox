Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar

Thank you for answering all my queries. I really=
 have a nagging problem 
which others may be experiencing at various intens=
ities. 

Without fail, my mind thinks of a very particular highly negative =
thought whenever  I am 
doing Japa.
Often I try to negate it in my mind wit=
h the obvious result that my Japa gets destroyed.
I am paranoid about these=
 bad thought coming true, especially as I am thinking them 
while doing Jap=
a. In my heart I definetly do not want them to materialize. How should I 
p=
roceed? 

Please advise.

Thank you yet again.
