My question is - did you give pasu bali? If yes, WHY??

Thank you,

materials and did a Chandi homam. The place had around 10 dogs. They were b=
arking loud before, but they all came and sat around the homam once fire st=
arted. Surprisingly, the dogs just sat around the fire without any sounds o=

ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness is attached to a new body, the th=
oughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousnes=

mas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very i=
mportant sadhanas for spiritual progress.

the thithi of demise of one's father (to be performed by the eldest son). T=

essary to perform yearly Shraddham subsequently.
