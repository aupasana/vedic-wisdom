Nitish,

I would have loved to read each one of your replies, but unfortuna=
tely work pressures rise, and I am unable to spend the necessary time. But =
let me say some things clearly, I think they may help you. It is probably t=
rue that you have had some significant spiritual experiences, which is why =
you speak with authority. I have no problem with that, and that is why I ac=
tually expect to find some wisdom in your words. But see, the problem with =
spiritual experience is terminology, terminology, terminology. Ordinary sen=
sory experiences are easily communicated - it is easy to say the word "tree=
" and you know exactly what I mean - because trees are available everywhere=
 in common sensory experience. But not so with spiritual experience, they a=
re by definition outside common sensory experience! So if you want to commu=
nicate your ideas (if you dont that's fine too), you will have to invest so=
me significant time in coming to common ground (with others) before ideas g=
et exchanged for the benefit of all. 

I will take your current post as an =
example. I will try to explain my terminology as clearly as possible and yo=
u will then see that there is some common ground between you and everyone e=
lse here: The essential point in all our minds when we talk Ahamkara, ego e=
tc is, in very loose essence, a "centering principle", right? It is that ce=
ntering principle which either is, or leads to, the formation of an individ=
uality, no? At every level of existence, no? 

I think you will agree with =
the above. Now, from my understanding of what you write, when you say Ahamk=
ara is the dominant I sense in the physical cosmos, Manas in astral cosmos =
and Chitta in the causal cosmos, you are simply in essence trying to convey=
 the fact that at difference levels of existence the actual centers are dif=
ferent, which is probably true. It is common experience that for all of us =
in everyday experience, we are not aware of our deeper senses of self (I am=
 not using any loaded terms here, simply the loosely defined term "self"). =
Our senses of self are clearly body centered. 

So what you are trying to d=
o, are at least what I get from your writings, is to call that body centere=
d sense of self Ahamkara, right? Whereas everyone else on this forum is usi=
ng the standard Upanishadic terms wherein Ahamkara is the centering princip=
le! There is only one underlying centering principle, which creates an appa=
rent sense of self in the manas, in the body and everywhere else you mentio=
n. Or do you disagree that at the root, there isnt only one causative cente=
ring principle?

I could do the above for the rest of your writings and pro=
bably reach common ground, but it would take time which as I said I am sudd=
enly at a shortage of. But it would be easier if you tried and understood t=
he terms as everyone uses them here, so the exchange of ideas and understan=
ding would be much quicker and without the conflict..

Regards

Sundeep

es and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is indepen=

 and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as exi=

   Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one =
or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causa=
