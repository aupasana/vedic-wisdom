 Varanasi Subbalakshmi rendered useful service in the Ashrama kitchen durin=
g
the lifetime of Sri Bhagavan. Her chosen God was Lord Viswanath of Benare=
s.
However, when she was going to Benares for good she had a dream in which=

Lord Viswanath told her to return to Arunachala, saying that Bhagavan Rama=
na
was the embodiment of Rama,Krishna, Siva and all other Gods.


I LOST MY=
 HUSBAND when I was sixteen. I went back to my mother's house and
lived the=
re as a widow should, trying to pray to and meditate on God. My
mother's mi=
nd too was devoted to the spiritual quest and religion was the
main thing i=
n her life.

Once we went on a pilgrimage to Kaveri Pushkaram and on our wa=
y back we
stopped at Arunachala.

There we were told that a young Brahmin s=
aint had been living on the hill
for the past ten years.

The next morning =
we went up the hill along with others with whom we were
travelling. At Mula=
ipal Tirtha we cooked our food, ate and had some rest.
Then we went further=
 and found the young Swami near Virupaksha Cave. There
was a brick platform=
 at the entrance of the cave and he was sitting on it.

As soon as I saw hi=
m, I was at once convinced that God Arunachala Himself
had come in human fo=
rm to give salvation to all who approached Him.

He was about thirty at the=
 time, and wonderful to look at; he was bright and
shining like burnished g=
old, his eyes were blooming and clear, like the
petals of a lotus. He looke=
d at us for a long time.

The peak of Arunachala was towering over our head=
s, the huge towers of the
temple were below and an immense silence surround=
ed the Swami.

Then the ladies started whispering. One wanted to pray for a=
 child for her
daughter-in-law who was barren, but another was saying that =
the Swami was
too exalted for such worldly matters. Finally the Swami was t=
old of the
young wife's sorrow. He smiled and lifted his folded hands to th=
e sky as if
saying : "All happens by the will of the Almighty."

We returne=
d to Nellore and the impression of that visit faded away. I did
not even dr=
eam at that time that my life would be spent at the feet of the
Swami.

Whe=
n I was thirty-one I went to Rameshwaram on a pilgrimage and on my return
j=
ourney I stopped at Tiruvannamalai. I learned that the Swami was then
livin=
g at the foot of the hill. That afternoon we went to see him at his
Ashrama=
. There was a thatched shed over his mother's samadhi and a tiled
hall for =
meeting the Swami. He was seated on a couch and about a dozen
devotees were=
 on the bare floor. We sat in silence for ten minutes and
returned to the t=
own.

Bhagavan's presence gave me the experience of inner silence and menta=
l
stillness, but away from him I could not regain it and I spent a year vai=
nly
trying to free myself from all thought. Some friends were going to see =
Sri
Aurobindo's Ashrama at Pondicherry and they took me along. They were to=
 stay
there for a week. I was not much impressed and went for a short visit=
 to
Ramanasramam.

A learned Shastri whom I knew appeared in my dream and a=
sked me: "Where was
the need for you to go to Pondicherry? Entrust yourself=
 to Bhagavan Sri
Ramana Maharshi. He is God Himself. He will surely lead yo=
u to salvation."

But even such a clear dream was not enough. I cherished a=
 plan of going to
Benares and spending my life there in holy austerities. I=
 decided to go to
Bhagavan, learn from him how to meditate, and then leave =
for Benares for
good. My friend Parvatamma decided to join me in the spirit=
ual adventure.
Accordingly we went to Tiruvannamalai and rented a house. In=
 the afternoon
we took cashew nuts and sugar candy as an offering to Bhagav=
an and went to
the Ashrama. We placed our offerings on a stool before him a=
nd sat down. The
cow Lakshmi happened to be lying near Bhagavan's sofa. She=
 got up and began
to chew our precious offerings. Bhagavan looked on and sa=
id nothing. His
attendant, Madhava Swami, did not even look. We thought it =
might be impious
to disturb the cow, but soon I got exasperated and exclaim=
ed, "Please remove
the cow !" Madhava Swami replied: "Why? I thought you of=
fered those sweets
to Lakshmi !"

What is Atma?

The next day at noon I was=
 again at Ramanasramam. His midday meal over,
Bhagavan was reclining on the=
 sofa and explaining a verse from the Bhagavad
Gita to Sri Ramiah Yogi. As =
no one else was in the hall, I gathered courage
and asked: "What is Atma?

=
Is it the limitless ether of space or the awareness that cognizes
everythin=
g?"

Bhagavan replied:

"To remain without thinking 'this is Atma' and 'tha=
t is Atma', is itself
Atma."

He looked at me and I felt my mind melt away =
into nothing. No thought would
come, only the feeling of immense, unutterab=
le peace. My doubts were
cleared.

Every day I would visit Bhagavan and lis=
ten to his talks with the devotees.
Deep in my mind there was the same rock=
-like stillness, immensely solid and
yet strangely vibrant.

Several times =
I was invited to work in the Ashrama, but the Ashrama ways
were not orthodo=
x enough for me. One day Bhagavan's own sister asked me to
take her place i=
n the Ashrama, for she had to leave for some time. I could
not refuse. At t=
hat time Santammal was the chief cook and my duty was to
help her. To my gr=
eat joy Bhagavan was in the kitchen with us most of the
time. He taught me =
to cook tastily and neatly.

I would spend all day in the Ashrama and in th=
e evening I would go to the
town to sleep, for there was no sleeping accomm=
odation for women in the
Ashrama.

Once Bhagavan said:

"You widows do not =
eat vegetables like drumsticks and radish. Diet
restrictions are good to st=
rengthen the will.

Besides, the quality of food and the manner of eating h=
ave an influence on
the mind."

I was very happy to work in the kitchen dir=
ectly under Bhagavan's
supervision; yet I wanted to go home. The Ashrama wa=
ys were too unorthodox
for me. And there was too much work. I did not want =
to work all day long. I
wanted to sit quietly and meditate in solitude.

I =
Leave the Ashram

So I left again for my village and I went away for about =
a year. I divided
my time between idleness and meditation. Yet my heart was=
 at the Ashrama. I
would tell myself: "Where is the need of running about. =
Is not Bhagavan here
and everywhere?" But my heart was calling me to Bhagav=
an. Even when I was
pleading with myself, that in the Ashrama there would b=
e no time for
meditation, my heart would say: "Working in the kitchen by hi=
s side is far
better than meditation." At home I had all the leisure I want=
ed, but it
seemed to me that I was wasting my time.

Later I learned that t=
hat was the time Bhagavan used to remember me very
often. Once they were pr=
eparing pongal (pulse with rice and black pepper) to
celebrate Bhagavan's m=
onthly birth-star (Punarvasu) and Bhagavan told
Santammal:

"Subbalakshmi i=
s far away yet she worries whether pongal is cooked here
today or not."

On=
 some other festival day Bhagavan announced:

"Subbalakshmi will turn up; k=
eep some pongal for her."

That very day I arrived at the Ashrama.

His gre=
at love for me, a worthless devotee, bound me firmly to his feet.
Again and=
 again I wanted to leave the Ashrama, but he held me for my good,
more powe=
rfully than I held on to him.

Whenever I was collecting courage to tell Bh=
agavan about my desire to leave,
he would seem to read my thoughts and fore=
stall me by giving me something
special to do. I felt I had too much to do =
and that my life was being
wasted. One day Bhagavan was looking at me inten=
tly and said:

"It looks as if you are still hankering after meditation."

=
I replied: "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan
s=
aid with deep feeling:

"Your hands may do the work but your mind can remai=
n still.

You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that=
 work is
not a strain.

But as long as you think that you are the body and =
that the work is done by
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.=


In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.

Even if your body keep=
s quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?

Even in sleep the mind is busy wit=
h its dreams."

I replied: "Yes, Swami, it is as natural for you to know th=
at you are not
your body as it is for us to think that we are the body. I h=
ad a dream
recently in which you were explaining this very point. I was dre=
aming that I
was working in the kitchen and you were having your bath in yo=
ur usual place
behind the bamboo mat partition.

You asked:

'Who is it?'

=
I replied: 'Who shall I say I am?'

You said:

'Exactly so, you are nothing=
 of which something can be said.'

Now, just remember that was my dream and=
 it was quite clear. Why can't I
remember always that I am not the body?"

=
"Because you haven't had enough of it," he smiled.


Do Not Torture The Bod=
y

I used to fast quite often, as advised in some scriptural texts. In one =
of
the books, I read: "He who wants to know himself and yet pays attention =
to
his body is like a man who trusts a crocodile to take him across a river=
."

I showed the text to Bhagavan and he explained:

"It does not mean that=
 you should starve.

You need not torture the body.

It only means not givi=
ng the body more than it needs.

With your mind, hold on to enquiry and jus=
t keep the body going so that it
does not become a hindrance.For this, pure=
 and fresh food,simply prepared
and taken in moderation,is a great help."

=
Another day I asked Bhagavan's permission to put on the sannyasin's orange
=
robes and beg for my food. He said:

"Will coloured clothes give you renunc=
iation?

First learn what sannyasa means."

Once five or six devotees sat d=
own before Bhagavan and sang a hymn in praise
of the Guru. He got up in the=
 middle of the recitation and went away,
saying:

"Prayers and praises will=
 not take one far.

It is the merciful look of the teacher that bestows tru=
e knowledge."

I felt elated. Had I not received his merciful glances? But =
the next day he
was saying:

"Unless one becomes a six month old baby there=
 is no hope for him in the
realm of self-knowledge."

My heart sank. Althou=
gh I lived in the presence of Lord Arunachala Himself,
I was far from becom=
ing an infant.

Why Should You Doubt?

Another time Bhagavan was telling us=
 stories from the lives of devotees of
bygone ages. I questioned him: "It i=
s written that God appeared before the
devotee and shed His grace on him wh=
ile he was still in his mother's womb.
Can it be true?"

To that Bhagavan r=
eplied:

"Why should you doubt? Will doubt profit you?

Only your devotion =
will suffer.

Those stories are as real as your telling me that you are pre=
sent here and
now."

Bhagavan was one day reading and explaining Tirupugazh=
 in Tamil to
Alamelammal of Madura.

I did not know Tamil and I could only =
look on. I saw a change in Bhagavan. A
light was shining from within him. H=
is face was radiant, his smile was
beaming, his eyes were full of compassio=
n. His words reverberated in the
mind and were instantly and deeply underst=
ood.

All my being was carried upwards on a current of strange vibrations. =
The
memory of this experience is ever present in my heart.

A great joy has=
 remained with me that I was privileged to sit at the feet of
the Divine Be=
ing.

It was ever like this with him.

Whoever went to him, he would go dow=
n to his level; his words and gestures,
even the intonation of his voice, w=
ould adapt themselves to the make-up of
the people around him. With childre=
n he was their playmate, to family people
- a wise counsellor, to pundits -=
 a well of knowledge, to yogis - the God of
will, the God of victory. He sa=
w himself in them and they saw themselves in
him and their hearts would be =
bound to his feet in everlasting love.

All who came to see him would be ch=
armed by his love and kindness, beauty
and wisdom, and the overwhelming sen=
se of unity he radiated like fire
radiating heat.

To some he would grant a=
 special vision, invisible to others; with some he
would openly discourse.
=

Crowds would gather round him and each one would see him differently. Even=

his pictures differ. A stranger would not guess that they are all of the
s=
ame person.

Grant Me Salvation, Swami

One afternoon a lady from Kumbhakon=
am sat near Bhagavan and exclaimed: "How
glad I am that I have met you, Swa=
mi. I have craved to see you for a long
time, Swami. Not that I want anythi=
ng, Swami. Only please be kind and grant
me salvation, Swami." With that sh=
e got up and went away.

Bhagavan had a hearty laugh.

"Look at her - all s=
he wants is salvation.

Give her salvation, she wants nothing else."

I sai=
d: "Is it not what we all want?"

He replied:

"Is salvation something to b=
e handed over on request?

Do I keep bundles of salvation concealed about m=
e, that people should ask me
for salvation?

She said 'I do not want anythi=
ng.'

If it is sincere, that itself is salvation.

What is there I can give=
 and what is there they can take?"

Somebody brought a bell to be rung at t=
he arati ceremony and it was put into
Bhagavan's hands. He tried its sound =
in various ways and laughed:

"God wants us to make a fire of our past evil=
 deeds and burn our karma in
it.

But these people burn a copper worth of c=
amphor and hope to please the
Almighty.

Do they really believe that they c=
an get something for nothing?

They do not want to bend to God,they want Go=
d to bend to them.In their greed
they would swallow God,but they would not =
let him swallow them.

Some boast of their offerings.

What have they got t=
o offer ?

The idol of Vinayaka (Ganesha) is made of jaggery.

They break o=
ff a piece of it and offer it to Him.

The only offering worthy of the Lord=
 Is to clear the mind of thoughts and
remain steady in the peace of Self."
=

In the early days, when I joined the Ashrama, Bhagavan used to help in
gri=
nding lentils, peeling vegetables and even lending a hand in cooking. He
wo=
uld get up long before daybreak to join the kitchen staff at their work.
We=
 ladies would arrive by sunrise, and Bhagavan would see that all was ready
=
for our arrival and we would often find a part of our work already done.

T=
o forestall him we would come by five; he would come at four; we would come=

then at three. When he saw that we were left without sleep, he stopped
ent=
ering the kitchen before sunrise and gave us time to sleep.

He was the ver=
y embodiment of wisdom and kindness, though he did not mind
our faults and =
mistakes,

He made us follow his instructions to the letter.

We had to do =
the same task again and again until it was done to his complete
satisfactio=
n. Did he do it for himself? Of what use was it to him?

He wanted to prove=
 to us that we could do things right,

that only lack of patience and atten=
tion causes all the mess.

He sometimes seemed too severe, even harsh, to m=
ake us do something
correctly, for he knew what we did not know that we can=
 act correctly if we
only try.

With experience came confidence, and with c=
onfidence the great peace of
righteousness.

In daily life he avoided all d=
istinction. At work and at food he was one of
us. But in the hall, seated o=
n the sofa, he was the great Lord of Kailas,
the Holy Mountain.

Whenever B=
hagavan would enter or leave the hall, we would all get up
respectfully. On=
e could see that he did not like so many people being
disturbed because of =
him.

He wanted us to learn well the lesson that God is present in every be=
ing in
all his glory and fullness and must be given equal reverence. He was=

tireless in hammering this lesson into our minds and hearts, and he would
=
ruthlessly sacrifice the little comforts we so loved to provide for him, as=

soon as he noticed a trace of preference.

The law that what cannot be sha=
red must not be touched was supreme in his
way of dealing with us.

Separat=
ive and exclusive feelings are the cause of the "I" and therefore the
great=
est obstacles in the realization of the One. No wonder he was
exterminating=
 them so relentlessly.

Once Bhagavan had jaundice. He had to be put on a f=
ruit diet, but he would
not eat fruit unless all ate, and in equal quantiti=
es too! Where could we
get such a lot of fruit? Yet he was adamant and woul=
d leave his share
untouched unless he saw an equal share on everybody's lea=
f-plate.

Those who say that a sick man needs special food and must not giv=
e trouble,
miss the point. Bhagavan was not sick. His body had jaundice, th=
at was all. He
wanted to impress on our minds that under no condition must =
a man have a
greater share. Our learning this lesson was more important to =
him than the
cure of his jaundice.

To serve him at mealtimes was by itself=
 a dangerous adventure.

Our womanly desire was to fill him to the brim. Hi=
s rule was to clear the
plate no matter what or how much was served. Not a =
speck of food would be
left uneaten.

So we had to be watchful and serve mu=
ch less than what we would like to. It
was not easy and we would often fail=
. He would scold us bitterly, or, what
was infinitely worse, would fall ill=
 and suffer.

I cannot understand how he managed to produce an illness when=
 a lesson was
needed, but our life with him was crisis after crisis.

He wo=
uld take any amount of trouble to teach us the virtues necessary for
self-d=
iscovery. Our life in the Ashrama was a school of yoga, and a hard
school t=
oo. For book-knowledge was as nothing to him; only character and
genuine sp=
iritual experience counted.

With time he ceased working in the kitchen, bu=
t we could still find him in
the dining hall. When all would leave after fo=
od, he would linger on his
seat and we would collect around him and chat an=
d listen to his precious
words. He would teach us and guide us and we would=
 forget the years that
passed and be again the happy crowd of yore.

Change=
d to the Very Root of Our Being

One had to live and work with him to know =
what a great teacher he was.
Through the trifles of daily life he taught us=
 Vedanta in theory and
practice. He led us with absolute wisdom and infinit=
e kindness and we were
changed to the very root of our being, not even know=
ing the depth and scope
of his influence.

It is only now, after so many ye=
ars, that we can see the meaning of the
orders, prohibitions, scoldings and=
 storms that we had to endure.

At that time we understood so little and ju=
st obeyed, because we felt that
he was God.

Even that feeling we owed to h=
is grace, for from time to time he would let
us see him as he really was, t=
he Lord Almighty, and not the human frame to
which we were accustomed.

We =
were women, simple and uneducated. It was our love for him, a reflection
of=
 his love, that chained us to his feet and made us stay. For him we gave
up=
 hearth and home and all our earthly ties.

We only knew that we were safe =
with him, that in some miraculous way he
would take us to our goal.

He him=
self was our goal, our real home. More than that we did not know or
care. W=
e were even slow to learn the lesson of equality to man and beast
which he =
was so anxious to teach us first.

To us he alone existed. The radiant form=
 of Ramana was enough for us.

We did not know that it was not enough, that=
 a human soul must learn to
embrace the universe and realize its own presen=
ce in every living being.

We would concentrate too much on him and resent =
his compelling us to enlarge
our little circle. His sometimes harsh treatme=
nt would bewilder us and make
us cry.

Now we see that it was love that suf=
fered as it laboured.

Yogis control themselves severely for long to reach =
the state to which
Bhagavan would take us by making us work near him in the=
 kitchen.

The small tasks of daily life he would make into avenues to ligh=
t and bliss.

Whoever has not experienced the ecstasy of grinding, the rapt=
ure of cooking,
the joy of serving iddlies to devotees, his devotees, the s=
tate when the
mind is in the heart and the heart is in him and he is in the=
 work, does not
know how much bliss a human heart contains.

Although physi=
cally he is no more with us, he still directs us, as in the
past. He will n=
ot let go his hold on us until we reach the Other Shore. This
is our unshak=
en faith.

We may not always be conscious of his guidance, but we are safe =
in his
hands. Sri Krishna, in His mercy became a cowherd to teach simple mi=
lkmaids
the way to salvation.

Similarly Bhagavan, the same supreme Being i=
n another form, took to cooking
in order to save a few ignorant women.

Wit=
h his eyes he served his devotees the food of the spirit, with his hands
- =
the bread of life.

i was told of the young wife's sorrow. He smiled and lifted his folded =
hands to the sky as if saying : "All happens by the will of the Almigh=
ty."</span><br>

<br>We returned to Nellore and the impression of that=
 visit faded away. I did not even dream at that time that my life would be =
spent at the feet of the Swami.<br><br>When I was thirty-one I went to Rame=
shwaram on a pilgrimage and on my return journey I stopped at Tiruvannamala=
i. I learned that the Swami was then living at the foot of the hill. That a=
fternoon we went to see him at his Ashrama. There was a thatched shed over =
his mother's samadhi and a tiled hall for meeting the Swami. He was sea=
ted on a couch and about a dozen devotees were on the bare floor. We sat in=
 silence for ten minutes and returned to the town.<br>

<br>Bhagavan's =
presence gave me the experience of inner silence and mental stillness, but =
away from him I could not regain it and I spent a year vainly trying to fre=
e myself from all thought. Some friends were going to see Sri Aurobindo'=
;s Ashrama at Pondicherry and they took me along. They were to stay there f=
or a week. I was not much impressed and went for a short visit to Ramanasra=
mam.<br>

<br>A learned Shastri whom I knew appeared in my dream and asked =
me: "Where was the need for you to go to Pondicherry? Entrust yourself=
 to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. He is God Himself. He will surely lead yo=
u to salvation."<br>

<br>But even such a clear dream was not enough. =
I cherished a plan of going to Benares and spending my life there in holy a=
usterities. I decided to go to Bhagavan, learn from him how to meditate, an=
d then leave for Benares for good. My friend Parvatamma decided to join me =
in the spiritual adventure. Accordingly we went to Tiruvannamalai and rente=
d a house. In the afternoon we took cashew nuts and sugar candy as an offer=
ing to Bhagavan and went to the Ashrama. We placed our offerings on a stool=
 before him and sat down. The cow Lakshmi happened to be lying near Bhagava=
n's sofa. She got up and began to chew our precious offerings. Bhagavan=
 looked on and said nothing. His attendant, Madhava Swami, did not even loo=
k. We thought it might be impious to disturb the cow, but soon I got exaspe=
rated and exclaimed, "Please remove the cow !" Madhava Swami repl=
ied: "Why? I thought you offered those sweets to Lakshmi !"<br>

=
<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">What is Atma?</span><br><br>The next d=
ay at noon I was again at Ramanasramam. His midday meal over, Bhagavan was =
reclining on the sofa and explaining a verse from the Bhagavad Gita to Sri =
Ramiah Yogi. As no one else was in the hall, I gathered courage and asked: =
"What is Atma?<br>

<br>Is it the limitless ether of space or the awar=
eness that cognizes everything?"<br><br>Bhagavan replied:<br><br><span=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">"To remain without thinking 'this is A=
tma' and 'that is Atma', is itself Atma."</span><br>

<br>=
He looked at me and I felt my mind melt away into nothing. No thought would=
 come, only the feeling of immense, unutterable peace. My doubts were clear=
ed.<br><br>Every day I would visit Bhagavan and listen to his talks with th=
e devotees. Deep in my mind there was the same rock-like stillness, immense=
ly solid and yet strangely vibrant.<br>

<br>Several times I was invited to=
 work in the Ashrama, but the Ashrama ways were not orthodox enough for me.=
 One day Bhagavan's own sister asked me to take her place in the Ashram=
a, for she had to leave for some time. I could not refuse. At that time San=
tammal was the chief cook and my duty was to help her. To my great joy Bhag=
avan was in the kitchen with us most of the time. He taught me to cook tast=
ily and neatly.<br>

<br>I would spend all day in the Ashrama and in the ev=
ening I would go to the town to sleep, for there was no sleeping accommodat=
ion for women in the Ashrama.<br><br>Once Bhagavan said:<br><br>"You w=
idows do not eat vegetables like drumsticks and radish. Diet restrictions a=
re good to strengthen the will.<br>

<br>Besides, the quality of food and t=
he manner of eating have an influence on the mind."<br><br>I was very =
happy to work in the kitchen directly under Bhagavan's supervision; yet=
 I wanted to go home. The Ashrama ways were too unorthodox for me. And ther=
e was too much work. I did not want to work all day long. I wanted to sit q=
uietly and meditate in solitude.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic"=
>I Leave the Ashram</span><br><br>So I left again for my village and I went=
 away for about a year. I divided my time between idleness and meditation. =
Yet my heart was at the Ashrama. I would tell myself: "Where is the ne=
ed of running about. Is not Bhagavan here and everywhere?" But my hear=
t was calling me to Bhagavan. Even when I was pleading with myself, that in=
 the Ashrama there would be no time for meditation, my heart would say: &qu=
ot;Working in the kitchen by his side is far better than meditation." =
At home I had all the leisure I wanted, but it seemed to me that I was wast=
ing my time.<br>

<br>Later I learned that that was the time Bhagavan used =
to remember me very often. Once they were preparing pongal (pulse with rice=
 and black pepper) to celebrate Bhagavan's monthly birth-star (Punarvas=
u) and Bhagavan told Santammal:<br>

<br>"Subbalakshmi is far away yet=
 she worries whether pongal is cooked here today or not."<br><br>On so=
me other festival day Bhagavan announced:<br><br>"Subbalakshmi will tu=
rn up; keep some pongal for her."<br>

<br>That very day I arrived at =
the Ashrama.<br><br>His great love for me, a worthless devotee, bound me fi=
rmly to his feet. Again and again I wanted to leave the Ashrama, but he hel=
d me for my good, more powerfully than I held on to him.<br>

<br>Whenever =
I was collecting courage to tell Bhagavan about my desire to leave, he woul=
d seem to read my thoughts and forestall me by giving me something special =
to do. I felt I had too much to do and that my life was being wasted. One d=
ay Bhagavan was looking at me intently and said:<br>

<br>"It looks as=
 if you are still hankering after meditation."<br><br><span style=3D"f=
ont-weight:bold">I replied: "What have I got except endless work in th=
e kitchen?" Bhagavan said with deep feeling:<br>

<br>"Your hands=
 may do the work but your mind can remain still.</span><br><br>You are that=
 which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not a strain.=
<br><br>But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is=
 done by you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.<br>

<br>In fac=
t, it is the mind that toils, not the body.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weig=
ht:bold">Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?<br><=
br>Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."</span><br>

<br>I =
replied: "Yes, Swami, it is as natural for you to know that you are no=
t your body as it is for us to think that we are the body. I had a dream re=
cently in which you were explaining this very point. I was dreaming that I =
was working in the kitchen and you were having your bath in your usual plac=
e behind the bamboo mat partition.<br>

<br>You asked:<br><br>'Who is i=
t?'<br><br>I replied: 'Who shall I say I am?'<br><br>You said:<=
br><br>'Exactly so, you are nothing of which something can be said.'=
;<br><br>Now, just remember that was my dream and it was quite clear. Why c=
an't I remember always that I am not the body?"<br>

<br>"Bec=
ause you haven't had enough of it," he smiled.<br><br><br><span st=
yle=3D"font-weight:bold">Do Not Torture The Body</span><br><br>I used to fa=
st quite often, as advised in some scriptural texts. In one of the books, I=
 read: "He who wants to know himself and yet pays attention to his bod=
y is like a man who trusts a crocodile to take him across a river."<br=
>

<br>I showed the text to Bhagavan and he explained:<br><br>"It does=
 not mean that you should starve.<br><br>You need not torture the body.<br>=
<br>It only means not giving the body more than it needs.<br><br><span styl=
e=3D"font-weight:bold">With your mind, hold on to enquiry and just keep the=
 body going so that it does not become a hindrance.For this, pure and fresh=
 food,simply prepared and taken in moderation,is a great help."</span>=
<br>

<br>Another day I asked Bhagavan's permission to put on the sanny=
asin's orange robes and beg for my food. He said:<br><br><span style=3D=
"font-weight:bold">"Will coloured clothes give you renunciation?</span=
><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">First learn what sannyasa means=
."</span><br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Once five or six dev=
otees sat down before Bhagavan and sang a hymn in praise of the Guru. He go=
t up in the middle of the recitation and went away, saying:<br>

<br>"=
Prayers and praises will not take one far.</span><br><br>It is the merciful=
 look of the teacher that bestows true knowledge."<br><br>I felt elate=
d. Had I not received his merciful glances? But the next day he was saying:=
<br>

<br>"Unless one becomes a six month old baby there is no hope fo=
r him in the realm of self-knowledge."<br><br>My heart sank. Although =
I lived in the presence of Lord Arunachala Himself, I was far from becoming=
 an infant.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Why Should You Doubt=
?</span><br><br>Another time Bhagavan was telling us stories from the lives=
 of devotees of bygone ages. I questioned him: "It is written that God=
 appeared before the devotee and shed His grace on him while he was still i=
n his mother's womb. Can it be true?"<br>

<br>To that Bhagavan re=
plied:<br><br>"Why should you doubt? Will doubt profit you?<br><br>Onl=
y your devotion will suffer.<br><br>Those stories are as real as your telli=
ng me that you are present here and now."<br>

<br>Bhagavan was one da=
y reading and explaining Tirupugazh in Tamil to Alamelammal of Madura.<br><=
br>I did not know Tamil and I could only look on. I saw a change in Bhagava=
n. A light was shining from within him. His face was radiant, his smile was=
 beaming, his eyes were full of compassion. His words reverberated in the m=
ind and were instantly and deeply understood.<br>

<br>All my being was car=
ried upwards on a current of strange vibrations. The memory of this experie=
nce is ever present in my heart.<br><br>A great joy has remained with me th=
at I was privileged to sit at the feet of the Divine Being.<br>

<br>It was=
 ever like this with him.<br><br>Whoever went to him, he would go down to h=
is level; his words and gestures, even the intonation of his voice, would a=
dapt themselves to the make-up of the people around him. With children he w=
as their playmate, to family people - a wise counsellor, to pundits - a wel=
l of knowledge, to yogis - the God of will, the God of victory. He saw hims=
elf in them and they saw themselves in him and their hearts would be bound =
to his feet in everlasting love.<br>

<br>All who came to see him would be =
charmed by his love and kindness, beauty and wisdom, and the overwhelming s=
ense of unity he radiated like fire radiating heat.<br><br>To some he would=
 grant a special vision, invisible to others; with some he would openly dis=
course.<br>

<br>Crowds would gather round him and each one would see him d=
ifferently. Even his pictures differ. A stranger would not guess that they =
are all of the same person.<br><br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Grant =
Me Salvation, Swami</span><br>

<br>One afternoon a lady from Kumbhakonam s=
at near Bhagavan and exclaimed: "How glad I am that I have met you, Sw=
ami. I have craved to see you for a long time, Swami. Not that I want anyth=
ing, Swami. Only please be kind and grant me salvation, Swami." With t=
hat she got up and went away.<br>

<br>Bhagavan had a hearty laugh.<br><br>=
"Look at her - all she wants is salvation.<br><br>Give her salvation, =
she wants nothing else."<br><br>I said: "Is it not what we all wa=
nt?"<br><br>He replied:<br>

<br>"Is salvation something to be ha=
nded over on request?<br><br>Do I keep bundles of salvation concealed about=
 me, that people should ask me for salvation?<br><br>She said 'I do not=
 want anything.'<br><br>If it is sincere, that itself is salvation.<br>=


<br>What is there I can give and what is there they can take?"<br><b=
r>Somebody brought a bell to be rung at the arati ceremony and it was put i=
nto Bhagavan's hands. He tried its sound in various ways and laughed:<b=
r>

<br>"God wants us to make a fire of our past evil deeds and burn o=
ur karma in it.<br><br>But these people burn a copper worth of camphor and =
hope to please the Almighty.<br><br>Do they really believe that they can ge=
t something for nothing?<br>

<br>They do not want to bend to God,they want=
 God to bend to them.In their greed they would swallow God,but they would n=
ot let him swallow them.<br><br>Some boast of their offerings.<br><br>What =
have they got to offer ?<br>

<br>The idol of Vinayaka (Ganesha) is made of=
 jaggery.<br><br>They break off a piece of it and offer it to Him.<br><br><=
span style=3D"font-weight:bold">The only offering worthy of the Lord Is to =
clear the mind of thoughts and remain steady in the peace of Self."</s=
pan><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">In the early days, when I jo=
ined the Ashrama, Bhagavan used to help in grinding lentils, peeling vegeta=
bles and even lending a hand in cooking. He would get up long before daybre=
ak to join the kitchen staff at their work. We ladies would arrive by sunri=
se, and Bhagavan would see that all was ready for our arrival and we would =
often find a part of our work already done.<br>

<br>To forestall him we wo=
uld come by five; he would come at four; we would come then at three. When =
he saw that we were left without sleep, he stopped entering the kitchen bef=
ore sunrise and gave us time to sleep.</span><br>

<br>He was the very embo=
diment of wisdom and kindness, though he did not mind our faults and mistak=
es,<br><br>He made us follow his instructions to the letter.<br><br>We had =
to do the same task again and again until it was done to his complete satis=
faction. Did he do it for himself? Of what use was it to him?<br>

<br>He w=
anted to prove to us that we could do things right,<br><br>that only lack o=
f patience and attention causes all the mess.<br><br>He sometimes seemed to=
o severe, even harsh, to make us do something correctly, for he knew what w=
e did not know that we can act correctly if we only try.<br>

<br>With expe=
rience came confidence, and with confidence the great peace of righteousnes=
s.<br><br>In daily life he avoided all distinction. At work and at food he =
was one of us. But in the hall, seated on the sofa, he was the great Lord o=
f Kailas, the Holy Mountain.<br>

<br>Whenever Bhagavan would enter or leav=
e the hall, we would all get up respectfully. One could see that he did not=
 like so many people being disturbed because of him.<br><br>He wanted us to=
 learn well the lesson that God is present in every being in all his glory =
and fullness and must be given equal reverence. He was tireless in hammerin=
g this lesson into our minds and hearts, and he would ruthlessly sacrifice =
the little comforts we so loved to provide for him, as soon as he noticed a=
 trace of preference.<br>

<br>The law that what cannot be shared must not =
be touched was supreme in his way of dealing with us.<br><br>Separative and=
 exclusive feelings are the cause of the "I" and therefore the gr=
eatest obstacles in the realization of the One. No wonder he was exterminat=
ing them so relentlessly.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Once B=
hagavan had jaundice. He had to be put on a fruit diet, but he would not ea=
t fruit unless all ate, and in equal quantities too! Where could we get suc=
h a lot of fruit? Yet he was adamant and would leave his share untouched un=
less he saw an equal share on everybody's leaf-plate.<br>

<br>Those wh=
o say that a sick man needs special food and must not give trouble, miss th=
e point. Bhagavan was not sick. His body had jaundice, that was all.=C2=A0<=
span style=3D"font-weight:bold">He wanted to impress on our minds that unde=
r no condition must a man have a greater share.</span>=C2=A0Our learning th=
is lesson was more important to him than the cure of his jaundice.</span><b=
r>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">To serve him at mealtimes was by i=
tself a dangerous adventure.</span><br><br>Our womanly desire was to fill h=
im to the brim. His rule was to clear the plate no matter what or how much =
was served. Not a speck of food would be left uneaten.<br>

<br><span style=
=3D"font-weight:bold">So we had to be watchful and serve much less than wha=
t we would like to. It was not easy and we would often fail. He would scold=
 us bitterly, or, what was infinitely worse, would fall ill and suffer.</sp=
an><br>

<br>I cannot understand how he managed to produce an illness when =
a lesson was needed, but our life with him was crisis after crisis.<br><br>=
He would take any amount of trouble to teach us the virtues necessary for s=
elf-discovery. Our life in the Ashrama was a school of yoga, and a hard sch=
ool too. For book-knowledge was as nothing to him; only character and genui=
ne spiritual experience counted.<br>

<br>With time he ceased working in th=
e kitchen, but we could still find him in the dining hall. When all would l=
eave after food, he would linger on his seat and we would collect around hi=
m and chat and listen to his precious words. He would teach us and guide us=
 and we would forget the years that passed and be again the happy crowd of =
yore.<br>

<br>Changed to the Very Root of Our Being<br><br>One had to live=
 and work with him to know what a great teacher he was. Through the trifles=
 of daily life he taught us Vedanta in theory and practice. He led us with =
absolute wisdom and infinite kindness and we were changed to the very root =
of our being, not even knowing the depth and scope of his influence.<br>

<=
br>It is only now, after so many years, that we can see the meaning of the =
orders, prohibitions, scoldings and storms that we had to endure.<br><br>At=
 that time we understood so little and just obeyed, because we felt that he=
 was God.<br>

<br>Even that feeling we owed to his grace, for from time to=
 time he would let us see him as he really was, the Lord Almighty, and not =
the human frame to which we were accustomed.<br><br>We were women, simple a=
nd uneducated. It was our love for him, a reflection of his love, that chai=
ned us to his feet and made us stay. For him we gave up hearth and home and=
 all our earthly ties.<br>

<br>We only knew that we were safe with him, th=
at in some miraculous way he would take us to our goal.<br><br>He himself w=
as our goal, our real home. More than that we did not know or care. We were=
 even slow to learn the lesson of equality to man and beast which he was so=
 anxious to teach us first.<br>

<br>To us he alone existed. The radiant fo=
rm of Ramana was enough for us.<br><br>We did not know that it was not enou=
gh, that a human soul must learn to embrace the universe and realize its ow=
n presence in every living being.<br>

<br>We would concentrate too much on=
 him and resent his compelling us to enlarge our little circle. His sometim=
es harsh treatment would bewilder us and make us cry.<br><br>Now we see tha=
t it was love that suffered as it laboured.<br>

<br>Yogis control themselv=
es severely for long to reach the state to which Bhagavan would take us by =
making us work near him in the kitchen.<br><br>The small tasks of daily lif=
e he would make into avenues to light and bliss.<br>

<br>Whoever has not e=
xperienced the ecstasy of grinding, the rapture of cooking, the joy of serv=
ing iddlies to devotees, his devotees, the state when the mind is in the he=
art and the heart is in him and he is in the work, does not know how much b=
liss a human heart contains.<br>

<br>Although physically he is no more wit=
h us, he still directs us, as in the past. He will not let go his hold on u=
s until we reach the Other Shore. This is our unshaken faith.<br><br>We may=
 not always be conscious of his guidance, but we are safe in his hands. Sri=
 Krishna, in His mercy became a cowherd to teach simple milkmaids the way t=
o salvation.<br>

<br>Similarly Bhagavan, the same supreme Being in another=
 form, took to cooking in order to save a few ignorant women.<br><br>With h=
is eyes he served his devotees the food of the spirit, with his hands - the=
 bread of life.<div style=3D"clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;mar=
