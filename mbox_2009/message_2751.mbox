|| OM TAT SAT ||
Namaskar Raja=
rshi,

Thanks for your contribution - all you have done is to prove what is=
 already known.

You had already, during you very first mail stated that ev=
erything is already known.=A0 So then why are you=A0wastingme here? -:)

> =
Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in beyond the death for a normal 
> human b=
eing. Therewfore, Ahamkara is present in the astral/casual 
> plane as well=
.

1. Do you realize what is being talked about and what you have ended up =
proving ? 
=A0
Maybe, most people here realize it better than you do! Thats=
 what makes your statements sound so incorrigible funny to say the least.
=
=A0
Wherein did I deny that Ahamkara is not present in Astral/Causal bodies=
 ?

You did deny it quite vehemently. Kindly check yourolder mails. You mak=
e a statement A then in the course of discussion you conveniently change it=
 to B and then jump around assuming ridiculous airs. At least, try and reme=
mber what you yourself speak. Go back and re check you own mails here.

Why=
 is Ahamkara not dominant in Astral/Causal bodies ?
The reason I have alrea=
dy given in the first mail in sufficient detail.
=A0

Thats again your assu=
mption.=A0Ahamkara is indeed a dominant force in all planes untill one reac=
hes a state beyond ego.

 BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH. AND THEN, =
HE WILL RECLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CONFLICTS THAT WILL ARI=
SE WILL BE BEYOND ANYBODY'S CONTROL. 
=A0
=A0
This shows that you have not =
understood even 1 percent of what has been told to you till now by other in=
 this forum, maybe because you have already decided to close your mind.
=A0=

Ahamkara is NOT confied to acquiring or not acquiring of weath. THE specif=
ics will depend on the law of karma. The essential sense of I-ness will ver=
y much remain in ALL planes, the speciifcs gets filled in by karmic repurcu=
ssions and desires.
=A0
=A0

THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED B=
Y THE I-NESS OF MANAS, while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHIT=
TA.
=A0
Any I-ness is Ahamkara. Period.


i Sri Paramahansa Yogananda", he =
has mentioned about all these things (what happens to a soul at death and s=
o on) in such a simplistic manner in his Gita commentaries, that even a lay=
man can understand it.
=A0
Is that the only book you have based all your fa=
ncy ideas on? Maybe its time for you go back to some more genuine reading w=
ith a open mind. It will do you a world of good.

Nitish

in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Moo=

 yoga is a path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual analysis. One =
pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not rea=
d many scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One star=
ts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning=

being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So=

1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideatio=
nal or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body=
 (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/a=

 that), while i=

 Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=
al body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=

Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressi=
ons of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa
 Guna=
, it doesn't have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impression=

 path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual analysis. One pursuing t=
hat path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scr=
iptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with th=
e basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end=
). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self=
. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not=
 Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, fi=
nally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very di=
fficult to follow in this age.<BR>> > > > > > <BR>> &g=
