Dear ALL,

Namaste.

3) WHOLESOME SOCIAL BEHAVIOR-DISCIPLINE AND ETIQUETTE:=
 It is most required
that when we come in contact with other our behavior s=
hould be polite and
gentlemanly. We must protect the dignity and self respe=
ct of everybody. We
are members of the human family and hence we must respe=
ct others and not
come in the way of their wholesome aspirations in life. A=
lthough it is
excellent that we imbibe gentlemanliness we must never bloat =
about it i.e.
do not blow your own trumpet of greatness. Right from having =
conversations
with others and other day to day transactions this sort of di=
scipline must
be observed. Even when others do not cooperate or that if you=
 are facing
harsh times never give up your gentlemanly character. At all co=
sts
indiscipline must be shunned like plague. When out of wrath we hurl abu=
ses
and insults at others know for sure that we are exhibiting our inner lo=
wly
stature. Even while dealing with the ugliest natured individuals never =
lose
your mental calm.

Civic scriptures elucidate many methods whereby wit=
hout harming others or
coming in their way we can safely lead a hallowed li=
festyle. We all have
different notions of how to lead a wholesome life. Hen=
ce it is most
important that every individual tries to understand the other=
s viewpoint
without bias or prejudice. Never say =91only my viewpoint is ri=
ght and that
you must follow the same=92. We must ourselves first understan=
d and then help
others understand and studiously stay away from verbal duel=
s unless of
course in those rare and exceptional case it cannot be adhered =
to.

We must behave with others exactly in the way which we like others to =
behave
with us. It encompasses not only politeness and etiquette but al tho=
se
actions which augment others comfort and never inflicts ill will on them=
.
Time management should be given due respect, one must abide by the promis=
es
given to others (accountability) and be committed to ones daily duties. =
All
these will ensure that you will slowly but surely climb peaks of glory.=

Never promise something which is beyond your ken and reach. To establish a=

bond of trust never act distrustfully. Human glory goes down the drain whe=
n
by using criminal means a person tries to fulfill his selfish desires. On=
e
must religiously abstain from such means of earning wealth. Today in the
=
economic arena foul, ethical and illegal means for earning wealth is on an
=
alarming rise. Laborers put in only 50% effort, businessmen loot their
cust=
omers by taking exorbitant profits and criminal minded people walk
freely i=
n society with total disdain for law and order. Hence it should be
seen to =
it that not only should we refrain from such criminal leanings but
that nev=
er allow others to do so too.

Just as good behavior means gentlemanliness =
and humility it also connotes
cooperation and generosity. One must respect =
others rights and give them
more importance. Only after doing so should we =
look into our needs. Duty
should be given primary importance and rights sho=
uld be secondary only.

Due respect should be given to others independence.=
 Never coerce on others
your views and beliefs however wholesome they may b=
e. Yes you may talk about
these to only those who lead unethical lives and =
have become anti social in
their behavior. It is totally undesirable to ram=
 your beliefs down other
people=92s throats. None should be obstructed from=
 availing the benefits of
thought independence and basic human rights.

The=
 protocol and etiquette executed when meetings and social transactions
take=
 place are based on nationality, time and credentials. Its prime goal is
to=
 respect others, cooperate with them and express ones good character. Thus
=
keeping in mind the saying =91In Rome do as the Romans do=92 we must
enthus=
iastically imbibe wholesome traditions and etiquette of other
countries whe=
n we visit them.

Civic sciences, Social sciences, Political sciences and E=
conomics opine that
man has been given apt basis and advice to execute his =
social
responsibilities. Hence the onus is with him to understand their dee=
p import
and then imbibe them in his daily living. Social arrangements have=
 been
designed so as to honor those who perform their duties zealously and =
punish
those who err in this respect. All governments of the world have mad=
e apt
laws, established armies, jails etc in order to establish discipline =
in
society. In turn this helps obstruct anti social elements from prolifera=
ting
in society. In society one sees both praise and insult and opposition =
and
proposition. In our individual life when we contact those around us thi=
s
very process in the form of reactions, pondering over various topics,
opp=
osition and lack of cooperation is witnessed. Even with our kith and kin
ou=
r one eye manifests love and the other eye discipline so as to reform
their=
 unwholesome habits and thinking.

Traditions in which vile activities have=
 forced their way in should be
removed totally and should be replaced with =
wholesome activities. Never
should we give our consent to undesirable habit=
s, blind beliefs and
erroneous activities. Instead if the need arises opt f=
or the method of non
cooperation and oppose these strongly until they are w=
eeded out from their
very roots. Further we must always encourage activitie=
s and stands that aim
at augmenting wholesome activities and thinking which=
 will ultimately
benefit the entire world. Another important point to note =
is regarding our
voting rights. Whenever we go for voting we must keep in m=
ind the
credentials and character of the person standing for elections. Whi=
le voting
always harbor a neutral mind and vote for the best person who has=
 long term
beneficial goals in mind. In this context honesty, accountabilit=
y and
commitment on the part of whom you vote for should be kept in mind.
V=
ociferously denounce those whose aims are selfish gains at the cost of
soci=
ety=92s uplifting. Instead encourage the qualities of congregational
wholes=
ome activities, cooperation and camaraderie.

The aim of world humanity sho=
uld be brotherhood and unity on the lines of A
BEAUTIFUL BORDERLESS WORLD. =
The high walls of disparity and differences must
be destroyed once and for =
all. There should be no discrimination based on
ones caste, community and g=
ender. We must all work hard to herald a new
world which will exist eternal=
ly as a prosperous united family. Global
efforts on a war footing are requi=
red to form a global nation, a unique
global language, a scientific religio=
n and a world culture that will bind
all human beings and other creatures w=
ith a sense of oneness and
brotherhood. All those biases and prejudices tha=
t hamper world unity must be
discarded from their very fount.

The axis of =
an individual is his/her family. A family can be compared to a
nation. A fa=
mily is akin to a factory that shapes jewel like and great
citizens of thei=
r country. If the institution called a family the world over
is well manage=
d and progressive in a wholesome way not only will individual
glory flouris=
h but that society and the world at large too will prosper both
materially =
and spiritually. All world denizens will thus experience joy,
avail materia=
l comforts and advance by leaps and bounds through the
institution of a bal=
anced family. Never should this tiny looking family be
ignored and instead =
it should be well managed and made prosperous in an
ethical manner. We all =
know that the goal of a prosperous family is
cleanliness both within and wi=
thout, hard work, cooperation, progressiveness
and living well within ones =
means. The more these ideals are absorbed the
more the family atmosphere ex=
udes grandeur and culture. Every member of such
families will doubtlessly e=
xperience a radiant and prosperous future.

In order to sacredly reform the=
 institution of family life Yuga Nirman
Mission has taken up the cause of W=
omen=92s Awakening. This gigantic program
encompasses wholesome give and ta=
ke of thoughts and thus lay down the firm
foundation stones of the ADVENT O=
F A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THE 21st CENTURY.
