Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Perils of vedanta and per=
ils of ritualism (Re: Why rituals?)





Namaste,
=A0
I want to expand on s=
ome thoughts I shared towards the end of the mail. Some people emphasize th=
e vedantic philosophy=A0and de-emphazie rituals, whereas some people are so=
 deeply immersed in rituals.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *
=A0
The concept "I am god" (aham brahmaasmi) or "you are That" (tattv=
amasi) is very dangerous for many people. Though it is undoubtedly the ulti=
mate truth, half-baked understanding of this supreme truth may result in ch=
aos in one's spiritual life. As I keep emphasizing, all these non-dualistic=
 (adwaitic) concepts are applicable to one who has transcended duality. If =
opposites such as pleasure and pain, life and death, heaven and hell, prais=
e and criticism etc are one and the same for a person and one sees the same=
 "Self" in all those opposites, then one can say "aham brahmaasmi". One who=
 sees these differently and finds one thing desirable and the other thing u=
ndesirable is not yet ready to declare "aham brahmaasmi". Just as one who s=
tudied calculus at school but forgot it *completely* now cannot claim "I kn=
ow calculus", one who sees pleasure and pain differently has forgotten one'=
s true nature and it is futile to pretend "aham brahmaasmi".
=A0
I can give=
 a parable to loosely explain this.=A0A king forgot that he was king. His f=
ace, body and personality changed. His mannersims,=A0demeanor and style of =
speaking=A0also changed.=A0He left his palace, went to a nearby forest and =
started living in a hut. Somebody came oneday and reminded him that he was =
the king. He then said "I am the king. Let me go and take control of the pa=
lace." When he went and tried to command the palace guards, he was not reco=
gnized and beaten up by his own guards. As his face, behavior, mannerisms a=
nd whole personality was different, he could not convince them he was the k=
ing. Instead of directly going to the palace, he should have practiced the =
behavior, mannerisms and style of speaking of king and then gone to the pal=
ace. Then he stood a chance of convincing the guards that he was=A0the king=
.
=A0
Similarly, each person is god. However, until one learns (again!) how=
 to think, act=A0and be like god, one is human. Until one learns how to loo=
k at pleasure and pain, life and death, praise and crtiticism, heaven and=
=A0hell etc=A0with an equal mind, one has not gotten back the characteristi=
cs needed. Until then, "aham brahmaasmi" is merely a theoretical statement.=

=A0
Somebody told me about a story apparently from Sai Baba's charitra. On=
e guru taught "aham brahmaasmi" to a sishya. It misled him, he became proud=
 and started looking at gurus, elders and all with disrespect and with a se=
nse of pride and self-importance. At the end of his life, he went to hell a=
nd met his guru there. He said "I can understand how I, with my arrogant be=
havior and half knowledge, ended up here. But why are you here?" The guru s=
aid "for teaching tattva to somebody not ready like you!"
=A0
Let the highe=
st truths of vedanta be at the back of your mind, but make sure that they d=
o not mislead you or do dame to your spiritual progress.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The concept "I am god" is so powerfu=
l and prone to abuse. It seems like there are variations of it in new age s=
piritualism. I have seen some books that marry positive and motivational=A0=
psychology to "I am god" concept=A0of vedanta and pass it=A0off as a spirit=
ual path and as=A0aatma jnaana (self-knowledge) . Self-realization is not f=
eeling good about yourself, feeling confident about yourself and getting wh=
atever you want. Supreme cosmic being (Shiva or Krishna or whatever you cal=
l) is the most powerful and can get anything, because he does not want anyt=
hing.The dogma "you can get whatever you want if you want it enough" can le=
ad to a little progress, but one will get stuck. It is very unlikely to res=
ult in self-realization.
=A0
The goal of sadhana is to pay back previous de=
bts, remove the sense of I-ness in all actions, cut off desires and reach a=
 state where there is no different between opposites and there is nothing t=
hat is desirable and nothing that is undesirable. It comes with sacrifice a=
nd surrender and not with self-importance and self-centeredness. In an unpr=
epared person, the statement "I am god" can induce self-importance, self-ce=
nteredness, arrogance and false=A0self-assurance.
=A0
Though unmanifested B=
rahman and manifested Brahman are the same in reality, there is a big diffe=
rence between them in the eyes of a person who is immersed in the delusions=
 (opposites) of the manifested universe.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
While vedanta is fraught with dangers for the unprepa=
red, the path of ritualism has its share of pitfalls. Many people engage in=
 rituals without understanding what they are meant for. One stuck in the ma=
terial world needs to engage in actions using the objects of material world=
 as symbols and these symbols will eventually trigger the correct thinking =
in the mind. There are many priests who do a nice pooja or homam and then f=
eel so proud about it. Actions engaged by one who is not making any effort =
to reduce the sense of "I am doing" in those actions are fruitless. As the =
sense of "I am doing" comes down, one's actions will have more nectar and l=
ess poison. Rituals and various actions engaged by many people are poisoned=
 by the sense of "I am doing" and the associated pride. If a ritual is perf=
ormed with a sense of surrender, then the ritual works and increases the su=
rrender further.=A0As surrender is increased, ritual will become better. As=
 ritual becomes
 better, surrender becomes better. One has to gain a suffic=
ient level of internal purity in order to break through into the groove.
=
=A0
One not realizing this will continue to run after the irrelevant and us=
eless. Such a person may cleanly bathe in the best rivers, wear the cleanes=
t and most beautiful clothes prescribed in scriptures and do the rituals fo=
llowing each instruction carefully. But, the strong sense of I-ness and pri=
de may poison everything and take a long time for the person to make progre=
ss.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
This is why I k=
eep emphasizing that external rituals and internal transformation should go=
 hand in hand. Only one will not help. Both are needed. Consciously introsp=
ect your thoughts and cut off pride and selfishness at their root whenever =
you encounter them in your thoughts and then take advantage of rituals with=
 a sense of surrender. This combination will make one lose the false sense =
of I-ness completely and then realize the true Self.
=A0
>From "somebody" (l=
imited sense of I-ness), most people have to first become a "nobody" (each =
layer of that I-ness shed off) before becoming "everybody" (realizing the S=
elf as the all-pervading spirit).

Subject: [vedic-w=
isdom] Why rituals?

Namaste,
=A0
Some intelligent and rational people wond=
er why we need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I =
want to explain this basic point with an analogy.
=A0
We teach some phrases=
 and manners to small children. For example, we tell small children to say =
"thank you" when someone helps or say "I am sorry" when they do something w=
rong. A really small child does not even understand what those words mean, =
but repeats them out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to underst=
and the true meaning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding=
 of what they truly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are a=
ctually understood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or th=
e picture of a mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred w=
ords. As a child accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions =
of the external world through senses), the child's thinking expands and one=
 gets more clarity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When =
one says sorry, one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even=
 feel a certain emotion (sadness and
 compassion).
=A0
Similarly, one may b=
e doing rituals like homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, wit=
hout fully understanding or appreciating what one does.=A0One doing a ritua=
l for many years without fully understanding its real meaning may slowly st=
art to understand and even experience some things that the rituals symboliz=
e. Many mantras and spiritual truths are actually understood from experienc=
e alone. One can never fully=A0understand what one has never experienced. A=
s we accumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external and in=
ternal world through external senses and the inward directed mind), one's t=
hinking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual tru=
ths one has been exposed to.
=A0
Rituals in various religions are designed =
to symblize some truths that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere ex=
planation of the symbolism is often useless to give one that state of bliss=
. Even if you explain to a one year old child what the word "sorry" means i=
n detail, the child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just ge=
t the child into the habit of saying "I am sorry" in approapriate situation=
s. Slowly, the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience=A0an=
d the correct emotions will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a m=
antra everyday - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and=
 visualization in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.
=
=A0
Some religions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emph=
asizing philosophy and the final truths. While the latter is undeniably the=
 end goal, the former helps one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs=
 to set foot at the base of hill before reaching its top, one often needs t=
o engage in some external practices in order to realize internal truths. Of=
 course, it is good to remind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest o=
ne should get stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one cannot completel=
y eliminate the first steps. Just saying "you are That. Just realize that y=
ou are That" is not an action plan. It does not work for most. One has to t=
ake some baby steps.
=A0If we don't teach a toddler to say various words be=
cause the toddler does not anyway understand them, one will never learn any=
thing. Correct knowledge evolves from half knowledge and habits that may be=
=A0devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Similarly,=
 correct spiritual knowledge evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic =
practices that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experienc=
es more. Most of us, when it comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers=
. So it is useful to get into the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sin=
cerely.
=A0

Narasimha

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial=
 size=3D2>Namaste,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Some intelligent and rational pe=
ople wonder why we need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to=
 them. I want to explain this basic point with an analogy.</FONT></DIV>
<DI=
V><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2>We teach some phrases and manners to small children. For example, w=
e tell small children to say "thank you" when someone helps or say "I am so=
rry" when they do something wrong. A really small child does not even under=
stand what those words mean, but repeats them out of habit. As the child gr=
ows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of what one has been sayi=
ng. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean comes to one slowly a=
s one grows. Many words are actually understood from experience. If a child=
 has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you cannot explain what =
a mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumulates more and more exp=
eriences (stored perceptions of the external world through senses), the chi=
ld's thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the words and concepts o=
ne has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one then clearly knows what ex=
actly that means and may even feel a certain
 emotion (sadness and compassi=
on).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV=
><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Similarly, one may be doing rituals like homam=
, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully understanding o=
r appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many years withou=
t fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand and e=
ven experience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spi=
ritual truths are actually understood from experience alone. One can never =
fully understand what one has never experienced. </FONT><FONT face=3DA=
rial size=3D2>As we accumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the =
external and internal world through external senses and the inward directed=
 mind), one's thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts an=
d spiritual truths one has been exposed to.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3D=
Arial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Rituals=
 in various religions are designed to symblize some truths that gives bliss=
 when experienced by one. A mere explanation of the symbolism is often usel=
ess to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain to a one year old =
child what the word "sorry" means in detail, the child will not understand.=
 The best thing to do is to just get the child into the habit of saying "I =
am sorry" in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning will become clear=
er and clearer with experience and the correct emotions will come auto=
matically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibly with mistak=
es and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mind - will slo=
wly understand it and experience it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>
<DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DArial size=3D2>Some religions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing =
rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the final truths. While the latter i=
s undeniably the end goal, the former helps one in getting to the latter. J=
ust as one needs to set foot at the base of hill before reaching its top, o=
ne often needs to engage in some external practices in order to realize int=
ernal truths. Of course, it is good to remind one that reaching the top is =
the goal, lest one should get stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one =
cannot completely eliminate the first steps. Just saying "you are That. Jus=
t realize that you are That" is not an action plan. It does not work for mo=
st. One has to take some baby steps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2></FONT> </DIV>If we don't teach a toddler to say various words=
 because the toddler does not anyway understand them, one will never learn =
anything. Correct knowledge evolves from half knowledge and habits that may=
 be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Simi=
larly, correct spiritual knowledge evolves from half knowledge and ritualal=
istic practices that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and exp=
eriences more. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Most of us, when it comes=
 to spiritual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get into the =
habit of doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.</FONT></DIV>
