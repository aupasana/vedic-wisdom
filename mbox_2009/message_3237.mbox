Namaste Narasimha/Utpal and others,
=C2=A0
Just a few point I would like to=
 mention after going through most of the posts in this thread.
=C2=A0
I com=
pletely agree to Narasimha's explanation of the degree of attachment in pla=
nts vs animals. Also I agree to the point that a meat eater, if he were to =
eat veg food for some months while reading the scriptures would feel spirit=
ually benefited. One year back I had tried it for 108 days and I definitely=
 felt some positive=C2=A0effects like a sense of purity of the mind.
=C2=A0=

Narasimha said:
=C2=A0
Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases eg=
o and identification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult.=
 After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to=
 its body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This i=
s not conducive to spiritual progress.
=C2=A0
With due respect to everyone,=
 I am not=C2=A0convinced of the above lines though I agree that for a meat =
eater, turning vegetarian is spiritually beneficial. I have a different exp=
lanation. A meat eater is basically addicted to the taste of meat. When he =
forgoes the same, it requires a degree of will-power and a conscious sense =
of direction in the mind. Like overcoming any addiction with a clear sense =
of purpose that I am doing it to help me spiritually benefit. This in turn,=
 when successfully done, creates a sense of purity in the mind. The reason =
for the purity is not so much about eating veg food, but more due to the me=
ntal force created by conscious abstinence from non veg food. 
=C2=A0
Simil=
arly, a regular=C2=A0vegeterian, if he or she were to shift to a diet of ON=
LY milk and fruits for some months=C2=A0- which is not his staple diet -=C2=
=A0 would feel a similar effect. As I see it, generation of will power is t=
eh first conscinous effect of the=C2=A0beauty of sadhana. This sense of men=
tal purity maybe - I am not sure - related to the generation of more bhutaa=
gni. That which jolts you out of your normal regularized habits will create=
 a force in the mind which is beneficial.
=C2=A0
Speaking of ego, for an av=
erage man not engaging in any specific spiritual=C2=A0pursuit (sadhana), I =
have really not encountered any difference between people who are strict ve=
geterians from birth or people who have an omnivorous diet. That is why I a=
m not at all convinced that an omnivorous diet for an normal human being bl=
ocks or aids him in any way any more than a vegeterian diet does. =C2=A0BUT=
 abstinence in any form and any degree,=C2=A0is=C2=A0a GREAT tool for spiri=
tual benefit.
=C2=A0
I hope I expressed my view point clearly.
=C2=A0
Dear =
Utpal,
=C2=A0
Do not think that I'll be offended or misunderstand you to be=
 a cruel hearted etc...
=C2=A0
Thanks!:)
=C2=A0
Vegterianism is related to =
Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)
against Adharama (Killing=
 Innocent creatures).
=C2=A0
I get what you mean thought I do see dharma/ad=
harma that way. 
=C2=A0
your second Para and some writings in your earlier =
message gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, De=
sh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
In my op=
inon, if one can justify eating=C2=A0popular meat of=C2=A0chicken, etc..=C2=
=A0then anything under the Sun is eatable.=C2=A0 with that logic, those peo=
ple who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alrig=
ht. even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and=
 not doing anything wrong as per the 'their' thinking.
=C2=A0
To talk about=
 Karma, Conditioning, Culture=C2=A0etc..., and=C2=A0try to=C2=A0make qualit=
y judgements by the logic of 'Direct killing' and 'eating meat of already d=
ead' does not go well with me.=C2=A0it is=C2=A0just a philosophy to cover u=
p.
=C2=A0
I guess I will just have to=C2=A0agree to disagree with you. We l=
ook at things differently:)
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
One more=C2=A0point=
 I would like to question. Some of the other mails mentioned that people (n=
on-vegeterians)=C2=A0should get out of the 'addiction' of taste for non-veg=
. While I agree that non-veg food is addictive to one who eats it, I would =
like to ask, is not vegeterian food addictive to one who is a thorough bred=
 vegetarian? Or are we implying that those who eat veg food - vegeterains b=
y birth - are not 'addicted' to food at all, and do not enjoy the food they=
 eat? 
=C2=A0
Ordinary we are all addicted to food, veg or non-veg, and eat=
 for our palates as much as for our stomachs, or so I thought.

Namaste,

I have been extremely b=
usy at work for a while now and will continue to be, working long hours eve=
ryday. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few qui=
ck points.

* * *

Self-identification of human beings and animals with bod=
y and body parts is much much stronger and denser than that of plants and t=
rees. Self-identification of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf o=
r flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion e=
xperienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut o=
ff in an animal or a human being, the emotion experienced is much stronger.=
 Even after death, an animal may identify with the body and think of it as =
"I".

The kaarmik debt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the a=
nimal's mind considers as a part of "I" and is highly attached to, is much =
bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits =
of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.

As long as we live in a physical=
 body, creation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimi=
ze the debts we create newly.

* * *

You are what you eat. Our body and va=
rious chemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.

Meat i=
s highly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and=
 identification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. Afte=
r all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its =
body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not=
 conducive to spiritual progress.

* * *

It is possible that a spiritual g=
iant from past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not=
 easy to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with=
 the body and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (=
simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).

If a meat=
-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and len=
tils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual =
literature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it make=
s a big difference.

* * *

Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha =
cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misgui=
ded propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes fr=
om classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored=
.

Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians=
 to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat=
. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.

N=
