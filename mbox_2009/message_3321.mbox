Dear Narasimhaji,

A while ago, there was a discussion on koshas, chakras a=
nd sariras. Although it was useful, I feel it didnt really get to the crux =
of the matter. I have for a while been pondering how to pose the question i=
n the correct way in order to elicit, from you or anyone else, the level of=
 answers that I would like to see. I'll make an attempt now, I would ask on=
ly that you read the whole post..

First, contrary to what most people on t=
his group probably believe, I feel it is best to start, in intellectual dis=
cussion at least, with the western concept of consciousness. The reason is =
that western-style inquiry/explanations always originate from sensory obser=
vables - which are of *common experience to all*, whereas eastern-style inq=
uiry/explanations may originate from sometimes non-sensory observables, whi=
ch lead to many misconceptions/subjective interpretations. So if we are to =
reach an understanding that is to some degree objective, it is best to star=
t from some common ground.

For this purpose, I'll take Carl Jung's definit=
ions as a starting point. What is ego? From his point of view, ego is one's=
 everyday field of consciousness. What is one conscious of? Things reported=
 by the senses - the material universe. But also feelings and memories, whi=
ch have no material representation - they are not "gathered" by the senses =
as the material world is. What is the feeling of "I"? It is the center of t=
he ego, that gives the ego a feeling of oneness. However, this ego is not a=
 solid circle i.e if the inside of the circle is the contents of the consci=
ousness, it is not as if the center is a content of consciousness too! The =
ego is more like a doughnut, with the empty central part being what Jung ca=
lls, naturally, the unconscious. We all feel whole i.e. my hand is mine, my=
 leg is mine, the memory of savoring a mango last night is also mine, but a=
m I the hand - no; am I the leg - no; am I the memory - no; I'll still be I=
 without them, though maybe not a happy I. So all this is consistent with t=
he doughnut model - an invisible I in the center, conscious of the edible p=
art of the doughnut.

At this point, even the least spiritual of people wou=
ld be hard pressed to disagree with me. So from my point of view, this is g=
ood and common ground i.e. a good point from where to start investigating v=
edic definitions. 

So at this point, I'll pose my first set of questions -=
 Where does this doughnut fit vis-a-vis the antahakarana? Is the doughnut i=
nside the manas with the ahamkara at the invisible center? Or is the doughn=
ut in the physical body with the entire antahakarana at the invisible cente=
r? Either way, when you raise kundalini/attempt spiritual awakening, you ar=
e pushing the inside of the doughnut toward the center, right? 

I can get =
to more questions as and when you reply..


Regards,

Sundeep
