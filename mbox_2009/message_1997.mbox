Namaste
=C2=A0
I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writ=
ing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.
=C2=A0
Near the beginning =
of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aur=
obindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In hi=
s high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage=
 in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right =
here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life w=
as now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a=
 breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body to=
wards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo was joined in=
 Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became kn=
own as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellula=
r transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we fac=
e today.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all ma=
tter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The proce=
ss of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. T=
he process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called=
 evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where =
these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he=
 foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=
=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely c=
hange everything on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what=
 he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul=
 is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an et=
ernal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard l=
id of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, =
even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.

Sri Aurob=
indo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A s=
tage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides o=
n the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinc=
tion as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1=
973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be terme=
d the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, =
and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular conscio=
usness.

Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and =
later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another le=
ap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Sup=
ermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we=
 will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =
=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=
ssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=
rging with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a speci=
es that is spontaneous-ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-ex=
panding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live f=
rom soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Thirdly is t=
he =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body,=
 but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consc=
iousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Final=
ly, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=
=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will=
 be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In th=
is species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Ear=
th.

The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing suprame=
ntal consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies=
. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental co=
nsciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields =
of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manife=
station in collective matter.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD=
 there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of t=
heir experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-di=
vine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, th=
e Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These=
 are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in con=
trol of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Luc=
ifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Sufferi=
ng has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak=
 havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=
=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own=
 intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficul=
t to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the =
current political sphere.

With the descent of this new vibratory conscious=
ness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri=
 Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they would=
 not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases F=
alsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the S=
upramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could ove=
rcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. T=
he Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Lig=
ht, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all t=
he violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experienced i=
f not for this power of harmonization!

When does all this happen? Sri Auro=
bindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum=
 descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the =
supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come abou=
t with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still co=
nsiderable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.

This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji=
 says about changes coming in the world.
