I had this query in my mind since long time but i didn't ask you. also in =
the past, few questions which i wanted to ask you but didn't has been alway=
s answered by you by means of this forum.

Now coming back to the Visarga -=
 
I was convinced when i read your above paragraph regarding pronunciation =
of Visarga (:, Ha). Technical also it looked correct.

but when i was recit=
ing CP yesterday i was having some doubts which are mentioned below along w=
ith some other related queries.

1) I came across Deva Uchu: in the 4th cha=
pter. Now i am convinced about DevaaH, RaamaH. IN This two words when you l=
et go the air, you can naturally (effortlessly-without affecting the flow) =
pronuonce Ha (Not Haa). and i thought it is the same for others but when i =
came across Uchu:, i was in doubt for the consistency of the rule. What i m=
ean here is that when i pronounce Uchu and then let go the air, the natural=
 pronunciation seems to be 'Hu'. for Uchu--Ha, i have to do some extra effo=
rts. it does not seem natural.
Likewise for the word, Devaei:, when you let=
 go, natural following voice seems to be 'Hi..'
Surprisingly for Dewaa:, Ha=
 seems to follow naturally and no need for Haa.

2) More importantly, when =
i recite CP or any other Shlokaas, i have found that, many a times it obstr=
uct the rythm when you try to pronounce Visargaas. Especially when Visarga =
come in between a shloka. what is the basic purpose of the Visarga in Sansk=
rit language? and what if i avoid some of the Visargaas which obstruct the =
flow?. 


Please ignore if these questions are like unnecessary hair splitt=
ing analysis because I also feel that way at the moment. But I thought of a=
sking you finally because the topic is relevant and the points I mentioned =
are practically experienced.

Yours,

Utpal
