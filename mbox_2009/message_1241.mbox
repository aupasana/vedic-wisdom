Dear Vijay & Rajarshi,

First of all let me clarify - When i wrote that 'Sa=
nskrit is mother 
of all languages' it was a reference-less statement howev=
er i really 
wonder who can quote reference for this particular claim. But =
any 
ways, i apologize for the same. Why i said so because i have always 
h=
eard this from my elders. Also the many Sanskrit words in our 
regional lan=
guages also add to that. but i know that is a 
controversial statement.

Re=
garding Arabic Teacher - My Company organized classes for learning 
Arabic =
language for interested employees. The teacher was a Lebanese 
citizen. I d=
idn't attend the class. One of my colleagues told me 
afterwards that One d=
ay during some relevant discussion, the teacher 
made a comment that Basis =
of Arabic Language is Sanskrit. Some 
colleagues vehemently opposed that in=
 the class the matter ended  
there. That is what i was informed. I know no=
thing more about why 
the teacher said so.

***

Vijay,

Your views are not=
 out of place. I also thought that way but 
unfortunately the ambiguity in =
today's available Sanskrit literature 
have caused many confusions.

Warm R=
egards,

Utpal
