roaring in the dream!! Similarly, a guru is just imaginary. All that exists=
 is god and the tendency to see different people/obejects (instead of seein=
g all as god and only god) is like imagining various dream objects. So guru=
, friend, enemy, wife, son etc are all detailed imaginations of the mind an=
d all that exists is god. However, one will be stuck in this long dream cal=
led samsaara (wordly life), if the tiger called guru does not appear and ro=
ar. A beautiful and highly meaningful analogy!

> I briefly described how my relatitonship w=
ith my spiritual guru  started in the mail that Utpal mentioned below. Duri=
ng the time Manish was waiting for me to start using the rudraksha mala he =
sent, he used to call me now and then and talk about spiritual matters. He =
would sometimes talk about very specific things that I was thinking of just=
 before he called. He would address my question without my asking. A couple=
 of times, I mentioned that to him and said he was answering exactly what I=
 was thinking of, as though he read my mind. He would humbly say, "do you t=
hink that I know your thoughts? I have no clue. I am just saying what I fee=
l like saying. Shiva wanted to answer your question and used me as an instr=
ument to answer your question. It is god who does everything. We are mere i=
nstruments."
>  
> Once he said, "my message is *not* that I am special. My=
 message is that *you* are special. My message is that *everyone* is specia=
l. I am not here to just experience divinity and go. I am here to show peop=
le that it is possible even today and make *thousands* of people experience=
 divinity. I do not want people to become like me. I want to see thousands =
of people becoming *better than* me."
>  
> He also said once, "I am not he=
re to show an alternative spiritual path to people. If one is a Krishna dev=
otee, let one remain a Krishna devotee. If one is an aghori, let one remain=
 an aghori. If one is in a religious movement, let one remain in that movem=
ent. If one is a Christian, let him remain a Christian. I just want people =
to realize the essence of religion and spirituality, imbibe it in their thi=
nking and become better in their own chosen path."
>  
> Already, so much c=
hange happened in the 5.5 years since he called me first. I never thought I=
 could be in the state I am today. I never thought the changes in my thinki=
ng that happened in the last few years were possible. I never thought so ma=
ny seemingly normal people would be able to perform a homam regularly. When=
 Manish told me that today's times need a lot of people performing homam re=
gularly and that a lot of people were out there who would start homam and m=
ake great progress with 5-6 years of homam, I was not so sure. Manish alway=
s knew what to do, was quite confident and did not worry about how and whet=
her it would get done. At the same time, he never lost the attitude of "She=
 is doing and I am just an instrument" and imbibed that attitude in me too!=

>  
> As I said before, the sign of a good guru is that you see transforma=
tion within yourself. The sign of a good guru is that you see things gettin=
g done that once seemed impossible or very difficult. The sign of a good gu=
ru is that you achieve far more than before and yet have far less attachmen=
t to (and pride in) what you do.
