Pranaam Narasimhaji,

I have been following your Mahaganapati Homam for a =
few weeks now and
have been getting good results and for that I am thankful=
 to you and
Manishji who is the inspiration behind this.  When I started th=
is
initially I had big doubts since on the first day I performed the Homam
=
my elder son fell down and broke his tooth and had bleeding (I was
reading =
the story of Ganesha losing his tooth to Parashurama's axe the
same day) an=
d the next time I did the Homam my younger son caught his
foot in the templ=
e door we were visiting on the same day (Ganesha
guarding the door?) and go=
t hurt.

I was expecting some negative experiences to come my way when I st=
arted
the Homams as part of some karmic cleansing but I was expecting them =
to
come my way and not the way of family members so was a bit surprised.  I=

was wondering if you have any thoughts on this.

My questions on Homam are=
 the following

1.  Have you published a regular or long procedure for Maha=
ganapati
Homam?  At some point I would like to try a longer version if that=
 is
available.  Is the difference only between the 5 types and the 16 types=

of offering or there is more to it such as detailed puja of digpalas and
g=
rahas etc?

2.  I recite Sri Rudram/Chamakam path for several years now and=
 would
like to do that via Homam.  Can you provide some guidance as to how =
to
do this?  i.e. when to say swaha?  I think it is fairly logical to do
th=
at in Rudram but Chamakam is not so clear and swaha seems to come at
the en=
d of each anuvaaka only.  Or perhaps Chamakam is only to be
recited and not=
 offered to Agni

Regards

Veenu
