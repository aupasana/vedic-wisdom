Dear Pathakbhai,

Can you please mention how long after your Ganapati homam=
 did you move to Chandi path? Your timeline would help in giving a guidelin=
e timeframe. 

I have seen Narasimhaji and many others saying that after fe=
w months - you can move on to other homams. Are there any indications from =
within that we should be waiting for to get started? Would it vary from per=
son to person?

I don't know if I'm thinking too much unnecessarily.

Warm =
Regards
Anup Ray

Namaste friends,
I revisited some of my communications with my Gu=

tri.=A0some useful extract from my message=A0to narasimha is as below:
[Y'd=
ay Maha Ganapati homam was a Starting point on a Starting Day of >Navaraatr=
i. It was all Krishnaarpanam. so how to say *I* performed? >>(As thakur say=
s, this Rascal I never dies :-) it took me 2 hours. >(excluding preparation=
 & winding up)]

Now=A0the same procedure=A0takes me around 1 hour includin=
g preparations.
My message to my Guru about Chandi Homam ( one year back i.=
e. last navaratri):
[Today chandi Homam took 3 hours 45 minutes=A0even=A0th=
ough i am very fluent in Chandi paath and quite comfortable with Devanagari=
.I think with Kavacha, Argalaaadi, it is very dificult to complete in=A0 3 =
hours. let me see=A0how can it be planned.]
Now i am able to perform the sa=
me procedure (full as per manual) in 2 and Half hours. 
I reproduced it so =
that it might help for the aspirants who wish to start=A0but worried about =
time management.=A0
Wish you all a very spiritual Navaraatri. may mother Du=
