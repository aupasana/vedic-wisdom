Hello,

Whether past lives exist is a debate - Krishna tells this in the Bh=
agavad  Gita 
even in the west Edgar Cayce and others claim to have taken p=
eople to their past lives using hypnosis - The book "many mansions" for exa=
mple or Brian Weiss in "many lives, many masters" The conclusions of both a=
re similar - that we seem to reap the benefits/harm of our doings in past l=
ives.

>From another angle, it is might just be a rational way for humans to=
 
attribute a "reason" for doings in this lives. This is the rational 
expl=
aination - we need to attribute a reason for our current being and a logica=
l explaination is many lives.

Some thoughts that occur randomly in my mind=
 on this:
* How come the number of human beings keeps on increasing? Is it =
that the animals are doing more and more good to be reborn as humans 
* How=
 come all politicians and power holders are so bad - e.g: Has Deve Gowda do=
ne something extremely great to have such a good life - he is PM, his unedu=
cated son is CM
* Are the number of souls in the world finite or infinite?
=

Coming to rajesh's problem - I think he is solely responsible for the mess=
 he has landed in - it was his choice and he must stand by it - this is the=
 logical thing that seems right in the Indian context.
If it were US or wes=
tern world - he could have walked out

So either decision is correct/wrong =
in context

but to attribute it to telling that if he says 'no' he might ha=
ve to have a bad next life and so on - karmic debt etc may not be the right=
 reason - as past lives are themselves debatable


Thanks
Vamsi
