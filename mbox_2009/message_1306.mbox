Namaste friends,

Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone=
 sent me a few snippets from an 
interview posted on her website. Please se=
e below.

It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as h=
er guru. It 
is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire c=
eremonies and 
show what is truth" and "at that time the whole world will b=
e peace". This 
is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when s=
he appeared to 
him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

She told him tha=
t many people are and will be born who will perform a short 
fire ritual on=
 a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
world and als=
o make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. 
Shree Maa's =
statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar 
lines.

My guru=
 was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
should=
 be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day=
. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and 
can=
 be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
n=
eed to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
of=
ferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
f=
ew such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of 
eve=
nts that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.

Though not 3 times a day,=
 these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for 
3 years in the same pl=
ace and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
It is the sadhana and=
 purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings 
deities to a place. Whi=
le several ancient temples are without any divine 
presence these days, new=
 places of divine presence may be created by pure 
souls engaged in selfles=
s sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, th=
e sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which 
Mother appeared and gave=
 instructions to my guru on spreading homam was 
taken on Ramakrishna' s bi=
rth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within 
a few minutes from the=
 actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. 
All of this was a co=
incidence and we were unaware of this significance when 
we decided the muh=
urta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
mention fire ceremoni=
es specifically to somebody and that his words are 
similar to the words of=
 Mother.

Best regards,
Narasimha
