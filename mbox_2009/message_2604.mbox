NAMASTE

Dear Mahalaxmyey,

I think, this the best answer to hear with, but=
 is this so simple? if yes, then I will definitely follow your advice...

I=
n previous days, there are books I read, taught to find ISHTA DEVATA from 1=
2th house from ATMAKARAKA in D9, but currently I have got a well explained =
topic on ISHTA DEVATA by P.V.R ji, taught to find him/her from 12th from AT=
MAKARAKA in D20...

In my case, 12th from KARAKAMSHA in D20 is GEMINI and t=
here is no aspect or association, but its LORD MERCURY is my LAGNA LORD as =
well as ATMAKARAK...now the question arises, how could it be possible for A=
TMAKARAKA to liberate the soul too?

Please help in this context, my only i=
nterest to SADHANA, HONOM etc to the correct path...I am very much eager to=
 choose the spiritual practice as well, but afraid of choosing any wrong di=
rection...

best regards,
Biswajit
