Hare Krishna
Dear friend.
The fact you are feeling this way shows your
inclination to take the high road.
Not a blade of grass moves without the sanction of the
Lord.
Everything is happening according to his will.
Surrender, and accept.
Our karmas are so entangled , it is hard to understand
them.
Personally, as Ive gotten older it is easier to "let
go" of things.
Also, in the whole scheme of things, better to devote
our energy to positive things.
One can expend our energy holding onto apparent wrongs
and injustices, but best to take the high road and
look around and see others who are must worse off than
ourselves.
My mother used to say
" I used to complain about no shoes until  I saw a man
with no feet".
So my next words are that, for me, each day , I count
my blessings.
Instead of counting my complaints, I count my fortune,
my blessings.
Look around and see all the animals and peoples who
are oblivious of Gods divine creation.
Give thanks, remember -
Pray to the Lord that he also stays by your side even
when you forget him.
With your human birth , take option to serve God.
Whatever your mind is fixed on determines your next
birth, so do you want to be thinking of these things
with family members and injustice?

Mantra- Engage your mind in mantra, and your body in
service.
With a sincere heart, God cleans your heart of
impurities,
Just chant and clean the dust from your heart, clean
the dirt from many lifetimes, chant the names of the
Lord with love and faith, all will fall in place.

Best wishes
Lakshmi
