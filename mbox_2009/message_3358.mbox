 THE husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law's house and is
seated in the drawingroom with other young men of his age. The girl and her
friends are looking at them through the window. Her friends do not know her
husband and ask her, pointing to one young man, "Is that your husband?"
"No," she answers, smiling. They point to another young man and ask if he is
her husband. Again she answers, "No." They repeat the question, referring to
a third, and she gives the same answer. At last they point to her husband
and ask, "Is he the one?" She says neither yes nor no but only smiles and
keeps quiet. Her friends realize that he is her husband.

One becomes silent on realising the true nature of Brahman.
