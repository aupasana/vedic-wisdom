Most respected Narsimhaji,
The way you are guiding us is so sweet and so be=
utiful, I have no words. This is real understanding. Most of us are sufferi=
ng from ritual fears like -do this and don't do this. Something will happen=
 and like. Your words are like God himself speaks to us. Thanks Sir.

=C2=A0 



=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Ram=
 and other friends,
=C2=A0
Before I try to address this quandary, I want to=
 tell a small story.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
More than 120 years ago=
, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar=
. Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine with a beautiful Kri=
shna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes. Due to an accid=
ent when another priest was carrying the idol during a festival, the idol b=
roke oneday.
=C2=A0
The priests and the highly learned scholars were in a q=
uandary and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras were clear that a =
broken idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in f=
lowing water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Gan=
ges.
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view=
. He thought for a while and said calmly, "Suppose you have a son and his l=
eg is broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue =
to love him or will you throw your son into Ganges?" His simple common sens=
e view prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself =
fixed the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to b=
e worshipped.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The idol was in your house for 5=
6 years. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your min=
d, after all these years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental p=
eace by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is better off being =
ignorant than having such knowledge.
=C2=A0
If you have an idol that was wo=
rshipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it would've capture=
d and stored some of the positive energy and positive thoughts of those peo=
ple. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.
=C2=A0
It should n=
ot be a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing=
 simple things should suffice.
=C2=A0
Whenever you see the idol, imagine th=
at there is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bo=
w to him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some fruit or raisins or=
 something to the idol now and then, when you get a chance, and imagine tha=
t Ganesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in water and wipe it=
 (to keep it clean).
=C2=A0
The key is not how detailed your rituals are an=
d whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in your ritual. The =
key is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol and how deeply yo=
u love that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Rituals are only mea=
nt to facilitate such a visualization and increase such a love. They are ne=
ither necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relationship with a deity=
 (which is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *
=C2=A0
How does a metallic (or stone or whatever) object become divin=
e?
=C2=A0
Of course, each object and each atom of this universe is filled, =
in essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But, that would apply =
to the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as being more divine=
 than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pervading non-dual god =
here. We are talking about a deity within the field of duality here. That d=
eity is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. But, how does the dei=
ty get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in it simply because of =
its shape? Of course not!
=C2=A0
All lokas and all devatas are present with=
in you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought, you concentrate=
 a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or any object). When =
a priest with a good level of purity and good ability to visualize (which c=
omes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pratishthaa in an id=
ol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa mantra as an instr=
ument and a deity's essence enters the idol.
=C2=A0
Even if you do not do a=
 praana pratishthaa formally, deity's essence will slowly be established in=
 the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all about the powe=
r of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down by a dense a=
nd heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work faster, bu=
t even thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed down by a dense and =
heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, albeit=
=C2=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol =
over a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invariably be establish=
ed in the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.
=C2=
=A0
If you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care o=
f him, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this ne=
gativity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saattwika form with=
 whom you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when =
you see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity's anger), it will i=
ndeed create such a presence in the idol and do you good.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *
=C2=A0
There are several *well-meaning* people out there with half-ba=
ked understanding that is not based on any direct experience, who go around=
 scaring people in several matters relating to god, religion and spirituali=
ty. But god is not to be feared.
=C2=A0
Love god. Do not fear god. When you=
r father or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is for a good reason=
 and it will eventually be for your good. They are not really angry at you =
and they actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes you or gives bad r=
esults, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. Do=
 not fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always *love* god and lo=
ve god very deeply. More deeply than you love your parents, spouse, childre=
n etc. That is a simple principle for sureshot=C2=A0spiritual progress.
=C2=
=A0
Good luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you decide to do with i=
t!
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house since the =
last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha wi=
th its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in =
a dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these years. =
It was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who=
 has been seeing it since then. <BR>> <BR>> I feel that it is better =
to donate it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there=
 for so long in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would b=
e extremely grateful if I could have
 advice as to what would be the correc=
t thing to do and how to go about doing the same.<BR>> <BR>> Kindly p=
ardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a query.<BR>> <BR=
