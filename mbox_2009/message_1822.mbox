Hi,
=A0
I would advise that you do not marry that girl. 
If you marry her, =
you'll always have a feeling that you have done some great favour to her an=
d no matter how good she is you'll never be able to get out of this feeling=
 (easily, given the level of your maturity) and this negative starting woul=
d unnecessarily spoil her=A0innocent life for no falut of hers.
=A0
You exp=
lain this situation to all parties explicitly and admit that it is 'YOUR' f=
ault for saying yes and get away from her life. 
=A0
Thanks
KK
