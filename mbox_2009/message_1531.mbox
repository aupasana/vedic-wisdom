Vijay,
     Narasimha said it is generally recommended by many to read out mantra loud during Homa, but according to him, even if you are chanting the mantra almost mentally, there should be a minimum sound produced, atleast by way of the movement of lips. When you are doing japam, however, it is better if there is no movement of the lips also.
     Here is an article http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/615 which talks about the Sabda and it's various levels.

Warm Regards
Ravi

Ravi,

I am surprised that there is a general rule that recommend us to read out mantra loud during homa. I thought the entire homam can be done with out making sound if we can do it. Once you get the mantra, it is much easier when we pronounce it loud. It takes much more effort to pronounce it completely mentally while keeping the correct swara.

There were times when many of the mantras were secret (one may recall the story of Ramanuja giving out Om Namoe Narayanaaya to all. It was kept a secret for a long time).

All the mantras are making our conversation with the gods during the mantra. The communication with Gods is at thought level and physical plane is not required.

In fact, if ones internal fire is very strong, then even physical fire may not be really required. How ever, the internal fire in most of us is perhaps very weak.

Best regards,
Vijay
Best regards,
Vijay
