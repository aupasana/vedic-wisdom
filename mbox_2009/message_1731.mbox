Namsate Narasimhaji

One of my close friend is very upset from lat 7-8 year=
s with the events happened in his life. I tried to console him but failed.
=
Yesterday I posted him all the profound explanation given by you "HOW KARMA=
 WORKS". Below is his reply, I am not capable to answer him So i am pasting=
 his reponse so that you can reflect some
light on that.
****************Hi=
s Resonse******************

vishal,
 
Dont u think this KARMA theory is li=
ke " MAN SHOULD BEHAVE LIKE ROBOT" No happiness no sadness. they should do =
all the good things.
 
so why GOD created human being, he should have creat=
ed ROBOTS, ROBOTS whi in turn wil create more ROBOT. 
 
When ther eill be o=
nly machine, there will not be EMOTIONS. what was the rational behaind crea=
ting this junk creature "HUMAN"
 
I've answer "GOD BECOMES HAPPY WHEN HE SE=
ES PEOPLE CRYING, IF PEOPLE WILL CRY, THEY WILL PRAY THIS JUNK SO CALLED GO=
D"
 
I dont think there should be no place of emotions in life. i people lo=
ve someone, how he/she can without emotion??
 
 
LIFE without LOVE and emot=
ion is like DEAD, as its my life.
*****************************************=

regards
Vishal Sharma
