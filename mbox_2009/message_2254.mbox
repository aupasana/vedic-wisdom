Namaste,

Ganapati is 'ee'karant pulling (masculine) word in Sanskrit.
Devi=
 is ee'karant stiling (feminine) word in Sanskrit.
Shiv is 'a'karant pullin=
g (masculine) word in Sanskrit.
Visnhu is 'u'karant pulling (masculine) wor=
d in Sanskrit.

For any action, in sanskrit, the object to which it is mean=
t for you have to use chaturthi ekvachan (singular) vibhakti. 
For 'ee'kara=
nt masculine, it is 'ye' Hence, Ganapataye
For 'ee'karant feminine, it is '=
vyei' Hence, Devyei
For 'a'karant masculine, it is 'aay' Hence, Shivaay
For=
 'u'karant masculine, it is 've' Hence Vishnave

So the Sanskrit sentence i=
s Ganapataye Nama:, Devyei Nama:, Shivaay Nama:, Vishnave Nama:

When it be=
comes a mantra,
1. It has to start with Om
2. In addition it can have a 'bi=
jakshar' such as G^n. 

Hence the mantra is 
1. "Om G^n Ganapataye Nama:"
2=
. "Om Nama: Shivaay" (Bijakshar is not needed. In Sanskrit verb can come an=
ywhere.)
3. "Om Vishnave Nama:"
4. "Om Devyei Nama:" Or "Om Namo Devyei Mah=
adevyei Shivayei Satatam Nama:"

The importance of Mantra is in Sadhana. Ev=
ery Mantra needs to be made Siddha. There are methods for doing this. The e=
xamples are well known. Story says that, Devarshi Narad gave mantra to Valy=
a Koli - "Mara" and asked him to repeat it continuously. You know the rest =
of the story.

The simple method to make a mantra siddha is to repeat it da=
ily for a committed number of times with full dedication to the meaning of =
each syllable of the mantra. The effect is seen gradually but definitely.

=
I am sorry, I always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right fo=
r a non Indian language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to =
explain it to an Indian language speaking person. For example - In "Shivaay=
 Nama:" and "Nama: Shivaay", there is a subtle difference in the pronouncia=
tion of "Nama:". In the first one "ha" of the visarga ":" is to be pronounc=
ed completely while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar ":=
" (no "ha"). Now you can understand why I say that it is difficult to expla=
in.

regards,

Jagmohan
