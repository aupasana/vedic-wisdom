Respected PVR ji,

Astrologically referenced from your Boston lectures i ad=
viced one due to her constant health problems to fast on wednesdays and pro=
piate Parvati as her AL is Gemini and seond from that house is Karkata (lor=
d moon whose devata is Parvati).Am i correct?

She asked me how to do Parva=
ti puja?
As i dont know the answer i look up to you respected sir for your =
help.


P.S.:Its my personal opinion your effort towards astrology is timel=
ess and you are among the few IN THIS FIELD who doesn't fear to criticise h=
is ownself.
Let the knowlegeable Ganesha's blessing be ever on you.
