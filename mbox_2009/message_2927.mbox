There are scorpion stings on one side, serpents are on the other side. Flie=
s, fleas, bugs, mosquitoes, other insects and thorns trouble you from one c=
orner. The sun scorches you in summer. Cold stings you in winter. Influenza=
, plague, fashionable appendicitis, pyhorrhoea, smallpox are all ready to d=
evour you. Then there are the three tapas (fevers): adhyatmic, adhidaivic a=
nd adhibhautic. Fear, delusion, grief, sorrow and misery, kill you every mo=
ment.

Desire, anger, hatred, jealousy, worry, anxieties and cares torment =
you every second. Deaths of persons whom you loved so dearly give you sever=
e shocks. Yet you will never renounce the momentary pleasures of the senses=
 of this unreal mundane existence. Such is the depth of sensual enjoyments.=
 You will speak through ahankara: "O, I am a powerful man. I am very intell=
igent. I can do anything. There is no Ishwara." You will twist your glued m=
oustache and when the scorpion stings you sharply, you will cry out bitterl=
y: "O Narayana, Narayana, Narayana, help me. Relieve me of this horrible pa=
in."

If the hair becomes grey, you invent various dyes to blacken it. You =
invent monkey-gland grafting for rejuvenation. If the teeth are fallen out,=
 you put on a new artificial dental set. You will never leave the "will to =
live and enjoy." Miserable wreck that you are! Hopeless specimen!

Think de=
eply. Cogitate. Reflect. Have constant satsang. Do selfless service to coun=
try and humanity. Develop the four means of salvation. Study Bhagavad Gita,=
 Yoga-Vasishta and Viveka-Chudamani of Sankara. Clear your doubts by approa=
ching learned sannyasins. Have recourse to sravana, manana and nididhyasana=
. Remove the veil of ignorance and rest in your own swarupa--the Satchitana=
nda state. Atma va are dyasktavyah shrotavyo, mantavyo, nidhidhyasitavyah?"=
The self must be seen, heard, thought upon and deeply pondered" (Brihadaran=
yaka Upanishad 4:5).

Shun honour, respect, degrees, name, fame, power, pos=
ition and titles. They are absolutely worthless. They will not give you ete=
rnal satisfaction. They will only intensify your vanity. They are all intox=
icants of the mind, They will bring misery and mental disturbance. That is =
the reason why Raja Bhartrihari, Raja Gopichand and Lord Buddha deserted th=
eir kingdoms, riches, honors, etc. They treated them as trifles.
