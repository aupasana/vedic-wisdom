Dear ALL,

Namaste.


4) WHOLESOME AND OPTIMUM USAGE: Generally wholesome u=
sage is with reference
to material objects. All those materials that we own=
 and are being used by
us should be maintained aptly and we must ensure tha=
t they are never wasted.
While using materials always keep in mind that if =
you refrain from wasting
them many others who need them can benefit greatly=
. Materials must be
maintained in a wholesome and optimal manner. This is b=
ecause of lack of
proper maintaining will render them prematurely useless a=
nd in some cases
may prove to be dangerous for its user. All these observat=
ions hold cent
percent true for the creation, usage and expenditure of weal=
th. In addition
it is man=92s prime duty to ensure that water and the atmos=
phere remain
unpolluted. Misuse of materials involves lack of apt usage and=
 in the
process destroying them, disallowing others to get their rightful s=
hare and
maintaining them in a very undesirable manner.

Behind the belief =
of looking upon hoarding as sin and charity as a
meritorious deed lies the =
philosophy of abstinence of using materials when
not required to do so and =
disallowing materials from piling up unused in one
place. Piling up materia=
ls for a great length of time induces their rotting.
If we insist on hoardi=
ng things many bad habits and distortions breed in our
minds. The flames of=
 envy are fanned and thus crimes proliferate in society.
Modern socialism a=
nd communist principles agree with this observation. This
can be said to ob=
struct misuse of wealth and instead use it aptly and
optimally.

Today the =
leaders of the corporate world opine that more various goods are
manufactur=
ed (TV, mobiles, computers etc) the more profits will be reaped.
Hence when=
 they produce more goods they lure people into buying them even
when the bu=
yer either does not need it or that it is well beyond his/her
means. Yet ac=
cording to corporate philosophy one will become wealthy and
more comforts c=
an be added to the kitty. USA and other developed nations
vote in favor of =
this philosophy. They do not realize that our globe=92s
natural resources w=
ill deplete perilously and that industrial pollution will
reach alarming le=
vels. (Already everyone is worried about global warming).
Mechanics working=
 with machines overtime tends to face dire health problems.
Excess work wil=
l induce drug abuse and excess alcohol intake. Thus what we
are trying to s=
ay that all this amounts to misuse of materials. The middle
path involves u=
sing technology that does not pollute our globe and that
production targets=
 should be only as much is required by society. In this
manner in compariso=
n to gigantic industries people will get more jobs.
Simple living and not w=
asting materials will obstruct their misuse. Those
materials that remain in=
 excess must be distributed amongst that backward
classes of society especi=
ally those that live below the poverty line. Simple
living must always be c=
onjoined to high thinking. Simplicity not only breeds
a good character but =
that because of it when our time, efforts, intellectual
capacity and wealth=
 gets saved the same can be utilized for world well being
activities. Where=
ver the ideal of wholesome usage of materials proliferates
there hoarding o=
f wealth too will be abstained from. Instead this excess
wealth will be use=
d for activities meant for society=92s well being. This
farsighted thinking=
 can truly be called apt usage of material wealth. It can
also be said to b=
e a gesture of goodwill towards Mother Nature on man=92s
part. Such sacred =
activities must be broadcasted and propagated all over the
world.
