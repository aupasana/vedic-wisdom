On the night of January 30th, the news of Mahatma Gandhi=92s death became
k=
nown everywhere. I heard the news at home only, because women cannot be in
=
the Ashram in the nights. I went at 7-30 next morning. A prayer was being
b=
roadcast over the radio. The news of the death was in the newspapers, and
B=
hagavan reading it and hearing the prayer,said, =93This is the prayer of
pe=
ople who prayed like that throughout his life.=94 The song =93Vaishnava
Jan=
ato=94 was broadcast over the radio and Bhagavan listened to it sadly. At
9=
-45, Bhagavan was about to go out when a newspaper reporter came and
reques=
ted him to give his views on the tragedy so that they might be
published.Bh=
agavan, his voice choked with emotion, said, =93For the Mahatma=92s
death i=
n this tragic manner, every person=92s heart is mourning. What is there
in =
particular that I could say? Who is there who is not grieved? If I say
anyt=
hing, you will publish it and then, one after another, people will come
and=
 ask me. What is the good of it?=94

So saying, Bhagavan sent the reporter =
away and went for his walk. On his
return, =93Vaishnava Janato=94 was again=
 being broadcast and tears fell from
Bhagavan=92s eyes.At 4-30 that afterno=
on, all the ladies began to sing
=93Raghupati Raghava Rajaram=94.With tears=
 in his eyes Bhagavan signed to us to
continue. At 5 o=92clock the conch sh=
ell blew and in view of the Mahatma=92s
death a special arati (waving of li=
ghts) was offered in the Mother=92s temple.
When the sacred ash and vermili=
on powder were brought,Bhagavan took them
with great reverence.

The day be=
fore yesterday, while reading the paper,Bhagavan remarked to
someone sittin=
g near him, =93Look, didn=92t a comet appear some time ago? It is
written i=
n this paper that the death of the Mahatma was due to that. So the
first re=
sult of it is now over.=94

What exactly was in Bhagavan=92s mind when he s=
aid that? Meanwhile, he took up
another paper and on reading it,said, =93Th=
e person who fired the shot, it
seems, came up to the Mahatma and, after bo=
wing down, asked him, =91Why have
you come so late today, Sir?=92 The Mahat=
ma replied that it was due to some
work. The shot was fired immediately aft=
er.=94 Bhagavan then drew a parallel
from the Ramayana, saying,=93It seems =
that after Rama killed Ravana, he forgot
that he,Rama, had to go to Vaikunt=
ha. So the Devatas took counsel among
themselves and then sent Yama, the Go=
d of Death,to him. Yama came in the
garb of an ascetic, and respectfully sa=
id, =91The work for which you have come
is now over; please come to heaven=
=92. This is similar; =91Swaraj has been
obtained; your work is over; why a=
re you still here? Shouldn=92t you go back?
It is already late=92. Thus the=
 Mahatma appears to have been sent away.=94

I asked, =93The story you have=
 just told us is from the Uttara Ramayana, is it
not?=94

Bhagavan: =93Yes,=
 but not only there. It has been written in another book
that, in the case =
of Krishna, the arrow of Vyadha was the cause of His
death; similarly it ha=
ppened with the Mahatma.=94

Yesterday, Harindranath Chattopadhyaya showed =
a photo of Mahatma, and said,
=93It is a pity that there was never any meet=
ing between Gandhi and Bhagavan.=94

Bhagavan: =93Some time ago, he came to=
 Tiruvannamalai.A meeting had been
arranged for him to be held on the road =
around the hill, beyond the Ashram.
People here thought that he would come =
to the Ashram on his way back, but
owing to the pressure of the crowds it w=
as impossible, and he went away
direct to the station. It seems that he ver=
y much regretted this
afterwards. Shankarlal Banker was very keen on bringi=
ng him here, and in
1938, when Rajendra Prasad and Jamnalal Bajaj came here=
 and saw
Skandasramam, they wanted to induce the Mahatma to stay there for =
some
time.But it did not happen. If at Sabarmati, or at Wardha anyone said =
that
he was mentally depressed, the Mahatma used to say, =91Go to Ramanasra=
mam and
come back after a month=92s stay there=92.When Ramaswami Reddiar we=
nt to see the
Mahatma immediately after taking office as Chief Minister, Ma=
dras State,the
Mahatma, it seems, asked him for how long he had been going =
to the
Ramanasramam. When he answered that he had been going there for over=
 thirty
years, the Mahatma said, =91Is that so? I have tried thrice, but so=
 far have
not been able to go there=92. What could he do? How could he come=
 here when he
was not left alone for one moment?=94

Bhagavan read in today=
=92s paper a report to the effect that the Mahatma had
had from a dream the=
 night before the tragedy, a premonition of his death,
and that therefore,h=
e had quickly disposed of his papers which had caused
the delay in his comi=
ng to the prayer. Bhagavan commented, =93Yes. For
enlightened people, will =
there not be that much of premonition? They will
know, but will not tell ot=
hers.=94
