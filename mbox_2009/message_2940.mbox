 =93It is all right. Why not? If one accepts the theory of karma, one will
=
have to accept the theory of astrology and horoscope also.=94

BY DAY WITH BHAGAVAN From the Diary of A. DEVARAJA MUDALIAR

20th September=
, 1948

Questioner: =93Swami! According to astrological science,predictions=
 are made
about coming events, taking into account the influence of the sta=
rs. Is that
true?=94

Bhagavan: =93So long as you have the feeling of egois=
m all that is true. When
that egoism gets destroyed all that is untrue.=94
=

Questioner: =93Does it mean that astrology won=92t be true in the case of =
those
whose egoism is destroyed?=94

Bhagavan: =93Who is there to say it wo=
n=92t be true? There will be seeing only
if there is one who sees. In the c=
ase of those whose egoism is destroyed,
even if they appear to see they do =
not really see. The window is open.

Questioner: =93You say that what is to=
 happen will happen and what is not to
happen will not happen; if that is s=
o, why should it be said that good deeds
must be done?=94

Bhagavan: =93If =
something good is done, it results in happiness. Hence people
say good deed=
s must be done.=94

Questioner: =93Yes. That is why elders say that sorrow =
is adventitious.=94

Bhagavan: =93That is so. Sorrow is adventitious. It is=
 only happiness that is
natural. Every living being desires happiness becau=
se his natural state is
the embodiment of happiness. All sadhanas (spiritua=
l efforts) are for
overcoming adventitious sorrow.
