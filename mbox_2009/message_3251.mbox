Namaste Rajarshi,
=A0
When a being is not established in Brahman, but estab=
lished in duality, such a being has notions of "I" and "others". All intera=
ctions between "I" and "others" impact and refine the conditioning further.=

=A0
The food one takes in, the literature one reads, the words one hears, =
the pictures one sees - all these things add on to one's conditioning and i=
nfluence one to varying degrees.
=A0
You said "I completely agree to Narasi=
mha's explanation of the degree of attachment in plants vs animals". Don't =
you think the gunas of a mind that identified with a body for a long time w=
ill be embedded in the body to some extent? Don't you think the gunas embed=
ded in the food you eat will affect you? In other words, don't you think th=
at eating the body of an animal that has a strong attachment to body, as op=
posed to a plant that does not have the same level of attachment to body as=
 you agreed, will increase the quality of body attachment in you?
=A0
Of co=
urse, this may not be the only factor causing body attachment in you, but t=
his will increase it a little and reinforce it.
=A0

=A0
Why was fasting or eating limited amount of fo=
od recommended for spiritual sadhakas? It is because the internal fire is n=
ot burdened with the task of digesting huge amounts of food. If the interna=
l fire is used up for digestion of physical food, it limits the amount of f=
ire that can be used for other purposes (e.g. digestion of mental food and =
spiritual food).
=A0
One's agni (internal fire) is used for many purposes. =
If you reduce its use for one purpose, it can fulfill another purpose bette=
r. Meat is far more complicated to digest than, let us say, milk and dal-ri=
ce. Using too much fire as jatharaagni to digest meat will limit how well o=
ne can digest the spiritual experiences. Eating meat will most definitely h=
ave an adverse effect on the speed of one's spiritual progress.
=A0
Why is =
one's alertness adversely affected a little immediately after a large meal?=
 It is because most of the internal fire is diverted to the stomach for dig=
esting the food. Limited fire is available for mental digestion in such cas=
es.
=A0
After taking the physical and mental needs into account, the amount=
 of internal fire left from *spiritual* transformation is usually so little=
 in people that one needs to conserve fire from other activities to increas=
e the fire available for spiritual transformation. Eating simple food is a =
great idea.

=A0
Legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar scored a sublime century with a te=
rrible backache. If you hypothesize that a broken back is not problem in ba=
tting, you are wrong. People with terrible back aches hardly score centurie=
s. Tendulkar was an exception rather than the rule. There may be yogis who =
can remain fully saattwik and focus their mind on god always, even when eat=
ing meat or drinking wine or having sex. But, one cannot emulate them easil=
y. While developing focus on god, it is good to give up some things.
=A0
It=
 is not without reason that tradition recommends vegetarianism to spiritual=
 seekers. In fact, not only eat vegetarian food, but eat vegetarian food th=
at is simple, easy to digest and saattwik, in order to maximize your spirit=

      Namaste Naras=
imha/Utpal and others,
=A0
Just a few point I would like to mention after g=
oing through most of the posts in this thread.
=A0
I completely agree to Na=
rasimha's explanation of the degree of attachment in plants vs animals. Als=
o I agree to the point that a meat eater, if he were to eat veg food for so=
me months while reading the scriptures would feel spiritually benefited. On=
e year back I had tried it for 108 days and I definitely felt some positive=
=A0effects like a sense of purity of the mind.
=A0
Narasimha said:
=A0
Eati=
ng meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification with bo=
dy and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating=
 flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality of bo=
dy attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual=
 progress.
=A0
With due respect to everyone, I am not=A0convinced of the ab=
ove lines though I agree that for a meat eater, turning vegetarian is spiri=
tually beneficial. I have a different explanation. A meat eater is basicall=
y addicted to the taste of meat. When he forgoes the same, it requires a de=
gree of will-power and a conscious sense of direction in the mind. Like ove=
rcoming any addiction with a clear sense of purpose that I am doing it to h=
elp me spiritually benefit. This in turn, when successfully done, creates a=
 sense of purity in the mind. The reason for the purity is not so much abou=
t eating veg food, but more due to the mental force created by conscious ab=
stinence from non veg food. 
=A0
Similarly, a regular=A0vegeterian, if he o=
r she were to shift to a diet of ONLY milk and fruits for some months=A0- w=
hich is not his staple diet -=A0 would feel a similar effect. As I see it, =
generation of will power is teh first conscinous effect of the=A0beauty of =
sadhana. This sense of mental purity maybe - I am not sure - related to the=
 generation of more bhutaagni. That which jolts you out of your normal regu=
larized habits will create a force in the mind which is beneficial.
=A0
Spe=
aking of ego, for an average man not engaging in any specific spiritual=A0p=
ursuit (sadhana), I have really not encountered any difference between peop=
le who are strict vegeterians from birth or people who have an omnivorous d=
iet. That is why I am not at all convinced that an omnivorous diet for an n=
ormal human being blocks or aids him in any way any more than a vegeterian =
diet does. =A0BUT abstinence in any form and any degree,=A0is=A0a GREAT too=
l for spiritual benefit.
=A0
I hope I expressed my view point clearly.
=A0
=
Dear Utpal,
=A0
Do not think that I'll be offended or misunderstand you to =
be a cruel hearted etc...
=A0
Thanks!:)
=A0
Vegterianism is related to Comp=
ession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)
against Adharama (Killing Inn=
ocent creatures).
=A0
I get what you mean thought I do see dharma/adharma t=
hat way. 
=A0
your second Para and some writings in your earlier message gi=
ves me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal et=
c... does not appeal me. to be very honest.=A0
=A0
In my opinon, if one can=
 justify eating=A0popular meat of=A0chicken, etc..=A0then anything under th=
e Sun is eatable.=A0 with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, =
Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have sta=
rted eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as=
 per the 'their' thinking.
=A0
To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture=
=A0etc..., and=A0try to=A0make quality judgements by the logic of 'Direct k=
illing' and 'eating meat of already dead' does not go well with me.=A0it is=

I guess I will just have to=A0agree t=

=A0

=A0
=A0
One m=
ore=A0point I would like to question. Some of the other mails mentioned tha=
t people (non-vegeterians)=A0should get out of the 'addiction' of taste for=
 non-veg. While I agree that non-veg food is addictive to one who eats it, =
I would like to ask, is not vegeterian food addictive to one who is a thoro=
ugh bred vegetarian? Or are we implying that those who eat veg food - veget=
erains by birth - are not 'addicted' to food at all, and do not enjoy the f=
ood they eat? 
=A0
Ordinary we are all addicted to food, veg or non-veg, an=
d eat for our palates as much as for our stomachs, or so I thought.

Namaste,

I have been extremely busy at work=
 for a while now and will continue to be, working long hours everyday. I ju=
st saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.
=

* * *

Self-identification of human beings and animals with body and body =
parts is much much stronger and denser than that of plants and trees. Self-=
identification of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or=
 fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion experienced =
by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut off in an an=
imal or a human being, the emotion experienced is much stronger. Even after=
 death, an animal may identify with the body and think of it as "I".

The k=
aarmik debt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal's min=
d considers as a part of "I" and is highly attached to, is much bigger than=
 the kaarmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a
 plant=
 or a tree or killing bacteria.

As long as we live in a physical body, cre=
ation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the deb=
ts we create newly.

* * *

You are what you eat. Our body and various chem=
icals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.

Meat is highly t=
aamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identific=
ation with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if =
one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the =
quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive=
 to spiritual progress.

* * *

It is possible that a spiritual giant from =
past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy to e=
mulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the body =
and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simple veg=
etables, fruits, greens,
 grains etc with mild spices).

If a meat-eating p=
erson stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals=
 (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual literatur=
e and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes a big d=
ifference.

* * *

Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked de=
er for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misguided propa=
ganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes from classi=
cs or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored.

Swami =
Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to be mo=
re pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. It is w=
rong to attribute to them support of meat eating.

Best regards,
Narasimha

ioned that people (non-vegeterians) should get out of the 'addiction' =
of taste for non-veg. While I agree that non-veg food is addictive to one w=
ho eats it, I would like to ask, is not vegeterian food addictive to one wh=
o is a thorough bred vegetarian? Or are we implying that those who eat veg =
food - vegeterains by birth - are not 'addicted' to food at all, and do not=
 enjoy the food they eat? </div>

<div>Ordinary we are all=
 addicted to food, veg or non-veg, and eat for our palates as much as for o=

<div>Namaste,<br><br>I have bee=
n extremely busy at work for a while now and will continue to be, working l=
ong hours everyday. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. J=
ust a few quick points.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Self-identification of human be=
ings and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and denser =
than that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and trees is v=
ery subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a pla=
nt or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand=
, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion expe=
rienced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with the=
 body and think of it as "I".<br><br>The kaarmik debt formed by eating the =
flesh of an animal, which the animal's mind considers as a part of "I" and =
is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eatin=
g leaves, vegetables or fruits of a
 plant or a tree or killing bacteria.<b=
r><br>As long as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts =
is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.<br><br>=
* * *<br><br>You are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormo=
nes in it are formed based on what we eat.<br><br>Meat is highly taamasik. =
Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification wit=
h body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is ea=
ting flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality o=
f body attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiri=
tual progress.<br><br>* * *<br><br>It is possible that a spiritual giant fr=
om past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy t=
o emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the bo=
dy and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simple =
vegetables, fruits, greens,
 grains etc with mild spices).<br><br>If a meat=
-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and len=
tils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual =
literature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it make=
s a big difference.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked =
fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a l=
ot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specif=
ic quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are =
best ignored.<br><br>Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clari=
on call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not r=
equire eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating=
