Elders do tell Sanskrit is mother of many languages. I do believe in 
this.=
 How ever, this is my belief and hence I can not convince other 
on validit=
y of such a claim. The follow verse (in Sankrit) claims the 
status for San=
skrit:
divyam, bhavyam, subodham cha, suddham artha pradayinim
jananeem bah=
u bhashaNam vandae girvaNa bharateem

Best regards,
Vijay
