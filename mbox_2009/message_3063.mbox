 Sri Ramakrishna said that once a doll, made of salt, wanted to measure the
depth of the ocean; but no sooner did it touch the water than it melted in
the ocean. How could it tell about the depth?Similarly, neither the mind nor
words can express the real nature of God when the aspirant has merged in
Him. A text of the Vedas says: "The words come back with the mind vainly
trying to express what Truth is."
