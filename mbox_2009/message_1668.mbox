Namaste

There is definately more to samputikarana, one can also do whole s=
lokas. These are secret ways mastered by our saints due to sadhana

This is=
 also true for reading other granths or other things like sunderkand recita=
tion or ramayan recitation etc.

I have read one book as follows:

Pronunci=
ation and the Chandi Samputs


By Swamiji and Shree Maa
Pronunciation and t=
he Chandi Samputs contains a collection of stories about sadhus' chanting, =
and about the constituent ingredients of intention, motivation, sincerity, =
attention, bhava, and understanding. It shares an outline of the history of=
 Sanskrit literature, and details the origins of transliteration into Roman=
 characters. It discusses the various styles of chanting among sadhus, and =
describes the differences in the alphabets of the differing languages of In=
dia . Then it details the Sadhana of the Chandi: different ways of chanting=
 for different purposes. Ultimately it defines many of the Chandi Samputs, =
and describes the siddhis for which each would be employed.
It's a small bo=
ok, a simple book, but I think it is very important for students of Sanskri=
t. 


Other books from the same authors are also very good
Their Chandi Paa=
th book is very meticulously written with a good process to read the Chandi=
 Paath.

If there are other books please share here too.

Best Regards

 You can note that each chapter in Chandipath is also enclosed with plain O=
