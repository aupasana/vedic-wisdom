kend if you put some notes or advises to young spiritual aspirants here abo=
ut the problems that can arise for a sadhaka and how to overcome them from =
the very basic level to gradually advance levels it wil be highly beneficia=
l to the spiritual community and specially to young aspirants like me and t=
o those who have yet not got a Guru but are striving in the path.I understa=
nd that it would not be possible to disclose all details of sadhana on the =
net still whatever comes from your side and specially Manishji I think will=
 be highly beneficial.If Manishji permises i will request you Narasimhaji t=
o give it a GO.
