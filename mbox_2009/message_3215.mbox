Dear Rajarshi,

As you have said, Most of these are sure shot arguments fro=
m the people who eat Meat/fish. But I have often feel that they are themsel=
ves are not convinced when they argue. they are 'hollow' arguments. However=
 , I'll honestly say that i have no answers for 'life in a Plant'.

The peo=
ple who argue such as': Most eat meat in the world, Egg is vegetarian, Plan=
t also has life, One will not get required nourishments only with vegetaria=
n food, If we don't eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will =
be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if everybody will =
become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put up such arguments to =
defend however as i said earlier they are themselves not convinced.

Vegete=
rian people have their own arguments but all these are mere arguments. I pe=
rsonally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its =
pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cuttin=
g of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so=
 cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the h=
umans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which c=
omes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don't hav=
e proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). an=
d then the dead fish thus is so tasty.

The bottom line is that "They canno=
t overcome" the cravings for the meat, fish and eggs. This is a naked reali=
ty.

Dear Rajarshi, However i try, i am not convinced with arguments in fav=
our of Nonveg food. Only at the cold places and deserts where survival was =
the main consideration, i can slightly agree but that too during ancient da=
ys. not now...Now everywhere Veg food is easily available.

***
Few months =
back, a young girl from Germany came to work in my office for 6 months. onc=
e i casually asked her as to what she eats during lunch. what she said was =
not at all expected. she said that she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg=
 food since 3 years now and wants to continue that way whole life. As expec=
ted, i was very happy and i further asked the reason. The answer she gave s=
o much happiness. She said that She does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I sa=
lute her from my heart.

Best Regards,

Utpal
