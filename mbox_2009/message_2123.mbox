Namaste Alok,

You are right. My mistake. Nirriti is Southwest and that was=
 what I meant. Sorry for the confusion. Nirriti is SouthWest.

Apologies.

can use a small piece of dharbha for doing so and put it in the reject bowl=
 which is usually kept in the south east direction. Can you confirm if that=
 priest wasn't facing North, in which case the left shoulder would be South=
east or Nirritti direction.

I ask because I noticed a priest in our local tempple throw it over his lef=
