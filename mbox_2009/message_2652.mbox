Dear Everyone,

I want to share something, I think it would be helpful for =
others too...

There is a specific mantra finding ISHTA DEVATA, I have test=
ed the mantra few months before, it was written that if someone practice si=
ncere japa that mantra for 15 minutes, his/her ISHTA DEVATA will show himse=
lf/herself in dreams within 7 days...

He was the deity with four hands app=
earing from four corners of the room - in my dream...it clearly indicates L=
ORD VISHNU in his NARASIMHA rupa...

two days before P.V.R ji suggest my IS=
HTA DEVATA as SRI LAKSHMI NARASIMHA through my chart...it proves the mantra=
 works perfectly...

but the main problem is that I have lost the mantra, I=
 cannot even remember the book where the mantra is written...I am searching=
 hard for few days...but remains unsuccessful...

If anyone knows the mantr=
a, please share to know...It would be a great help...

best regards
Biswaji=
