incidently, a=
 month back, one of my colleagues by name Ramesh 
Venkatraman, deicided to =
do Homa at his residence. He has his own 
traditional way of doing Homam wh=
ich he had learnt from his father. 
He complained me that it is difficult t=
o perform homa in small flats 
in Dubai because of the amount of smoke whic=
h is generated by the 
wood. I stressed on Dry Coconut and gave my example.=
 i pressed him 
to use 'dry coconut' for his planned homa. As the thing tur=
ned out 
very well for him by using Dry coconut and he later told us that 
=
Homam went very well with Dry coconut. 'Thanks to Utpal' - i 
instantly sai=
d, say thanks to Garu! i am just a postman :)

on a lighter note-There is a=
 lovely Store here, which keeps all 
traditional Indian Items. You'll get a=
lmost everything including Dry 
Coconut Halves (As well as full dry coconut=
). When i started 
frequenting that store for purchasing 1 or 2 kg of Dry C=
oconut twice 
a week, they were very suprised. one day they asked me as to =
what i 
am doing with this dry coconut. i said 'Havan' - looked at me as if=
 
looking at some person from a different planet :(


jovial regards,

Utpa=
