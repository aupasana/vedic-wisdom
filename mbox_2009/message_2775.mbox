Namaste,

There is no thumbrule. Spend AS MUCH time as you can, on spiritual sadhana.

Apart from the time you spend in formal spiritual sadhana, try to make every 
activity of life a sadhana. Consider what you do to others around you as an 
offering to the Lord who came in the form of those people. Consider what 
others do to you as a blessing from the lord. Give whatever you can to 
others, but do not expect much from others. Happily and gratefully receive 
whatever you get from others. Take this human life as an opportunity to give 
and pay off debts, rather than taking things from others. Never expect 
anything for yourself.

Always remember that you are not this body or the mind in it. The tendency 
to be happy about some things and sad about some things is the cause of many 
problems. Try to be balanced, keep reminding yourself now and then that you 
are not the body or the mind, and not let things done to your body or ideas 
in the mind make you overly happy or sad. All sadhana is meant for getting 
control over emotions and reach a state of equanimity of the mind.

Out of various forms of spiritual sadhana I know, homam is the best. Fire is 
living god and known as the purifier. Invoking gods in fire and chanting 
mantras in front of fire while making offerings is a great practice. Such 
fire worship was a key part of several ancient religions. We are acting on a 
specific command from the divine Mother to my spiritual guru Dr Manish 
Pandit 3.5 years back, to spread simple homam procedures for various deities 
around the world.

Best regards,
Narasimha
