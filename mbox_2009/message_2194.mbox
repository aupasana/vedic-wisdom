Dear Narayanji
=A0
Thanks for the info, I have a Giri trading near where I =
live in Dombvili. Thanks once again!
=A0
-Regards

The upsurg=

Namaste Rajar=
shi ji,

Yes, there are differences between the Gita Press & RK publication=
s. Manishi Panditji asked me to stick to the Gita Press version.

Regarding=
 the mp3, you can get the CD from Giri Trading (branches in Matunga, Mylapo=
re, Malleshwaram) or any place which sells South Indian/Tamil devotional CD=
's.

Regards
Narayan

As you said, the words are really difficult to pronounce. Is the audio of S=

d also like to add that I was able to reduce the time by practicing it regu=
larly and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaushik's D=
urga Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has a great=
 voice, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can pause and repeat =
it. I tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast for my li=
king.
