 Live in the world like a dead leaf. As a dead leaf is carried by the wind
into a house or on the roadside and has no choice of its own, so let the
wind of Divine Will blow you wherever it chooses. Now it has placed you in
the world, be contented. Again when it will carry you to a better place, be
equally resigned.

The Lord has kept you in the world, what can you do? Resign everything to
Him, even your own dear self; then all trouble will be over. You will see
then that He is doing everything; everywhere is the will of Rama [**]
(God).
