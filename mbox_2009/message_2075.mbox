namaste everybody,

the thought that the future is already present / in the=
 present / past / in the past is a very interesting thought indeed. it is t=
here in some of our ancient books also (particular reference to the stories=
 in yoga vashista like those of Lila or Shukracharya (?)...or stories where=
 u travel in time and space to come back to the same square one). 

maybe t=
here are many dimensions in space and time as our modern physics talks of..=
.or as vijyaji said, future may have already happened.

if time is maya / b=
orn of dualism then absence of time or stillness of time must be of the abs=
olute. now if our little boy in the event which narasimha ji described coul=
d have glimpsed the absolute / the avatars of vishnu, then surely time woul=
d have stood still...the future merged with the present.

as to where free =
will comes into this, my 2 paisa on this, borne out of flight of fantasy is=
 that the only thing we can do is act. the more we act out of free will, aw=
areness, the more free we become. the more we act out of compulsion / vasan=
ayas, the more tightly destiny binds us. destiny is nothing but reduced deg=
rees of freedom to act with consciousness. 

so if we are to overcome desti=
ny we should always act with awareness / excercise free will.

but i know t=
his is mere theorising...for the sake of discussion???!!!
