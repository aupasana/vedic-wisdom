Left represent the Ida nadi and right represent the pingal na=
di. There could be some significant of why we should use right hand.

How e=
ver, coming to small % being left handed - It is subjective. You will see m=
ore left handers in western world. To a large extent it is the prejudice th=
at controls the %. In India, we see left handedness as a problem and hence =
the parents/teachers curb the instinct at early ages and hence the % low.
