Namaste,
 
I mentioned my guru Dr Manish Pandit and the command of the Divi=
ne Mother when she appeared before him in March 2006 regarding teaching sim=
ple homam procedures to people. I want to mention a small story about his p=
ast. This is an incident that had a profound impact on his spiritual evolut=
ion in this life.
 
*        *        *
 
When Manish was young, he was not=
 exactly spiritual. His mother was highly spiritual and religious and he na=
turally knew some prayers, but did not do much spiritual sadhana. He would =
race motor bikes outside Pune with friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.=

 
When in college, he got bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to =
go to college oneday to fight and increase his marks. When he was about to =
leave house, a teenaged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good tejas in =
face came to his house. He asked Manish where he was going. He then said, "=
do not go out today. Going out today will ruin your life. Just stay home an=
d think of god. I will make sure that your marks with be increased. Leave i=
t to me and don't worry about it." He then strongly suggested to Manish tha=
t he should wear a diamond ring on his right hand index finger and it would=
 change his life. Interestingly, Manish has Meena lagna and Venus is a male=
fic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th house) with 3 other planets, peo=
ple would normally avoid diamond in this case to be safe. Moreover, most pe=
ople do not put diamond on index finger, which is associated with Jupiter, =
an enemy of Venus. So nobody would normally recommend him diamond, that too=
 on the index finger. This is an unusual suggestion.
 
That brahmin boy the=
n asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand and said that this ac=
t would do him good. There was no tea at their house and Manish fed him som=
e sugar. He ate it and left after saying, "when you come to Shirdi next, co=
me to so and so room in so and so place. That is where I live. Also, I need=
 to give a glass of water to your mother. Please come to Shirdi with her."
=
 
*        *        *
 
Barely a minute after he left, Manish had a questio=
n and ran to the door of his compound wall. He found no person in orange cl=
othes walking on the road. He asked the persons standing outside whether th=
ey could tell him in which direction a person who came out of the house in =
orange clothes had gone. They said nobody went in or came out of the house =
in an hour. Manish went around the area to check if anybody saw a young Bra=
hmin in orange clothes. Nobody in that area saw anyone like that. So this s=
eemed like a miracle. Manish was puzzled.
 
Later his marks in the exam wer=
e automatically increased and his problem was solved by itself, without his=
 doing anything.
 
*        *        *
 
A few months later, they went to S=
hirdi. They wanted to meet that young Brahmin. They went to the place he me=
ntioned. Manish's mother was waiting downstairs and they went upstairs to t=
he room number mentioned by him to find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody=
 in that room and there was a life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wal=
l. When they asked, they were told that that room had always been empty and=
 only the picture was there. Nobody ever lived in that room.
 
When they ca=
me downstairs, Manish's mother told them that she suddenly became very thir=
sty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink some water from h=
is hands and left in a hurry.
 
*        *        *
 
After this, Manish di=
d buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine visitor and wore it on his =
right hand index finger. He still wears it. Perhaps wearing a strong moksha=
 trikona lord's gem on the moksha finger (the four fingers represent the 4 =
purusharthas and thumb shows self) strengthens moksha trikona. Though this =
was an unusual (and risky) suggestion, perhaps this is very appropriate in =
this case for spiritual progress.
 
Soon after this, another miraculous inc=
ident involving a deity happened, which I do not want to mention now. Then =
started his spiritual transformation. Manish became very serious about spir=
itual sadhana after that and started spending many hours everyday in spirit=
ual sadhana. He had visions - internal and external - of many deities and s=
pecial beings, including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many experiences. His=
 life changed completely after this experience.
 
*        *        *
 
Tod=
ay many people do not believe that miraculous and magical things can happen=
. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints like Sai Baba, Raghavend=
ra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Mahavatar Babaji, Jnanes=
hwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained in rational thinking assume that=
 the stories are made up by someone. Healthy skepticism is justified becaus=
e many fake people are there today, who abuse people's faith. However, abso=
lute cynicism is wrong. Such things are possible.
 
But one word on miracle=
s and siddhis. Miracles and siddhis are secondary to self-realization. The =
important thing is to do spiritual sadhana, realize self, and live as a lib=
erated person (jeevanmukta) continuing to discharge the job assigned to one=
 by Nature, with an equanimous mind and neither attraction nor repulsion to=
 anything. Nature assigns different jobs to different persons. Personalitie=
s like Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi, Raghavendra Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ram=
anujacharya, Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did different jobs on this eart=
h, but what is common between them is that they completely overcame their l=
imited personalities, became realized and then went on to fulfill the tasks=
 given to them by the Power that runs the universe, with an equanimous mind=
.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
