Namaste,

Answer to mail 1:

Yes, Sri Sooktam is from Rigveda.

All vedic prayers are for self-realization only. No vedic prayer has any 
other ultimate purpose. But different mantras take one on a different path 
to that realization. Even though a mountain may have a single cliff, there 
may be different paths leading to it.

Sadhana with Sri Sooktam makes one experience wellness, prosperity and 
happiness and realize self through the happiness all around one.

In any case, there are hardly any people now who can make veda mantras work. 
Ideally, veda mantras are far more powerful than naama mantras, beeja 
mantras and shlokas. However, in this age, veda mantras also work similar to 
other mantras (for most of us anyway). After all, when people not knowing 
how to shoot a gun have guns in their hands, they may use a gun like a 
stick. When faced with an enemy, one may beat up an enemy with the stick or 
gun in one's hand. To such a person, a gun and a stick may have no 
difference. Of course, still one may feel more comfortable and confident 
holding a gun in hand.

IMHO, the exact results attributed to each sooktam are irrelevant to you. 
Just pick the one you feel attracted to and read it with sincerity and 
devotion. Accept whatever result god gives.

Answer to mail 2:

The first 15 riks are the main sooktam. The next riks are added later with 
the results etc. For example, the 16th verse says that one who does homam 
with ghee using the 15 riks gets prosperity. All those verses are not 
needed. Repeating the 15 verses is sufficient. Some people add the "om 
mahaadevyai cha vidmahe.." from the end and make it 16 aahutis. That is what 
I suggest.

Best regards,
Narasimha
