Dear Utpal,

Maharshi Parasara, father of Maharshi Vyasa, wrote a treatise on Jyotisha 
shastra just before Kali yuga started. He referred in it a few times to the 
"intellectual pygmies of Kali yuga" and gave techniques suitable for 
astrologers of Kali yuga. Thus, he was conscious of impending Kali yuga and 
that was on his in mind as he taught. In the chapters on remedial measures 
to overcome karmic problems (as represented by planets and horoscope), he 
basically referred to various kinds of homas. Though some people may insist 
on japam (meditation) today, Parasara only referred to offering mantras in 
homam fire. He was not specific on poorvaangam (initial offerings) and 
uttaraangam (final offerings) to be used and asked to use whatever 
agnimukham (fire ritual procedure) is practiced in the family or by one's 
gurus. But he was specific on the mantras to be offered in fire for various 
deities.

Obviously, Parasara did not advise japam (meditation) of various mantras and 
instead advised homam (fire ritual) with various mantras, for a reason. He 
knew that the latter is *far more effective* in Kali yuga.

*        *        *

The goal of sadhana is to burn impurities in the subtle body (synonymous to 
overcoming various internal enemies and weaknesses) so that energy can flow 
freely within one's subtle body. The internal fire (bhootaagni) burning 
within us does this burning. When you focus your mind on a mantra, 
bhootaagni burns and starts acting.

However, the ability of *most* people to focus the mind is highly limited. 
The bhootaagni is extremely low in most people. Thus, meditation of mantras 
even in counts of millions does not make much difference really. There is an 
impact only if one spends 4-5 hours meditating on the mantra everyday. The 
first hour or so is warm up, mind slowly achieves a decent focus after that 
and the fire starts to burn slowly.

If you do the same meditation in front of an external fire, it makes a big 
difference. You tend to absorb some qualities from the people you spend time 
with. When you spend a lot of time with a cinema fan, the cinema fan inside 
you becomes strong. When you spend a lot of time with a politics observer, 
the politics observer inside you becomes strong. Similarly, when you spend a 
lot of time with fire, the fire inside you becomes strong.

If you do a 30-min homam and spend just 10 minutes meditating by the fire 
after homam, the energy surrounding you, the level of focus you can get and 
the amount of impurities you can burn are much more than a regular 
meditation for a couple of hours!

*        *        *

One need not believe me. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. If 
anybody tries to do a 30-minute homam everyday (or atleast every weekend) 
for a few months, one should find some difference internally.

Mahaganapathi homam is very apt for many people. Lord Ganapathi takes care 
of one's material needs and gives spiritual progress at the same time. A 
detailed manual, an audio MP3 file and a complete youtube video of a simple 
20-min Mahaganapathi homam are available for free, so that people can learn 
and get started (see the link below).

*        *        *

It is not without a reason that many sadhus (saints) maintain a dhuni 
(constant fire) near them. When at Dakshineshwar, Swami Vivekananda used to 
light a big fire in open space that would burn throughout the night and he 
used to meditate by it whole night.

If one can actually spend a couple of hours meditating by the side of a 
bright fire everyday, I am sure they can make a lot of quick progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
