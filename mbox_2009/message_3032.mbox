Namaste,
 
Utpal reminded me that I did not answer his question in
 
http:/=
/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2741
 
1) Yes.
 
2) Nirvikalpa=
 means without creational variety. Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state where one =
does not perceive multitude of objects and creational variety. Chitta may s=
till have some accumulated conditioning left. If that is small enough, aham=
kara may have been allowed to merge in supreme consciousness. But, like a c=
ompressed spring expanding, vanished ahamkara (individualized I-ness) may c=
ome back in a little time.
 
When conditioning is small enough, one can be =
in nirvikalpa samadhi for long enough. If that happens, that wipes out the =
little conditioning left in chitta. One will then merge in Brahman for ever=
. As Ramakrishna said, some special souls may come back to duality after co=
nditioning is completely wiped out.
 
Normally, it is thought that one stay=
ing in nirvikalpa samadhi for a few days is unlikely to come back. However,=
 Ramakrishna was in that state for 6 months and came back.
 
Best regards,
=
Narasimha

e.g. 5 jnaanendriyas, 5 karmendriyas, 5 praanas, manas, buddhi and chitta. =
However, ahamkaara is not identifying with *anything*, not even with a mani=

consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras down=
wards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fir=
e, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element withi=

 self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element withi=

 self-awareness. And so on.

 etc, don't just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth elem=
ent shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fl=
uid state of existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular t=
hing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state an=
d made of earth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. =
a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water eleme=
nt. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five ele=
ments.

nks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart fr=
om the physical aspect, one may think of "I" as someone who has certain qua=
lities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has a=
bout who one is, form one's self-awareness and Kundalini represents that se=
lf-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* tha=
t is *solid* in nature within one's cumulative idea of who one is is still =
remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* tha=

s is still remaining. And so on.

merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may stil=

 there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a so=
lid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kunda=
lini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one's cumulative idea=

 Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted with the chaos, it produced some univer=
sal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities like Sh=
iva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the "Vidyut" of vayu ( none of these are the=

 the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agn=

ting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible =
states of energy.

 the only way to know this for sure. And so also for everything else that i=
s below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do=
 read about them (all these things e.g Atma etc), and about the significanc=

 in a he-said/she- said type game (if perhaps that is what you were hinting=
 at?). I am extremely curious as to why there is an order and not a paralle=
