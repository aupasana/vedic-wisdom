<div><font face=3D=

<div>Regarding Homam - will it not d=

 and my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta will be Shiva(Sun), Palan de=

anada. </div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<di=
v>Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME of shiva and =
ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It's a difficult to describe feeling=
 -=C2=A0it's as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me.=C2=
=A0Recently, I went to a=C2=A0shani( w/Hanuman=C2=A0& Ganesha)=C2=A0tem=

ese facts on choosing the homam? Is it just the play of my mind to be ignor=

<div>Or </=

<div>if=C2=A0Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting point before we go ah=

ancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? </div>

<div><font fa=
ce=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituali=
ty and materialism two poles apart (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd=
 like to reach the heights of professional success in my career, Am I doome=
d not to become a good spiritualist (???)? or, If I want to become self-act=
ualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop planning to climb the professio=
nal ladder? I do understand about "Limited Bandwidth" issue - but=
, then I also read about King Janak. Can I combine these two - if yes, how?=
</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>
<div=
>c) Getting even more confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation i=
s our=C2=A0spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - sh=
ould our goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play=
. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and tryin=
g to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God's=
 scheme of things by trying to get out of the scheme? </div>

<div><font fa=
ce=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>d) Or, Is it part of God&#=
39;s scheme to put us in this "maya" first and then ask us to get=
 out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be p=
laying=C2=A0"rats in the maze" game. Then, why??</div>

<div><fon=
t face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>e) Sometimes, I also t=
hink that all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-schoo=
l kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying=
 about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Em=
ancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thi=
nking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experie=
nce more till we are ready (for what?)</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" siz=
e=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual jour=
ney? where/how do we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - b=
ut is that the right way? or there is another way. Probably, there are many=
 ways - then how do I choose my way? An "user guide" or " sp=
irituality for dummies" book=C2=A0 would have been useful. Do we have =
one?</div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</div>
<div>I=
 will appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, p=
robably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget about arti=
culating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))</di=
