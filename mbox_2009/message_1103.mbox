Namaste,
 
If you can have a stable, balanced and saattwik mental state wit=
hout taking bath, then a bath is not necessary.
 
But, as you said, tamogun=
a takes over the mind after a day's work. Most people will benefit from tak=
ing a bath in that situation and reach a better state of mind.
 
While I am=
 not for making strict rules, I believe that a bath will be advisable for m=
ost people when doing homam in the evening after work.
 
Best regards,
Nara=
simha

        Respected Narasimhaji,
   =
     Namaskaaram !!!

        If I may interject- Dr.Ashwin Rawalji is (lik=
e me) wanting to know that is it acceptable to do MahaGanapathi Homam at ni=
ght after washing hands and feet-that is without taking a regular bath and =
just washing face,hand and feet as a quick measure. Me,too, am interested i=
n having clarity on the evening Bath and change of fresh set of cloths.Thou=
gh I do prefer to take bath and change into fresh cloths-this takes easily =
10-15 minutes and after a working day-sometimes the Tamo guna takes over th=
e mind ...
        As you have been repeatedly stressing-the real purpose i=
s to have deflated ego and pavtira bhava in surrendering to the Deity, I re=
quest clarity on the criticality of bathing for evening Homam.

        Hum=
ble regards,
        amit

          Namaste Sir,

          When you do a ritual li=
ke homam or just meditate with a mantra, it generates a spiritual energy ar=
ound your being. Different mantras and different homas generate different k=
inds of energy. I was pointing out that Chandi homam tends to generate diff=
erent kinds of energy at daytime and night time. Energy tapped by Chandi ho=
mam at night is likely to be more fierce and raw.

          If one has a s=
ubtle perception, one may be able to perceive this energy. If one is ready =
to be absorbed in that energy and let it purify one, one will benefit from =
it. But, some may be scared or otherwise put off by it.

          So I rec=
ommend doing Chandi homam in the daytime only.

          But, I see no iss=
ues with doing Mahaganapathi homam in the night.

          Best regards,
 =
         Narasimha

        Namaste,

                    Yes, Mahaganapathi homam can be perfo=
rmed in the night too. In fact, the most pleasant Mahaganapathi homam I hav=
e ever attended was performed in the back yard of a priest's house, right n=
ext to a river, on a night. I practically know that it is perfectly fine to=
 do Maha Ganapathi homam in the night and the energy generated is still ple=
asant and saattwik.

                    However, if you do Chandi homam, m=
y advice is to do it in daytime, atleast in the beginning. The energy that =
manifests is different at night than at daytime, especially with Chandi hom=
am. If you are unable to perceive that energy, then there is no problem and=
 no difference between day and night. But, if you are able to perceive that=
 fierce energy and if it scares you, that may be bad. Thus, it is better in=
 the beginning to do Chandi homam during the daytime.

                    =
For Lakshmi homam also, daytime is preferred. But night is also acceptable.=


                    Other homas are ok anytime.

                    Best=
 regards,
                    Narasimha

           I am glad to know that. With practice, it will become smooth and=
 you can

 =
                             When priests perform homam on a grand scale, t=
hey distribute the tasks among 
                              them. If you =
do on a smaller scale by yourself, you can do everything by 
              =
                yourself. In fact, the latter is better.

                 =
             In fact, even when many priests do it together with one fire, =
it is good to 
                              have one person managing the f=
ire and offerings. If one chants, one prepares 
                           =
   and chooses offerings and one finally makes the offerings in the fire, t=
hat 
                              is better than everybody making differen=
t offerings in fire. Ideally, the 
                              contact wi=
th fire should be from one person. Of course, if each has a 
              =
                separate homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.

    =
                          Never think in terms of keeping the positive vibr=

                              within your house. Fir=

                   =
           to maintain dharma in this universe and promote creation and sus=

                              homam thinking that you are doin=

                              =
motives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping nature, nature WILL
