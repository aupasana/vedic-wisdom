Namaste friends,

I revisited some of my communications with my Guru. i st=
arted with my
first Ganapati Havan on the first day of last Navaraatri. som=
e useful
extract from my message to narasimha is as below:

[Y'day Maha Gan=
apati homam was a Starting point on a Starting Day of
>Navaraatri. It was a=
ll Krishnaarpanam. so how to say *I* performed?
>>(As thakur says, this Ras=
cal I never dies :-) it took me 2 hours.
>(excluding preparation & winding =
up)]


Now the same procedure takes me around 1 hour including preparations=
.

My message to my Guru about Chandi Homam ( one year back i.e. last
navar=
atri):

[Today chandi Homam took 3 hours 45 minutes even though i am very f=
luent
in Chandi paath and quite comfortable with Devanagari.I think with
Ka=
vacha, Argalaaadi, it is very dificult to complete in  3 hours. let me
see =
how can it be planned.]

Now i am able to perform the same procedure (full =
as per manual) in 2
and Half hours.

I reproduced it so that it might help =
for the aspirants who wish to
start but worried about time management.

Wis=
h you all a very spiritual Navaraatri. may mother Durga start taking
note o=
f her children who are deparate to become purer.

Regards,

Utpal
