Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Internal god and ext=
ernal god (R: Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam)

=A0 
Dear Rajarshi,
=
=A0
You have a knack for asking important questions, that sound simple but =
touch upon deep issues.
=A0
> I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I=
 just bringing out the
> energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there =
one single, universal,
> omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists =
in the universe, and
> I am trying to invite him into the fire?
=A0
Terms l=
ike internal god and external god are just a manner of speaking, for easy=
=A0understanding and simplification of concepts. In reality, a deity existi=
ng microcosmically "inside" you, a deity existing microcosmically inside me=
, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else and a deity existing=
 "externally" in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and there is =
absolutely no difference between all of them! That is essentially the Upani=
shadic understanding.
=A0
In fact, when you say "inside me", ask yourself :=
 "what is this I"? Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it th=
e causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physical body, =
it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. When mind =
entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of =
a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is=
 a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I.=
 When mind finally overcomes all such notions one after the other, it may l=
ook at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upan=
ishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmi=
c being. Thus, expressions like "inside me", "inside you" and "inside him" =
are just expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. There=
 is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
When you have a conditio=
ned mind, which has a notion that there is a certain entity called "Rajarsh=
i Nandy", an entity called "Narasimha Rao" etc, these entities exist within=
 your mind, for as long as your mind=A0can keep those notions alive. When a=
ll such false notions are successfully eliminated, only=A0supreme cosmic be=
ing is left for the mind to focus on.
=A0
When a conditioned mind that has =
a notion that it is a specific person called "Rajarshi Nandy" in a specific=
 body, such a mind is pre-occupied with so many things that it cannot focus=
 itself on god perfectly.. Due to its pre-occupations, it can only focus it=
self on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is like a mirror =
capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun's image may be reflected on 100 mirrors=
 in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. It may reflect ver=
y little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, each mind can focus=
 on god in a different way, to a different extent. We express this fact in =
alternate words by saying "the mind focuses on internal god and he is limit=
ed".
=A0
This is just a simple way to put things. In reality, the issue is =
not internal vs external. The issue is the mind's ability to perceive and f=
ocus on god. As the mind's pre-occupation with other things comes down and =
its ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the internal god is becomi=
ng stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation. In reality, god, =
whether you call him internal or external, is infinite and does not become =
weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind's idea of god become=
s stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and d=
ull Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mi=
rror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. =
We can say "Sun in the mirror" has become cleaner and brighter. But there i=
s really no Sun "in the" mirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, =
Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and=

 the same!
=A0
This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and =
talking about strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottom=
line is that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the condition=
ing, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visuali=
ze god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its abil=
ity to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and =
becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god h=
as become infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I want to give a small practical exampl=
e, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some concepts.
=A0
Once=A0a co=
uple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhish=
ekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaal=
akshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Sav=
itru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he wors=
hips, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and i=
magines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mah=
alakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her=
. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He=
 lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that =
he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he =
came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described somethin=
g unusual that he "saw". In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned tow=
ards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw
 a tall=A018-hand=
ed form of Mahalakshmi standing in=A0the place of this person for a little =
while.
=A0
As that person meditated, his=A0senses turned inward and he was =
looking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his en=
tire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of inte=
rnal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-perva=
ding light (it is neither "internal" nor "external"). He basically perceive=
d Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. Howev=
er, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purif=
ied state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time=
=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading for=
m. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two diff=
erent ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither internal no=
r external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But=
, both are the same. They appeared different to two minds because of the
 c=
onditioning of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun =
may appear different in two different mirrors!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
No amount of theorization will help one fully u=
nderstand and appreciate things like this. The most important thing is to d=
o some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a regular basis.. No effort=
 is wasted and eventually gives results when there is critical mass. Whatev=
er I say, whatever masters have said before and whatever rishis taught in u=
panishads, can be understood and appreciated through direct experience. THA=
T is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and mails like this is only a =
starting point. One has to engage in some sadhana. Even people like Ramana =
Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vivekananda etc did sadh=
ana for many years, before they realized god..
