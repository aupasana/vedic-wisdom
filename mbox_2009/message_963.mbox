Rao Garu !
Namaste !

Few days back a person asked me sincerely one questio=
n.
"What is a difference between Self respect & Egoistic attitude in day 
t=
o day life?"

I thought it to be a very pertinent and complex question. tha=
t may be 
the concern of many aspirants. only a advanced soul can try to an=
swer 
this with some conviction.

I could have given her a detailed theorit=
ical explanation but thats 
of no use unless things are clear.

Say for exa=
mple, somebody Insults/Ignores/Neglects one person. How 
he/she needs to re=
act?

If a superior send a caustic email to subordinate which is 
unjustifi=
ed. should he/she keep quite or answer in same language 
without any fear?
=

In any case, one can choose to react differently but as you've 
mentioned =
earlier that shouldn't bore any grudge. I suppopse, such 
detachment may co=
me only after lot of Saadhana and after good amount 
of purifications. but =
what to do till that actual wisdom rises?

as usual i ended mixingup !!!

Y=
ours,

Utpal
