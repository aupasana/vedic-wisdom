Nitin,

I have some comments inline for some of your points.

> 2.=A0 =A0 =
=A0While it has been told explicitly in a mail addressed to

 debate is over as far as you are concerned,

s on the same topic, without any

Vijay: Nitin, I di=
sagree with your notion of right. When you are writing in a public forum, y=
ou are spending your time in doing so willingly, and there are no rights. A=
lso, in a public debate, there is concept of debate getting over for a part=
icular individual.

Discussion in a group is not like a private chat room. =
If you have spent time writing it, other are spending time reading to it.

=
If you see some thing objectionable in what Narasimha writes, you can count=
er it. But, I do not feel it is correct to says Narasimha, or so and so per=
sons are not allowed in my discussion thread is appropriate as far as Yahoo=
 group policies are concerned.

> 4.=A0 =A0 If you are left with even a lit=
tle respect for the
> individuality of another person, please ensure that y=
ou don't send
> unsolicited intercepting mails particularly when your name =
has not been mentioned inside the mail.

Vijay: Again, email groups are not=
 one to one communication. If my name is not mentioned, but, by reading it =
I feel I have a point to share, I always have the liberty to step in write =
my two cents. If what I am writing is completely irrelavent, then you can b=
e upset. But, the other person may have felt what he wrote to be relavent a=
nd may not have intended to disrespect you.

> 8.=A0 =A0 If you don't give =
space to members, then, as a moderator,
> you won't ever be able to achieve=
 the "state of discipline and
> decorum" and "participation of group member=
s" at the same time.
Vijay: As far I have seen over the last 6 months, memb=
ers absolutely have the freedome to disagree and debate and question Narasi=
mha (you may want to recall the thread about types of Agni as an example). =
I had liked the thread so far. Request you to get back into actual discussi=
on at the earliest.
