Sri Narasimha Garu, Namaskaram.

I have one another question to this list, =
kindly clarify;

Typically, i travel 1.5 hrs each side from my home to offi=
ce, so i generally prefer to listen to Rudra Namakam chamakam, vishnu sahsa=
sranamam etc during this travel time. 

Manay times, since i reach my desti=
nation i had to cut short the playing audio in my car, i'm not sure if that=
 is a good practise or not, or do i have to necessarily complete the entire=
 audio thing? 

Thanks
Krishna Kanth
