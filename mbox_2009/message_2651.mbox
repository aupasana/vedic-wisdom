Namaste friends,
 
If you see a mail like this in future, please do not respond at all. Just ignore it.
 
The home page of this yahoogroup clearly says the following:
 
"Please note that discussions on individual horoscopes are unwelcome here. For that, there are other yahoogroups like vedic-astrology. Please do not send horoscopes for horoscope reading or remedy recommendation to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. This yahoogroup has a zero tolerance policy, instituted after several abuses, in that matter and offenders will be banned right away."
 
I will ban people who do not care to read the introductory mail from the yahoogroup and proceed to post chart requests like this. But others can and should just ignore mails like this.
 
We have too many yahoogroups for discussing astrology and this yahoogroup is NOT for astrology.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
