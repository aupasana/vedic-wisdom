Dear All,
=C2=A0
Just as an addition to this mail, recently I was talking t=
o someone connected to the Aurobindo Ashram. Sri Aurobindo had said that th=
ere will be five special people who will do the chief work for this change =
that will be coming. Of these, two were disciples of Sri Aurobindo (they ha=
ve expired now), and three other very elevated souls who are not connected =
to=C2=A0his ashram in any way.

Namaste,

Aurobindo need not be ta=
lking about a single "savior" the way people may imagine. Also, he need not=
 be talking about somebody "connected to" his ashram. Moreover, when it com=
es to great lineages, there are connections between all. For example, Aurob=
indo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of S=
wami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He had =
a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a few years aft=
er his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahams=
a Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishy=
a of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a=
 tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew=
 Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.
=C2=A0
Coming back to the mai=
n point, the supermind established in the field of earth that was referred =
to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some attention to matters o=
n earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of the higher planes of c=
onsciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by the mere power of his =
thought. If there is a divine play to make some positive changes on earth a=
nd a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a small part of his supe=
rmind on the affairs of earth and direct a few important souls to do some k=
ey work.=C2=A0Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send =
their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil different part=
s of a divine play.
=C2=A0
You may then see several (not just one) elevated=
 beings, enlightened beings and realized beings born on earth to bring clar=
ity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get spec=
ific internal/external guidance from the divine, based on what their part i=
n the play is.

I know very little. But I was told tha=

Namaste
=C2=A0
I found an interesting article based on Sr=
i Aurobindo's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.
=C2=A0
N=
ear the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and =
yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expre=
ssed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had co=
me for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was =
to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence=
 into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as E=
arth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within he=
r material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurob=
indo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, w=
ho later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of=
 intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal un=
certainties we face today.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine forc=
e permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consci=
ousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is ca=
lled involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out o=
f matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reac=
hed a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his=
 inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of =
what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD tha=
t would entirely change everything on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatn=
ess is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible=
. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most p=
eople, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from des=
cent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divin=
e plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contrad=
ict it.

Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolut=
ionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tr=
emendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prev=
ent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified bef=
ore her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind,=
 what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fie=
lds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down int=
o cellular consciousness.

Evolution took a great leap forward with the ori=
gins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the thres=
hold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the em=
ergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human e=
volution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Ea=
rth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a ra=
tional being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from=
 contacting and merging with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human=
,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the infl=
uence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able =
to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. 
=
=C2=A0
Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a d=
ense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which i=
s supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscious=
ness. 
=C2=A0
Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupra=
mental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms o=
f matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Mast=
ers.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be full=
y realized upon Earth.

The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was =
in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness =
of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that=
 the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the co=
nsciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower i=
nto its full manifestation in collective matter.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=
=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and th=
e Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD =
essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the As=
ura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the As=
ura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and whic=
h seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the Asu=
ra of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and t=
he Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two st=
ill remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura =
of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War I=
I, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It wo=
uld not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other wo=
rld leaders in the current political sphere.

With the descent of this new =
vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demol=
ished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be =
enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth aut=
omatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Fa=
lsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonizat=
ion which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic strug=
gle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their origina=
l emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to sp=
eculate, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might=
 have experienced if not for this power of harmonization!

When does all th=
is happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was s=
et for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother sai=
d in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that=
 it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this =
minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would b=
e a turning point.
=C2=A0
This was a very interesting read and matches what=
 Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.

DIV>Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter=
 and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been =
expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time h=
ad come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine=
 was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emer=
gence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even=
 as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held with=
in her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<BR>=EF=BF=BD<B=
R>Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra=
 Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a=
 journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the =
colossal uncertainties we face today.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo saw tha=
t the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has =
a force of
 consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down=
 into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends =
back upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo,=
 humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultan=
eously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experien=
cing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciou=
sness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.<BR>=EF=BF=BD=
<BR>Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but i=
n what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if=
 seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, eve=
n if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality=
. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer=
 senses seems to contradict it.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FO=
NT><BR>Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutio=
nary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made trem=
endous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preven=
t its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befor=
e her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, w=
hat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the field=
s of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into =
cellular consciousness.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Evolution took a great leap forward =
with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now =
at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepar=
e for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stage=
s of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurre=
ntly upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current s=
pecies, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obs=
tructed from contacting and merging with it.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Next is the =
=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =
birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=
hat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=
ind-consciousness. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </D=
IV>
<DIV>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a=
 dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which=
 is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscio=
usness. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Fi=
nally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=
=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This w=
ill be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In=
 this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon =
Earth.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in=
 bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of=
 their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that t=
he supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the cons=
ciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower int=
o its full manifestation in collective matter.<BR>Whenever there is a =EF=
=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and=
 the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=
=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is th=
e Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and th=
e Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and =
which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the=
 Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, a=
nd the Asura of Suffering has
 returned to Source, and so only the latter t=
wo still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the A=
sura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World =
War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. =
It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=
er world leaders in the current political sphere.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>With the d=
escent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=
tures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=
he changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=
 power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =
part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =
power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =
than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=
 into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=
e interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=
estruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=
!<BR></DIV>
<DIV><U>When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother=
 believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that i=
t was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transfor=
mation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of =
destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD=
 She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.</U></DIV>
