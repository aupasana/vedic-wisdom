Dear Doraiswamy,
You are right.  Upanayanam marks the beginning of Brahmacharya Ashrama  in the life of a Hindu boy of  the three communities, that is, Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vysyas.  Upanayana Samskara becomes a purificatory rite also for the study of the scriptures because the scriptures are holy and to study them one must become holy. In the case of Brahmins, Upanayanam  is a precursor for study of Vedas and is considered as second birth for him.  Mere wearingof  a sacred thread  does not make  a Brahmachari   a Brahmin.   It is rather study of the Vedas, learning and chanting Mantras including Gayatri and Sandhyavandanam  will qualify him to be a true Brahmachari.   In  the academic syllabii  of modern  education,  there is no place for  study of Scriptures.   Very few Brahmins study Vedas  after  Upanayanana.  The least that is expected to be done after the Upanayana  ceremony is to perform Trikalasandhyavandanam and to recite Gayatri Mantra.   The Upanyana ritual
 is not given much importance or practised with religious fervour by the above-mentioned communities.  The Upanayanam is celebrated more as a social function  and much attention is paid on the exhibition of wealth  in the form of Gifts and return gifts  and feeding of guests etc.  No attempt is made  by the  father  of the boy  or his elders or the Purohits(most of whom are not in the habit of performing Sandhyavandanam and Gayatri Japam as prescribed) to educate the youngsters on the importance of  the ceremony and its spiritual values.  I can not blame the Grihastas  as they consider worldly pursuits as more important than knowing the significance of the rituals. Many of us are glued to the TV or computer  at the right time when Sandhyavandanam is to be performed. I have heard some parents saying, "knowing the significance of Upanayanam, Sandhyavandanam etc.  is the duty of the Purohit and not of the Grihasta". Incidentally, among  Brahmins of Southern
 India  most of the Mantras are required to be repeated by the Yajaman or Grihasta during rituals, barring lengthy Japas like Udaka Shanti Japa Mantras etc. etc. But in Northern parts of India, generally, the Panditji keeps uttering the Mantras in a mechanical way and does not bother the Grihasta to repeat them. Exceptions could be there.  Coming back to Upanyanam, the ceremonies are done in a  routine manner and the Vatus(wards)  take this sacred religious ritual with least seriousness.  The net result is complete ignorance and degeneration of values.  Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakotipeetam, Sri Chandrasekhar Saraswati(Mahaperiyaval)  used to emphasize the  importance of performing  Upanayanam at the right age and also the performance of Sandhyavandanam and Gayatri Japam. It is said that  Sandhyavandanam combines in it rituals and meditation.  It is an integral ritual connected with Indian culture in a very prominent manner.  In fact, Sandhyavandanam
 reveals the cultural identity of the person performing it.

Dear Sir, It's true that sandhyavandanam is prescribed  only for brahmins { also kshaaatriyas and vaishyas ]  after undergoing upanayanam. But recital of Gayatri mantra is done by  anyone who is interested . Shraddha is important ./ I know a case  a nadar and gounder couple  who suffered losses in business.,  succeeded after reciting  the Gayatri for 108 times daily . which they are still doing. the same is tsaught in some selected foreign schools { Iheard and re  ad in newspapers}.   It is a  universal mantra given a kshatriya rishi. can we claim sole rights for this?   Sarve janah sukhina bavantu is our motto and even we pray in Gayatri as Deemahi in plural. I feel there is nothing wrong if everybody recites with shradda and not casually including ladies.   R.Doraiswami

 Sandhyavandanam can be performed only those who have undergone Upanayanam samskaram, which is not prescribed for ladies. This is one of the reasons why Veda Adhyayanam was also not prescribed for ladies, since Veda Adhyayanam is to be started only after Upanayanam. During periods ladies need perfect rest. They should not be asked do domestic chores, what to talk of Pooja etc.? This was being strictly observed in all Brahmin families upto probably the early1900s. Now-a-days, people have scant regard for such observances. Not only that. They also laugh at ladies (Rajaswalas)observing the routine prescribed during periods. There could be genuine and  practical difficulties in observing what used to be known as Upahati  or 'thooram". It is considered as another form of untouchability by the younger generation.
