Namaste, 

I had happened to read a very inspiring book by Swami Rama (Livi=
ng 
with Himalayan Masters) and it's noted there that for spiritual 
uplift=
ment the following has to be done:
a) See Godliness in all
b) Consider obje=
cts as the means and not the end
c) Do not covet for wealth, fame and women=
. 

My understanding is that these are the concepts that are taken from 
Ve=
dic Literature as these yogis are followers of jnana and raja 
yogas. 

If =
this hypothesis is correct, why is it that we happen to hear 
polygamous ma=
rriages in the olden days (King Dasaratha, King 
Vichitravirya etc) King Da=
saratha is supposed to be a spiritually 
enlightened person(Ashtavakra Gita=
 etc) but why this contradiction 
with regard to marriages here? 

Thanks &=
 Regards,
--Murahari
