Hello All,

Looking over the panchang, I just came to note that another San=
i Trayodasi is occuring on Oct 31st. Tithti here in Toronto (EST) ends at 1=
6:57. Others may advise on best practices, but now we have Sani homam manua=
l also. 

I am stuck in a class which I must take that day and will unfortu=
natley miss the opportunity to worship as I would like to. Hope others can =
in any case. 

With regards,
Puneet
