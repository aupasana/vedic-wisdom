Namaste Vijay and others,
    vAli had a boon according to which whosoever =
fights him head-on in a dual he gets half his opponents strength. This way =
he defeated Ravana too. This is the reason for Rama to shoot him by hiding.=
 
     I want to point out that Realized beings and Avatars that have a mas=
tery over duality, don't necessarily manifest miracles that violate the rul=
es of duality according  to 'our' definitions of good, righteousness or nec=
essity etc. Unless they deem it necessary, they play within the limitations=
 of duality and act by the natural laws of violate a lower dharma for uphol=
ding a higher dharma as needed. The fundamental difference being that their=
 concept of lower and higher Dharma is in accordance with the Existence and=
 ours is driven by selfishness, prejudices and delusion. 
Regards,
-Prasad

ur explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama was capable of ma=
