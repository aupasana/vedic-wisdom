Namaste,
 
The pronunciation of various aksharas (syllables) is quite good except for "sya" in "devasya", in which "a" is not pronounced well enough. The swara (intonation) is quite good except for "dheemahi", where pitch variation has been falsely introduced (whole word should be with the same pitch without ups/downs/stresses).
 
Another problem is that some syllables are pronounced slowly and some syllables are pronounced fast. The speed variation is incorrect.
 
Except for these three problems, it is good.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
