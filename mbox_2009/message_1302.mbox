Dear Ajit,
 
If the room where you meditate is very cold, it is a good idea=
 to turn the heater on a little before you meditate there. That will ensure=
 that the room warms up before you start and is more conducive to your medi=
tation. Otherwise your meditation may be distracted and less effective.
 
O=
n the other hand, if a room is always maintained warm, there is no need to =
switch the heater on before meditation.
 
It is fantastic if one is sincere=
ly doing 1000 times Gayatri mantra and a nitya homam in the form of aupasan=
am everyday (and any other nityahnika rituals followed in one's tradition).=
 One will be reasonably pure then. Meditation by such a person is like medi=
tation in a warm room in the above analogy.
 
But we are living in changed =
times, when dvijas are cutting down on everything or doing a little bit wit=
hout sincerity.
 
If one is doing agni karma everyday and also considerable=
 amount of japam, the order is secondary. Instead, if one has limited time =
for sadhana, then optimization is needed.
 
I am not aware of any smritis, =
but I do know of traditions where fire is worshipped and then one meditates=
 sitting next to fire. Moreover, many sadhus do light a dhuni (constant fir=
e) and meditate sitting in front of it.
 
> Is there any benefit in perform=
ing japa in front of a lit fireplace,
> where no agnimukham has been perfor=
med.
 
In my view, it is still beneficial. Just as sitting and meditating n=
ext to a big body of water calms and relaxes one's mind, sitting and medita=
ting next to fire purifies one and enhances subtle vision.
 
When at Dakshi=
neshwar, Swami Vivekananda used to collect a lot of wood in one place, ligh=
t it up into a big fire, sit facing it and meditate the whole night. Though=
 he did not do any formal ritual, I still believe that fire helped his focu=
s in meditation.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Dear Narasimha,

  Can you please help me reconcile the superiority of hom=
am with the place that japa finds in the nityahnika procedure?

  As part of nityahnikam, the prescribed method f=
or dvijas is to perform japa followed by the nitya homam (in the form of au=
pasana). This ordering is followed in ahnika texts followed by various comm=
unities. If homa is much more effective, I would expect there to be *some* =
dharma shastra prescription which prefers performing _this_ required daily =
japa as homa. The rishis / grihya-sutra-kartas would never have left such a=
n opportunity alone. At the very least, I would expect these texts to presc=
ribe the performance of japa after the aupasana, in front of the kindled fi=
re. Do you know of any smriti texts / shishtachara which follows such a pro=
cedure? If not, can you please help me understand such an absence?


  > If=

fference. 

  Is there any benefit in performing japa in front of a lit fir=
eplace, where no agnimukham has been performed.

  bhavadIyaH,

         aj=
it
