Dear Sunita,
=A0
If you are going to the Kaalighat temple, you need to be c=
areful of the local priests/pandas. They can be very nasty and extremely mo=
ney minded. Dakshineshwar is more peaceful.=A0Near the Dakshineshwar ma Kaa=
li idol, closeby is the room where Sri Ramakrishna used to live. People can=
 go and sit inside the room and meditate. 
=A0
Wish you and your family a v=
ery holy and fullfilling trip.

-Regards

 Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible that =
Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar a=
nd I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe=
 is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The=

thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form =
of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets =
"established" in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on tha=

think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly a=
nd all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people's strong =
thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a re=

 to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you=
 overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to=
 happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of=
 negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.

te that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a=
 particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desir=
es/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone p=

ory as opposed to just air. That's all.
> >

most people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of =
wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, =
any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirabl=
e thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside=
 becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulg=

nce he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediate for a=
bout 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he saw so=
me deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was a disti=
nct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as if the=
re was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect. Also a strong, =
sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he=
 came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a ki=
lometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he felt w=
as a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that night, exc=
ept for an overwhelming joy, as he said later
 on. Bottomline: a nice spiri=
tual experience.

 Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays=
 to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present =
in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susceptible to=
 such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little higher when a=
