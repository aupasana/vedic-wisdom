Dear All,
Namaste.


Earth gets life from the sun. With its light and heat =
all activities ensue
on earth and many resources are unearthed. In comparis=
on to other planets
and satellites of the solar system it is our earth that=
 is most influenced
by the sun with reference to the atmosphere, plants and=
 other beings. It is
the very life bestowing force on our globe. By correla=
ting the activities of
daily living everyone can experience the amount of i=
nfluence of its
rising/setting, dawn and noon and the state of earth=92s de=
nizens. It is the
sun that heralds in change in seasons. All this is experi=
enced under normal
solar conditions but whenever a deviation sets in condit=
ions of calamities
(earthquakes, tsunamis etc) ensue and thus normalcy and =
balance are
overthrown. Thus not only the condition of earth goes awry but =
that there is
chaos in the psyche of all beings especially humans and they =
act so
disgracefully which is beyond the ken of ones imagination.

These da=
ys such activities are seen in the sun which can be called ordinary
and yet=
 the reaction is such that it influences all living beings. Amongst
them is=
 the augmenting of sun spots which greatly influence earth denizens.

Accor=
ding to research scientists of high repute when ever these sun spots
manife=
st in the sun its state becomes extraordinary. Darkness and storms
erupt in=
 regions spanning thousands of miles, flames are ablaze and
electromagnetic=
 waves manifest so speedily that the entire solar system gets
influenced. T=
here exists a special bond of give and take between the earth
and sun and h=
ence there is a greater probability of adversity ensuing.
Ordinary conditio=
ns change and such adverse conditions set in which induce
more calamities t=
han benefits. Seasons become colder, snowing is in excess,
storms lash out =
and greater atmospheric pressure erupts as cyclones. In the
ozone layer the=
re is less oxygen. In Indian Astrology the manifestation of
sun spots is an=
 indication of change in which both good and bad things can
occur. Even mod=
ern science now agrees with this totally.

A famous scientist Alexander Mar=
shek in his book =91Earth and Horizon=92 has
said that may be there is no p=
erceivable connection between the activities
of earth and internal chaos on=
 the sun yet from the statistical standpoint
its connection has been proved=
 beyond doubt. It has been found that when
ever these solar activities augm=
ent there is more rain and floods, plants
bloom more, heat increases and fa=
mine is seen, road accidents arise, space
accidents augment and war and blo=
odshed too is witnessed. At such times not
only earthquakes and fire outbur=
sts are seen but also extraordinary radiance
of Meru light is glimpsed. Thi=
s too indeed influences our day to day living.
America=92s weather scientis=
t Dr Waxler termed this as a deep interruption in
man=92s daily life.

What=
 is the influence of changes taking place on the sun on our earth? To
know =
this Russia=92s scientist of fame Chibosky has studied the history of
past =
400 years as far as solar activities are concerned. He has concluded
that t=
here is a strong connection between various types of epidemics and
changes =
and sun spot activities. This is a scientific fact that after every
11 year=
s sun spots augment a great deal. As long as the sun spots are deep
or shal=
low its ratio induces changes on earth. Apart from this due to sun
spots th=
e earth=92s magnetic field too remains imbalanced. Radio transmission
is ob=
structed and weather gets influenced too. A famous scientist Michaelson
opi=
nes to this extent that due to these changes on special occasions the
earth=
 tends to expand and contract too as a result of which earthquakes and
othe=
r calamities ensue. Another well known American scientist Dr Andrew
Douglas=
 says that sun spots not only influence human beings and smaller life
forms=
 but that even plants get influenced. After every 11 years the annual
ring =
of trees widens. Possibly this happens because in those days in order
to st=
ay away from the subtle rays of sun spots nature makes tree trunks
larger i=
n diameter.

America=92s Atomic Energy Commission, whose scientists work in=
 the Sandia lab
of Albuquerque has researched a great deal on solar influen=
ces. They have
amassed statistics of 20 years of crime and accidents and an=
alyzed them.
Over and above this they concluded that when sun spots are at =
their pinnacle
accidents and crimes augment 6-fold. Even New York=92s Dr Ba=
ker has found that
during intense solar movements there is an increase in p=
atients with
psychological ailments. With reference to this, ancient Indian=
 Astrologers
had found out much beforehand as to what is the nature of thes=
e outbursts in
the solar system. What are its causes and what is the influe=
nce of earth and
its surroundings? With reference to these outbursts at the=
 level of super
consciousness Maharshi Garg, Parashar, Kashyap, Deva, Narad=
a and Vasishtha
conducted profound studies.

In these days space scientists=
 are supervising the solar system and the
interstellar space beyond it. The=
y say that present day solar activities are
going to induce dire conditions=
 on earth. Everyone knows that the earth has
to imbibe more energy from oth=
er extra terrestrial regions than what itself
possesses. Solar energy is it=
s very life force and right from ancient times
it has been accepted that be=
ings sustain on earth because of sun=92s grace. In
Egypt during irrigation =
a festival is conducted since time immemorial. This
festival takes place in=
 the month of July when the Nile River gets flooded.
After deep research it=
 was found that floods occur on that very day when the
Lubdhak Star (in the=
 Northern Hemisphere) is seen at sunrise. This means
that in some way or th=
e other changes in River Nile are connected to solar
activities.

According=
 to great scientists sun spots reappear after every 11 years 1month
and 22 =
years 2 months. As a result a chaos occurs on earth. When sun spots
manifes=
t the sun shines brightly which is called Solar Flare and many
particles ar=
e emitted from it slowly or speedily. The ones that are emitted
fast have i=
nfinite energy. These particles cross the ozone layer and contact
our earth=
, which as a result influence the psyche of human beings. It is
seen that w=
hen sun spots increase and particles of its Solar Flare contact
human being=
s the latter=92s psychology is affected. Due to their influence
even great =
men are affected and various types of situations pan out on
earth.

When ev=
er sun spots augment in number not only individuals but that an all
pervasi=
ve effect of solar activities is noted on world humanity. World
history res=
earch says that right from the 18th century to this day this fact
is clear =
that important historical revolutions, bloodshed, warfare etc have
occurred=
 during sun spot manifestations.

Research scientists have unveiled this am=
azing data that there is a strong
connection with incidents of human civili=
zation history. In the year sun
spots augment rapidly life becomes extraord=
inary on earth. At such times
there have been wars, revolutions etc. In the=
 year 1789 AD the French
Revolution, the first battle of India=92s Independ=
ence struggle in 1857 AD,
battle between Russia and Japan in 1904-1905, 1st=
 world war in 1914-18, 2nd
world war in 1939-42, India=92s Independence in =
1947 etc took place when sun
spots were phenomenally on the rise. After tha=
t 3 important years of sun
spot augmenting passed by in 1958, 1969 and 1980=
-81. A new phase started in
1992-93 and in future when total solar eclipse =
will take place sun spots
will rapidly manifest. It has been calculated tha=
t the disorder and nature=92s
wrath will be that much more terrible and it =
is said that the last 8 years
of the 20th century will be more tortuous and=
 full of changes (this
literature was written before 1991 AD).

Spiritual s=
eers opine that in accordance with the wheel of time the coming
days will b=
e full of speedy changes in an all round manner. For some unknown
reasons i=
n the coming days the sun will break certain cosmic laws and induce
changes=
 on planet earth. Not only will there be floods, famine, world wars,
epidem=
ics etc but new revolutions will set in and a change for the better
will be=
 noted in the so far lowly human intellect. The sun is just not the
life of=
 the material world but is also the Lord of human consciousness.
Rishis cal=
l it 3-fold knowledge meaning that 3 principles exist in it viz.
gross one =
which constitutes the human body, vital body from which
consciousness manif=
ests and mind which induces other inner activities. Since
time immemorial t=
he Gayatri Mantra has been chanted for activation of human
power consciousn=
ess so as to render a cosmic transformation. In the coming
days the world o=
ver this experiment shall intensify with great momentum.
