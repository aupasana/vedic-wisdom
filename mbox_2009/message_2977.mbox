 26th June, 1949

One of the devotees who had recently come and had been st=
aying for some
time, asked Bhagavan, =93Several people here go round the hi=
ll frequently.
What is its greatness?=94

Bhagavan told him the following s=
tory:

=93The greatness of this Giri Pradakshina has been described at leng=
th in
Arunachala Puranam. Lord Nandikesa asked Sadasiva a similar question =
and
Sadasiva narrated as follows: =91To go round this hill is good. The wor=
d
=91Pradakshina=92 has a typical meaning.

The letter =91Pra=92 stands for=
 removal of all kinds of sins; =91da=92 stands for
fulfilling the desires; =
=91kshi=92 stands for freedom from future births; =91na=92
stands for givin=
g deliverance through jnana.

If by way of Pradakshina you walk one step it=
 gives happiness in this world,
two steps, it gives happiness in heaven, th=
ree steps, it gives bliss of
Satyaloka which can be attained.

One should g=
o round either in mouna (silence) or dhyana (meditation) or japa
(repetitio=
n of Lord=92s name) or sankeertana (bhajan) and thereby think of God
all th=
e time. One should walk slowly like a woman who is in the ninth month
of pr=
egnancy.

It seems Amba who was doing tapas here, went round the hill on th=
e day of
the Krithikai star in the first quarter of the night. Immediately =
after the
darshan of the holy beacon, she became finally absorbed in Lord S=
iva.

It is stated that on the third day after the festival of the Holy Bea=
con,
Siva himself started for the Pradakshina with all his followers. Reall=
y, it
is difficult to describe the pleasure and the happiness one gets by t=
his
Pradakshina.

Besides this, there are several varieties of medicinal he=
rbs on the hill.

The air that passes over those herbs is good for the lung=
s. As there is no
vehicular traffic there is no worry about making way for =
cars and buses. One
can walk carefree according to one=92s wishes.
