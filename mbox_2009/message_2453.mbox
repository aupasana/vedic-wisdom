Friends,

The subject-matter of  The  Hindu religion( Sanatana Dhrma) and  Hindu philosophy (Vedanta) may be said to comprehend  primarily  the three factors---GOD(Isvara), the soul (jiva), and the world (prapancha), each having its own rights.   Difficulty ,of course, has been there in showing as to how these three interact  with one another.  No doubt, the  Advaitins   have overcome the difficulty by admitting that all these are apparent diversifications, through  Prakriti(Maya),   of a single transcendental principle.  The latter is nothing other than Consciousness,Brahman which is immutably homogeneous, infinite and pure,   as the scriptures indicate.  In fact, It is the only reality.  It is  Advaita   in the sense that it is the substratum of the abscence of all duality (na vidyate dvitiyam iti). 
 
Prakriti, consists of the three strands of  sattva, rajas and tamas, and it is  indeterminable either as real(sat) or an absolute nothing(asat).    It is termed as  Maya   when its constituent  sattva  is predominant therein rendering  rajas and tamas  ineffectual.  It is designated as Ignorance  (avidya)  when  sattva  is clouded by   rajas and tamas.  Vedanta  holds the reflection of Consciouness in  Maya  is known  as  Isvara   and its reflection in avidya  is jiva.  Isvara  is a blend of consciousness and   Maya.  Isvara   is endowed with all auspicious attributes like  omniscience  and also with the material and efficient causality of the world, which are illusorily projected by  Maya.  The consciousness element in Him is real, while   Maya  and the attributes projected by it are not real.   Isvara  is always aware of His  identity with the consciousness-element,  which is His essential nature and which is never concealed from Him by  Maya  since 
 sattva  is predominant therein.  He is therefore ever released(Nitya Muktah).
