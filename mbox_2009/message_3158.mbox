Dear Shri. Utpal,
    I have said everything I got to say in my reply to Na=
rasimha. I am one of hundres of thousands of sadhaks in AOL. I do not have =
the means to contact him personally and so cannot pass on your questions. I=
 have had only very brief moments of personal time with him. 

If you _real=
ly_ want to know the answer to these questions you need to know him. Then y=
ou will intuitively know the answers and the questions will disappear.

lov=
e,
-Siva.

> Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world's largest volu=
nteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravish=
ankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitable activiti=
es again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers have given up ve=
yr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become teachers and =
teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money. All senior=
 AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes ev=
en dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a tim=
e when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of peop=
le.

 lives by going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalit=
es, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka,=
 etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.

r the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri's=
 guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course because they c=
annot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL c=
ourses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for free an=
d were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster str=
ikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teac=
h courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not adverti=
se it or make a show of it.

nding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers =
and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.

 and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long =
as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happ=
