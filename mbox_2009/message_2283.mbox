Friends,
We call ourself as a Brahmin  when  both our  parents were of Brahminical origin.  We attain the stage of Dwija  when we are invested withYagnopaveetham (sacred thread).  Thereafter ceratin daily rituals such as Trikala Sandhyavandanam  has to be done by all Brahmins every day including  the day of death of close relatives.  Brahmacharis  (bachelors) are required to do Samidhaadanaam  and Grihastas  (married males)  are required to perform Aupasanam  two times a day  all  the 365 days of the year. This is the commandment of the  Sruti(Vedas).  It is upto each person who claims to be Brahmin to question himself whether he  can call himself to be a Brahmin  despite not   complying with the requirements of Sruti.  In the Bhagawad Gita  Lord Krishna says, "One`s own duty(occupation), though seemingly devoid of merit or faulty, is superior to that of another, even if well performed or discharged perfectly. It is preferable and honorable to die doing one`s
 duty(occupation)  (Sreyan sva-dharmo vigunah  paradharmaat sva anushthitat  sva dharme nidhanaa sreyah  para dharmo bhayavaha); undertaking another`s duty(occupation) is fraught with danger"(Chapter 3,verse 35).  Moreover, "It is better to engage in  one`s occupation(Dharma) though uninviting, than that of another better discharged; for he who performs the duty(occupation) according to one`s nature does not incur any sin"Svabhava niyatam karma kurvan na apnoti kilbisham ( Chapter 18,verse 47).   From this  it is clear that without performing Brahminical duties such as Yajnas, Vedha Adhyayana, sandhya vandana etc. and observing of Vratas like Ekadsi Vrata etc. etc.  we are not eligible to call ourselves  as Brahmins. Our community  people are excelling  by engaing themselves in other`s occupation  such as joining the  armed forces etc. for fighting for the country,technology(yantra vidyakan), trade  etc. etc.   Such people  have given more importance to
 other occupations,  professions, trade etc. etc.  than Brahminical svadharma.  In the past one or two  centuries   a trend seems to have emerged  whereby the young members of our community  did/ do not want to accept  their karma  of being born as  in a  brahmana- parivara  and attempt to follow Brahminal codes.  Majoroty  of them seem to have  migrated to technologically advanced or richer nations to do the jobs of  sudras  in order to earn  greater  amount of money.  If one takes pride in proclaiming that he is a brahmin by birth, he should  rigidly adhere to the rules of the  Dharma Sastras   which declare that if a Brahmana crosses the ocean, he loses his caste.  Thus those who went/ have gone/are going  to work in foreign countries  have lost their brahminical identity.  Only a  sudra  is allowed to reside outside  Bharatavarsha and Bharatah khanda  that too when he is in distress or for subsistance.  I am not saying this  out of my hat. usbManu
 Smriti 4.61 says "Let him ( brahmana) not dwell in a land that is goverened by sudras.
