 ONCE Narada besought the Lord of the universe,"Lord, show me that Maya of
Thine which can make the impossible possible." The Lord nodded assent.
Subsequently the Lord one day set out on a travel with Narada. After going
some distance, He felt very thirsty and fatigued. So He sat down and told
Narada, "Narada, I feel much thirsty; please get me a little water from
somewhere." Narada at once ran in search of water.

Finding no water nearby, he went far from the place and saw a river at a
great distance. When he approached the river, he saw a most charming young
lady sitting there, and was at once captivated by her beauty. As soon as
Narada went near her,she began to address him in sweet words, and ere long,
both fell in love with each other. Narada then married her, and settled down
as a householder. In course of time he had a number of children by her.And
while he was thus living happily with his wife and children, there came a
pestilence in the country. Death began to collect its toll from every place.
Then Narada proposed to abandon the place and go somewhere else. His wife
acceded to it, and they both came out of their house leading their children
by the hand. But no sooner did they come to the bridge to cross the river
than there came a terrible flood, and in the rush of water, all their
children were swept away one after another, and at last the wife too was
drowned.

Overwhelmed with grief at his bereavement, Narada sat down on the bank and
began to weep piteously. Just then the Lord appeared before him, saying, "O
Narada,where is the water? And why are you weeping?"

The sight of the Lord startled the sage, and then he understood everything.
He exclaimed, "Lord, my obeisance to You, and my obeisance also to Your
wonderful Maya!"
