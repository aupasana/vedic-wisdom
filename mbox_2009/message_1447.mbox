Namaste,
 
Praana is the movement in consciousness that sustains the lifefo=
rce. Apaana is the downward force. When one attains a perfect focus on a ma=
ntra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from lungs/stoma=
ch and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana combine, they can move =
upward at a rapid speed.
 
When praana and apaana combine for the first tim=
e, it may feel like an explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will fe=
el like one is freed from the body and one does not exist. This is similar =
to death, except that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel=
 a kind of bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one's foc=
us on mantra relaxes and one become "aware of" the experience and starts an=
alyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one becoming worrie=
d and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is full focus o=
n mantra and no other distractions, for as long as possible.
 
These things=
 happen automatically without thinking about them and engaging in any speci=
fic practicies. In fact, thinking about them, desiring them and doing speci=
fic practices may become an obstacle and delay things. If you surrender to =
a deity and do a mantra with a high level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT =
run after any experience and think of an experience as an end result. The f=
ocus should be mantra and mantra alone.
 
Even when an experience occurs, I=
 tell people to not be tied to it and not think too much about it.
 
Suchak=
a dream is a vision of something that is going to happen.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

  This is what I recommend:

            Say "Om Bhur bhuvah suvah" once in=
 the beginning. Then start repeating the following:

            Om tatsavi=
tur .... varenyam Om

            This is what should be repeated for one m=
ala or two malas or, as Manish said below, 10 malas.

            *        =
*        *

            I know something about Manish. He has the rare abil=

                      Dear Narasimha,

        =
              When the sadhaka effaces his own personality such that the de=
ity of the mantra comes and occupies him, then at that stage there is 
    =
                  no real difference between the sadhaka and the Deity(even=
 if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there is no real=
 difference).
                      The difference that one feels is as fol=
lows:
                      One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on=
 the eyes.
                      A few repititions of the mantra bring abou=
t a situation where the deity possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka's prana=
 goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), 
                      During all=
 meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face, etc of t=
he deity sitting beside him along with minute details of the room (even tho=
ugh the sadhak's eyes are closed).
                      The sadhak typical=
ly becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.
                      The w=
hole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i again exper=
ience the Beloved.
                      That then is the experience of man=
tra when it is done correctly.
                      When the sadhak's pers=
onality is effaced such that the deity's personality sits there then the sa=
dhak experiences himself as that Deity(Devata) .
                      Ther=
e then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain=
 thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that which appears=
 to be bad) . The deity's personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the per=
son care almost for nothing himself, so self identification is minimised an=
d the person's spiritual evolution continues.
                      Remembe=
r, there is very little according to me which is black magic. It is all a u=
se of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand =
Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God =
himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, such a sa=
dhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni=
 goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings. 
                     =
 Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads of=
 the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan c=
omes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causing =
an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here the=
re is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and yo=
u will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to =
10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with the =
universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks you=
, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie =
God or the universe).
                      If people persist in using the =
Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shak=
ti which can be used, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be =
free of identification with the body and so their actions are those which a=
re generally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spir=
its which they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experi=
ence.
                      Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for=
 a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity =
and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of =
his previous effort).
                      On the other hand somebody doin=
g this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind =
every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.
            =
          According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let=
 me suggest an easy sadhana.
                      If one is so inclined, t=
hen starting on some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call =
this the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constrain=
ts
                      Same time every day.
                      Same pl=
ace.
                      Same materials.
                      Same direc=
tion.
                      As little movement as one can.
                =
      Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
                 =
     Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the bod=
y), reduce food intake, grow a beard.
                      Do not eat 2 hr=
s before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before you start.
     =
                 Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 t=
imes.
                      See the difference in your personality before a=
nd after.
                      Long and short , what is important is that =
life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as=
 long as is physically possible.
                      I hope this clarifie=
s some of the concepts which were being discussed.

                      K=
ind Love and Regards
                      manish
                      You=

                      I mentioned the above with respect to the need of tho=
usands of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god a=
nd wants to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need f=
or thousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands=
 of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of diff=
erent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. Howe=
ver, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I wil=
l elaborate.

                        Also, commanding god is NOT black mag=
ic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished e=
ven by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy e=
go. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a s=
piritually elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding =
that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist c=
annot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individua=
l ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previou=
s mail to clarify:

                        The universe has many lokas (pl=
anes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are infinite k=
armic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite p=
ossible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill i=
t* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind=
 constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of s=
elf-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of ene=
rgy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes co=
rresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic inter=
actions between various objects.

                        Each set of "karm=
ic interactions between various objects" is a "result". Various mantras are=
 for various "results". One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra ful=
ly and getting a specific result from it as "commanding a result" from god.=
 Whether you like the term or not, it is essentially that.

               =
         *        *        *

                        But the bottomline is=
 this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific =
results from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting =
as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Nature=
). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis ar=
e meant for such sadhakas.

                        Those are hardly of use=
 to so many people out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish resul=
ts. They cannot command specific results from god (because of their heavy a=
ttachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a =
limited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all=
 the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with thes=
e technicalities, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at Go=
d's door.

              There may be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra) for =
climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (different experience) =
on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrolog=
ers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery=
 (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped person without legs =
(a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs =
and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (=
a reasonably detached person with very little ego).

                      =
  Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb the =
mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and traverse th=
e long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are bogged=
 down by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantra advic=
e from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by doing t=
hat 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a powerful =
mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after* one su=
cceeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a path l=
eading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particularly bea=
utiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive the climb=
 along the long path.

                        We need to emphasize the att=
itude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the c=
hoice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great=
 spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize p=
icking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized ha=
ving the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, pers=
istence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and us=
eful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and imp=
ress god.

                        Parasara's definition of gandanta is=
 restricted to two neighboring areas in a contiguous space having a predomi=
nance of fire and water elements. "I see fire and I see water. So there is =
gandanta" is a wrong approach. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, be=
ing in a fiery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gand=
anta. Gandanta requires a *transition* in a contiguous space.

            =
            In your example of upapada lord's tithi, there is no contiguous=
 space where there is a water-fire transition.

      =
                  Dear Sanjay,

                        > Since you do not =
have any real definition of Gandanta, I am dropping that

                 =
       I do have a definition of gandanta, which is Parasara's definition i=
n BPHS.

                        Since some of you are extrapolating it bas=
ed on the fire embodied in UL and water embodied in tithis, the onus is on =
you to outline and justify your definition. I got into this thread because =
statements were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a cha=
rt can cause "insult to Vishnu", "serious doshas" and "danger to spouse", b=
ased on these far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.

                    =
    > Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.

          =
              Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth a=
nd arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/percepti on. That was meaningful. Now, you =
associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri a=
nd water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is really in line wi=
th everything you have learnt (and taught).

                        BTW, I=
 specifically asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your o=
wn thinking or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full =
context). Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately and r=
ecently publicly, you did not respond.

                        *        * =
       *

                        > Statement 1 is an arrogance that the en=
tire Jyotisha shastra is bogus

a and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and
                =
        > not of much consequence.

                        First of all, P=
arasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis based on=
 any arudhas or houses in a chart.

                        For doshas in b=
irth chart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessi=
ngs of planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described h=
ow to perform them. His section on remedial measures is full of various hom=
as. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am =
in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by the=
mselves.

                        Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or=
 tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for s=
pecific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tit=
hi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not base=
d on any house or arudha in the chart.

                        Thus, the p=
rinciples I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.

                      =
  Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complica=
ted principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scarin=
g people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause =
"danger to spouse" or "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu", based on horo=
scope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There=
 may be a little difference between doing an austerity on different days, b=
ut my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing =
and not doing at all and that doing it on a "wrong day" does not cause dang=
er as being suggested.

                        Third, our shastras primari=
ly talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the ene=
rgy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekd=
ay or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irres=
pective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man co=
mes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is b=
etter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is =
more important.

                        Choosing the day of a remedy based=
 on the deity is more important and the variations based on individual horo=
scope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variation=
s. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are actua=
lly well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question ov=
er-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable origi=
n and scaring people on that basis.

                        I did not say it i=
s "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is limited and w=
e should take our limitations into consideration.

                        =
The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings and man=
y objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Ac=
cordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfect=
ly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the m=
antra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantr=
a. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes inte=
rnal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to=
 the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe=
 and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.

          =
              However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is =
irrelevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to a=
bsorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-=
awareness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such see=
rs are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience=
 any mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

    =
                    *        *        *

                        Just repea=
ting a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may t=
hink that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of =
times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickl=
y and another may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. =
Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to reall=
y work and it is much more difficult than one may think.

                 =
       *        *        *

                        A highly learned schola=
r in the court of a king may be able to command the king and get whatever h=
e wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather =
than trying to command (and failing for sure).

                        Sim=
ilarly, most people are better off begging god for what they want rather th=
an trying to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar does =
not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of hu=
mility and helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what help =
a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. =
In this age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good beg=
gar at god's door.

                        What people today need for mate=
rial and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better attitude =
in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras and oth=
er specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result from g=
od.

                        It is worth noting that so many great spiritua=
l teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking th=
e right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the =
correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, =
discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than tr=
ying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

 =
                       *        *        *

                        One mor=
e thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rish=
is like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very li=
mited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on them. They use all =
kinds of other rules coming from various traditions. They are not free from=
 corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate various mantras wit=
h various results, irrespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of =
who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Anga=
raka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is ov=
erplayed by today's astrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara's guideli=
nes.

                        If one has a sadguru, I recommend following t=
he word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretician.

        =
                If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. P=
ick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) ins=
tead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is =
the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god's door. Choi=
ce of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in being =
a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great sch=
olars.

                        Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, pan=
chakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare kris=
hna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra =
etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without=
 the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.

           Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, I am drop=

                          2.=
 Statement 2: *reciting any prayer* will give the desired effects for any a=
ilment we wish to remedy

                          Is this what you intend=
ed to say or did I get this wrong?

                          Statement 1 i=
s an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no relevan=
ce as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done on=
 specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like =
another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like this co=
erced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled=
 but such pretexts to knowledge.

                          Statement 2 is =
an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=
=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for the sam=

astra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.
