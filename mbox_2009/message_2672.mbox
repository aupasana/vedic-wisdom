Dear Sundeep,
=A0
Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamach=
arun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order)=A0- it maybe of som=
e help to you.=A0He did mention in details about the process of creation as=
 he saw it.
=A0
As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chao=
s. Then from there came the "vidhyut" of Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted=
 with the chaos, it produced some universal energies which are more commonl=
y known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the =
"Vidyut" of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see=
 it, but more the essence of the element, hence his use of the word "vidyut=
" and " taranga") whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more en=
ergy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one result=
ing from the previous and each one resulting in some energy states, which i=
n the end resulted in 33 crore possible=A0states of energy.
=A0
=A0
=A0
=A0=

There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it..=
 I feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional p=
hysics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..
=A0
=A0
This=
 is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.
=A0
As much as I co=
uld fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetrate t=
he mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half formed.=
 There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by multipl=
e physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which 'c=
laim to explain' in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a cor=
relation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble opini=
on, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between basic Q=
uantum Mechanics, non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but =
a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta?..
=A0
Well, 
=A0

=A0

Th=
e upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Dear Rajarshi,

Not sure if I g=
et the thrust of your point. Yes, sadhana is the only way to know this for =
sure. And so also for everything else that is below the reach of the senses=
 (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do read about them (all these thi=
ngs e.g Atma etc), and about the significance of the vedic gods anyway, don=
t we? They do offer a mild complement to sadhana, dont they? They do help m=
ake the mind more receptive toward the benefits of sadhana..

Also wanted t=
o assure you that I really want to know the answer to the question. I am no=
t interested in a he-said/she- said type game (if perhaps that is what you =
were hinting at?). I am extremely curious as to why there is an order and n=
ot a parallelism, for e.g. why are the mahabhutas not simultaneously formed=
. There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.=
. I feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional =
physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..

Regards,

=
Sundeep
