 15th January, 1949

One of the devotees addressed Bhagavan: =93You told us=
 once that you had seen
on
this hill very high temples, gardens and such li=
ke. Was that all during the
period you were on the hill?=94

Bhagavan: =93Y=
es. That was perhaps when I was in the Virupaksha Cave. I closed
my eyes. I=
 felt I was walking on the hill itself towards the northeast. I
saw at one =
place a nice flower garden, a big temple, a fine compound wall
and a big Na=
ndi (a bull carved in stone). There was a strange light. It was
extremely p=
leasant. As I was looking at all these, it was time for puja
(worship). The=
 bell was rung and immediately after that I opened my eyes.=94

Devotee: =
=93Bhagavan told us some time back that there was a big cave also.=94

Bhag=
avan: =93Yes, yes. That also happened when I was living on the hill. I was
=
wandering about aimlessly when I found at one place a big cave. When I
ente=
red the cave, I saw a number of waterfalls, beautiful gardens, tanks
within=
 those gardens, well laid paths, fine lighting; everything there was
most p=
leasing. As I went farther and farther I saw a Realised Person (Siddha
Puru=
sha) seated like Dakshinamurthy under a tree on the banks of a tank.
Around=
 him, a number of saints (munis) were seated. They were asking
something an=
d he was replying to them. That place appeared to me very
familiar. That is=
 all. I opened my eyes. Subsequently,after some time, when
I saw Arunachala=
 Puranam in Sanskrit in the two slokas that cave and that
Siddha Purusha ha=
ve been described and so I was surprised that what appeared
to me in a tran=
ce was to be found in that book. So I translated them into
Tamil: =91Angiyu=
ru vayumoli mangugiri yaga...=92. Its meaning is: =91Though you
are in the =
form of fire,you have kept away the fire and have taken the shape
of a hill=
 mainly to shower your blessings on the people. You are always
living here =
in the form of a Siddha. The cave that appeared to me is in you
with all th=
e luxuries of the world.=92

Recently when the temple in Adi Annamalai was =
renovated,it has been reported
that in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple =
a large tunnel was found and
when people tried to find out its extent they =
saw that it was extending to
the very centre of the hill.

As they could no=
t go in very far, they came back. I therefore thought that
which occurred t=
o me and that which is in the Purana appears to be true and
that the tunnel=
 was the way to the place I had seen. It is reported that
Siddha Purushas c=
ome from the cave inside to the temple through that tunnel
night after nigh=
t and go back after worshipping Ishwara. Why so far?
Recently, something li=
ke that was seen even here. I was going on to the hill
as usual when, as I =
was getting near the steps over there, a big city
appeared before me. There=
 were huge buildings of several varieties, well
laid thoroughfares, good li=
ghting; and it appeared to be a great city. At
one place a meeting was bein=
g held. Chadwick was with me. He was even
saying, =91Bhagavan,all this is s=
o self-evident! Who will believe if we say
this is all a dream!=92 Everythi=
ng appeared as if it was actually happening.

Meanwhile, I opened my eyes.=
=94

Devotee: =93Is all this really a dream?=94

Bhagavan: =93I can=92t say=
 whether it is a dream or not.What is real?=94
