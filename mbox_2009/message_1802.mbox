I was talking to one of the elderly persons in India over phone. At that he=
 was telling me that I can do tarpana to Sani graha for shanti, if I cannot=
 do homam (I am having Sani Mahadasa now, with Sukra Antaradasa). He said h=
e has read such a procedure in one of the publications (Sanigraha Shanti Po=
oja Vidhanam published by LIFCO). It was first time that I heard that I cou=
ld do tarpana to Sani Graha for appeasement.

Has any one heard of offering=
 of tarpana to Sani? If any one has done tarpana to Sani in the past, can t=
hey advise me the procedure?

Thanks in advance.

Shankar
