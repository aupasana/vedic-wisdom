Greetings!

This is my first post to the vedic-wisdom group.

I have enjoye=
d the enlightening posts & discussions on this group ever
since becoming a =
member earlier this summer. Kudos to my friend & guide
(and my undergraduat=
e classmate), PVR Narasimha Rao, for his yeoman's
service in founding & she=
pherding this group.
Sharing with you a fascinating article on the signific=
ance of today's
date (9.9.9) by Carl Johan Calleman, an expert on the Mayan=
 Calendar,
whom I met a couple of weeks ago at a conference in Washington D=
C.Best,
Sanjay

       9.9.9. and the Maya=
n Calendar

The number nine has been endowed with a special significance in=
 many
different spiritual and religious traditions. Nine was the number of
=
muses in Greek mythology and Nine were the number of worlds in the
Scandina=
vian. Nine was the number of doors to the holiest part of the
temple in Jer=
usalem and the month of Ramadan is the Ninth in the Muslim
calendar. Moreov=
er, the counting system used by most of the world today
includes nine numbe=
rs and so the relevance of this number is much
ingrained in us. Also, in th=
e Mayan tradition the number Nine plays a
predominating role. The only exis=
ting inscription from ancient times
that discusses the meaning of the Mayan=
 calendar "end date" for
instance speaks of Nine "deities" that will descen=
d then as its
crucial event. This would in modern wording mean that Nine en=
ergies
<http://calleman.com/content/articles/the_tortuguero+_monument.htm> =
, or
Nine cosmic forces would fully manifest then since the ancient Maya
wo=
uld look upon time periods as "deities". As far as we can tell
these "deiti=
es", or cosmic forces, are like evolutionary wave
movements, built on top o=
f one another where we are currently riding on
the eighth one getting ready=
 to ride o n20the ninth.


The Nine Cosmic levels (Underworlds) that accord=
ing to the only existing
Mayan inscription about the calendar end date (Tor=
tuguero monument 6)
will manifest then. Currently we are in the eighth leve=
l (The Galactic
Underworld) gearing up to the Ninth and highest level, the =
Universal
Underworld. Photo of the Pyramid of the Jaguar in Tikal by the au=
thor.)
In the manifestation of these evolutionary waves we may now as we
ap=
proach the Ninth level notice an amazing synchronicity. This is that
the up=
coming date 9.9.9 (September 9, 2009 in the Gregorian calendar)
happens to =
coincide with the beginning of a Mayan Sacred Calendar count
of 260 days. H=
ence, in this calendar, in use since 3000 years, the
modern date 9.9.9 has =
the energy of Hun Imix, or 1 Alligator as its
English translation reads, wh=
ich happens to be the first of its
energetic combinations. If we ponder wha=
t this synchronicity may be
telling us the most natural conclusion to draw =
is that on this
particular date we are called to focus on the number nine a=
nd especially
the Ninth level of the Mayan calendar system, whose coming in=
to
existence we are soon about to witness.   I believe that behind these
co=
smic forces, whose times of activation ar e described by the Mayan
calendar=
, is an intell igent plan for the history of humanity that comes
from a hig=
her source and has a benevolent intention. To realize this is
also to under=
stand the importance of the guidance regarding how to
follow this plan that=
 we may gain from the calendar of the Maya. These
nine cosmic forces are in=
fluencing and in fact governing our collective
consciousness and so we have=
 every reason to pay attention to what is
going on in this cosmic time plan=
.   Synchronicities can often be
interpreted in different ways, but if they=
 are profound they always
deserve our attention. 9.9.9, three Nines in a ro=
w, may for instance be
seen as symbolic of three sacred calendar rounds of =
260 days that will
now in three steps lead us to the completion of the Nint=
h level of
evolution which is its highest level. To the best of our knowled=
ge this
highest energy state of the universe will be attained on the energy=

13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13 13 Ahau (13 and Ahau are symbols of
completion =
in the Mayan calendar) on the Gregorian date October 28,
2011. This highest=
 state does not in any sense mean the end of the
world, but only that all t=
he Nine wave movements are then completed.
Maybe we can use the metaphor th=
at we are now about to climb the last
hard steps of a ladder until we climb=
 on to the roof where we will find
a new stability under our feet and a pla=
ce to rest.  Regardless of what
this final climb will mean=3D2 0we thus hav=
e reasons to expect an
unprecedented period of change in a very short perio=
d of time. This is
partly because we are entering the final phase of the ei=
ghth level of
evolution and partly because a wave movement of a very high f=
requency,
the Ninth level, will radically come to transform the collective
=
consciousness in such a way that we will see the world in an entirely
diffe=
rent light. It is for this reason that in the three upcoming Sacred
Calenda=
r rounds that follow upon 9.9.9 we will need to network and focus
our inten=
tions so that they converge in the birth of a new world. This
is all the mo=
re important as there are several sources that seem to
indicate that the si=
xth night of the Galactic Underworld, beginning on
November 8, 2009, may co=
me to generate a deep downturn in the
world's economy. The first of these 2=
60-day Sacred Calendar rounds,
the one which actually begins on 9.9.9 and g=
oes on until May 26, 2010,
may be seen as a period of build-up to the Ninth=
 level that is suitable
for prayer, meditation and mental focusing. We enco=
urage community
building, networking and spiritual synchronization in this =
time period,
also of a practical nature. The second 260 calendar round, sta=
rting
27.05.10 will create a preliminary arrival of the Ninth level and the=

beginning of this will be marked by the Cosmic Convergence, July 17-18,
a =
significant focus point for spiritual projects of a practical nature
that w=
ill prepare f or the birth of a new world. The third Sacred
Calendar round =
of 260 days will begin February 11, 2011 and includes the
actual activation=
 of the Ninth level, the Universal Underworld on March
8, 2011. This may be=
 the most dramatic of the three steps as it leads up
to the establishment o=
f the highest energy state of the universe on
October 28, 2011.
I believe t=
hat through these three steps, three Sacred Calendar rounds,
starting on 9.=
9.9: 1/ Build-up, 2/ Preparatory Ninth level and 3/ Actual
Ninth level of t=
he evolution of the cosmos, the universe is now about to
deliver what it ha=
s been striving towards all along, the establishment
of a new level of cons=
ciousness, a unity consciousness. I also believe
that the Ninth level is de=
signed especially to generate such a unity
consciousness, which will transf=
orm all of human society. For the human
race it will mean very big challeng=
es and opportunities. These changes
will however not happen by themselves a=
nd need to be manifested by the
human beings themselves who may then chose =
to resist or welcome them.
>From this perspective we may thus look at the da=
te 9.9.9 not only as a
numerological curiosity to celebrate, but also as an=
 opportunity for us
to focus on and embrace the participation of humanity i=
n a
transformation process of a very large scale, the one brought by the
Ni=
nth level of the Cosmos. From what we may understand of the Mayan
calendar =
the unity20consciousness will set an end to all forms of
dominance of one h=
uman over another and especially those generated by
the left brain. What th=
is likely will mean is that instruments of
dominance, such as the current f=
inancial system, weapons, national
borders and many other structures uphold=
ing authority in this process
will come to crumble as an effect of this uni=
ty consciousness coming
into existence and so conclude with the birth of a =
new world where a
divine harmony characterize the human relations. This end=
 to dominance
will also affect the relationship between the genders on a gl=
obal scale
that as a result will profoundly shift. Needless to say, there w=
ill
never be any return to business as usual. Instead we will need to
appro=
ach the birth of the new world consciously and with an intention of
co-crea=
ting it in a positive sense and not just react to the various
difficulties =
that lie ahead. I believe that such a collective intention
of co-creating t=
he new world will be the best way of easing the
consequences of these diffi=
culties.
Although what is starting on 9.9.9 is only the build-up phase to t=
he
Ninth level, this date is nonetheless a very important focusing point
si=
nce the timing of the continued preparations for the emergence of this
leve=
l are of the essence. From20this follows that the more practical
projects t=
hat will start to manifest in the Cosmic Convergence, July
17-18 2010 as th=
e name implies, will have to be bas ed on an
understanding that the very fr=
amework of the human existence and of
consciousness will be dramatically ex=
panded. The expansion of human
consciousness is what will bring the socio-e=
conomic transformation at a
time when the hardships of the old systems may =
be expected to be
painfully felt also by nations that currently may been co=
nsidered as
wealthy. As the Ninth level is finally activated our identities=
 will
come to be defined in a much expanded spiritual framework. This artic=
le
comes much too late to encourage people more broadly to focus and intend=

together for the future. Nonetheless, many will celebrate the 9.9.9 date
r=
egardless (see for example http://www.fredpajorden.se/sida21.html 
<http://=
www.fredpajorden.se/sida21.html> ). The purpose of my present
article is th=
en only to inform those that will be celebrating this date
anyway, that ind=
eed this is not just a numerological curiosity in the
Gregorian calendar, b=
ut that the date plays a profound objective role in
the cosmic plan as we m=
ay understand this from the Mayan calendar
directly leading up to the birth=
 of a new world through the Ninth level,
9.9.9. It is an ideal time to part=
icipate in prayers and meditations
with the focus and intention of co-creat=
ing a new and20better world.
Additional tools for networking and communicat=
ion with the focus on the
Cosmic Convergence, July 17-18, 2012 will be deve=
loped as we go along.
9.9.9 may b e seen as an initial and modest initial c=
all for the
co-creation of the birth of a new world.
