I never talked of superficial things such as "complexion". Moreover, yo=
u are replacing Kaalika with crows in your sircasm and making fun really of=
 Tantra and Parasara.
 
*        *        *

ed?
 
Instead of getting caught in superficial and extraneous factors, let =
us go to the crux.
 
Mahavidyas and their consorts are not showing the same=
 thing, but two different things that have a synergy. The list of planets m=
apping to mahavidyas and those mapping to mahavidya consorts will according=
ly have to be different. I will elaborate with examples.
 
Each mahavidya r=
epresents one form of liberating supreme knowledge that helps one overcome =
duality and become liberated, starting from different vantage points within=
 duality and approaching liberation from them. Consorts are the factors tha=
t aid in that approach.
 
*        *        *
 
For example, Kaali is equat=
ed to Krishna by Munda Maalaa Tantra and Krishna is equated to Moon by Para=
sara. So Kaali is shown by Moon. From the perspective of Moon (mind), this =
duality is a very troublesome temptation and the way to overcome it is to r=
ealize its impermanence and destroy the duality so that it cannot tempt aga=
in.
 
During this process, the ideal companion of Moon is Saturn (vairagya =
and discipline). So the consort of Kaali shown by Moon is Mahakala shown by=
 Saturn.
 
Take Taaraa. She is equated to Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantra and =
Raama is equated to Sun by Parasara. So Taaraa is shown by Sun. From the pe=
rspective of Sun (soul), this duality is an ocean of delusion that needs to=
 be waded across to reach the supreme cosmic soul.
 
During this process, t=
he ideal companion of Sun is Jupiter (intelligence and discrimination). Jus=
t as rajaguru (Jupiter) guides king (Sun), the intellect and discrimination=
 will aid soul in the process of wading the ocean of duality and reaching t=
he supreme. So the consort of Taaraa shown by Sun is Akshobhya shown by Jup=
iter.
 
Take Chhinnamasta. She is equated to Bhaargava Raama by Munda Maala=
a Tantra and Bhaargava Raama is equated to Venus by Parasara. So Chhinnamas=
ta is shown by Venus. From the perspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duali=
ty needs to be enjoyed and not run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnam=
asta depicted accompanied by a naked couple in copulation and associates dr=
inking wine is that nothing is impure and all is Brahman. That is the take =
of Venus (enjoyment).
 
During this process, the ideal companion of Venus (=
enjoyment) is Ketu (detachment and egolessness). Only when the enjoyment is=
 gone through without ego and identification can it be conducive to liberat=
ion. So the consort of Chhinnamasta shown by Venus is Shiva-Kabandha shown =
by Ketu. Kabandha means the headless one.
 
As Dhumaavati is shown by Jupit=
er (dhee, i.e. intellect and discrimination), there is no need for a compan=
ion. If the force of dhee is there, one realizes that all is god and does n=
ot distinguish between good and bad, happy and sad etc and becomes liberate=
d easily. One with a strong aatmabala or manobala can waver and may need su=
pplementing influences, but one with a strong dheeshakti is fine. There is =
no supplementing influence.
 
*        *        *

Now let us take your exa=
mple. Mahatripuarasundari is equated to Kalki by Munda Mala Tantra and Kalk=
i is equated to lagna by Maharshi Parasara. So Tripura is lagna.

While Sun=
 and Moon show the soul and mind, lagna shows the individualized consciousn=
ess through which we operate in the world. It includes body and more. It is=
 lagna through which we act in the world. From the point of view of lagna, =
duality is to be overcome by doing what is expected from us by Nature and e=
ngaging in actions. Tripura personifies the supreme liberating knowledge of=
 using the individualized consciousness to engage in perfect actions in the=
 world to liberate oneself.

Now, the most useful companion of lagna in thi=
s process is Moon (mind). The actor within you (lagna) needs mind as mind t=
ells the actor what to do. Thus, the ideal companion of lagna is Moon. Acco=
rdingly, the consort of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna is Somanatha show=
n by Moon.
 
*        *        *
 
You can find similar logic for all of th=
em. Here is the full list:
 
1. Kaali (Moon) - Mahaa Kaala (Saturn)
2. Taar=
aa (Sun) - Akshobhya (Jupiter)
3. Mahatripurisundari (Lagna) - Somanaatha (=
Moon)
4. Bhuvaneswari (Rahu) - Tryambaka (Venus)
5. Bhairavi (Mars) - Daksh=
inaamurti (Sun)
6. Chhinamastaa (Venus) - Shiva-Kabandha (Ketu)
7. Dhumavat=
i (Jupiter) - None
8. Bagalaamukhi (Saturn) - Mahaa Rudra (Mars)
9. Maatang=
i (Mercury) - Shiva Maatanga (Rahu)
10. Kamalatmika (Ketu) - Vishnurupi Sad=
aashiva (Mercury)
 
Short notes on the ones I did not cover before:
 
Bhair=
avi represents the path of Mars, i.e. viewing the duality as a challenge th=
at needs to be fought hard and fearlessly and not fear anything, including =
death and pain. The ideal companion is aatmabala, represented by Sun, just =
as a good king (Sun) is an ideal supplement for a good commander (Mars).
 
=
Bagalaamukhi represents the path of Saturn, i.e. viewing the duality as tha=
t which results from one's own weaknesses, sins and internal enemies and se=
eing a conquest of internal enemies as the key to overcoming duality. The f=
ighting spirit represented by Mars is the ideal companion in the process of=
 overcoming enemies. Mahaa Rudra shown by Mars is hence the consort of Baga=
lamukhi.
 
Maatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the dualit=
y as that which needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome.=
 Free thinking without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal compan=
ion in this path. Maatanga means free spirited one or free roamer and Shiva=
 Maatanga is such a form of Shiva. He is the consort of Maatangi.
 
*      =
  *        *
 
Friends, there may be an outcry to my writings from astrolog=
ers used to a different planet-mahavidya map (which is NOT sanctioned by an=
y scripture and yet popular today in some circles). I may not be able to re=
spond to all the mails.
 
But please do bear in mind that there is a simple=
 and uniform philosophy behind the concept of Mahavidyas. Flowery expositio=
ns without a uniform philosophy and even a basic uniform understanding of w=
hat Mahavidyas are for are useless. If you are told logic like "Tripurasund=
ari holds sugarcane. Mercury shows sugar cane. So Tripurasundari is shown b=
y Mercury", reject such superficial logic. If somebody tells you that a mah=
avidya is for winning lawsuits or for getting power or getting wealth, reje=
ct such things.
 
Please remember that mahavidyas are forms of *supreme lib=
erating knowledge*. The path to liberation looks different from the point o=
f view of different planets.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

a 
(Ketu) - Vishnurupi Sadaashiva (Mercury)</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Sh=
ort notes on the ones I did not cover before:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
Bhairavi represents the path of Mars, i.e. viewing the duality as a 
challe=
nge that needs to be fought hard and fearlessly and not fear anything, 
inc=
luding death and pain. The ideal companion is aatmabala, represented by Sun=
, 
just as a good king (Sun) is an ideal supplement for a good commander 
(=
Mars).</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Bagalaamukhi represents the path of Sat=
urn, i.e. viewing the duality as 
that which results from one's own weaknes=
ses, sins and internal enemies and 
seeing a conquest of internal enem=
ies as the key to overcoming duality. The 
fighting spirit represented by M=
ars is the ideal companion in the process of 
overcoming enemies. Mahaa Rud=
ra shown by Mars is hence the consort of 
Bagalamukhi.</DIV>
<DIV> </D=
IV>
<DIV>Maatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the duality =
as that 
which needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome. =
Free thinking 
without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal compan=
ion in this path. 
Maatanga means free spirited one or free roamer and Shiv=
a Maatanga is such a 
form of Shiva. He is the consort of Maatangi.</DIV>

<DIV>Friends,=
 there may be an outcry to my writings from astrologers used to a 
differen=
t planet-mahavidya map (which is NOT sanctioned by any scripture 
and =
yet popular today in some circles). I may not be able to respond to all the=
 
mails.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>But please do bear in mind that there=
 is a simple and uniform philosophy 
behind the concept of Mahavidyas. Flow=
ery expositions without a uniform 
philosophy and even a basic uniform unde=
rstanding of what Mahavidyas are for are 
useless. If you are told logic li=
ke "Tripurasundari holds sugarcane. Mercury 
shows sugar cane. So Tripurasu=
ndari is shown by Mercury", reject such 
superficial logic. If somebody tel=
ls you that a mahavidya is for winning 
lawsuits or for getting power or ge=
tting wealth, reject such things.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Please remem=
ber that mahavidyas are forms of *supreme liberating 
knowledge*. The path =
to liberation looks different from the point of view of 
different planets.=

within us. The highest form of<BR>> knowledg=
e coming from delving deep into 
this aspect is what gives one<BR>> lear=
ning of various topics. If you master 
the knowledge that give you<BR>> =
mastery of all kinds of learning through 
logical and rational thinking,<BR=
>> other things will follow and you 
eventually get liberation. Maatangi=
<BR>> personifies this knowledge. In fact, 
some people associate Maatan=
gi with<BR>> Saraswati. Saraswati is also known 
as "Maatanga Kanya".<BR=
>> <BR>> Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and 
discrimination (dhee s=
hakti) within us.<BR>> The highest form of knowledge 
coming from delvin=
g deep into this aspect is<BR>> that all is delusion. The 
individual so=
ul and individual mind and everything<BR>> they perceive is just 
an ill=
usion. All that is there is Brahman. Any other<BR>> perceptions, of 
var=
ious good or bad things, are just a delusion, like<BR>> figures made of =

smoke. If you master the knowledge that makes your intellect<BR>> shine=
, you 
will realize that the entire world is a delusion and not deluded<BR>=
> by 
anything anymore. Then other things will follow and you eventually=
 get<BR>> 
liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowledge.<BR>> <B=
R>> Venus is the 
spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of kno=
wledge<BR>> coming from 
delving deep into this aspect is what makes one=
 egoless and<BR>> blissful. If 
you master the knowledge that makes you =
utterly fearless and<BR>> you do not 
fear anything, including death or =
pain, other things will follow<BR>> and you 
eventually get liberation. =
Chhinnamasta personifies this knowledge.<BR>> She 
is depicted as a deit=
y holding her own severed head, standing near a<BR>> 
naked couple in co=
pulation and surrounded by associates who are drinking<BR>> 
wine. One m=
astering this knowledge need not stay away from any 
pleasures,<BR>> but=
 one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, 
pleasure obtained<BR=
>> with an ego ("*I* am enjoying this act or object") 
binds. The headle=
ss state<BR>> symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome 
I-ness, pleas=
ures are not<BR>> binding. One not thinking in terms of "*I* am 
enjoyin=
g" but having no sense<BR>> of "I" can live life without running away 
f=
rom any pleasures or undertaking<BR>> any austerities and yet become 
li=
berated.<BR>> <BR>> Saturn is the spirit of hard work within us. He a=
lso 
represents our<BR>> weaknesses and sins. The highest form of knowle=
dge coming 
from delving deep<BR>> into this aspect is what makes us rea=
lize our internal 
enemies and destroy<BR>> them. If you master the know=
ledge that makes you 
overcome weaknesses such as<BR>> laziness and inte=
rnal enemies such as lust, 
anger, greed, jealosy etc, other<BR>> things=
 will follow and you eventually 
get liberation. Bagalamukhi<BR>> person=
ifies this knowledge. Most of her 
mantras ask to destroy enemies and<BR>&g=
t; so people foolishly think that she is 
the one who gives success in<BR>&=
gt; litigation and worship her for court cases. 
This is like going to a ki=
ng to<BR>> ask for two spoons of sugar for your 
milk. You go to the kin=
g for bigger<BR>> things and a neighbor is enough for 
giving you two sp=
oons of sugar. The<BR>> enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are 
internal e=
nemies and your own laziness.<BR>> Remember, she is a mahavidya, 
i.e. a=
 type of supreme knowledge that<BR>> liberates you!<BR>>  
<BR>&=
gt; Rahu is the spirit of material well-being within us. Rahu is the one 
w=
ho<BR>> binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sins and Rahu 
s=
howing<BR>> rebirth are important in the death chart). The highest form =
of 
knowledge<BR>> coming from delving deep into this aspect is what giv=
es us 
worldly success<BR>> in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowled=
ge that 
makes you materially<BR>> successful in a dharmik way, you beco=
me successful 
and fulfil all your<BR>> duties and debts in the world an=
d eventually get 
liberation. Bhuvaneswari<BR>> personifies this knowled=
ge.<BR>> <BR>> 
Ketu is the spirit of of detachment and Vedic knowled=
ge within us. The<BR>> 
highest form of knowledge coming from delving de=
ep into this aspect is 
the<BR>> essense of Veda. If you master the know=
ledge that enables you to be 
in<BR>> oneness with the supreme cosmic be=
ing, you eventually get liberation. 
Kamala<BR>> (Mahaalakshmi) personif=
ies this knowledge. According to 
saptashati rahasya<BR>> also, Mahaalak=
shmi is the Aadyaa (the first One). She 
is the energy of<BR>> supreme c=
osmic being. She divides Herself into 3 parts 
- Mahaakaali,<BR>> Mahaal=
akshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they create Brahma, 
Vishnu, Shiva and<BR>>=
; their consorts. Kamala represents the knowledge of the 
supreme cosmic en=
ergy<BR>> of the supreme cosmic being.<BR>> <BR>>

<BR>> <BR>> One of the above 
is not superior to the other. Depending=
 on your vasanas<BR>> (mental 
conditioning), attitudes, likes and disli=
kes, depending on which<BR>> aspect 
of your personality dominates over =
other aspects (the sinfulness and<BR>> 
weaknesses? or the interest in l=
earning things? or the spirit of 
fighting?<BR>> or the sense of enjoyme=

Take the one that is most<BR>&=

BR>> <BR>> There are some 
who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one=
 Mahavidya's mantra<BR>> for one 
month, then switch to another and so o=
n. They think that by doing<BR>> each 
mahavidya mantra for a certain co=
unt, they "finish" the mahavidya<BR>> 
sadhana. This is wrong and serves=
 no useful purpose. Instead, one should<BR>> 
pick any ONE mahavidya and=
 succeed in that sadhana. The definition of<BR>> 
success is that the kn=
owledge represented by that deity becomes part of 
your<BR>> common sens=
e - you understand that knowledge and ooze that 
knowledge in your<BR>> =
thoughts and actions. Whether you experience the deity 
as an external<BR>&=
gt; human-like form (who may impart some knowledge to you) or 
as an intern=
al<BR>> human-like form or as light or as sound is secondary, but 
the e=
nd result<BR>> should be that the knowledge represented by Her should 
b=
ecome common sense<BR>> and second nature to you. One claiming visions o=
r 
siddhi of a mahavidya but<BR>> not showing the corresponding knowledg=
e is 
bluffing.<BR>> <BR>> There are many people who do mahavidya sad=
hana and 
yet many others who claim<BR>> to have siddhi in one or more m=
ahavidyas, but 
very few who actually possess<BR>> any of the ten mahavi=
dyas. The area of 
mahavidya sadhana is one of the most<BR>> ill-underst=
ood in today's age of 
ignorance and half-baked knowledge. It is<BR>> ea=
sier to possess lower vidyas 
or lower shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond<B=

understanding for most people.<BR>> <BR>> B=
