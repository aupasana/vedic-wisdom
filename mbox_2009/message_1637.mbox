Namaste,

Yes, ideally deva rishi pitri tarpana are part of the daily ritual.

There are some differences in the mantras and procedures used by different 
people for homam and tarpana.

If you have been taught by your elders or gurus how to do homam or tarpana, 
please use that procedure instead of what I taught. What I taught is ONE 
way, but not the only way.

Best regards,
Narasimha
