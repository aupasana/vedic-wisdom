Yes, the world is vast. But the=
 space that matters to the goat is small and the goat's maneuvres within th=
at small space are quite important - they decide how much the goat is able =
to accomplish and how happy it is. See the example below of river and bucke=
t of water. In that example, goat's choice decides whether its thirst is qu=
enched or not.
 
Similarly, an ordinary person's free will works within a l=
imited space. There may be millions of things that are out of reach for an =
ordinary person. But, the maneuvres made within the limited space of possib=
ilities can have a considerable impact on that person's life.
 
*        * =
       *
 
Assuming that life and one's actions are predetermined based on =
horoscope, we are effectively saying that actions in one of the previous li=
ves (which determined the current horoscope) are determining all actions in=
 this life, hence the next life's horoscope, hence all actions in next life=
, hence the horoscope in the life after that one, and so on. This line of t=
hinking implies that choices made in one particular life predetermine a seq=
uence of lives. What a proposition!
 
*        *        *
 
BTW, Prasad, th=
anks for an awesome link. Seekers of knowledge who are genuinely interested=
 in this topic (the play of destiny and free will) should find this article=
 quite insightful. I bow to the wisdom of Swami Chandrashekhara Bharati, wh=
o is clearly a knower of Brahman.

simplest of analogies=
. His analogies are <BR>> usually quite apt and 
brilliant.<BR>> =
; <BR>> Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of past 
<BR>> actions=
) is like a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope restricts 
the moveme=
nt of the goat, but does not determine where the goat <BR>> goes 
and wh=
at it does! That is upto the goat's free will.<BR>>  <BR>> A 
th=
irsty goat may look at a river nearby and <BR>> despair as it cannot rea=
ch 
the river due to the rope. It may try and struggle <BR>> continually=
, without 
reaching the river. Another thirsty goat may realize that <BR>&g=
t; it cannot 
reach the river, accept that, look around, find a small bucke=
t of <BR>> water 
behind it within reach if it negotiates with the rope =
and the obstacles. 
<BR>> It may turn back, go, drink that water in the =
bucket and be 
happy.<BR>>  <BR>> While the destiny as frozen at=
 the time of birth 
<BR>> (and as reflected in the horoscope) is like th=
e rope tying the goat and 
the <BR>> surroundings of the goat, the actio=
ns of free will after birth are 
like the <BR>> actions of the goat - ho=
w it accepts and negotiates the rope 
and its <BR>> surroundings to get =
what it wants.<BR>>  <BR>> 
*      =

*        *<BR>>&nbs=
p; <BR>> Today's 
actions (karma) are tomorrow's destiny (karma). Some o=
f today's <BR>> actions 
may impact destiny in a future life. Some of to=
day's actions may modify <BR>> 
destiny for tomorrow (in this life itsel=
f!). Let me <BR>> extend Ramakrishna' 
s analogy to explain it.<BR>>&=
nbsp; <BR>> A goat tied to a tree with a 
rope may go around the tree a =
few times in one <BR>> direction and the rope 
may get shorter. It may n=
ow be unable to reach places it <BR>> was able to 
reach earlier. Simila=
rly, some bad acts of free will in this life <BR>> may 
tighten the dest=
iny, make things worse and reduce one's options.<BR>>  
<BR>> It=
 may go around the tree a few times in another direction and the rope 
may =
<BR>> get longer. It may now be able to reach places it was unable to 
r=
each earlier. <BR>> Similarly, some good acts of free will in this life =
may 
improve the destiny and <BR>> make more things possible.<BR>>&nb=
sp; 
*        <BR>> 
*  &nb=
sp;     *<BR>>  <BR>> One's mind 
is conditi=
oned based on one's destiny. <BR>> One's surroundings and life 
situatio=
ns faced by one are influenced by one's <BR>> destinty. One will be 
pul=
led in certain directions. One may feel attraction <BR>> for another 
pe=
rson. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw <BR>> obstacle=
s. 
One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be adored by <BR=
>> 
millions of people. And so on. One faces different life situations a=
t different 
<BR>> times and in different matters.<BR>>  <BR>>=
; However, destiny 
only shows how one (and one's <BR>> mind) is pulled =
in various directions and 
what life situations one finds oneself <BR>> =
in. Irrespective of the mental 
conditioning and one's circumstances, one c=
an <BR>> still choose between 
different actions. The actions taken by o=
ne are not fixed <BR>> based on the 
horoscope. For example, one person =
may abuse one badly and one may <BR>> feel 
great anger towards that per=
son, all on account of a previous karmik debt. 
<BR>> But, when badly pr=
ovoked, one can either succumb to the temptation and 
fight <BR>> back o=
r just ignore and move on.<BR>>  <BR>> Destiny 
places you in di=
fferent situations. What <BR>> you do in those situations is 
based on h=
ow you use your free will. In some <BR>> cases, free will has a lot 
of =
wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, <BR>> it has fewer 
opt=
ions. But, usually, you do have several options that may or may <BR>> no=
t 
be obvious and the action you finally choose shapes your <BR>> destin=
y in a 
future birth.<BR>>  <BR>> *     =
;   
<BR>> *        *<BR>&g=
t;  <BR>> 
Please note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma =
and the Sanskrit 
<BR>> word for action is also karma. Basically, action=
s of today become 
destiny of <BR>> tomorrow. You will get reaction in f=
uture to your current 
actions and destiny is <BR>> the sum total of tho=
se actions that will come 
back to you.<BR>>  <BR>> Each action =
of yours that impacts other 
beings and <BR>> objects of this universe w=
ill go towards forming your 
destiny for future. (Here <BR>> please note=
 that both physical and mental 
actions count. Any emotions you feel <BR>&g=
t; towards someone else and do not 
necessary express outwardly will also <=
BR>> impact that person in a subtle 
manner and hence counts as an <BR>&=
gt; action.)<BR>>  <BR>> Horoscope 
captures the good and bad ac=
tions, <BR>> committed physically or mentally to 
other beings, until th=
e current birth, which <BR>> are to give their 
reactions in this life. =
This is also known as <BR>> destiny.<BR>>  
<BR>> It does not=
 fix what you do in various situations <BR>> in your 
current life. You =
have the ability to make different choices at <BR>> 
important crossroad=
s. The choices you make are your karma (actions) and they 
<BR>> shape y=
our destiny for future. They may either impact your current life

>  <BR>> Anybody who 
tells you that so and so houses show <BR>&=

understand what free will is. Horoscope is =
the <BR>> frozen list of past 
karmas that form one's destiny for this l=
ife. It is like the <BR>> rope tying 
the goat. Acts of free will are li=
ke how the goat negotiates the rope <BR>> 
and moves around within the p=

<BR>> hands of the goat.<B=
R>>  <BR>> The scope and options 
available to free will can be =
<BR>> estimated from the horoscope, but the 
exact acts of free will are=
 unpredictable <BR>> based on horoscope. To 
complicate things further, =
how exactly free will has been <BR>> used until 
now in this life (which=
 cannot be seen from the horoscope) has <BR>> an 
impact on the scope an=

p;    *<BR>>  <BR>> I am not 
downplaying astrolo=
gy. Going back to the <BR>> original Chiranjeevi 
prediction, the predic=
tion that he would come into politics <BR>> in 
2007-2009 and enjoy some=
 kind of power was made using astrology. When someone 
<BR>> is already =
a candidate, even a random prediction of success or failure 
has <BR>> a=
 1/2 or 1/3 probability. But, when there are no signs on the 
ground, a <BR=
>> prediction on one's political entry in a specific timeframe 
has a ve=
ry low <BR>> probability. Such a low probability prediction made 7 
year=
s ahead using <BR>> astrology came true. Moreover, we have all seen many=
 
cases where astrology <BR>> worked spectacularly. I am not saying astr=
ology 
is nonsense. But I am saying <BR>> that we do not attempt to unde=
rstand its 
shortcomings.<BR>>  <BR>> When someone's free will w=
orks in a 
predictable <BR>> way, i.e. when one's free will has very few=
 options and/or 
one reacts to life <BR>> situations thrown up by the de=
stiny in predictable 
ways, job of an astrologer is <BR>> easier. But, w=
hen free will has a wide 
range of options and/or one used the free <BR>>=
; will powerfully, the gap 
between the destiny as reflected by horoscope a=
nd the <BR>> actual destiny as 
a result of those actions may make an as=
trologer <BR>> fail.<BR>>
