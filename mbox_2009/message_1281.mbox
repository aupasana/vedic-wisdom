Namaste,
=C2=A0
> Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do=
 homan of it
=C2=A0
That is not a valid reason. Even a very powerful mantra=
 can be offered in homam. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri mant=
ra are very very powerful mantras and they are offered in homam. On the Tan=
trik side, Pratyangira mantra, Mahasudarsana mantra, Paashupata mantra etc=
=C2=A0are very very powerful astra mantras=C2=A0and they are offered in hom=
am. As these examples show, even very powerful mantras can be offered in fi=
re for amplification.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The power of powerful m=
antras is a mirage for most people. The experience given by a mantra and th=
e internal/external results brought by a mantra vary from mantra to mantra.=
 But, even with a very powerful mantra, one needs to be ready for the mantr=
a to actually work.
=C2=A0
When one is able to perfectly control the mind a=
nd *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating i=
n the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absor=
ption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by =
the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and=
 that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and correspondi=
ng karmic interactions between various objects. 
=C2=A0
There may be thousa=
nds of paths to climb a mountain. Each path takes one to a different spot a=
top the mountain. The view one has from the top may be different accordingl=
y. One view may be more breathtaking and amazing than another. However, one=
 taking a path leading to a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading=
 to a normal view both have to struggle on their paths and reach the top de=
spite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, but none is too easy. =
All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a more breathtaking vie=
w than the others.
=C2=A0
Similarly, one chanting a "powerful mantra" and a=
 "normal mantra" will both have to put in effort and overcome the weaknesse=
s and get control over mind. The power of the powerful mantra refers to a m=
ore powerful experience after one succeeds with the mantra (more breathtaki=
ng scenery on reaching the mountain top). It is not correct to think that t=
hings will happen automatically and easily because one if chanting a powerf=
ul mantra 11 (or whatever) times.

Coming back =
to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommend homam with Kunjika stotra. Kunji=
ka stotra is a coded stotra containing several mantras in coded form. It is=
 not what it may seem to be. It is for a reason that Shiva tells Parvati th=
at this prayer should be hidden like one's privates. It is weird that we ar=
e discussing such a secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a collection =
of powerful mantras for specific prayogas that would be considered raajasik=
/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the actions is actin=
g them out as an instrument of the Divine.
=C2=A0
I see no point in wanting=
 to do homam with it. If you are meant to do a homam with Kunjika stotra to=
 stop the army of a country in their tracks or kill someone or delude someo=
ne etc and if you are detached enough to carry it off successfully, then yo=
u will be given an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. Otherwise, =
why even try?
=C2=A0
My advice is to drop the idea of doing a homam with Ku=
njika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses). If that is too long fo=
r you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th chapter or just the 11th =
chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just the moola mantra (navaak=
shari) .
=C2=A0
If one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well,=C2=
=A0a homam with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.
