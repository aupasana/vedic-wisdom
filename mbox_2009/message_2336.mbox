Dear Sir, It's true that sandhyavandanam is prescribed  only for brahmins { also kshaaatriyas and vaishyas ]  after undergoing upanayanam. But recital of Gayatri mantra is done by  anyone who is interested . Shraddha is important ./ I know a case  a nadar and gounder couple  who suffered losses in business.,  succeeded after reciting  the Gayatri for 108 times daily . which they are still doing. the same is tsaught in some selected foreign schools { Iheard and re  ad in newspapers}.   It is a  universal mantra given a kshatriya rishi. can we claim sole rights for this?   Sarve janah sukhina bavantu is our motto and even we pray in Gayatri as Deemahi in plural. I feel there is nothing wrong if everybody recites with shradda and not casually including ladies.   R.Doraiswami

 Sandhyavandanam can be performed only those who have undergone Upanayanam samskaram, which is not prescribed for ladies. This is one of the reasons why Veda Adhyayanam was also not prescribed for ladies, since Veda Adhyayanam is to be started only after Upanayanam. During periods ladies need perfect rest. They should not be asked do domestic chores, what to talk of Pooja etc.? This was being strictly observed in all Brahmin families upto probably the early1900s. Now-a-days, people have scant regard for such observances. Not only that. They also laugh at ladies (Rajaswalas)observing the routine prescribed during periods. There could be genuine and  practical difficulties in observing what used to be known as Upahati  or 'thooram". It is considered as another form of untouchability by the younger generation.
