Dear Raviji and all,
Namaskar.

I have also seen earlier photographs of Nar=
asimhaji. The video shoot, let me tell you was excellent- showed=C2=A0us a =
different Narasimhaji. I could see the inner tejas that shone through, that=
 *pure* *thought*.
I could really understand most of what he *teaches *us m=
ore effectively... I dont know why????
You are really fortunate to be that =
closely associated with him.

As for me, I have religiously downloaded all =
the homam manuals and have been contemplating starting with them for a whil=
e now ): When I read about the video=C2=A0upload I thought I should really =
start doing it. I started to download the shoot and thought I should probab=
ly start with Ganapati Homam and=C2=A0wondered if I also start Chandi homam=
... May try that telugu colloquial .. Avakayato annaprasana. We were watchi=
ng TV- Animal planet.. suddenly there was a doc about elephants and lo... t=
here was MahaGanapathi....=C2=A0the documentary started off with Vinayaka, =
his temples etc. I was spellbound!!! I have always given a lot of importanc=
e to these subtle messages, that is one of my many weaknesses (: I have als=
o received a lot of reassurances from Her that way. Then there was another =
documentary , infact the very next one on tigers and there was=C2=A0Durga M=
ata riding a tiger=C2=A0before the start of the doc. I resolved there and t=
hen that it was her 'anugna' to start.
Sadly, when I enquired locally (New =
Zealand) at the Indian shops I could not find Homa Kundam... Though the hav=
an samagri is all sold as a package..
I shall make my efforts to get one so=
on with Her Grace.. Ido not still know if *I* am cleansed enough to receive=
 that Blessing from Her.
Heartfelt thanks for the invaluable video which wa=
s full of that vibrating energy which could be felt coming through....

Namaskaara=C2=A0 Ravi,
Very moving words -straight from the=

Such humility is to be imbibed by a=

Namaste

The video is very good, Good work b=
y the video grapher and Narasimha.
It was a pleasure watching it and I feel=
 that I will watch it a few 
more times.

Most importantly I want to bring =
out the fact that when one does a lot
japams and homams, the good work is r=
eflected in the persons face, 
the lustre etc. Although I have not met Nara=
simha ever, I have seen 
one picture of him may be from many years ago and =
now the video. 
There is a striking difference between the two.

The transf=
ormation internally may be more intense and fantanstic.

On a different not=
e, I have heard from a very realized soul that
The Saffron color or the Gar=
oua color one donned by monks is reserved 
for them, it is not advisible fo=
r people like us married or single to 
put it on. Many years ago the realiz=
ed sould did explain me the 
reasons but I dot remember more things about.
=

I have seen in Acharya Rajnish order a lot of family oriented people 
putt=
ing it on. 

The color signifies detachment.

What the the views of the peo=
ple here?

Best Regards
Mitesh
