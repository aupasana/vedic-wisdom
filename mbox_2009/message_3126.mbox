Namasthe Narasimha garu,  Since we live in a town that does not have a temp=
le or very many priests, we are planning to perform the pitru tarpana using=
 the manuals you provided.  We moved into the new house about six months ag=
o.  Can we perform Pitru tarpana at our house?  My folks are of the opinion=
 that our new house is a blessing of our elders, and therefore should be a =
perfect place to offer respects to our elders.  Pls suggest.  Thanks,
