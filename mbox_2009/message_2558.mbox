 1. Choose the highest ideal and live your life upto that. Look at the
"ocean" and not at the wave.

2. That which tends to increase the divinity in you is virtue, and that
which tends to increase brutality in you is vice.

3. He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really
worships Shiva.

4. Purity in thought, speech, and act is absolutely necessary for anyone to
be religious. Purity is strength. Spiritual truth is purity.


5. The ideal of the man is to see God in everything. The real evil is
idleness which is the principal cause of our poverty.

6. Everyone should know that there is no salvation except through the
conquering of desires.

7. Death being so certain, it is better to die for a good cause.

8. Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.

9. Your country reqires heroes, be heroes!

10. To me the very essence of education is concentration of the mind, not
the collecting of facts.

11. Each soul is potentially divine.

12. Religion is the idea which is raising the brute unto man, and man unto
God.

13. All power is within you; you can do anything and everything. Believe in
that.

14. Work, work, work - let this be your motto.

15. Now the only way out is to listen to the words of the Lord in the Gita.

16. Be a hero. Always say, "I have no fear".

17. Struggle hard to get money, but don't get attached to it.

18. Feel that you are great and you become great.

19. To devote your life to the good of all and to the happiness of all is
religion. Whatever you do for your own sake is not religion.

20. At my will mountains will crumble up. Have that sort of energy, that
sort of will; work hard, and you will reach the goal.

21. It is those foolish people who identify themselves with their bodies
that piteously cry, 'Weak, weak, we are weak'.

22. Keep the motto before you: "Elevation of the masses without injuring
their religion".

23. Man never progresses from error to truth, but from truth to truth, from
lesser truth to higher truth.

24. Avoid all weakness, for weakness is sin, weakness is death.

25. Never talk about the faults of others, no matter how bad they may be.
Nothing is ever gained by that.

26. I shall inspire men everywhere until the world shall know that it is one
with God.

27. Let us go forward and do yet greater things.

28. The more selfish a man, the more immoral he is.

29. Give to the weak, for there all the gift is needed.

30. Knowledge exists, man only discovers it.

31. Give up all desire for enjoyment in earth or heaven.

32. Be courageous. Do not try to lead your brethren, but serve them.

33. Be the witness and do not react, only thus can you be happy.

34. None can help you, help yourself; work out your own salvation.

35. Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvellous work.

36. Try to love anybody and everybody.

37. You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make
you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul. Know it for
certain that you are in everything.

38. Go on bravely. Do not expect success in a day or a year.

39. Let all your nerves vibrate through the backbone of your religion.

40. Do not talk much, but feel the spirit within you.

41. If you want to be spiritual, you must renounce.

42. Your way is the best for you, but that is no sign that it is the best
for others.

43. Renounce the lower so that you may get the higher.

44. Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and
in every living being?

45. Your work is to serve the poor and miserable, without distinction of
caste or colour.

Help another because you are in him and he is in you.

46. The poor, the illiterate, the ignorant, the afflicted,.. .let these be
your God. Know that service to these alone is the highest religion.

47. If I am in the dark, let me light a lamp.

48. The earth's bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the
good of many, for the welfare of all.

49. Every duty is holy, and devotion to duty is the highest form of worship
of God.

50. We only get what we deserve. It is a lie when we say, the world is bad
and we are good. It can never be so.

51. You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little
of strong blood in you.

52. It is struggle against nature and not conformity to nature that makes
man what he is.

53. Each work has to pass through these stages - ridicule, opposition and
then acceptance.

54. First there should be strict integrity... Secondly, entire devotion to
the cause.

55. The will is not free - it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect -
but there is something behind the will which is free.

56. You fail only when you do not strive sufficiently to manifest infinite
power.

57. Whatever you do, devote your whole Mind, Heart, and Soul to it.

58. Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak
you will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.

59. Never mind failures; they are quite natural, they are the beauty of life
- these failures.

60. He works best who works without any motive, neither for money, nor for
fame, nor for anything else.

61. The new religion says that he is an atheist who does not believe in
himself.

62. Neither seek nor avoid, take what comes.

63. You should work like a master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but
do not do a slave's work.

64. Believe that the soul is immortal, infinite and all powerful.

65. Even if the order be wrong, first obey and then contradict it.

66. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves; because to advance we must have
faith in ourselves first and then in God.
