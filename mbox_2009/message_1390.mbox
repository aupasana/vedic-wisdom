Namaste
 
Though Narasimhaji discourages jyotish discussion in this forum, =
I am 
still sending this mail because I found something very interesting an=
d 
(maybe) relevant to homas.

I was just checking Pt Sanjay Rath's website=
 on Saptarishi Nkahstra 
Dasas and this period of time (decade till 2009) i=
s supposed to be 
under the Bharani nakshtra. No wonder terrorism has becom=
e such an 
issue now. The next decade would be under Krittika. That could w=
ell 
spark off a movement in Homas across the world in a big way. Krittika =

is of course all about fire.

-Regards
 Rajarshi
