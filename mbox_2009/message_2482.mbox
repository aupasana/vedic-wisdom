 If there were not, in each religion, at least one word which could reveal
=
the transcendental Supreme Thing in the Heart, as clearly as a mountain on =
a
plain, then all the researches and arguments found in the scriptures of t=
hat
religion would become nothing but the hubbub of a cattle market.

Sadhu=
 Om: It is asserted in this verse that at least one word or saying
[Mahavak=
ya] which easily reveals the fact that Self is the Supreme Reality
will be =
found in every true religion existing on earth. Some of those
pointed out b=
y Sri Bhagavan are:

in Hinduism =96 =93Tat twam asi=94, =93Aham Brahmasmi=
=94, etc.
in Islam =96 =93Ana=92l-Haq=94;
in Judaism and Christianity =96 =
=93I AM THAT I AM=94.

These words clearly show that God is the Reality of =
the first person, =91I=92.

Know that the bright light of fire that rises w=
ithin, kindled by more and
more inwardly grinding the mind,which has been m=
ade free from impurities, on
the stone of heart through [the enquiry] =91Wh=
o am I?=92, is the true knowledge
=93Ana=92l-Haq=94 [I am the reality].

Sa=
dhu Om: If a religion is a true one, at least one sacred utterance of
Mahav=
akya which reveals the transcendent nature of Self,should be found in
its s=
criptures. If such a Mahavakya were not found in its scriptures, it
would n=
ot be a true religion. For example,Sri Bhagavan used to point out the
peerl=
ess Mahavakya =91I am that I am=92 which is revealed in the Holy Bible. In
=
the same manner, He also used to point out the sacred utterance =91Ana=92l-=
Haq=92
in the Islamic Religion al-Haq is one of the 99 names of Allah, and =
means
=91the reality=92 or =91the truth=92; =93Ana=92l-Haq=94 means =91I am=
 the reality=92, and is a
sacred utterance made by Hallaj, a famous Sufi Sa=
ge]. Sri Bhagavan used to
explain that the final aim of all these religions=
 is to make one know the
Self.

Those who always worship the holy Feet of A=
llah [God] will achieve all
benefits and happiness together, having extingu=
ished all the fire of
suffering of the imaginary mental life led by them on=
 account of wicked and
sinful actions [karmas].

Sadhu Om: Since this is ad=
vice given to some Muslims, Sri Bhagavan used the
word =91Allah=92 instead =
of God.
