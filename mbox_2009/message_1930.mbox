Namaste Narasimha,

Here's what the Mundamala Tantra states (not in correct=
 itrans format):

kriShnaastu kaalika saakshaat raamamoortischa taariNii |
=
vaaraaho bhuvana prokta nrsimho bharavishvarii ||
dhoomavatii vamanaH syaat=
 chinnaa bhrighukulodbhavaAH |
kamalaa matsyaroopaAH syaat koormastu bagala=
mukhii ||
maatangii baudh ityeSHa Shodashii kalkiroopinii ||


Some of the =
reason for the mapping given is:

Varaha as the boar that dug deep to uplif=
t Mother Earth (Bhuvaneshvari)
Bhairavi is the burning tapas of that shoots=
 forth and destroys all evil but not to aspirants (like Narasimha deva bein=
g kind to Prahalada)
Parasurama cut the head of his mother Renuka (Chinnama=
sta)
Kamalatmika robed in the waters of consciousness is behind the Matsya =
the primordial fish in the vivifying waters of creation.
Bagalamukhi is sti=
fling force of Kurma avtara that lies still and motionless withdrawing its =
limbs into itself.
Matangi is the Vaikhari Vak behind the avatara of Buddha=
 who had come to articulate the message of truth.

Regards
Narayan
