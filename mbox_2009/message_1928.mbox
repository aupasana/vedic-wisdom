Dear Vijayji
=A0
Thanks for the post. I will try to=A0look up the slokas fo=
r the instances you have mentioned. Is the Chandrasena story mentioned in t=
he Valmiki Ramayana?
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi
=A0


=A0

The upsurge (of co=
nsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Rajarshi,

Rama gives an explanation to Vali who asks t=
he same question and Vali gets convinced. How ever, going by a story I read=
, Angada, who is son of Vali takes birth as a hunter in Dwaparayuga and mis=
takes Krishna's leg fingers to be ears of a deer and shoots an arrow with w=
hich Krishna concludes his avataram.

Killing an animal from behind is allo=
wed and Rama equates Vali to an animal for his behaviour to his brother.

I=
 disagree that Rama was unaware of his deviness. In fact, during the war wi=
th Ravana, on a specific day he tell his men "Only I and Siva can shower ar=
rows in this manner". If he were to behave like an ordinary man, he can not=
 say he knew Siva's amstery with bow & arrow.

How can an ordinary man best=
ow boon of eternal life to others? (Hanuman and Jambavantha) . Rama also gr=
ants a boon to Jambavantha that he would fight him in next birth.

Rama, no=
 doubt knew who he was. In another story, Rama tells Chandrasena that he wo=
uld marry her in his next birth as Krishna (and Chandrasena is Satyabhama).=
 So, many instances where he gives clear indications that he knew he is no =
ordinary man.

How ever, as Utpal said earlier, he lived a life as an ordin=
ary man. 

Best regards,
Vijay
