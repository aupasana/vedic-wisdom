Dear Rajesh,
Accept my apology in advance - This mail is harsh in tone.

Th=
e way you have put the question, it is clear you are only seeking us to say=
 "You are forced to do bad thing, and hence it is okay!".

You made it abun=
dantly clear that you can not leave this activity ("I am not in a position =
to leave this"). If you yourself feel guilty, there is no reason why you sh=
ould seek others opinion. If you are open to leave this activity, then aski=
ng this question to others makes sense.

Your statement that if you do not =
do, some one else will do is also wrong in attitude.

If a act is bad in na=
ture, both the following arguments are wrong in attitude:
1. I know this is=
 bad, but I am forced to do
2. If I don't do, some else will do. So, this a=
ct will any way happen. I can do it and I am only a nimitta.

If you stop t=
his activity, you may losse the additional money, and hence loose comforts =
and may have to go through financial problems. You have to make a judgement=
 if you are mentally and physically strong to face it. If you are not ready=
 for it, try to explore another avenue to get revenue by doing an act that =
does not make you guilty.

Personally, I do not feel writing TV episodes is=
 a bad karma. Yes, the characters may be behaving badly, but, I am not real=
ly sure, if that results in bad behaviour in the viewers.

My personal opin=
ion and others personal opinions apart, if you feel guilty about, you plan =
for leaving it. That is my advice.

Best regards,
Vijay
