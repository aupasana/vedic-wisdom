Dear PVR and Members,
I would like to add some thing here to ongoing discus=
sion. A spritual 
aspirant should start 'Puja' or Sadhana without thinking =
too much of 
externalities like cleaniness, posture, room, M C etc. As one =

progresses, one learns what is good for him/her. Such is marvelous 
way of=
 God, who imparts neccessary and commensurate knowledge to 
sadhaka. More o=
ne is in sadhana, more one learns about correct method 
of sadhana. What is=
 of utmost importance is 'devotion' to god. 
Greater the devotion, greater =
degree of learning. This knowledge is 
built in 'SELF' as u progress, self =
becomes prominent, and thus 
knowledge thorugh subtle ways is revealed to i=
ndividual. 

But above does not discount the importance of formal knowledge=
 of 
sadhana and puja. That helps a lot. But it sometimes happen that 
peop=
le get bogged down by extenalities.

Regards,
Sanjeev
