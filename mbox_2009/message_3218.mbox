Namaste Prasanna,

I've seen over some years and almost convinced that argu=
ments and debates does not make sense to people.

That is why i bluntly giv=
e my opinion if pressed hard and that is -"I dont want to kill and eat".
Pl=
ain and simple. No other reasoning.
and debates are closed! 

Thanks & Rega=
rds,

Utpal
