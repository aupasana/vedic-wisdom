Dear Siva,

These are my personal views and they maybe wrong and egoistic s=
o i appeal of forgiveness before:

If you think your GURU to be GOD know th=
at for sure that HE IS GOD
and let not the view of the world shake your fai=
th.
One more thing friend spirituality is not a subject of debate or discus=
sion but OF REALISATION as i feel.
You have taken your GURU or i think we t=
ake our GURU as a ladder to reach GOD'S house.When you are climbing never l=
ook down to what others are saying.If you want to hear and see from someone=
 let that be ONLY and ONLY your GURU.Either you will reach hell or you will=
 reach heaven.But you will reach somewhere and will not be stranded with th=
ose persons shouting below.
Wishing all the luck in your spiritual journey =
and may Lord Shiva guide you through.

 I did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what d=

 Why did he accept to debate the infamous Zakir Naik on Hinduism? Sri Sri R=

Let me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a f=

 guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having t=

ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master i=

 and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to gui=

AOL is world's largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor=
 its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go=
 to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full tim=
e teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in prope=
rty to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither need=
s all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went throug=
h very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge t=
o the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be reveale=
d to maximum number of people.
