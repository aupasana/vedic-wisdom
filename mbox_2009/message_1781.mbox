Hi PVR,

I disagree here. Intellect is disliked because it questions. And =
when the answers are not comfortable with our existing beliefs we find excu=
se to quite our mind. There are many ways to find God. Intellect never hind=
ers. The same way pride also has many disguise. One can be proud of humilit=
y or one's devotion to god as well. 

So saying such a thing actually confu=
ses people and set wrong beliefs in mind.

Regards,
Siya.
