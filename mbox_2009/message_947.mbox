Namaste Ashwin Ji,

Are you doing the Homa as per the Mahaganapati Manual b=
y Narasimha?

if yes, then in that manual, there are FEW verses which are r=
elated 
to Invocation of MahaGanapati.

"SHRI MAHAGANAPATI PRAAN PRATISHTHA=
PAN MANNTRASYA. GANAK RUSHI....."

"AAM, HREEM, KROUNM, YAM, RAM, LAM,SHAM.=
....SHRI MAHAGANAPATI PRAAN 
SHAKTYEI NAMAH" 
"AAVAAHITO BHAV, STHAPITOBHAV=
, SANNIHITO BHAV...."

The above clearly explains that one is welcoming Shr=
i MahaGanapati 
from one's Heart to enter into Fire & Idol. One is requesti=
ng The 
lord to stay in the fire (and idol if applicable) till homa 
conclu=
sion and accept the aahutis offered.

warm regards,

Utpal

 Directly I am starting homam with Adhaar

giving 12 ahutis of Maha Ganapati Mantra, =
then immediately 24 Gayatri

am not inviting any deity in fire. Some confusio=

so this clarification is needed Sir.
