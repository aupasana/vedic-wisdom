namaste,

I have done Basic course (Sudarshan Kriya), Advance course and DS=
N course (Padma Saadhana) of AOL. recommend to do Basic and DSN as they giv=
e very good tool namely Sudarshan Kriya and Padma Sadhanaa respectively.

i=
 followed Sudarshan Kriya for almost 2 years and Padmasaadhana also for man=
y months before i started Homam and Chandi Paath.

In my opinion "Padma Saa=
dhana" is the best process of AOL which calms down Body as well as Mind to =
agreat extent.

Regards,

Utpal
