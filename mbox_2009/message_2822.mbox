Namaste VemparlaRamKishore ji,

i am sorry to deviate from the Subject

> I=
t is my humble opinion that the Avatars of Christ and Mohammed >came to atl=
east steer the western continent towards a little >dharma. The modern day v=
ersions of both these faiths have deviated >much from the original messages=
.

I agree completely to your opinion. it is opinion of mine as well. IM no=
t really humbleO, The west and the middle east was probably so much in dark=
 period (spiritually) that there required some person(S) who can lead them =
to some dharma in their daily routine. However i try, i can not agree to th=
e notion that *ours is the only right path and others will go to hell*. So =
either the books available are not the same versions given by prophets like=
 Jesus and Mohammed OR it may have been the need of the time which was to b=
e eventually a great threat in the future.

In the same breath, i have rese=
rvation about ISCON as well. I see fanaticism there as well. Their marketin=
g really puts question mark and repel people. Some of the forcible teaching=
s such as Krishna is the supreme God and others are demi gods (Gods which h=
old lesser portfolios). It is very amusing at times ....They show in their =
Yearly calendar that Vishnu and other Incarnations are actually of Krishna =
and not of Vishnu. The same goes for different branches within Hinduism and=
 their fight of supremacy over each other such as Vaishnavites and Shaivite=
s, Advaitins and Dvaitins etc=85 etc=85

Apologizing in advance if written =
something harsh but truth is sometimes better told as it is.

Best Regards,=


Utpal
