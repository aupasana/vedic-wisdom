Namaste,
 
I want to expand on some thoughts I shared towards the end of th=
e mail. Some people emphasize the vedantic philosophy and de-emphazie ritua=
ls, whereas some people are so deeply immersed in rituals.
 
*        *    =
    *
 
The concept "I am god" (aham brahmaasmi) or "you are That" (tattvam=
asi) is very dangerous for many people. Though it is undoubtedly the ultima=
te truth, half-baked understanding of this supreme truth may result in chao=
s in one's spiritual life. As I keep emphasizing, all these non-dualistic (=
adwaitic) concepts are applicable to one who has transcended duality. If op=
posites such as pleasure and pain, life and death, heaven and hell, praise =
and criticism etc are one and the same for a person and one sees the same "=
Self" in all those opposites, then one can say "aham brahmaasmi". One who s=
ees these differently and finds one thing desirable and the other thing und=
esirable is not yet ready to declare "aham brahmaasmi". Just as one who stu=
died calculus at school but forgot it *completely* now cannot claim "I know=
 calculus", one who sees pleasure and pain differently has forgotten one's =
true nature and it is futile to pretend "aham brahmaasmi".
 
I can give a p=
arable to loosely explain this. A king forgot that he was king. His face, b=
ody and personality changed. His mannersims, demeanor and style of speaking=
 also changed. He left his palace, went to a nearby forest and started livi=
ng in a hut. Somebody came oneday and reminded him that he was the king. He=
 then said "I am the king. Let me go and take control of the palace." When =
he went and tried to command the palace guards, he was not recognized and b=
eaten up by his own guards. As his face, behavior, mannerisms and whole per=
sonality was different, he could not convince them he was the king. Instead=
 of directly going to the palace, he should have practiced the behavior, ma=
nnerisms and style of speaking of king and then gone to the palace. Then he=
 stood a chance of convincing the guards that he was the king.
 
Similarly,=
 each person is god. However, until one learns (again!) how to think, act a=
nd be like god, one is human. Until one learns how to look at pleasure and =
pain, life and death, praise and crtiticism, heaven and hell etc with an eq=
ual mind, one has not gotten back the characteristics needed. Until then, "=
aham brahmaasmi" is merely a theoretical statement.
 
Somebody told me abou=
t a story apparently from Sai Baba's charitra. One guru taught "aham brahma=
asmi" to a sishya. It misled him, he became proud and started looking at gu=
rus, elders and all with disrespect and with a sense of pride and self-impo=
rtance. At the end of his life, he went to hell and met his guru there. He =
said "I can understand how I, with my arrogant behavior and half knowledge,=
 ended up here. But why are you here?" The guru said "for teaching tattva t=
o somebody not ready like you!"
 
Let the highest truths of vedanta be at t=
he back of your mind, but make sure that they do not mislead you or do dame=
 to your spiritual progress.
 
*        *        *
 
The concept "I am god"=
 is so powerful and prone to abuse. It seems like there are variations of i=
t in new age spiritualism. I have seen some books that marry positive and m=
otivational psychology to "I am god" concept of vedanta and pass it off as =
a spiritual path and as aatma jnaana (self-knowledge). Self-realization is =
not feeling good about yourself, feeling confident about yourself and getti=
ng whatever you want. Supreme cosmic being (Shiva or Krishna or whatever yo=
u call) is the most powerful and can get anything, because he does not want=
 anything.The dogma "you can get whatever you want if you want it enough" c=
an lead to a little progress, but one will get stuck. It is very unlikely t=
o result in self-realization.
 
The goal of sadhana is to pay back previous=
 debts, remove the sense of I-ness in all actions, cut off desires and reac=
h a state where there is no different between opposites and there is nothin=
g that is desirable and nothing that is undesirable. It comes with sacrific=
e and surrender and not with self-importance and self-centeredness. In an u=
nprepared person, the statement "I am god" can induce self-importance, self=
-centeredness, arrogance and false self-assurance.
 
Though unmanifested Br=
ahman and manifested Brahman are the same in reality, there is a big differ=
ence between them in the eyes of a person who is immersed in the delusions =
(opposites) of the manifested universe.
 
*        *        *
 
While vedan=
ta is fraught with dangers for the unprepared, the path of ritualism has it=
s share of pitfalls. Many people engage in rituals without understanding wh=
at they are meant for. One stuck in the material world needs to engage in a=
ctions using the objects of material world as symbols and these symbols wil=
l eventually trigger the correct thinking in the mind. There are many pries=
ts who do a nice pooja or homam and then feel so proud about it. Actions en=
gaged by one who is not making any effort to reduce the sense of "I am doin=
g" in those actions are fruitless. As the sense of "I am doing" comes down,=
 one's actions will have more nectar and less poison. Rituals and various a=
ctions engaged by many people are poisoned by the sense of "I am doing" and=
 the associated pride. If a ritual is performed with a sense of surrender, =
then the ritual works and increases the surrender further. As surrender is =
increased, ritual will become better. As ritual becomes better, surrender b=
ecomes better. One has to gain a sufficient level of internal purity in ord=
er to break through into the groove.
 
One not realizing this will continue=
 to run after the irrelevant and useless. Such a person may cleanly bathe i=
n the best rivers, wear the cleanest and most beautiful clothes prescribed =
in scriptures and do the rituals following each instruction carefully. But,=
 the strong sense of I-ness and pride may poison everything and take a long=
 time for the person to make progress.
 
*        *        *
 
This is why =
I keep emphasizing that external rituals and internal transformation should=
 go hand in hand. Only one will not help. Both are needed. Consciously intr=
ospect your thoughts and cut off pride and selfishness at their root whenev=
er you encounter them in your thoughts and then take advantage of rituals w=
ith a sense of surrender. This combination will make one lose the false sen=
se of I-ness completely and then realize the true Self.
 
>From "somebody" (=
limited sense of I-ness), most people have to first become a "nobody" (each=
 layer of that I-ness shed off) before becoming "everybody" (realizing the =
Self as the all-pervading spirit).

Narasimha

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Why ritua=
ls?


  Namaste,

  Some intelligent and rational people wonder why we need=
 to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want to explai=
n this basic point with an analogy.

  We teach some phrases and manners to=
 small children. For example, we tell small children to say "thank you" whe=
n someone helps or say "I am sorry" when they do something wrong. A really =
small child does not even understand what those words mean, but repeats the=
m out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the true me=
aning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what they t=
ruly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually underst=
ood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a =
mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a chil=
d accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external=
 world through senses), the child's thinking expands and one gets more clar=
ity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry,=
 one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain=
 emotion (sadness and compassion).

  Similarly, one may be doing rituals l=
ike homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully unders=
tanding or appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many years wi=
thout fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand a=
nd even experience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and=
 spiritual truths are actually understood from experience alone. One can ne=
ver fully understand what one has never experienced. As we accumulate more =
experiences (stored perceptions of the external and internal world through =
external senses and the inward directed mind), one's thinking expands and o=
ne gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths one has been expo=
sed to.

  Rituals in various religions are designed to symblize some truth=
s that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere explanation of the symbo=
lism is often useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain =
to a one year old child what the word "sorry" means in detail, the child wi=
ll not understand. The best thing to do is to just get the child into the h=
abit of saying "I am sorry" in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning=
 will become clearer and clearer with experience and the correct emotions w=
ill come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibl=
y with mistakes and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mi=
nd - will slowly understand it and experience it.

  Some religions have do=
ne the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the=
 final truths. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former help=
s one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the base o=
f hill before reaching its top, one often needs to engage in some external =
practices in order to realize internal truths. Of course, it is good to rem=
ind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest one should get stuck at the=
 base or in the middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate the first step=
s. Just saying "you are That. Just realize that you are That" is not an act=
ion plan. It does not work for most. One has to take some baby steps.

  If=
 we don't teach a toddler to say various words because the toddler does not=
 anyway understand them, one will never learn anything. Correct knowledge e=
volves from half knowledge and habits that may be devoid of knowledge, as o=
ne experiments and experiences more. Similarly, correct spiritual knowledge=
 evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic practices that may be devoid=
 of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Most of us, when it=
 comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get int=
o the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.

  Best regards,
  N=
arasimha

  <DIV><FO=
NT face=3DArial size=3D2>Some intelligent and rational people wonder why 
 =
 we need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want t=
o 
  explain this basic point with an analogy.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
We teach some phrases and manners to small 
  children. For example, we tel=
l small children to say "thank you" when someone 
  helps or say "I am sorr=
y" when they do something wrong. A really small child 
  does not even unde=
rstand what those words mean, but repeats them out of habit. 
  As the chil=
d grows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of what one 
  has be=
en saying. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean comes to 
  on=
e slowly as one grows. Many words are actually understood from experience. =

  If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you cannot =

  explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumulates m=
ore 
  and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external world throu=
gh 
  senses), the child's thinking expands and one gets more clarity on th=
e words 
  and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one t=
hen clearly 
  knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain em=
otion (sadness and 
  compassion).</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Similarly, o=
ne may be doing rituals like homam, 
  pooja, meditation etc with various m=
antras, without fully understanding or 
  appreciating what one does. =
One doing a ritual for many years without 
  fully understanding its real m=
eaning may slowly start to understand and even 
  experience some things th=
at the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spiritual 
  truths are actually=
 understood from experience alone. One can never 
  fully understand w=
hat one has never experienced. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial 
  size=3D2>As we =
accumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external 
  and inte=
rnal world through external senses and the inward directed mind), 
  one's =
thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual 
 =
 truths one has been exposed to.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial siz=
e=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Rituals in var=
ious religions are designed to 
  symblize some truths that gives bliss whe=
n experienced by one. A mere 
  explanation of the symbolism is often usele=
ss to give one that state of bliss. 
  Even if you explain to a one year ol=
d child what the word "sorry" means in 
  detail, the child will not unders=
tand. The best thing to do is to just get the 
  child into the habit of sa=
ying "I am sorry" in approapriate situations. 
  Slowly, the meaning will b=
ecome clearer and clearer with experience and 
  the correct emotions =
will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra 
  everyday - pos=
sibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and 
  visualization in=
 the mind - will slowly understand it and experience 
  it.</FONT></DIV>

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Some religions have done t=
he mistake of 
  de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the =
final truths. While 
  the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former he=
lps one in getting to the 
  latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the b=
ase of hill before reaching its 
  top, one often needs to engage in some e=
xternal practices in order to realize 
  internal truths. Of course, it is =
good to remind one that reaching the top is 
  the goal, lest one should ge=
t stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one 
  cannot completely elimina=
te the first steps. Just saying "you are That. Just 
  realize that you are=
 That" is not an action plan. It does not work for most. 
  One has to take=
 some baby steps.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>&n=
bsp;</DIV>If we don't teach a toddler to 
  say various words because the t=
oddler does not anyway understand them, one 
  will never learn anything. C=
orrect knowledge evolves from half knowledge and 
  habits that may be =
;devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and 
  experiences more. Similarly=
, correct spiritual knowledge evolves from half 
  knowledge and ritualalis=
tic practices that may be devoid of knowledge, as one 
  experiments and ex=
periences more. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Most of us, 
  when it c=
omes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get 
  in=
to the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.</FONT></DIV>
