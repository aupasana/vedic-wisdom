Dear NitishJi,
I have emailed my birth details to you.
even i began wearing=
  a yellow sapphire as per my horoscope before two year
the think is karma =
worked on the day of my accident
my wife told the ring was ugly and removed=
 it on the day before accident
the next day while driving at 30km only a bi=
ke overtook me and pushed me and went away without knowing
i fell down and =
lost my senses
i woke up in my home with a big bandage but no broken bone i=
n my knee
my wife put back the ring on my finger  while i was sleeping in p=
ain
yellow sapphire has strange powers to control karma
but karma has more =
powers and  could make me remove the yellow sapphire
now iam planning to he=
lp people to create some positive karma
looking forward to your help

her experts  who want to help me please advice me
