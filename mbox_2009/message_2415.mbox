Hi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0 Your are a very LUCKY person who have such a Deity in your=
 family. You should never ever think of giving it away or any other such wr=
ong thing. Do we throw away or immerse in water our Good Fortune???

=A0Do =
not worry for a single second if you are not able to do Puja now. Ask HIM T=
O Guide you and other members of your family for puja or worship etc.

I ha=
ve written from my personal experience. I usually do not write but I opened=
 my PC and saw your post and could not believe it and others response to it=
.

Take care.
LaxmiNarayan

OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya

Dear A=
ll,

This ia my first posting in this forum.

Am writing in as am in need o=
f advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during puja in our ho=
me. This idol has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our hou=
se since the last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Sh=
ri Ganesha with its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship=
 it daily in a dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all =
these years. It was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per =
my father who has been seeing it since then. 

I feel that it is better to =
donate it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there fo=
r so long in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would be e=
xtremely grateful if I could have advice as to what would be the correct th=
ing to do and how to go about doing the same.

Kindly pardon me if this is =
not the appropriate forum for such a query.

Thanks,
Ramesh M
Bangalore
