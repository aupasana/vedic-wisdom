Dear Rajarshi and Sameer,

I am not able to digest what Maharshi Aurobindo =
has said about Kali. 
It is contradicting Thakur's views about the Kali and=
 my own thinking.

>What does it matter how the pranpratistha has been done=
, if I am >using the name Kali to address my prayers

Yes. I have always ca=
rried words of Thakur in my heart. one of the greatest words which were spo=
ken to M during his second meeting with him. extending that spirit, If Kali=
 is sincerely prayed, will she not know? SHE is every where. isn't it. so i=
n one sense, Idol becomes redundant however it has a purpose that it remind=
s one of Kali in a more effective way.

what do you say?

Sameer also said =
nice thing. If going to Holy places, do not pray for worldly desire. try ha=
rd to refrain from them and then what negative energies can do?

sorry to b=
utt in.

Warm Regards

Utpal
