 Once, two friends were going along the street when they saw some people
listening to a reading of the Bhagavata. "Come, friend," said the one to the
other, "let us hear the sacred book." So saying he went in and sat down. The
second man peeped in and went away. He entered a house of ill fame.But very
soon he felt disgusted with the place."Shame on me!" he said to himself. "My
friend has been listening to the sacred word of Hari and see where I am!"
But the friend who had been listening to the Bhagavata also became
disgusted. "What a fool I am!" he said. "I have been listening to this
fellow's blah-blah, and my friend is having a grand time."

In course of time they both died. The messenger of death came for the soul
of one who had listened to the Bhagavata and dragged it off to hell. The
messenger of God came for the soul of the one who had been to the house of
prostitution and led it up to heaven.

Verily, the Lord looks into a man's heart and does not judge him by what he
does or where he lives.
