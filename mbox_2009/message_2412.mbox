If temples don't accept then the last option would be to immerse the id=
ol in water with the help of local priests.

OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya

Dear All,

This ia my first posting in =
this forum.

Am writing in as am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha=
 idol which we found during puja in our home. This idol has its trunk to th=
e right side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I rec=
ently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the =
right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and =
we have honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purcha=
sed by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it =
since then. 

I feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would=
 worship it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are fee=
ling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have=
 advice as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doi=
ng the same.

Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for suc=
h a query.

Thanks,
Ramesh M
