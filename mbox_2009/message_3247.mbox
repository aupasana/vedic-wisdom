Namaste Ramanarayanan Sir,

How are you?. long time no hear:)

>The need of=
 the hour is to have a cognitive shift from unconscious >state of functioni=
ng to conscious state of functioning

This idea suggested by you essentialy=
 means that One needs to resort to reasoning, logic rather than working on =
impulse or guided by emotions. thats how i understood it.

>Jiva could have=
 picked up any body at random in an unconscious >state in the past.

It mea=
ns, past Sanskaar of some life or lives are working and dominating heavily =
the behaviours and habits of current state.

If i understand correctly, you=
r message in nutshell states that the current habits and behaviours are pro=
duct of some past samskaaras and it requires strong rational, logical, reas=
oning faculty which surpasses the Emotional, impulsive force of past samska=
aras. You also suggest that to overcome the force of Past impressions, It r=
equires to surrender to the Almighty.

It is required to consciously examin=
e our habits and tendencies and after enough reasoning and discrimination, =
if we found that it needs to be overcome, then it is best to surrender and =
also try as much possible to generate counter force.

I think that is what =
i suggested in one of the message. that is how any tendencies can be overco=
me. only one point i need to mention that i see the need of talking about v=
egetarianism or non-vegetarianism because that may serve as a vital food fo=
r thought in somebody...somewhere.

I think, i conveyed whatever i needed t=
o on this thread of Veg-nonveg. in my many messages, i've conveyed most of =
the things which was accumulating from long years. i've become empty now!!!=


Respectful regards,

Utpal
