Dear Narasimhaji,

In some cases, especially on the Kundalini-yoga path, it=
 has been suggested that eating meat is actually required to sustain the bo=
dy at its current level of spiritual development. The specific person I hav=
e in mind is Pandit Gopi Krishna (http://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/gopi.h=
tml), the most well known person in modern times to have raised his Kundali=
ni, and documented it. In his book, it is clearly indicated that at one poi=
nt, he was virtually at the point of death and was saved when he ate (proba=
bly several times - maybe even consistently after that) some Kashmiri meat =
dish. I dont have the book in front of me, but he had indicated that at tha=
t stage of development, he could barely eat a few spoonfuls of rice and som=
e milk (in the entire day), after which he was immediately enveloped in som=
e sort of searing pain related to Kundalini. But upon eating the Kashmiri m=
eat dish, the pain subsided, his appetite increased, and he was quickly on =
the road to recovery. You might dismiss his level of spiritual development,=
 but if you simply read the link about his experiences, it might make you t=
hink twice about that conclusion..

 Separately, I have heard from some "en=
lightened" Buddhist types, who didnt know anything about Gopi Krishna, also=
 say the same thing. 

 I'm only throwing in this information into the mix =
- I havent formed a strong opinion myself..

Regards,

Sundeep

Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to=
