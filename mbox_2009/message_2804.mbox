Namaskar,

I hope the following article from internet will help you on your=
 questions:

DEVI: HER THREE MANIFESTATIONS

Whatever the mode of her origi=
n, attributes or aspects, the Puranas, at least the earlier ones, saw Devi =
as the personified sole female energy of the cosmos, the comprehensive dyna=
mic principle, and the universe as its manifestation. In its original appli=
cation, the term 'Devi' was not a common noun as it became in later usages.=
 As the Devi-Mahatmya has it : 'MahalakshmirMahakali saiva prokta Saraswati=
, Ishvari punyapapana sarvalokamaheshvari' (Part 3, Chapter Vaikrtika Rahas=
ya, verse 25); that is, 'She herself is proclaimed as Mahalakshmi, Mahakali=
, and (Maha) Saraswati, the great ruler of all worlds, reigning over the vi=
rtuous and the wicked'. She is thus one but, as proclaims the Devi-Mahatmya=
, is also three, that is, she combines three in her, similar to the univers=
e, which appears to be one but is three-aspected comprising 'tamas', 'rajas=
' and 'sattva', i.e., inertia, dynamism and luminosity. The equation of sag=
e Markandeya is simple. Metaphysically, the Devi has been perceived as the =
one dynamic principle that the universe manifested in its oneness. In her f=
orms as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati  manifested the cosmic dive=
rsity, i.e., the three elemental components of the phenomenal universe - 't=
amas', 'rajas' and 'sattva', which not only work as instruments of creation=
 but also underlie all subsequent activities of creation, sustenance and di=
ssolution. Devi defines the totality of cosmic energy, while Mahakali, Maha=
lakshmi and Mahasaraswati define its 'vyastis', individual aspects of this =
cosmic energy, which are 'tamas', 'rajas' and 'sattva'. The Puranas, thus, =
saw her as both, one and many. 
The abstract principle of Devi's unity, whi=
ch texts like Devi-Mahatmya contemplated, seems to have confined, however, =
to rhetoric and metaphysical discourses alone. Her aniconic verbal concept =
little suited the devotional mind and least, a shrine, which had by now a w=
ell-evolved tradition of iconic deities. Not in the course of time but in t=
he very beginning, Devi's three formal manifestations - Mahakali, Mahalaksh=
mi and Mahasaraswati, were her more accepted forms. Even the Devi-Mahatmya,=
 which advanced the principle of Devi's unity, treated each of her manifest=
 forms independently. When personalising these forms, the Devi-Mahatmya con=
ceived for each of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati a different set =
of iconic imagery, anatomy, attributes, kind of role and personality type. =
The Devi-Mahatmya has for each of them an independent 'Dhyana', meditative =
hymn devoted to her. The text also classified into separate chapters the ve=
rses devoted to Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati and their exploits =
against evil forces. Not long before, the term 'Devi' reduced to a common n=
oun, to mean goddess, defining either or all of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Maha=
saraswati and other subsequently evolved deities in different pantheons. 
 =

The ten-armed and three-eyed Mahakali has been conceived with ten faces an=
d ten feet. She has a complexion sparkling like a sapphire. She carries in =
her hands sword, discus, mace, spear, bow, iron club, sling, human head and=
 conch. In her form as Mahakali, Devi was instrumental in eliminating the d=
emons Madhu and Kaitabha. 
 
 
The lotus-seated Mahalakshmi has been person=
alised with eighteen hands and the coral-like radiant complexion. She has b=
een conceived as carrying in her hands prayer beads, ax, mace, arrow, thund=
erbolt, staff, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose =
and discus Sudarshana. It is in her form as Mahalakshmi that the Devi kille=
d Mahishasura. 
Effulgent like the moon shining at the edge of a cloud, the=
 eight-armed Mahasaraswati has been acclaimed as the support of the three w=
orlds. She has been conceived with lotus-like hands and as the one who came=
 forth from the body of Gauri to destroy Sumbha and other demons. She holds=
 in her hands bell, trident, plough, conch, mace, discus, bow, and arrows. =
Thus, whatever her manifest form, the Devi was perceived initially as the d=
estroyer of evil and the promoter of good. 

TRANSFORMATION OF DEVI-FORMS I=
N LATER PURANAS

In later Puranas, the roles of the three Devi-forms, Mahak=
ali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati widely changed. The aniconic Devi of the=
 Devi-Mahatmya was now iconically realised Devi and demon-slaying attribute=
s of her Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati forms, slaying Mahishasura or Sumbha=
, merged with this new Devi form. She was now the principal demon-slaying g=
oddess assuming whatever form, four, eight, ten or eighteen armed, the prev=
ailing situation required. This form was known by various names, Mahishasur=
a-mardini and Durga being the most prominent among them. Lion was now invar=
iably her vehicle. 
Mahakali, better known as Kali, was contemplated as one=
 of her aspects. For accomplishing an object Devi created Kali out of her o=
wn being. 
She also created her 'shaktis', subordinate powers. In the cours=
e of time many of these subordinate powers entered the Brahmanical pantheon=
 as minor but independent 'devis'. 
With her own distinction Kali soon emer=
ged in the devotional mind and tradition of faith as an independent divinit=
y, and even if an aspect of Devi, it was as significant as her Mahishasura-=
Mardini, Durga and Parvati forms. In the entire pantheon, Devi came out wit=
h the widest role, most multifarious personality and the largest range of i=
conic and anthropomorphic formations. As Kali she was ferocious, as Durga, =
valorous, and as Parvati, Uma or Gauri, lovable and incomparably beautiful.=
 
She represented in her being both light and darkness and destruction and =
sustenance. If black complexioned Kali represented darkness and destruction=
, the gold complexioned Parvati, Uma or Gauri, light and love, and Durga, s=
ustenance, which she effected by annihilating evil that sought to destroy l=
ife and cosmic order. 

THE DESTROYER
The male dominated angle of later Pur=
anas conceived Devi as Shiva's consort and his feminine aspect. These Puran=
as perceived in Shiva the proto lover and in Uma or Parvati, Devi's other a=
spect, his creative faculty and timeless love-companion and his half. 
Myth=
ically, Parvati was the daughter of Himalayas, and as such, represented hum=
ble sublime aspect of creation, which as Himalayas' daughter was her inhere=
nt nature. As Durga, she slew demons and eradicated evil, but different fro=
m the ferocious looking Kali, she has been conceived with a benign look, fe=
minine softness and an abhaya, fearlessness, granting gesture. 
Kali, in al=
l forms, Shamshan-Kali, Mahakali, Chandi and others, has been seen as the h=
orror-striking destroyer of the universe. 
Severed human heads comprised he=
r garland, skull, her bowl, fresh human blood, her drink, and blood-smeared=
 naked sword, her weapon. She roamed in cremation ground and exalted she da=
nced over corpses. 
Of Devi's all forms Kali has always been the most widel=
y worshipped divinity of Indian masses enshrining altars even in remotest t=
ribal hamlets. 
Her role in assisting Devi, Durga of myths, in eliminating =
demon Rakta-bija is one of the best-known Kali-related legends. Under a boo=
n from Rudra, there grew a new Rakta-bija demon wherever a drop of blood fr=
om the body of Rakta-bija fell. As the Puranas have it, before Rakta-bija b=
ecame invincible, Durga separated her 'tamas', ferocious aspect and created=
 Kali out of it. Kali devoured each drop of Rakta-bija's blood before it fe=
ll on the earth. 
The demon-slaying aspect of Mahalakshmi was the first to =
disappear. Such aspect of Mahasaraswati continued for a longer time but not=
 with the prior fervour. In her demon-slaying form, she was conceived with =
an iconography identical to Durga, though unlike Durga she wore white costu=
me and had no regular vehicle. This form of Mahasaraswati was widely known =
as Sharda and was highly worshipped in northern and central India during me=
dieval days. Mahakali continued in her demon-slaying role, though the over-=
all Puranic perception in regard to her had largely changed and sometimes w=
idened. She still represented dissolution, destruction, death and decay but=
 far more than that she now personified in her being horror, awe and loaths=
omeness. She still slew demons but mostly when summoned by Devi to accompli=
sh an assigned target, and to such extent she was her subordinate. Whatever=
 its status in concurrent linguistics, the term 'Maha', which formed first =
half of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, was reduced to a mere adje=
ctival suffix and was widely dropped from their names reducing them to Kali=
, Lakshmi and Saraswati. Now the suffix 'Maha' was used with their names on=
ly rarely to connote a particular form or aspect, not a name in general. 

=
THE SUSTAINER
Not merely that the adjectival suffix 'Maha' was dropped, the=
 late concept of Lakshmi was altogether different from the Mahisha-slayer M=
ahalakshmi. Lakshmi, a blend of Indus Mother goddess and Vedic 'Sita' both =
in iconography and spirit, was conceived as the sustainer, who bestowed bli=
ss, prosperity, wealth and material happiness, yielded good crop and abunda=
nt grain and represented magnificence and beauty in life. Lotus, elephant, =
pot and a four-armed anatomy emerged as the essential elements of her icono=
graphy. 
 Not an aspect of Devi, Lakshmi was one of the three major female =
divinities revered alike in Buddhism, Jainism and different Brahmanical sec=
ts. 
She was linked with Vishnu as his consort and feminine aspect that hel=
ped him sustain the universe. 
In the course of time there emerged her othe=
r forms, Padmavati, Gaja-Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi, and names, Shri, Kamala, =
Dharini, Vaishnavi, Narayani, Vishnu-priya, Rajalakshmi, Chanchala and so o=
n. 

THE CREATOR
Saraswati, representing creation, too, emerged as the Divi=
nity independent of Devi and completely different from Mahasaraswati or Sha=
rda. Lotus-seated and swan-riding Saraswati was conceived as the instrument=
 using which Brahma rendered creation. She was hence dually perceived in Pu=
ranas, first as Brahma's creation, and hence, his daughter, and, secondly, =
as the feminine component of creation, and hence, his consort. 
She has bee=
n addressed also as Brahmani, and as such carries most of Brahma's attribut=
es. She represents supreme wisdom and all-knowing intellect and nourishes a=
ll creative faculties, arts, music, dance and literature. Elegantly bejewel=
ed and gracefully costumed the four-armed Saraswati carries in her hands vi=
na, book, rosary and pot. Lotus and swan, aspects of her iconography, symbo=
lised purity and chastity, which she symbolised.
