Friends,
On this day, obeisance and tributes are paid to Saptha Rishis---Kasyapa, Atri, Bharadwaja, Viswamitra, Gauthama,  Jamadagni and Vashishta.  Women have a special bath on the day using a special herb. Special Kalasham  is prepared on the day and prayed to. The devotee is required to keep  perfect Purity in body and mind on this day. Rishi Panchami pooja is performed only  by women to get rid of the bad effects during their menstrual cycle period. On this day women ask for forgiveness for any sin committed during their monthly periods. In Hindu religion, menstruation is taken as a symbol of impurity and women are not allowed to take part in religious observances and practices during their periods. Rishi Panchami is the occasion to wash of one`s impurity.
G.Balasubramanian
