Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams

Please forgive me if I am seen to =
be impertinent in my question based on the
lines in bold below.

Why must t=
he Guru upadesa be kept secret and not shared with anyone who
might benefit=
? More the so if it is a prasiddha mantra? Think of
Ramanujacharya, who aft=
er receiving the astakshari from his Guru, shouted
the mantra from the roof=
top to all and thus the world was benefited. The
same way, have we not bene=
fited when the rishis generously shared their
knowledge of Brahman?

I can =
understand it if the mantra/prayer is customized for an individual
accordin=
g to the capacity of the person.

best regards
Hari
