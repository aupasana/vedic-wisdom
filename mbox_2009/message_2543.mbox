Yes, you can cover the homa kundam, once the fire goes off. If your neighbo=
rs know you perform the ritual, they are bound to make some noise. The smel=
l from the ghee burning is much much milder than their barbeque sessions!! =
 So, just ignore them. Use incense sticks liberally, which helps in spreadi=
ng the pleasant smell. I sprinkly sambrani powder on the embers in the kund=
am. You can also use the pleasant smelling jawar, which have an awesome aro=
ma, and serves as a room freshener when sprinkled on the embers.
