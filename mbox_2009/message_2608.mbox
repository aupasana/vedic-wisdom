Subject: Jiddu Krishnamurthy's view of Guru

Recently one of my friend had a question for me:

1. Can a Guru help us? He=
 took Jiddu Krishnamurthy's view on this. JK claims that a guru can not hel=
p any one and the self realisation has to come from with in. My friend is a=
sking, if a Guru is useless as JK claims, why did JK write so many books (n=
o offence to JK followers)

2. If a person has to realise on himself, how i=
t can be?

3. If the fact is that there is no I but for Brahman, why all th=
is Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go through the misery and in the e=
nd realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be Brahman and not create an=
y thing?

I could not give convincing answers to any of the questions.

Bes=
t regards,
Vijay
