A note from the preface to "Enlightening Expositions" which descri=
bes
the life of the former pontiff of the Sringeri Sharada peetham, Sri
Abh=
inava Vidyateertha Swami --

" Acharyal found great joy in meditating on Ba=
la Ambal, and had His
first experience of Savikalpa Samadhi before He was 1=
8 years old. By
the time He was 20, He had already attained Nirvikalpa Sama=
dhi and by
repeated attainment of this sublime state, had become a Jeevanmu=
kta.
But the paradoxical part of this was that Acharyal had already
attaine=
d the Highest before He was 20, but His formal lessons in
Vedanta commenced=
 only after He was 23 ! "

bhavadiiyaH,
