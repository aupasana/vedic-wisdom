Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
Your logic seems correct. Otherwise there is really =
no reasonable explanation.
=C2=A0
However, then the question comes, is Datt=
atreya Jayanti on Maargasira Pournima or Kaarthika Pournima. I mean did the=
 error in the names of months with respect to the actual lunar position cre=
ep in before or after it was decided that Dattatreya Jayanti is on Maargasi=
ra Poornima?
=C2=A0
Because if it was BEFORE the error creeped in, that mea=
ns the real Datta Jayanti IS on Mrigasira Purnima. IF the setting of Dattat=
reya Jayanti celebration happened AFTER the error was introduced, then that=
 means the real Datta Jayanti is on Karthika Purnima. We come to know about=
 the Dattatreya Jayanti from some Puranic texts. Not all of them were befor=
e the Kali Yuga started.=C2=A0 I hope you understand my confusion.
=C2=A0
B=
asically, what I mean is that, is there any way to know for sure if today i=
s the real Dattatreya Jayanti irrespective whatever name we set for the mon=
th?

Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Dattatreya Jayanti i=
s on Margasira Pournima. Is today really a Maargasira Pournima?
=C2=A0
Peop=
le name the lunar months these days based on the raasi occupied by Moon at =
the time of Sun-Moon conjunction, i.e. end of Amaavaasya. Sun-Moon conjunct=
ion in Pisces begins Chaitra month, in Aries begins Vaisakha month and so o=
n. However, is this perfect or has an error been introduced in the last few=
 millennia due to deepening Kali?
=C2=A0
If you look at the names of months=
 themselves, they are based on the star on Pournima (Full Moon day). For ex=
ample, Moon is in Pisces (Poorvabhadra 4th paadam, Uttarabhadra, Revati) at=
 the beginning of Chaitra month. But on the Pournima day that follows, he i=
s in Chitra or its vicinity.
=C2=A0
It is likely that the zodiac was divide=
d into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned with 12 rasis) and the posit=
ion occupied by Moon at Full Moon of a month determined the name of the mon=
th. These 12 months were then named based on a main star in those 12 parts.=
 Chitra star for Chaitra month, Visakha star for Vaisakha month, Jyeshtha s=
tar for Jyeshtha month and so on. Aaswayuja, Kaarthika, Maargasira and Push=
ya months are associated with Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasira and Pushya stars =
respectively.
=C2=A0
Though Dec 30/31, 2009 is supposed to be Pushya Pourni=
ma, Moon will be nowhere near Pushya star. He will instead be in Mrigasira =
and Aardra. That is likely to be the real Maargasira Pournima. Today is sup=
posed to be Maargasira Pournima, but Moon is nowhere near Mrigasira. He is =
instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini in the evening. This =
is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
