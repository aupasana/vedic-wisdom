 31st January, 1946

Someone enquired of Bhagavan some time back, =93People=
 talk of Vaikunta,
Kailasa, Indraloka, Chandraloka,etc. Do they really exis=
t?=94

Bhagavan replied, =93Certainly. You can rest assured that they all e=
xist.There
also a Swami like me will be found seated on a couch and discipl=
es will also
be seated around him. They will ask something and he will say =
something in
reply. Everything will be more or less like this.

What of tha=
t? If one sees Chandraloka, he will ask for Indraloka, and after
Indraloka,=
 Vaikunta and after Vaikunta,Kailasa, and so on, and the mind goes
on wande=
ring. Where is shanti? If shanti is required, the only correct
method of se=
curing it is by Self-enquiry. Through Self-enquiry
Selfrealisation is possi=
ble.

If one realises the Self, one can see all these worlds within one=92s=
 self.
The source of everything is one=92s own Self, and if one realises th=
e Self,
one will not find anything different from the Self. Then these ques=
tions
will not arise. There may or may not be a Vaikunta or a Kailasa but i=
t is a
fact that you are here, isn=92t it? How are you here? Where are you?=
 After you
know about these things, you can think of all those worlds.=94
