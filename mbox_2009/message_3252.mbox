Dear Rajarshi,

If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to ju=
st say a
simple, harmless lie, like sun >rises in the west, he would not sa=
y it.
Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually >never ever=

spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small.

This is somethi=
ng very very very exceptional! Thank you very much for
sharing this. He is =
really an inspirational person.

This also reminds me of Thakur who said th=
at i asked Kali to take away
everything but did not ask to take away *Truth=
* from him becuase Truth
is one sure aspect of God.

***

About lord Ramach=
andra, like you and kishore, i also have reservations
but that is part and =
parcel.  I've only one reasoning for this and that
is what Narasimha has ma=
ny times stated "in dual world, mother is the
supreme power. she can delude=
 *any one*. even the person who goes in
Samadhi"

***

No debate what so ev=
er. One request, if you can speak to him about his
thought on Food habits, =
it'll be great.

Thanks for sharing this.

Best Regards,



Utpal

ne day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting.
His way =
to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by
in=C2 his scoote=
r, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the
temple. He says he still =
does not know why he went inside the temple,
but he did. That was at 9 o cl=
ock in the morning. Next when he sees his
watch it is 4:30 in the evening! =
And he has no knowledge of how the time
went. When he asked the priest, the=
 priest said that he went into the
temple sat down and just stayed as he wa=
s for the whole time without any
movement. The priest somehow felt scared t=

had no idea why this happened. He remembered n=

deep sleep.

visions etc of Krishna. He does not sa=

things. But once he was in
samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his medita=

same place and same position for 3 days continuousl=
y.=C2 Only his wife
and close relatives know about this incident. I believe=
 nowadays when
ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Sam=

someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it fe=

if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the=

stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the
water=
, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It
cannot be=
 accurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sri Krishna to be God
and=C2 Lord Ram=
a to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the
Ramacharit Manas bec=
ause he thinks it elevated Sri=C2 Rama to the
> level of a God whereas the =
aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to
show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=
=C2 not a God.The difference he says is
that, an ideal man is someone who c=
an be emulated, an ordinary man can
and should aim to become like the ideal=
. But a God cannot be emulated by
ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, =
but one=C2 can try to lead his
life like Rama. I have argued with him over =
this, but I am merely
stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a hu=
man guru at least,
and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. N=
eedless to say,
he is not an atheist any more.
