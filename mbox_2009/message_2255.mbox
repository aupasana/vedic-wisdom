Namaste!

Thanks for your illuminating mail.

"The importance of Mantra is =
in Sadhana". 

Have to keep reminding myself of this...even though the path=
 ahead seems so difficult and joyless at times.

Best wishes

I always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right for a non Indi=
an language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to explain it t=
o an Indian language speaking person. For example - In "Shivaay Nama:" and =
"Nama: Shivaay", there is a subtle difference in the pronounciation of "Nam=
a:". In the first one "ha" of the visarga ":" is to be pronounced completel=
y while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar ":" (no "ha").=
 Now you can understand why I say that it is difficult to explain.
