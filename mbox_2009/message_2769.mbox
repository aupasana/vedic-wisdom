I do not know whether the posts on this group are moderated, but I would
request that posts with this kind of rude and derisive tone not be allowed.
Allowing such threads to continue endlessly will, I'm afraid, deter sincere
people from posting their genuine thoughts and questions on sadhana and
homam out of fear of being derided publicly on the list or out of shyness
since few want to engage in such combative dialogue. There is nothing
productive or remotely spiritual in such discussions when one takes such an
arrogant, combative, and scornful tone in post after post. Too many Yahoo
groups purportedly about Hinduism / Dharma are full of vitriol, and I have
always found this group to be unique in its collegiality, generosity, and
focus on spiritual development. I would not like to see it get sidetracked
by someone who has an axe to grind. I understand the value of allowing free
speech, etc., but I think this has gone beyond the pale now. This is not a
matter of a few stray posts, but of one person who has made a habit and
pattern, day after day after day, of being rude and disrespectful towards
the other members of this group.
Warm regards,
Aditi
