Namaste Rajarshiji,
 
> As a corollary, can the path shown by Lord Rama be =
equated to the path of Dakshina Kali and that of Krishna as Vama Kali.


Ac=
tually, Krishna is equated to Kali, as per the Munda Mala Tantra. Krishna's=
 beeja akshara is Kleem while Kali's beeja akshara is Kreem. Whereas, Rama =
is equated to Taaraa, the Raama Naama is called the Taaraka mantra. Taaraa =
means crossing and she is the one who helps us cross-over from the material=
 plane to the spiritual plane. Raama also had to cross the ocean to get Sit=
a. Esoterically, Raama is the soul, Lakshmana is the single-pointed concent=
ration (lakshya-mana) and Sita is the Kundalini Shakti. Raavana who stands =
for our material desires steals Sita and takes her away to Lanka, stands fo=
r how our material desires makes the kundalini remain in the mooladhara. Th=
e beeja akshara of Mooladhaara is Lam, which is what Lanka is.

Munda Maala=
 tantra has other parallels (equating Das Mahaavidya & Das Avataara) too, s=
ome of which makes sense and some of them dont.

Hope this helps.

Thanks
