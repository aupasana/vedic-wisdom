 WHEN Akbar was the Emperor of Delhi there lived a hermit in a hut in the
forest. Many people visited the holy man. At one time he felt a great desire
to entertain his visitors.

But how could he do so without money? So he decided to go to the Emperor for
help, for the gate of Akbar's palace was always open to holy men.

The hermit entered the palace while the Emperor was at his daily devotions
and took a seat in a corner of the room.

He heard the Emperor conclude his worship with the prayer, "O God, give me
money; give me riches", and so on and so forth. When the hermit heard this
he was about to leave the prayer hall, but the Emperor signed to him to
wait.

When the prayer was over the Emperor said to him, "You came to see me: how
is it that you were about to leave without saying anything to me?" "Your
Majesty need not trouble yourself about it",answered the hermit. "I must
leave now."

When the Emperor insisted, the hermit said: "Many people visit my hut, and
so i came here to ask you for some money." "Then", said Akbar, "why were you
going away without speaking to me?" The hermit replied:

"I found that you too were a beggar; you too prayed to God for money and
riches. Thereupon I said to myself:

'Why should I beg of a beggar? If I must beg, let me beg of God."
