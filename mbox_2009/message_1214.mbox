            <p>Dear RJ<br>
<br>
Namaste<br>
<br>
Interesting, My goodness, =
what a mess!<br>
<br>
Dear RJ I suggest you need to be a silent reader in b=
oth priase and <br>
lighter moments or exchange of disagreements,<br>
 <br>=

it really takes time :-).....<br>
<br>
What good is observing Narasimha fo=
r long time .....<br>
<br>
I am just kidding here, camn down!<br>
<br>
We a=
re all grown ups we donot need to give gentle reminders to <br>
ourselves a=
nd others...<br>
<br>
We need to enjoy the moment, be joyful, laugh atleast=
 20 times a day <br>
and most important make others laugh too. We all need =
to be less <br>
sensitive and more accomodating, this one is for me, be joy=
ful in <br>
pleasure and pain or praise and criticism. I am trying now to d=
o this <br>
and learning to be the best.<br>
<br>
Please you or others don&=
#39;t shoot miseales at me from whereever you <br>
are :-) and please don&#=
39;t butt me too :-), I have one wife who does it <br>
full time and I have=
 no more quota in my karma bank balance to the <br>
best of my knowledge, o=
uch it seems now that there may be more ...<br>
<br>
I am not going to be d=
efensive but now I shall shed more light on <br>
things for the benefit of =
all.<br>
<br>
When anyone does more sincere sadhana and is progressing, a s=
tate of <br>
joyfullness engulfs that person internally and externally. He =
non-<br>
voluntaryly starts sharing it<br>
<br>
I am afriad to state that a=
tleast I fail to see in Narasimha many of <br>
the times.<br>
<br>
I wanted=
 to influence him indirectly about that and all of us, He and <br>
all of u=
s need to be more joyful and cheerful. Also we do a lot of <br>
things mech=
anically like drinking water, taking shower etc. you know <br>
what I mean.=
 So all I was trying to influence indirectly to Narashima <br>
that<br>
for=
 quoting shastras i.e. where the names are described one does not <br>
need=
 mother's direction, it is for the sake of completeness and it <br>
als=
o helps others  if they want to do more research. One can always <br>
descr=
ibe their own experiance or teaching acquired from others.<br>
<br>
As Nara=
simha states our email exchange was confusing to him first and <br>
his res=
ponse to me, am not sure about others or you, more confusion <br>
to ....<b=
r>
<br>
Now I have added even more confusion, but I promise on this subject=
 <br>
it is the last one from my side.<br>
<br>
Have a joyful day.<br>
Best=
 Regards<br>
Mitesh</p><div><div></div><div class=3D"Wj3C7c"><br>
