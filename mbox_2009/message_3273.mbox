I have a Durga Saptashati book which has everything in story format.Can it =
be used for doing the chandi homam? Where to put swaha ? I am confused. Mor=
eover it doesn't have the saptashati nyaasa. Does anyone know of any specif=
ic book which has all the shlokas (preferably English)and is good for homam=
? 

Thanks,
