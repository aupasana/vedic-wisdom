Om Gurave Namah

Namasthe Narasimha Garu

I got it, I was just reading what=
 you wrote in a thread about Changdev Maharaj and your interaction with Man=
ishji.

One more question, does it matter where we do the Homam i.e inside =
the Home on the Carpet, or in the Garage or should it be only done outside =
in the open. Especially in the USA.
