Dear All

First of all, wish every one of you a very very wonderful and 
fu=
llfilling year ahead. Last week I had been on a trip to Kasi. It 
turned ou=
t to be a terrific trip for me. That city has a strange 
spiritual atmosphe=
re unlike any other place I have been to. Just in 
case someone is planning=
 on a trip to Kasi any time in the future, 
do not miss out of the followin=
g places/temples apart from the 
regular temples. The following are lesser =
know but really powerful 
places of worship which I came across during my t=
rip last week:

1) Chausat Yogini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temple ha=
s one 
idol for the 64 Yoginis and an idol of Ma Kali. 

2) Temple of Lord =
Shiva as Kedareshwar in Kedar Ghat. An amazing 
temple. 

3) Sankata Temple=
 near Schindhia Ghat. 

4) Bindu Madhav temple 

5) The temple of Gopal whe=
re Anandamayi Ma used to worship. 

6) Kinnaram Baba's Ashram. There is a d=
huni in the ashram which was 
lit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a funeral p=
yre and has been 
burning continuously since then. The deity in Agni Rudra.=
 Regularly 
wood from the mahasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordinary pe=
ople 
are not allowed to give any ahutis in that fire but one can sit 
clos=
e to it and meditate. I felt that ashram to be one of the most 
powerful pl=
aces I had ever been to. 

Just thought of sharing the names of these place=
s I came across 
during my visit this time. 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
