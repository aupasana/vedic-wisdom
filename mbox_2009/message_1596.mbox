Namaste,

Excellent explanation from you Narasimha-ji!

Just have some doub=
ts:
The code of conduct about reciting vedas (who can do it)  are prescribe=
d in Manusmriti. Is that correct? As per Manusmriti:
   a. The teaching of =
vedas can be done only by Brahmin and no one
      else.
   b. Women and so=
me sections of society are not given rights to
      recite, listen, read, =
translate, comment on vedas.

However, If I am not wrong Manusmriti does no=
t talk about code of conduct in different yugas (Satya, Treta, Dwapar, Kali=
). Is there any reference to this? Can you throw some light on this?

Ofcou=
rse the best reference to description of different yugas I have found is in=
 "Guru Charitra".

regards,

Jagmohan
