Dear PVR Narasimha Rao garu, 

I am absolutely new to this group. 

I had b=
een going through your free lessons on astrology and refered several books =
on astrology as well, including the one authored by you. I was going throug=
h this yahoo groups and found one of the messages where you were advising s=
omeone to do 'chandihomam' based on his birth chart. Likewise, I would like=
 to get help on what kind of spiritual path is best for me and I can provid=
e you my birth data if you are willing to help me. Currently I do certain t=
hings like Sandhyavandanam, Rudra-abhishekam every monday (lord shiva is my=
 ishta devata), panchopachara puja everyday (almost). Sometimes I do Ganapa=
thi Homam and Gayatri Homam as well. But I want to know if any of these or =
something different / additional is better for me. Is there a way?

Regards=
,

Nagraj Kota
