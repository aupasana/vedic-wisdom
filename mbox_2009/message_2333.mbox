THE SAGES OF INDIA
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora

This mind is =
continually changing, always in a state of flux; it is finite,
it is broken=
 into pieces. How can nature tell of the Infinite, the
Unchangeable, the Un=
broken, the Indivisible, the Eternal? It never can.Even
in our lives, in th=
e life of every one of us here, there come moments of
calmness, perhaps, wh=
en we see before us the death of one we loved, when
some shock comes to us,=
 or when extreme blessedness comes to us. Many other
occasions there are wh=
en the mind, as it were, becomes calm, feels for the
moment its real nature=
; and a glimpse of the Infinite beyond, where words
cannot reach nor the mi=
nd go, is revealed to us.

Consciousness is bound by the senses. Beyond tha=
t, beyond the senses, men
must go in order to arrive at truths of the spiri=
tual world, and there are
even now persons who succeed in going beyond the =
bounds of the senses. These
are called Rishis, because they come face to fa=
ce with spiritual truths.

Any attempt to modernise our women, if it tries =
to take our women away from
that ideal of Sita, is immediately a failure, a=
s we see every day. The women
of India must grow and develop in the footpri=
nts of Sita, and that is the
only way.

A great landmark in the history of =
religion is here, the ideal of love for
love's sake, work for work's sake, =
duty for duty's sake, and it for the
first time fell from the lips of the g=
reatest of Incarnations, Krishna, and
for the first time in the history of =
humanity, upon the soil of India. The
religions of fear and of temptations =
were gone for ever, and in spite of the
fear of hell and temptation of enjo=
yment in heaven, came the grandest of
ideals, love for love's sake, duty fo=
r duty's sake, work for work's sake.

There was a book written a year or tw=
o ago by a Russian gentleman, who
claimed to have found out a very curious =
life of Jesus Christ, and in one
part of the book he says that Christ went =
to the temple of Jagannath to
study with the Brahmins, but became disgusted=
 with their exclusiveness and
their idols, and so he went to the Lamas of T=
ibet instead, became perfect,
and went home.

To any man who knows anything=
 about Indian history, that very statement
proves that the whole thing was =
a fraud, because the temple of Jagannath is
an old Buddhistic temple. We to=
ok this and others over and re-Hinduised
them. We shall have to do many thi=
ngs like that yet. That is Jagannath, and
there was not one Brahmin there t=
hen, and yet we are told that Jesus Christ
came to study with the Brahmins =
there. So says our great Russian
archaeologist.

This one great Northern sa=
ge, Chaitanya, represented the mad love of the
Gopis. Himself a Brahmin, bo=
rn of one of the most rationalistic families of
the day, himself a professo=
r of logic fighting and gaining a word-victory =97
for, this he had learnt =
from his childhood as the highest ideal of life and
yet through the mercy o=
f some sage the whole life of that man became
changed; he gave up his fight=
, his quarrels, his professorship of logic and
became one of the greatest t=
eachers of Bhakti the world has ever known =97 mad
Chaitanya.

His Bhakti r=
olled over the whole land of Bengal, bringing solace to every
one. His love=
 knew no bounds. The saint or the sinner, the Hindu or the
Mohammedan, the =
pure or the impure, the prostitute, the streetwalker =97 all
had a share in=
 his love, all had a share in his mercy: and even to the
present day, altho=
ugh greatly degenerated, as everything does become in
time, his sect is the=
 refuge of the poor, of the downtrodden, of the
outcast, of the weak, of th=
ose who have been rejected by all society. But at
the same time I must rema=
rk for truth's sake that we find this: In the
philosophic sects we find won=
derful liberalisms.
