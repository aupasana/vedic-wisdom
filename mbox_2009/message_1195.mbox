Namaste Rajarshi

I am not blaming him. I saw the names and definitions and=
 asked him 
for scriptural reference and he gave a very defensive answer th=
at 
created more confusion. These concepts were totally new to me so I 
tho=
ught for a while if he came up with terms and their definitions.

What I ha=
ve requested him is not wrong or bad. When we write on the 
internet there =
is a wide audiance and we need to be careful and not 
give answers from how=
 we feel in our heart only, heart is important 
but things like the above i=
f had some scriptural reference than it is 
always better.

We eat food, we=
 take shower, we do a lot of things, we have 
responsibilities and other th=
ings, we donot say then oh mother told 
me to do this or that. 

These post=
ings here shall be there for a long period of time and so 
we should all en=
deavour to be more complete and provide references if 
there are any.

I ho=
pe you understand my concerns and am not blaming him or anyone 
else.
Best =
Regards
Mitesh
