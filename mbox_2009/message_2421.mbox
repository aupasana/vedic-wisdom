As a character Buddha was the greatest the world has ever seen; next to him=

Christ. But the teachings of Krishna as taught by the Gita are the grandes=
t
the world has ever known. He who wrote that wonderful poem was one of tho=
se
rare souls whose lives sent a wave of regeneration through the world. Th=
e
human race will never again see such a brain as his who wrote the Gita.

=
A great Bhakta (Hanuman) once said when asked what day of the month it was,=

"God is my eternal date, no other date I care for."

A bit of Mother, a dr=
op, was Krishna, another was Buddha, another was
Christ. The worship of eve=
n one spark of Mother in our earthly mother leads
to greatness. Worship Her=
 if you want love and wisdom.

One part of the Vedas deals with Karma =97 f=
orm and ceremonies. The other part
deals with the knowledge of Brahman and =
discusses religion. The Vedas in
this part teach of the Self; and because t=
hey do, their knowledge is
approaching real knowledge. Knowledge of the Abs=
olute depends upon no book,
nor upon anything; it is absolute in itself. No=
 amount of study will give
this knowledge; is not theory, it is realization=
. Cleanse the dust from the
mirror, purify your own mind, and in a flash yo=
u know that you are Brahman.

The universe is ours to enjoy. But want nothi=
ng. To want is weakness. Want
makes us beggars, and we are sons of the king=
, not beggars.

What we call nature, fate, is simply God's will.

"Only by =
practice and non-attachment can we conquer mind." . . .

To love anyone per=
sonally is bondage. Love all alike, then all desires fall
off.

Time, the "=
eater of everything", comes, and all has to go. Why try to
improve the eart=
h, to paint the butterfly? It all has to go at last. Do not
be mere white m=
ice in a treadmill, working always and never accomplishing
anything. Every =
desire is fraught with evil, whether the desire itself be
good or evil. It =
is like a dog jumping for a piece of meat which is ever
receding from his r=
each, and dying a dog's death at last. Do not be like
that. Cut off all des=
ire.

Say, "it is my nature", never say, "It is my duty" =97 to do anything=

whatever.

"All knowledge depends upon calmness of mind."

Jesus was imper=
fect because he did not live up fully to his own ideal, and
above all becau=
se he did not give woman a place equal to man. Women did
everything for him=
, and yet he was so bound by the Jewish custom that not
one was made an apo=
stle. Still he was the greatest character next to Buddha,
who in his turn w=
as not fully perfect. Buddha, however, recognised woman's
right to an equal=
 place in religion, and his first and one of his greatest
disciples was his=
 own wife, who became the head of the whole Buddhistic
movement among the w=
omen of India. But we ought not to criticise these great
ones, we should on=
ly look upon them as far above ourselves. Nonetheless we
must not pin our f=
aith to any man, however great; we too must become Buddhas
and Christs.

"T=
hat day is indeed a bad day when we do not speak of the Lord, not a stormy
=
day."

"As the spider throws her web out of herself and draws it in, even s=
o this
universe is thrown out and drawn in by God."
