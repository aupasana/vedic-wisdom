Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,

I wish to add or say Echo the same thing in =
different words.

Please Consider this -

A Cheats B (Say for the instance =
that Cycle started now)
Next time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire t=
o cheat A and B does it with sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.
Now if A =
accepts it calmly and naturally without any sadness and without any emotion=
s of hatred towards B -Now then i feel that A is out of the perticular cycl=
e but what about B. B did the cheating revengefully and enjoyed it although=
 it was the reaction only. SO WHAT ABOUT B? is he out of cycle.

What i am =
thinking in the above case is that Though B is also out of that specific cy=
cle in relation to A but here he Unconsciously gets the Impressions stamped=
 in his Chitta due to his/hers egoistic reaction (Cheating A) and that Sams=
kaar will some time in future triggered by some opportunity will compel or =
tempt him/her to cheat or do some wrong things to some other person and get=
 entangled in to new chain.

I feel that Egoistic reactions gets accumulate=
d in to Samskaaras (Mental conditioning) which then never allows most peopl=
e to break free from the chain of cause & effect web.

Have i understood co=
rrectly?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
