|| OM TAT SAT ||
Namaskar R=
ajarshi,

I have not read the diaries of Lahiri Mahashaya, so lets drop all=
 that "technicalities" out of the discussion. The specific diagram is in "G=
od talks with Arjuna, Self-Realization Fellowship, Jaico Publishing House, =
2002" - Part -2 of that book.
=C2=A0
Well, I have seen the diagram you are =
refering to. 
=C2=A0
Technicalities, I feel,=C2=A0 should not be dropped, b=
ecause in that case the conversation will become too hazy. Further, one may=
 use the same term to mean something else and keep needlessly arguing over =
a non issue. Precise, clear definitions are the first step in a meaningful =
dialogue.


Here is the relevant Text:

"....Ajna and mooladhara chakras ar=
e closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the other. Idea=
lly, ajna should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in order to =
allow an unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and=
 the lower chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to furth=
er awaken ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is t=
hrough the practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific f=
or mooladhara.. .."

Well, thanks for the quote. However, this does not say=
 that "awakening" of one will automatically "awaken" the other. It says, in=
 an ideal case one should "awaken" Agya chakra to some extent before trying=
 to awaken Mooladhara chakra. 
=C2=A0
In a lot of people chakras remain "aw=
akened in various degrees"without any conscinous effort. Rarely would an in=
dividual appear who have absolutely zero awakening of all chakras. In most =
cases, "partially awakenend" chakras do exist, but I am not sure if that is=
 of any significant help in practical spirituality.
=C2=A0
Plus, this is on=
e of the possible paths of progess in Yoga, not the only one possible. Henc=
e, we should not jump to conclusions which are not explicitly stated. 
=C2=
=A0
A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, is wors=
hipped first.
=C2=A0

Ganesha is worshipped first because it presides over =
the Mooladhara, not because mooladhara has a connection with Agya. 
=C2=A0
=
Regarding the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it already exists, Yog=
ananda writes in his commentary the following:

"...Beyond the subtlest phy=
sical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda explained, is the su=
perether," a finer manifestation and therefore not classified as one of the=
 physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are only five-earth,=
 water, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this tattwa as mind, o=
r 'non-matter' , as opposed to matter or gross vibration... ."

I am sorry,=
 but the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta is=
 a 6th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and "a finer=
 manifestation". Maybe the intented audience for this passage was one who i=
s not intellectually aware of the basic=C2=A0idea of five creative elements=
. Otherwise, the "super-ether" needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti? It is C=
hitta? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he calling =
it a vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the =
five, therefore clubbing everything together into one?
=C2=A0
As you mentio=
ned Samkhya, it uses a calssification of the universe in 24 tattwas with 5 =
which cause physical manifestations to occur. It is still not 6 by any meas=
ure.
=C2=A0
Again in Kasmiri Shaivism, they define 36 tattwas! That is why =
the need to be technically precise so that we may not misunderstand each ot=
her.
=C2=A0
> The tattwas are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scriptures,=
 both > Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.

Which scriptures ? Quotes ? =

=C2=A0
Check the quotation given by Sundeep right at the begining of this =
set of mails. Are you questioning the veracity of scriptures or the fact th=
at they mention creation is caused by five gross elements?


It is through =
Sankhya, that you can understand why Chitta is related to it. 
=C2=A0
As I =
said before, no one is denying the existence of Chitta. One is however ques=
tioning whether Chitta is a '6th element' . If you take Samkhya, there are =
24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the rest are subtle. So when normal =
creation is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. W=
hen the essence of spirituality is spoken off right upto the state of God, =
then we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your classification). Further, in th=
e 36 element lists, the "suddha-tattwas" are defined as unknowable from thi=
s plane of existence. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
As Narasimha knows Jyotish shastra als=
o, he could probably figure out the rashi to which the 6th tattwa is attrib=
uted since I have already given the table out, so it is as real as it rises=
 daily.

Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy. Lot of hazy areas ye=
t. Kindly check above.
=C2=A0

Nitish

 Can you quote a scripture which says there are 6 tattwas? Tattwa has a ver=
y specific technical meaning. When you say that Gunas by "inherent duality"=
 in nature give rise to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplic=
ation of 3 x 2 and arriving at six. My question, then why not a simple 3 ra=

 As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from th=
ere came the "vidhyut" of Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted with the chaos=
, it produced some universal energies which are more commonly known as the =
universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the "Vidyut" of vay=
u ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more t=
he essence of the element, hence his use of the word "vidyut" and " taranga=
") whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Th=
us, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the pr=
evious and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resul=
ted in 33 crore possible states of energy.

<DIV>I am sorry, but the above quote is=

the intented audience for this passage was one who is not intellectually aw=

we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the five, therefore clubbin=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As you mention=

<DIV>As I said before, no one is denying the existence of Chitta. On=

mkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the rest are subtle=
. So when normal creation is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms of 5 elem=
ents and not 6. When the essence of spirituality is spoken off right upto t=

 Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flex=
ible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a p=
articular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of sol=
id state and made of earth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular t=
hing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of =
water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to t=
he five elements.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > When one t=
hinks of "I", one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a
 parti=
cular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of "I" =
as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc=
. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one's self-awareness an=
d Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadh=
aara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one's cumulativ=
e idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishth=
aana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one'=
s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.<BR>> >=

 have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really=
 leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one
 will not hav=
e notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra,=
 each element is effaced in one's cumulative idea of who one is, at the phy=
sical as well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even o=

use the only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality involvin=
