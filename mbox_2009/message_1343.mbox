Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.

Thank you for so patiently and eloquently answering all of my 
questions. As per your suggestion I have moved the Puja room out of 
my basement.

If you have a free moment I do have a technical question for you:

Does the injunction not to cross the Meru bead when doing Japa apply 
to just one "session" ? Say a person does 3 malas of a certain mantra 
every day. After the first round the person must turn back and so on. 
I understand this. But does one have to remember on which side of the 
mala he finished so he can start on that side of the mala on the next 
day? 

If yes, what is the best way of remembering? I myself attach a paper 
clip on the side I finish with so I know to start on that side the 
very next day or for a different session on the same day. 

I hope I am being at least somewhat clear.

Thank you.
