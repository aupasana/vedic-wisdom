Yesterday, a sadhu came and sat in the Hall. He seemed anxious to speak to
=
Bhagavan, but hesitant. After some time, he approached him and said, =93Swa=
mi,
it is said that the Self (atma), is all-pervading. Does that mean that =
it is
in a dead body also?=94

=93Oho! So that is what you want to know?=94=
 rejoined Bhagavan. =93And did the
question occur to the dead body or to yo=
u?=94

=93To me,=94 said the sadhu.

Bhagavan: =93When you are asleep do yo=
u question whether you exist or not? It
is only after you wake up that you =
say you exist. In the dream state also,
the Self exists. There is really no=
 such thing as a dead or a living body.
That which does not move we call de=
ad, and that which has movement we call
alive. In dreams you see any number=
 of bodies, living and dead, and they
have no existence when you wake up. I=
n the same way this whole world,
animate and inanimate, is non-existent. De=
ath means the dissolution of the
ego, and birth means the rebirth of the eg=
o. There are births and deaths,
but they are of the ego; not of you. You ex=
ist whether the sense of ego is
there or not. You are its source, but not t=
he ego-sense. Deliverance (mukti)
means finding the origin of these births =
and deaths and demolishing the
ego-sense to its very roots. That is deliver=
ance. It means death with full
awareness. If one dies thus, one is born aga=
in simultaneously and in the
same place with Aham sphurana known as =91Aham=
, Aham (I, I)=92. One who is born
thus, has no doubts whatsoever.=94

Yeste=
rday evening, after the chanting of the Vedas, a young European who
came fo=
ur or five days ago, asked Bhagavan a number of questions. Bhagavan,
as usu=
al,countered him with the question, =93Who are you? Who is asking these
que=
stions?=94 Unable to get any other elucidation, the young man as a last
res=
ort asked Bhagavan which verse of the Gita he liked the most, and
Bhagavan =
replied that he liked them all. When the young man still persisted
in askin=
g which was the most important verse, Bhagavan told him, Chapter X,
Verse 2=
0 which runs: =93I am the Self, Oh Gudakesa1, seated in the heart of
all be=
ings. I am the beginning and the middle and the end of all beings.=94

The =
questioner was pleased and satisfied and on taking leave, said, =93Swami,
t=
his unreal self is obliged to travel owing to the exigencies of work. I
pra=
y that you may be pleased to recommend that this unreal self be merged
into=
 the real Self.=94

Bhagavan, smiling, replied, =93Such a recommendation mi=
ght be necessary where
there are a number of different selves =97 one to as=
k for a recommendation,
one to recommend and one to hear the recommendation=
. But there are not so
many selves. There is only one Self. Everything is i=
n the one Self.=94
