Namaste!

This is a vaste and confusing area for a layperson. The three wor=
ds that struck me in the mail were "Abhichara", "Vashikarna" and "Bali" and=
 their importance in certain practices. Though i have yet to google the lat=
ter two terms to understand more about them, the following link gives an in=
teresting write-up on "Abhichara":

http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=3Den&=
q=3DABHICHARA&btnG=3DGoogle+Search&meta=3D&rlz=3D1W1ADBF_en&aq=3Df&oq=3D

T=
houghts do have energy. That is why if we think good of a person, the good =
comes to him and vice-versa. Maybe "abhichara" could be the same process ma=
de more potent when encapsulated in a mantra or tantra practices.

One of m=
y encounters with black magic has been in the context of "nazar utarna". Th=
ere is a practice in northern India (maybe there is a similar variant in so=
uth india too), of dispelling the effect of "an evil eye" on people. Infant=
s probably are more prone to this. I remember my aunt doing the practice of=
 "nazar utarna"...taking off the effect of the evil eye...through a certain=
 ritual. It was done with "rie" and "noon"...mustard seeds and salt. She co=
uld make out when the eye was cast by the way the eyelashes of the infant c=
urled up. Then after performing a small practice the effect of the evil eye=
 could be neutralised. I dont exactly recall the practice but when i watche=
d her doing it one day i was truly amazed how the ingredients caught fire.
=

Long years back i also recall how my mother engaged the services of an "oj=
ha" / excorcist (?) to make my brother recover from jaundice. We were not a=
llowed to watch this but i am told that the man chanted some mantras while =
performing some rituals using water. The colour of water turned yellow. My =
brother too recovered. Maybe it was only a belief. But once again the amazi=
ng thing was that the water turned yellow.

Though such things are indeed f=
ascinating i bellieve we should not engage in them for two reasons....they =
are for short term gains and secondly these practices could be dangerous.

=
But then the question arises...are not all practices for gains (it could be=
 spiritual gains too)???

Maybe practices are required to get us THERE? / m=
ake us understand that we were always THERE?

THERE being WHERE, in the wor=
ds of Shankaracharya, there is: 

"Na Punyam Na Papam Na Saukhyam Na Dukham=

Na Mantro Na Teertham Na Vedo Na Yajnaha
Aham Bhojanam Naiva Bhojyam Na Bh=
okta
Chidananda Rupa Shivoham Shivoham"

What is the best way to get there =
remains for each one of us to explore and find out....over lifetimes...

Be=
st wishes to all of us on this journey to know that we were always at the d=
estination........
