Namaste Friends

Recently I attended a spiritual workshop that ran over say=
 10 hours.
But the next day I felt like I was completely drained of my ener=
gies,
I felt very tired and also felt that I lost lot of good energies, 
in=
 fact the person conducting the workshop did also indicate that one 
can ex=
periance similar things when one goes to a group meeting and one 
needs to =
be careful about it. I did not pay much attention then but
really I felt ba=
d the next few days to the point that I regret going 
there. At a minimum I=
 did not go there to get robbed.

Anyways my question is how does one make =
sure that he/she does not 
experiance this again in future. I believe it is=
 very important for all 
of us to not go through similar experiance. Are th=
ere any precautions, 
one can take? Any special mantras to protect one self=
?

Have other experianced this?

Best Regards
Mitesh
