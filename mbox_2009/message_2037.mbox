This is a surpr=
ising coincidence. I am at a remote site in Qatar. Few hours back, i had a =
good discussion with my colleague (Who is from Egypt and with me at site) a=
bout the issue of religion and Allah, god etc...
During our discussions, my=
 colleague informed me that as per Islam, Allah created Devil (Shaytan) fro=
m Fire and then he created Human (Adam) from clay. Allah then ordered the d=
evil to bow to the Man which was refused by Devil and since then devil is b=
ent upon corrupting the minds of Humans (Men & women) so that they forget A=
llah and pray to false gods.
He told me that Devil first corrupted the mind=
 Adam and compelled to make him a Sin and hence Adam had to leave Heaven an=
d was send to Earth. Then the devil corrupted the minds of Good people by t=
actfully maneuvering them to make images and start praying them. Hence Isla=
m considers that whoever is praying to Clay images or any other Gods other =
than Allah is misguided by Very intelligent Devil.

This is some what resem=
ble what you have mentioned in the above paragraph.

However i had a lot of=
 arguments with him. I gave him many examples including the famous example =
of Water Pond by Ramkrishna. I also told him that have a open mind. Now the=
 time has come not only to respect the other faiths but to have a firm beli=
ef that every faith is true and they will surely reach the supreme if they =
are sincere seekers. i can not write here what all i have told him or else =
it'll be very lengthy but i finally said to him that forget about all the r=
eligion, forget about all the dogmas, doctrines and all that which is writt=
en or spoken. Until we have urge to meet the final power, until we try hard=
, until we forget everything else in our life for the sake of God and until=
 we finally Meet God - doubts, argument and fights will never be finished. =
Allah or whatever you call that power has made everything, including Devil =
so it is all his/her play. he creates Human, he also creates devil then he =
only guides devil to corrupt Humans, then he only gives wisdom to some of h=
umans to break free from the clutches of devils and like wise play goes on =
so don't worry much on these things. Let us sincerely call this supreme rea=
lity so that we can have a final meeting with the final power.

Just though=
t of sharing with you all as it was relevant to the topic.

Warm Regards,

=
Utpal
