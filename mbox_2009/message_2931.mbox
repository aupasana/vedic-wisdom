Namaskar Narasimha,

   I hope you h=
ave neither forgotten nor forgiven me till now.

   Isn't it true that forg=
iveness is the last option considered in a balanced judgement ?
   What kin=
d of a Guru are you to your many disciples on this list, if one person coul=
d budge your balance and cause disturbance to an extent that you forgot to =
consider the spiritual notion of forgiveness ? Start Reading Gita...

   Ho=
w will you accomplish a great task, if you have not yet learned to "Love yo=
ur actions" ?

                                 * * * 

>   I had no choice=
 but to ban him from the group after he continued > to misbehave even after=
 being warned to focus on the subject

anyone.
 
   You have a rich-history of attacking the tradition as well as =
personal attacks.

1. A message from "Sarbani Rath" on Sohamsa list starts =
as follows:
   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sohamsa/message/18148

>> Nara=
simha has also in the past two years made many statements in >> bad taste w=
hich were uninformed, pre-conceived and were personal >> attacks.

2. A mes=
sage from "Sanjay Rath" on Sohamsa list says:
   http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=
oup/sohamsa/message/19587

>> Strangely you seem to be on a binge to attack=
 everything where the >> word tradition is added ... while trying to redefi=
ne it.
 
   In these matters, everybody is ones' own judge - so I won't com=
ment on:
a. why Narasimha did what he hates to do ?
b. why I chose not to r=
eply to him immediately ?

                                  * * *

3.  Las=
tly, Asmita is not same as Ahamkara - Patanjali was much more learned and w=
ise to have chosen the word Asmita which doesn't equate to Ahamkara.

   Su=
ndeep and those who want to know the reason, may join my YahooGroup Patanja=
li_Raja_Yoga.

   But, please be sure, you have already seen the way my rep=
lies are going to be - like for like - even before you subscribe to this gr=
oup.

Regards,
Nitish
