Namaste,
 
I am replying to the list without revealing your identity.
 
Whe=
n you are doing an action (e.g. a homam, an archana, a service to the poor =
in your area etc), it is very unlikely and difficult that you are doing it =
without an "I" sense. But it is ok. Atleast, you are engaging your I-sense =
to work for the benefit of the world rather than self-gratification. When d=
o a homam or archana, you are trying to please a deity (personification of =
a particular good quality in all the people of the world). When you do soci=
al service, you are helping needy people. And so on.
 
While doing various =
kinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of mind from the limited self=
 (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to a larger entity (e.g. a d=
eity, a community, a society, a country, universe etc). One tries to focus =
the mind on others and not think much about oneself. This helps one overcom=
e mind's natural tendency to focus on limited self and gratification of tha=
t limited self.
 
While doing that, however, thoughts may arise "I am doing=
 this good and important work". Such thoughts bring the focus of mind back =
to the limited self (body, name, status, image etc). By telling oneself tha=
t the Lord is doing it though one and that one is merely an instrument, i.e=
. by cultivating the spirit of "Sarvam Sri Krishnaarpanamastu", one tries t=
o overcome that tendency towards self-gratification and/or self-glorificati=
on.
 
After repeated practice, such thinking becomes common sense to one an=
d one's mind gets focused on doing what one sees as one's dharma, without a=
ny sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glorification.
 
*        *=
        *
 
If a priest doing an archana for you takes your name and naksha=
tra in the sankalpam before the pooja, there is nothing to be worried. In y=
our mind, try to think as above.
 
Some priests go much further and say all=
 kinds of highly specific things in sankalpa. For example, I have seen prie=
sts say "to give dharma, artha, kaama, moksha, well-being, strength, boldne=
ss, success, fearless, longevity, health, wealth etc to so and so person, t=
o remove all past, present and future sins and all past, present and future=
 problems related to all planets, shadowy planets, sub-planets in rasi, nav=
amsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts at birth, in dasas and in transits, an=
d to give results as though all planets are placed in the 11th house and no=
t in the actual house of placement" etc etc. Some priests spend 5-10 minute=
s mentioning so many specific desires in sankalpam. When you find a priest =
saying things like that, I suggest just taking it easy and not getting eith=
er excited or disturbed. Just think in your mind "I am doing this ritual as=
 a humble offering to you. Please receive it kindly and give whatever you s=
ee as appropriate" and try to focus the mind on the deity. What's in your h=
eart is far more important than anything else.
 
*        *        *
 
Cult=
ivating the sense that whatever good work you are doing is being done by th=
e Lord *through you* and whatever results (including very bad ones) are giv=
en to you are fruits granted by the Lord to your karmas which you should ac=
cept without regrets, is an important activity that should go on outside of=
 the ritual time.
 
For example, when one's wife or husband (or someone clo=
se) yells at one or abuses one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One c=
an either become upset and angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wo=
ndering why the other person is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it =
as the fruits given by the Lord for one's previous actions and focus the mi=
nd on what good actions can be performed *now*. Similarly, when people prai=
se one, one has a choice. One can either become excited and gloat in the pr=
aises or one can think that the Lord used one as an instrument in getting t=
hat work done and focus the mind on what good actions can be performed *now=
*.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
