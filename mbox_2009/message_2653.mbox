 21st January, 1946

Echamma=92s cooking was never very good; it would not =
contain vegetables and
spices in proper proportions. To Bhagavan her devoti=
on was more tasty than
her preparations and so he never complained, but som=
e who could not relish
the food casually hinted at this now and then while =
Bhagavan was cutting
vegetables in the kitchen in the early morning hours. =
After hearing their
complaints repeatedly Bhagavan said, =93I don=92t know.=
 If you do not like the
food you need not eat it. I find it quite good and =
I shall continue to do
so.=94

Sometime back, she was sending food for abou=
t a week or ten days through
someone else because perhaps she was out of to=
wn or not quite well. The
cooks one day forgot to serve the food sent by he=
r and completed serving all
other items of food cooked in the Ashram. Bhaga=
van who would usually beckon
to others to start eating and would himself co=
mmence doing so, sat silently
that day with his left hand under the chin, a=
nd his right hand on the leaf.
The people there sitting in front began to l=
ook at one another and those in
the kitchen, or wondering and enquiring in =
whispers about the possible
reason. Suddenly they remembered that the food =
sent by Echamma had not been
served and, when they served it saying, =93Oh,=
 we have forgotten,=94 he gave the
formal signal to the others to eat and h=
e too commenced eating the food.

It is usual for him to eat with greater r=
elish the raw groundnuts offered to
him by a devotee than the highly season=
ed sweets and puddings offered by
rich people, just as Lord Krishna ate wit=
h relish the beaten rice handed
over to him by Kuchela.
