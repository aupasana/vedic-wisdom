Dear Narasimha,

I was thinking in the same line as Rajarshi has express=
ed in the below message about Sain Baba. In the morning when i saw your mes=
sage, first thing came to my mind is that How much influence Sain baba or K=
abir has on Muslims today? Immediately Shirdi temple and long queue came to=
 my imagination and can we find any Muslims there?

The fact remains that b=
e it Sain Baba or Kabir or another saint, unifying effect is only on Hindus=
 and their followers today are also only those.

>>>It was heartening to me=
 when I saw it. I saw a ray of hope<<<

Honestly, I am not very excited wit=
h this.

The Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentioned are true. and=
 those are the very reasons which prevents even the broad minded Islamic in=
dividual to succumb finally.

In my opinion, it requires a radical force fr=
om within the followers of Islam itself which can change their outlook for =
good.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 Again the reason is because Muhammed had told muslims that nothing can cha=

      <p>Dear Narasimha,<br>
<br>
I was =
thinking in the same line as Rajarshi has expressed in the below message ab=
out Sain Baba. In the morning when i saw your message, first thing came to =
my mind is that How much influence Sain baba or Kabir has on Muslims today?=
 Immediately Shirdi temple and long queue came to my imagination and can we=
 find any Muslims there?<br>
<br>
The fact remains that be it Sain Baba or =
Kabir or another saint, unifying effect is only on Hindus and their followe=
rs today are also only those.<br>
<br>
>>>It was heartening to me when I sa=
w it. I saw a ray of hope<<<<br>
<br>
Honestly, I am not very exci=
ted with this.<br>
<br>
The Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentione=
d are true. and those are the very reasons which prevents even the broad mi=
nded Islamic individual to succumb finally.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it requ=
ires a radical force from within the followers of Islam itself which can ch=
ange their outlook for good.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
Utpal<br>

I would beg to disagree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As =
I said he only lies and use half truths when it comes to other religion. Fo=
r Islam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam a=
nd non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconc=
ileable.=C3=83=E2=80=9A An explanation for this maybe digressing and long.<=
