Namaste,
     One option as Padmaja garu mentioned is to get a havan kund with stand at http://www.homastore.com ( http://www.homastore.com/shop/?cat=1&cart=8221&itemid=4).
     The other option is to buy the hawan kund from Indo US Plaza. Get two to four bricks (concrete or regular). Arrange the bricks on the floor, preferably on a 2ft by 2ft wooden plank wrapped with aluminium foil. Make sure you spread out the bricks, do not put them closer. Put the hawan kund on the bricks and make sure the hawan kund is stable.
     In the Mahagapathi homam video at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm, you can see couple of concrete bricks underneath the hawan kund that were put on the floor. Wooden plank with aluminium foil helps in cleaning the mess after every couple of weeks if you are doing homam daily.
     You can get a wooden spoon at a store like Walmart in US.

Thanks
Ravi

Namaste Friends,

I am trying to purchase the havan kund from the following online store, but they dont sell 'stand' for keeping the havan kund. 

I live in a rented apartment which has carpet floor.

One suggestion was to purchase a concrete slab from Home depot and place the havan kund. 

The online shop people also advised me that they would try to get havan kund with stand, as a special case but it can take few months. 

I am eager to find out how our US friends are performing homa in their residences?

Another point is that, these people do not sell wooden spoons and they are offering copper spoons for ahuti. Is it adviseable to use copper spoons? I look forward for your advice.

Thank you,
Shankar 
Detroit, MI, USA
