necessary
 arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself to be=
head Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.<br>> However, w=
hen the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his head =
Sankara's disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned this =
murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an '=
avesa' (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, bec=
ame the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra=
 siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous =
Kapalika and tore him to pieces.<br>
> Sankara Vijaya, published by the =
Ramakrishna Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, sc=
attering away the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew into =
the cave, stunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha in=
carnation once again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the =
Lord with his
 leonine claws.<br>> Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous r=
oars of a lion, awoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapa=
da's body was smeared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while his fac=
e glowed with divine splendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw befor=
e him the awesome Lord Narasimha himself and pacified him with soothing and=
 overflowing devotion.<br>
> On another occasion, Adi Sankara's hand=
s got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasi=
mha through the famous hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Sto=
tram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram'). These hymns=
 are so titled because each of these verses ends with the same refrain '=
;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam' (O Lord Narasimha, please l=
end me your helping hand).<br>
> It is believed that fervent recitation =
of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two stotras Adi Sankara compos=
ed on Him) will always help
 one smoothly get over difficulties with the Lo=
rd's helping hand.<br>> Salagrama, the sacred stone found only in th=
e Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in their homes, is=
 used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to be special=
ly sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given to Adi Sanka=
ra by Lord Narasimha himself.<br>
