 No one can think of fire without thinking of its burning power. Again, the
power of burning cannot be conceived as separate from fire. In the same
manner, we
cannot think of the rays of the sun, without thinking of the sun himself.
Again, we cannot think of the sun without thinking of his rays.

Therefore, no one can think of Brahman as apart from Sakti, or Sakti as
separate from Brahman. Likewise, no one can conceive of the phenomenal as
independent of the Absolute,or of the Absolute as apart from the phenomenal.
The same Eternal Energy, the Mother of all phenomena, is creating,
preserving, and destroying everything.

She is called Kali, the Divine Mother. Kali is Brahman, Brahman is Kali, one
and the same Being. I call Him Brahman when He is absolutely inactive; that
is,when He neither creates, nor preserves, nor destroys phenomena; but when
He performs all such actions, I call Him Kali, the Eternal Energy, the
Divine Mother. They are one and the same Being, the difference is in name
and form, just as the same substance water is called by different names in
different languages, such as jal, aqua, pani, etc. [p. 151]
