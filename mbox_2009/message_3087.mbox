Dear Siva,

Narasimha's views are to Fight/debate/disagree/question without=
 PASSION. so this is an apt thread to do some progress in that attitude.

I=
 am sorry if you feel sad or insulting when Sri Sri is criticized but under=
stand that So many millions of Hindus would have felt the same feeling in t=
hat debate. I personally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel a=
nd have placed them to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one fo=
r whom i have same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekanand=
a or Narasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us =
proud not only by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECA=
USE THEY OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF 'SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA'. BIGOTRY CAN NE=
VER BE ATTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the id=
eals of Sanatan Dharma.

***
Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about=
 him initially. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switc=
hed on TV where in i saw that person on 'Peace' Channel. He was lecturing i=
n front of a gathering and he used a word 'Veda' which interested me to go =
through.

I don't remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lec=
ture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christiani=
ty for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like 'Sansk=
aar' and 'Ashta' where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus)=
  come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they hav=
e attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of San=
atan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.
after that first lecture, i=
 watched Zakir's other lectures and was convinced that this person is not a=
 true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fan=
atic and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate =
at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated=
 on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking hi=
m that does he really believe that other religions and faith are also true.=
 I must say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more toleranc=
e and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.
The unfortunate part is that the br=
oad minded people of today's generations are getting corrupted by such fana=
tic leaders.

***
As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good fri=
ends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -"The time has come when=
 we must not only 'respect' the other religious faiths but also we must bel=
ive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is true and we must ne=
ver try to convert people of other religion to our religion but on the cont=
rary we must discourage a person who wants to formally convert by telling h=
im/her that yours is also right and don't get in to such theatrics.

I abso=
lutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :"as many are paths, as many opinion are th=
ere"
***
About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him as a great spiritual =
leader. i've some past experiences which makes me believe that. Now that is=
 the reason i wish to know his views on this particular debate episode. I k=
now he has a great knowledge and he also is a scholar but then why he did n=
ot counter Dr. Zakir?.
