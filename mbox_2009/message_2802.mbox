Excellent Article and may I add what a beautiful picture.  Please send
us =
more !

A couple of points:

1.  The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali=
 allowed for them also
signify how the lord will dissolve the maya and take=
s control of our
bodies and life.  With the first step the lord took contro=
l over the
Bhuva Loka (association with body and material aspects) and with=
 the
second step he took control over the higher lokas (indriyas) and final=
ly
the last step was left and only place left was Balis head (ahamkara)
whi=
ch was dissolved as well.

If you allow God to be part of your life then he=
 will work in mystical
ways and take care of the illusion of your body, sen=
ses, and finally
your ego

2.  The story cannot be complete without the rol=
e played by Shukracharya
or the guru of the Asuras.  He knew that Sri Vaman=
a was no other than
Sri Vishnu and warned Bali but the latter out of pride =
and duty still
gave his word (there was still some goodness in Bali, maybe =
a small
piece).  To seal the deal water was to be put out of the kamandalu =
of
Sri Vamana onto the hands of Bali.  Shukracharya shrinks to a small size=

and tries to block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana
tak=
es a straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye.  The
guru of t=
he Asuras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).

As the devata tries =
to enter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element
will play all kinds of tr=
icks and block the path.   A straw
(representing qualities of Surya or the =
scriptures) accompanied by an
able Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.

egards
