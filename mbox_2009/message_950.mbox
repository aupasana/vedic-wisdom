Namaste,
 
You can see the procedure for invoking Ganapathi in fire in the =
homam manual (see link below). At a minimum, say "atra aagachchha" (come he=
re), "aavaahito bhava" (be invoked), "sthaapito bhava" (be established here=
). While saying it, mentally imagine that Ganapati is entering the fire and=
 setting down there.
 
After saying the above, you can just make offerings =
with a swaahaa.
 
At the end, imagine that Ganapati is leaving the fire, wh=
ile saying "yathaa sthaanam pratishthaapayaami".
 
The manual has everythin=
g in more detail.
 
Rituals are largely a mental game. The stronger you can=
 mentally imagine and believe that there is a god there receiving your serv=
ices and offerings, the better your ritual is. Increase the strength of bel=
ief.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear S=
ir,
        Certain words I can not understand properly as these words are =
new for me. In your reply you have written that ....
        "If we invoke =
a specifice deity in fire and worship him and then offer Ahutis...."
      =
  Here what is the meaning of Invoking? If the meaning is inviting then I a=
m not doing that. Directly I am starting homam with Adhaar Ahutis of Surya,=
 Prajapati, Indra, Agni and soma. Then directly giving 12 ahutis of Maha Ga=
napati Mantra, then immediately 24 Gayatri Mantra for Gayatri and like one =
by one in continuance. Specially I am not inviting any deity in fire. Some =
confusion created in my mind so this clarification is needed Sir.

          Namaste,

          There is no need to=
 say that. Just add swaahaa first 11 times and vaushat in the 12th time.

 =
         Saying "this is for XYZ god and not mine" after the mantra is need=
ed if we are using fire to send generic aahutis to various deities like Pra=
japati, Agni, Vayu etc. If we invoke a specific deity in fire and worship h=
im and then offer aahutis for him, you can merely read the mantra and add s=
waahaa. No need to specifically say "this is for XYZ god and not mine" afte=
r each mantra.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

                  Dear Sir,
                  One more qu=
estion for Homam.
                  Suppose I am giving 12 Ahutis daily to =
Maha Ganpati with (Aum, Shrim, Hrim Klim.....Vashamanay a Swaha) Maha Ganap=
ati Mantra, is it necessary that I have to speak - Idam Maha Ganapataye, Id=

                  Or  It is OK if  I give =
12 Ahutis first with the Mantras only and I will speak -Idam Maha Ganpataye=
,Idam Na Mama - only once at the last after 12th Ahuti is completed?
