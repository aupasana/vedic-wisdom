Namaste Venkat garu,
 
This IS the purpose of the group and not at all a misuse.
 
(1) It is perfectly ok. In fact, even if the original expert recorded it mechanically and without much devotion, you will still get good punya from it if you listen to it with focus and devotion.
 
The purpose of mantra is to control the mind and its thoughts and tap some spiritual energy that the mind has access to but does not get because of its various pre-occupations. If you hear something with focus, it still helps in controlling the mind, tapping some spiritual energy. It is still beneficial.
 
However, as you become comfortable with it, try to chant it yourself at some stage. That is a little better.
 
(2) Yes. As you hear, a part of your mind is repeating that sound while you do the actions. It will still be beneficial. In fact, I know that some people who are now doing homam quite well started out in that manner!
 
(3) You will benefit mainly. But various people who enabled you will also get some small portions of it. But most of the benefit for this specific action is yours.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
