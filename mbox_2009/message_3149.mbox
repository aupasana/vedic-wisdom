Namaste,
=C2=A0
This mail reminded me of a saying of Ma Sarada:
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
"The mind is everything. It is in the mind alone that one feels pure an=
d impure."
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi




The upsurge (of consciousness=
) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Narasimh=
a=C2=A0 garu

i have some queries regarding homam.

my parents=C2=A0 are sa=
ying , we should not do homam at home because our homes are not clean like =
temples , where homam's are performed.

Also women's get period every month=
 , so=C2=A0 our homes are not sacred to do homam at home.

Even at my home =
we do satyanarayana swami vratam and Kedareswrara swamy vratam , after pain=
ting our home (in telugu we say ellalu veyinchina tarvata matrame) and no w=
omen when they are in periods=C2=A0 should not enter into home till complet=
ion of the vratam.

If this is the case , then how can i do homam at home ,=
 i dont have seperate pooja room ?

How can i clean my home before doing ho=
mam ?
(homam chaala pavitram ga , nishta ga cheyali ani)

Also=C2=A0 is the=
 homa kundam should be of shape square or it can be any , i am not getting =
square shaped utensil at any where.

is round shaped utensil can i use ?

P=
