Namaste :-)

I mentioned that I don't desire to read any book for past 6 mo=
nths or so.

This message of Narasimha adds to that desireless ness. Even h=
is compulsive critic would think before making any comments after reading t=
his. Just a lighter comment. don't take seriously friends.  

nothing more =
is required to read on *The Mother Kundalini*. She will do the needful when=
 time comes.

sorry for the praise again. i couldn't actually contain mysel=
f.

Best Regards,

Utpal
