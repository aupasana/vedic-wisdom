Dear Members,
=A0
I would agree to Rajarshiji about the Kaalighat priest / =
pandas.
=A0
About Dakshineshwar, I would like to add a few more words based=
 on my experience. I have been visiting this temple since the age of 10 and=
 I have seen how things have changed around the temple but fortunately the =
peace inside the temple still prevails and I do get a lot of positive energ=
y. Incidently, my Istha devata is Maa Kaali and I could feel her divine gra=
ce much more than Kaalighat ( my personal opinion).
=A0
Over the period of =
years the temple has gained importance nationally / globally due to=A0Sri R=
amkrishna, Sharda Maa and Swami Vivekanda's ashram. Hence the pilgrims & to=
urist inflow has increased by many folds but still the authorities are tryi=
ng to maintain a clean atmosphere / surroundings as compared to Kaalighat. =

=A0
Here too the priest are commercial minded but not as much obvious as i=
n Kaalighat. The devotees do not get much time to have the darshan of Maa d=
ue to the long crowd as well as your feet will burn if the sun is shining b=
right. But what I suggest is that just opposite to the temple is a open hal=
l from where Maa Kaali can be seen clearly as Maa's idol is much elevated=
=A0 (please note that you will have to take about 20 steps to have her dars=
han). I sit in this hall and try to get a place where I can see her clearly=
 and then meditate once my system has absorbed her full Rupa - a pleasant f=
eeling. Forget the crowd around you and you can have a good dialouge with M=
aa. 
=A0
After Maa's darshan walk down to the abode of Shri Ramkrishna , yo=
ur mind will be so peaceful after the meditation - so much of positive ener=
gy around there. The next hop would be a pleasant boat ride ( I prefer that=
 as it make me close to mother nature - car ride is also possible)=A0visit =
the Swami Vivekananda Ashram . Well I bet the day is well spent and you wil=
l feel better.
=A0
(this is my personal experience and it might differ from=
 others, but a place worth visiting)


Warm Regards,=A0

Debabrato Sarkar

Dear Sunita,
=A0
If you are going to the Kaalighat=
 temple, you need to be careful of the local priests/pandas. They can be ve=
ry nasty and extremely money minded. Dakshineshwar is more peaceful.=A0Near=
 the Dakshineshwar ma Kaali idol, closeby is the room where Sri Ramakrishna=

=A0
Wis=

 The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a=
 spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particul=
ar object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets "established" in tha=
t idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form fast=
er and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds=
 are separate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are abl=
e to perceive in some vague form other people's strong thoughts that are pr=
esent in the ether.
 Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several=
 spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing th=
at idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.<BR>> >=
 <BR>> > However, there is some translation involved when thoughts of=
 one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This trans=
lation is dependent on one's mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at=
 the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!<BR>> > <BR>>=
; > Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday o=
f a fierce goddess who kills all of one's enemies, brings people under one'=
s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then yo=
u are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as some=
one who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothin=
g bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol a=
s a
 repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.<BR>> &=
gt; <BR>> > However, please note that this principle works without an=
 idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench)=
 and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts ar=

<BR>> > <BR>> > However, please note that most people have some=
 devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they=

hip the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he=
 walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty =

 I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=

i (Ramana Maharshi's place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=

 it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the div=

 it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and st=

the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over =
the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the=
 roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that =
the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left=
