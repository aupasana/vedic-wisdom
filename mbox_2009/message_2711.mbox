Dear Utpalji,
=C2=A0
Nice query. 
=C2=A0
Logically speaking, it maybe that =
"soul leaving the body" has does not mean mearging once self awareness into=
 the Brahman. 
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


The upsurge (of consciousne=
ss) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Does it mean =
that when consciousness reaches Sahasraar Chakra, one merges in to Brahman =
and that is the same state which is named varyingly as Realisation/ Jeevan =
Mukta/Nirvikalpa Samaadhi/Merging in to brahaman etc...?

Why i asked you t=

, in "Auto Biography of a Yogi", it is mentioned that only the souls who de=
part from Sahsraar are eligible to enter to Suvarnaa loka and then there th=
ey have to still work out the bondage of their Karana Shareera...
Is it not=
 true that Chetana reaching Sahsraar means *practically* end of journey.?

=
How to reconcile with the above to seemingly different informations?

Best =

Utpal

Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understandin=
g of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaar=
a chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves=
 Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of =
earth element are effaced in one's self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Sw=
aadhishthaana, water element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of =
water element are effaced in one's self-awareness. And so on.
> > > 
> > > =
By earth and water etc, don't just think of physical earth and physical wat=
er etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows=
 a flexible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one "ow=
ns" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is=
 of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that one "needs" a parti=
cular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nat=
ure of water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapp=
ed to the five elements.

from the physical aspect, one may think of "I" as someone who has certain q=

 about who one is, form one's self-awareness and Kundalini represents that =
self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* t=

experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely about s=

dalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one =

each chakra, each element is effaced in one's cumulative idea of who one is=

a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redundan=

mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be red=

hile rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is th=

 even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. Wh=

and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed =
to have a perfect control.

no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of=
 the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half formed. There being mult=

 M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which 'claim to explain' =
