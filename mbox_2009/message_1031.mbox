Namaskaar to all Gurus, esp Narasimha!

First, not sure how -and how much -=
to thank you for your tireless 
services to provide us with the fantastic a=
nd improved version of 
JHORA!!! But, here's an expression of gratitude fro=
m an unseen student 
of yours!

I have a question but am unsure whether thi=
s is the right forum to pose 
it -please forgive me, the transgression is u=
nintentional.

The Q: If our beliefs are firmly rooted in karma and of rein=
carnation 
[which I am absolutely], why then should we pray year after year=
 for 
the departed soul/s? 

Given that the atman is itself indestructible,=
 what is the necessity to 
annually set aside a day to perform "tharpanam"?=
 Isn't this rendered 
superfluous because of the soul's independent path, r=
egardless of what 
other [mere] mortals think or do [whether or not related=
]?

Unless the soul was destined to attain moksha, wouldn't the soul simply=
 
latch onto another body and be re-born?

Anyone to proffer an answer plea=
se? Grateful!
Venkat
