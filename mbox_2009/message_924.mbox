Namaste Narasimhaji

I was reading up on the old mail about how your starte=
d doign Chandi 
Homa. You mentioned that you always considered Ma Lakshmi a=
s you 
Istha Devata.

Now what I was wondering about it that, is it possibl=
e that for a 
person to get closer to his/her Istha, he/she may have to und=
er go 
serious sadhana of some other deity?

Like in your case you have don=
e so many homas for Ma Chandi, so does 
it mean Ma Chandi is your Istha dev=
ata? 

Or does it mean Ma Lakshmi wanted you to do these sadhanas so that 
=
you can progress faster, maybe you had done a lot of sadhana for Ma 
Chandi=
 in previous lives?

Kindly tell us your views on this.

-Regards
 Rajarshi=
