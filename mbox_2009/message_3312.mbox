If god is within us and we call god from our heart in fire then why can't a=
 woman with periods do homam.What happens to the god in the woman's heart d=
uring periods?I find this confusing and need clarification.

This might sou=
nd silly but I amn't able to understand that during homam why should we inv=
oke the diety in the idol when we are already invoking the diety in the fir=
e. So far I have done my homams without invoking the diety in idol.

I want=
 to do chandi homam but after reading list of rules (like one shouldn't yaw=
n, not hold the book in hand, sitting place should be very clean, no singin=
g of mantras, pronouncing mantras properly etc ) am a bit scared. Also in t=
he manual you have mentioned women shouldn't fall to lust while doing chand=
i homam. Can you please put more light into this? What will be the conseque=
nces if a woman fails? 
 My parents are advising me not to do any complicat=
ed rituals as one can face anything but not the wrath of god. Kindly advice=
.

Regards and thanks,
Shraddha
