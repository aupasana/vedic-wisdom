Pranam,

i too move the coconut pieces in the homam to ensure that they are=
 burnt completely. have done a few experiments like resting a big piece on =
smaller pieces so that there is passage of air underneath the big piece. Wh=
en the fire starts subsiding i turn the piece upside down to ensure that bo=
th sides burn completely. Sometime the piece crumbles while turning it...bu=
t some solid portion always remains waiting to be burnt. At the end of the =
havan when the kund is emptied there are generally some slivers of burnt co=
conut left that have not been completely reduced to ashes. i think of them =
as solid hard core karmas/impurities/ego that need dissolution.

:):):)

lo=
ve and best wishes
