"Sanskrit commentaries" are not a panacea free fr=
om these lines of
thinking. In South India, the dharma-shAstra most-widely =
"followed"
was written by Apastamba. Certainly, his dharma-shAstra and a sa=
nskrit
commentary upon it, believe in varnA by birth, and prAyashcitta for
=
association with Shudras. Those who are interested can look at the
followin=
g sutras -- 1.1.4, 1.1.6, 1.1.32, 2.9.9, 2.9.11. After talking
about birth =
into a varNa, Apastamba also talks about birth by
knowledge, brought about =
by a true guru (1.1.10 - 1.1.18). This is
said to be superior to the "mere =
birth of the body from the parents".
The context makes it clear that this i=
s sub-category of the earlier
classification, and is not a contradiction.

=
All that aside, it doesn't really matter. The world has changed.
