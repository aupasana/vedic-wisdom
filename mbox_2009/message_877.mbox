As usual your explanation is wonderful and brill=
iant. I understand the significance of cloth now. 
=C2=A0
Actually I asked =
about the cracking sound because of something I noticed. This may sound wei=
rd and nonsensical, but teh way my homa goes gives an indication of how the=
 coming days pass untill my next homa. Or while doing the homa if some thou=
ght about something comes into my mind, the way the fire reacts with the so=
unds gives an idea of how the things will go.
=C2=A0
This I have observed t=
wo many times. Initially I though I am over imagining, but now it has happe=
ned too many times for me to ignore it. And this includes the cracking soun=
ds. Every cracking sound corresponds to something or the other. Weird this =
may seem. 
=C2=A0
Let me give u an example. Last week before I went on a tr=
ip, I was doing a homa. While in the middle my thoughts went to how the tri=
p would go. I was excited. Suddenly there was a huge crack in the wood, whi=
ch brough me back to the present. Same way towards the end of the homa anot=
her huge sound. Otherwise it was very good and left a happy feeling.
=C2=A0=

During my trip, in the train while going my money bag was stolen. I landed=
 a pauper in Kasi with not even one rupee on me. Thankfully I had a friend =
along with me. The trip went very well and made me happy. Again while comin=
g back our trains got delayed due to fog and had to send nine hours waiting=
 in teh train. But trip went beautiful.
=C2=A0
This corresponded almost hug=
ely to how my homa had gone as I think back. There have been other incident=
s like this too quite often. 
=C2=A0
But anyway I think all this is ok and =
all right. I was thinking about this yesterday night when the thought came =
to me that everything is indeed controlled my Bhairava/Shiva, and it is my =
imperfection that I do not realise it.=C2=A0=C2=A0Every sound, every act, e=
very movement is through His will..=C2=A0He is the one who knows best. 
=C2=
=A0
Thanking you for your time and patience in answering my queries.

Namaste Rajarshi,

Happy new year=

=C2=A0
Cracking can be because of air or moisture t=
rapped in wood. Don't worry about it.
=C2=A0
Offering clothes to gods is li=
ke offering clothes to your mother and father. But remember one thing. If y=
ou give expensive clothes as opposed to simple clothes, human beings may be=
 happier. But gods do not care much about the value placed on clothes by hu=
man beings. A simple 1 ft x 1ft cotton cloth offered with devotion, sinceri=
ty and surrender may please Her much more than a 9 ft x=C2=A04 ft silk sare=
e with elaborate silver embroidery work offered with pomp and pride.=C2=A0G=
ods do not think like normal human beings. One should offer what is reasona=
ble based on one's finances and time and maintain a humble attitude of surr=
ender.
=C2=A0
A child who is proud and pompous does not impress his mother =
as much as an innocent child does. When you do a homam, think and behave li=
ke a small child who plays a game with his mother in which he feeds small b=
ites of food to mother. One's mother may be big and be able to take care of=
 herself. But she may like to play a game with the child and say "I am hung=
ry my son. Can you please give me some food?" Even if the child gives very =
small bites, she may say "oh thank you. I am full now." Just as in the alle=
gory, we are children and gods we worship in fire (or elsewhere) are parent=
s who have everything and do not really need anything from us. Yet, for the=
ir pastime, they engage in a play with us. Be an innocent child in that pla=
y rather than being a pompous and proud kid. We are feeding little bites to=
 playful parents who do not really need anything from us and who actually o=
wn everything that we consider ours.
=C2=A0
Esoterically, clothes represent=
 the gunas that condition us.
=C2=A0
Regarding burning good and bad karmas:=
 Suppose a great saint visits you and you serve him and offer him something=
 nice. Suppose he blesses you. His blessings may either enhance good result=
s or decrease bad results. Both are possible. With fire and homam also, bot=
h are possible. Fire may burn a bad karma and relieve you from having to ex=
perience its fruit. Fire may also receive a good karma and give its fruit i=
mmediately. Fire is intelligent and you do not have to worry.
=C2=A0

One more=

 it burns or also the once we call good karmas?

Dear Members

Wish you all a very h=
appy new year.

I had a few questions to people who use wood for homa. Some=
times the 
wood bursts in the fire with a loud crack. Is it because of trap=
ped 
air in teh wood? If so, is there anything that can be done to reduce 
=
this cracking. 

Sometimes I have seen people offering pieces of cloth in f=
ire during 
poornahuti. What does cloth indicate?

-Regards
Rajarshi
