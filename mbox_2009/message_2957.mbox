Namaste,
    I had seen this version and had the same question. In some ot=
her versions of  Rudram elsewhere 11th Anuvaka stops elsewhere. It almost s=
eems as if they dont want to stop
finish at stanza with  'Namo rudraya' vis=
hnave mrityurme pahi'. 
Does anybody know the actual reason for this?
