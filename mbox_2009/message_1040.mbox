Namaste,

There is no truth in what you heard. Not only that, but you can do homam to 
a very very badly placed and afflicted planet in your chart also. There is 
no problem with it. In fact, Maharshi Parasara suggests doing homam with the 
mantra of the planet that is badly afflicted in a chart, for relief. See the 
chapter on "graha shanti" in "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram".

Anybody can do homa to any planet or any deity, irrespective of the 
horoscope.

Jupiter is badhakesha in my chart and he is in an inimical house. I have 
been doing a homam daily for 2.5 years.

Best regards,
Narasimha
