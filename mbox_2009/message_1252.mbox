Dear Jitender,

Goal of all sadhana is internal purification. Homam is far more efficient 
than other sadhanas and actually increases the effectiveness of other 
sadhanas when used in conjunction with them. However, time has to come for 
anything. Don't worry about the inability to do homam.

Meditation of 15-20 min is only better than no meditation. It is not really 
that effective. For most people, it is hardly sufficient for cleaning up the 
impurities that accumulated in the subtle body within the last 24 hours. One 
needs to take care of accumulated karmas of several lives and that needs 
much heavier sadhana.

However, if this is all you can manage now, that is fine. As I keep saying, 
rituals like japam and homam are only one part of the sadhana one does. One 
can engage in constant contemplation of one's thoughts and motives to weed 
out the internal weaknesses and overcome ego. Every moment and every 
activity can and should be sadhana. Watch your thoughts and reactions to 
what others do and say and see if any shadripus (internal enemies) or other 
internal weaknesses have a role in those thoughts and how ego is causing all 
this. When one starts to put in conscious effort into such contemplation, 
that is also sadhana. Whether one does japam or homam or something else, 
this contemplation is also needed. If you cannot do those, you can still 
engage in contemplation. Depending on your readiness, it can work fast or 
slowly. But remember that no effort is ever wasted.

Best regards,
Narasimha
