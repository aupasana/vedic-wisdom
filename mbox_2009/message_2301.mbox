_The_Parliament_of_Religions/Why_we_disagree

I will tell you a little stor=
y. You have heard the eloquent speaker who has
just finished say, "Let us c=
ease from abusing each other," and he was very
sorry that there should be a=
lways so much variance.

But I think I should tell you a story which would =
illustrate the cause of
this variance. A frog lived in a well. It had lived=
 there for a long time.
It was born there and brought up there, and yet was=
 a little, small frog. Of
course the evolutionists were not there then to t=
ell us whether the frog
lost its eyes or not, but, for our story's sake, we=
 must take it for granted
that it had its eyes, and that it every day clean=
sed the water of all the
worms and bacilli that lived in it with an energy =
that would do credit to
our modern bacteriologists. In this way it went on =
and became a little sleek
and fat. Well, one day another frog that lived in=
 the sea came and fell into
the well.

"Where are you from?"

"I am from th=
e sea."

"The sea! How big is that? Is it as big as my well?" and he took a=
 leap from
one side of the well to the other.

"My friend," said the frog o=
f the sea, "how do you compare the sea with your
little well?=94

Then the =
frog took another leap and asked, "Is your sea so big?"

"What nonsense you=
 speak, to compare the sea with your well!"

"Well, then," said the frog of=
 the well, "nothing can be bigger than my
well; there can be nothing bigger=
 than this; this fellow is a liar, so turn
him out."

That has been the dif=
ficulty all the while.

I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well an=
d thinking that the whole
world is my little well. The Christian sits in hi=
s little well and thinks
the whole world is his well. The Mohammedan sits i=
n his little well and
thinks that is the whole world. I have to thank you o=
f America for the great
attempt you are making to break down the barriers o=
f this little world of
ours, and hope that, in the future, the Lord will he=
lp you to accomplish
your purpose.
