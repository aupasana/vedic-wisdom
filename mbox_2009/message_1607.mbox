Yes we do share the same Birthday! Wish you a very happ=
y birthday in advance.

in my opinion, what matters for us is Sadhana, S=
adhana and More Sadhana. Purification and direct perception of supreme trut=
h. everything else such as Swa-Dharma etc.. will fall in place after that o=
r during the path.

Yes Sir, that seems to be the best and most reliable=
 option, the more I think the more this alone seems to be the solution.


B=
y the way, the word 'Sadhna' reminded me of 'Hanumaan Jayanti' on coming Th=
ursday (Chaitri Paournima). intrested members may think of taking leave fro=
m their daily job and recite 'Hanumaan Chalisa' from morning to Evening-108=
 times if possible.

Thank you very much for informing in advance. Excel=
lent day for praying to Lord Hanuman.

Namaste Rajarshi,

We share the same Birthday (Saal ko goli m=
aro;). happy b'day in advance!

I thought that you might have misunderstood=
 Swaboda w.r.t. his comments regarding Terrorists hence i gave my earlier r=
eply

***

My take on the whole issue of Swa-Dharma is as under:

1) Swabod=
a in his Article, as you pointed out, does not proivde any insight in to Sw=
aDharma. but atleast he would have been successfull in triggering some impo=
rtant chain of thoughts in atleast some of the serious readers.

2) Narasim=
ha has expressed it accurately in his message when he says that it is *very=
 vey very* difficult to find out individual Dharma. his whole message is qu=
ite insightful and dispeller of many a doubts. 

3) Few months back, i was =
confused and worried about my swa-dharma and such stuff. now there is a goo=
d amount of clarity and clutterlessness. it was because of the below messag=
e of Narasimha which i read few months ago AND my own contemplation on the =
matter AND Thakur Ramkrishna's disicive quote which i am reproducing below:=


[[[[[
This is the message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world. Care no=
t for doctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count f=
or but little compared with that essence of existence which is in each one,=
 and 
called 'spirituality' . The more this develops in a man, the more pow=
erful is he for good. He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow =
man. First, then, acquire that. Only those who have seen it will understand=
 this; but such spirituality can be given to others, even though they be un=
conscious of the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are among=
st the great teachers of mankind. They are the powers of light. Then be you=
 this! The more of such men any country produces, the higher that country i=
s raised. That land where no such men exist is doomed. Nothing can save it.=
 Therefore, my Master's message to the world is, `Be ye all spiritual! Get =
ye first realization! ' And to the young and strong of every country he wou=
ld cry that the time is come for renunciation. 'Renounce for the sake of hu=
manity! You have talked of the love of man till the thing is in danger of b=
ecoming words alone. The time is come to act. The call is now. Do! Leap
 in=
to the breach and save the world! 
]]]]

4) in my opinion, what matters for=
 us is Sadhana, Sadhana and More Sadhana. Purification and direct perceptio=
n of supreme truth. everything else such as Swa-Dharma etc.. will fall in p=
lace after that or during the path.

By the way, the word 'Sadhna' reminded=
 me of 'Hanumaan Jayanti' on coming Thursday (Chaitri Paournima). intrested=
 members may think of taking leave from their daily job and recite 'Hanumaa=
n Chalisa' from morning to Evening-108 times if possible.

any takers?

War=

Utpal

<DIV>Namaste Rajarshi,<BR><BR>We share the same B=
irthday (Saal ko goli maro;). happy b'day in advance!<BR><BR>I thought that=
 you might have misunderstood Swaboda w.r.t. his comments regarding Terrori=
sts hence i gave my earlier reply<BR><BR>***<BR><BR>My take on the whole is=
sue of Swa-Dharma is as under:<BR><BR>1) Swaboda in his Article, as you poi=
nted out, does not proivde any insight in to SwaDharma. but atleast he woul=
d have been successfull in triggering some important chain of thoughts in a=
tleast some of the serious readers.<BR><BR>2) Narasimha has expressed it ac=
curately in his message when he says that it is *very vey very* difficult t=
o find out individual Dharma. his whole message is quite insightful and dis=
peller of many a doubts. <BR><BR>3) Few months back, i was confused and wor=
ried about my swa-dharma and such stuff. now there is a good amount of clar=
ity and clutterlessness. it was because of the below message of Narasimha w=
hich i read few
 months ago AND my own contemplation on the matter AND Thak=
ur Ramkrishna's disicive quote which i am reproducing below:<BR><BR>[[[[[<B=
R>This is the message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world. Care not for =
doctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count for but=
 little compared with that essence of existence which is in each one, and <=
BR>called 'spirituality' . The more this develops in a man, the more powerf=
ul is he for good. He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow man=
. First, then, acquire that. Only those who have seen it will understand th=
is; but such spirituality can be given to others, even though they be uncon=
scious of the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are amongst =
the great teachers of mankind. They are the powers of light. Then be you th=
is! The more of such men any country produces, the higher that country is r=
aised. That land where no such men exist is doomed. Nothing can save it. Th=
erefore,
 my Master's message to the world is, `Be ye all spiritual! Get ye=
 first realization! ' And to the young and strong of every country he would=
 cry that the time is come for renunciation. 'Renounce for the sake of huma=
nity! You have talked of the love of man till the thing is in danger of bec=
oming words alone. The time is come to act. The call is now. Do! Leap into =
the breach and save the world! <BR>]]]]<BR><BR>4) in my opinion, what matte=
rs for us is Sadhana, Sadhana and More Sadhana. Purification and direct per=
ception of supreme truth. everything else such as Swa-Dharma etc.. will fal=
l in place after that or during the path.<BR><BR>By the way, the word 'Sadh=
