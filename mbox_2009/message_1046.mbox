Nalini ben,

i completely agree with you and that is why i don't go in to m=
uch 
technical details when it comes to spiritual realms.

Even if Raama is=
 incorrectly addressed as Raavana out of ignorance 
thinking that the name =
represents Lord Raama. will Raama be actually 
take any offence? he'll know=
 that this dear devotee is actually 
invoking me with devotion.

by the way=
, i was told in my childhood that Raavana was a great 
devotee of Lord Raam=
a!

Best Regards,
Utpal
