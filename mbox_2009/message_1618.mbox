namaste,

> So that is one sure shot, explicit case


This is a very strong=
 statement.

> The=A0Chandogya Upanishad mentions this incident. The boy ca=
me to Gauthama Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked him for his gotra. T=
he boy goes back to his mother and finds out that his mother is not aware o=
f who the father was.


This is a popular misconception. Satyakama asks his=
 mother this
question upfront. The mother does not know her child's gotra. =
Why? In
olden days, women married young, and did not ask questions such as
=
"Who are you? What is your gotra?" to their husband. (In some areas,
this i=
s still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated
during various=
 samskara's, she would naturally remember it. The
conclusion here is that h=
er husband, whom she served with devotion,
died young.


> The boy comes ba=
ck and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says that he shall teach the bo=
y as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and thus by default is a Brahma=
na.


The seers were tri-kAla-darshi-s. Gautama knew of his boy's pedigree
=
before asking him the question. After hearing his answer, he says "A
non-br=
ahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved from
the truth". =
"satyam" is explained as "brAhmaNa-jAti-dharma".

First, you have a jAti-br=
AhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on
his own, during childhood. He t=
hen answers the preceptor's question
truthfully, in his mother's own words,=
 without embellishment. This is
a very rare set of events. Of course the ac=
haryA sees the worthy
student in front of him.

bhavadIyaH,

      ajit
