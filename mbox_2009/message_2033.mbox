Dear Narasimha ji and list members, Namaste

I have recently started performing daily Deva, Rishi and Pitri Tarpana by following your manuals,
while trying as much as possible to keep my thoughts and intentions focused on the purpose and
meaning of each step.

Could you please elaborate on what the concluding shlokas (narakeSu samasteSu yaatanaasu ca ye
sthitaH...) mean?  With what intention should they be recited?

Kind regards,

Samir
