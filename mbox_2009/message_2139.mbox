namaste,

>One can do whatever one wants - good and bad - and declare at th=
e >end like a great philosopher, "god did it through me". But, the...

Exac=
tly. i agree completely. an individual with I ness can always think in term=
s such as 'I am doing' 'i am happy' 'i am sad' 'why it is happening to me..=
.what did i do wrong' etc... It means that the person has a sense of free w=
ill and as a result enjoys the fruits good or bad or mixed (however most bo=
ast about free will when enjoys good fruits but as soon as bad fruits comes=
 on the way they blame destiny, god, and everything else).

I felt that the=
 whole issue of free will may be explained with one line "there is actually=
 no free will". to clear any confusion, i never meant that people should do=
 as they wish without discrimination and look for only comfortable result f=
or themselves and perform crime, Adharma and then pretend to be philosopher=
 by quoting Ramkrishna or Gita. it is foolishness and darkest layer of igno=
rance to use the teaching of Thakur in that way . i may be completely wrong=
 in my freewill understanding (or misunderstanding)as i have no experience =
of anything which is beyond the realm of five senses.

Elsewhere i have wri=
tten following to rafal:
>A is suppose to be a fool in a birth so 'A' does =
foolish
>activities and gets the fruits of the same. B is suppose to be a >=
demon in one life. it is ordained that way and hence B keeps on >engaging i=
n gruesome activities due to wrath, jealousy, pride, >etc=85does exactly as=
 ordained and gets the fruits accordingly.
>A and B are destined to realize=
 self, they will think and act >accordingly, they will meet a right Guru, d=
o lawful activities,
>sadhanaas etc.. and the fruit of all these will be se=
lf realization >which was already fixed. so every activities and correspond=
ing >Fruits (mental and physical), would be in compliance with the law >of =
nature and there is no violation just because the drama is fixed.

i've giv=
en few verses from DS in one of the messages for you to explain.

few days =
back, at my native, i was going thro' Ramkrishna Lila prasang. Interesting =
thing i again read after a long time is about Naren's experiences. He used =
to feel that he knows people, houses, and even some episodes beforehand. He=
 felt that he has already seen these things before. He finally came to inte=
llectual conclusion that he would have seen all his life on earth like a fi=
lm before he incarnated.

let me leave this topic at that if i've enough fr=
ee will to do that:).

Best regards,

utpal
