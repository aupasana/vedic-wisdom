Dear Friend,
Every person is destined as per his own past Karmas. Bad perio=
d and bad dasha misguides us. Your frustation is right but you are victim o=
f your own planets who were not in your favour at that time. God's planetar=
y work is supreme.

since t=
his group focuses on vedic wisdom, and have seen learned 
dsicussions by Na=

the right (vedic) way =
to remediate ..

for the past few years i am remembering my past how people=
 have 
influenced me badly and made me a weaker person. by lack of guidance=
, 
these people who are very close to me (relatives, friends) have made 
me=
 choose wrong choices etc. i am in a mess, psychologically and 
spiritually=
. I believed in god all along, did my japam etc. why did i 
fall prey to th=
ese people? 

i realize now that after many years, these people are ignoran=
t. I 
wanted to say 'ignorant fools' but there are some elders involved 
he=
re.

i can assume this as karma phala, but the past is hindering me. there =

is so much pent up anger, that i want to go back and kick these 
people wh=
o have mis guided me.

how do I forigve these people and forget? even gita,=
 or homam etc are 
not any reprive. the soul is frustrated ... what does go=
d get out of 
this drama?

any thoughts, wise men and women?
