Namaste Amit and Rajarshi,

I remember having read the book called "Bharati=
ya Nari" (Translated version of Vivekananda's work on Indian women". The su=
bject matter is the part of that book.

Honestly, though i adore vivekanand=
a so much, found it very hard to understand the statements. there are few o=
ther quotes in the same book which i could not reconcile with.

Only possib=
le answer to such thing is - "Take everything with pinch of salt". As Naras=
imha Says - Everybody (Even Ramakrishna himself) can be deluded by Mahaamaa=
ya!!! she is the ultimate authority in the realm of Dualistic world and cap=
able of deluding everybody.

so as Rajarshi has said, Think for your self. =
if something is not digestable, don't be sycophant to accept it - don't for=
ce you mind to accept it just because they are the words from the mouth of =
saintly authority.

best reagards,

Utpal
