Dear Narasimha ji,
 Is it okay to keep doing homam once the dakshinayan (sl=
eeping of god?) starts?
 does JHora display somewhere if a given date is in=
 uttaryana/dakshinayana? 
 With your grace I was able to finish my first ch=
andi homam past pournima. Many thanks for your efforts.

Many Thanks!
