Namaste,

In our local temple here in upstate NY, several people sponsor a homa. All the sponsors (say, 4 or 5 persons - most unrelated to one another) gather around the homa kundam and offer ahutis. How does the concept of intertwining of individual karmas and karmaphalas among affect this? 

Regards,
Narasimhaswamy Banavara

Namaste,
 
It is fine to do multiple 
homas in the same fire, if the persons doing it have intertwined 
karmas.
 
If one starts a fire and makes 
offerings, an association is made between one's internal fire and that 
fire. It will continue to some extent even after homam finishes, as long as 
the fire keeps going. If another person makes an association between the 
same fire and internal fire, then there is some karmik interchange between 
the persons. If the other person is someone that you do not mind sharing 
some of your karmas and karmaphalas with, then it should be 
fine.
 
Usually, karmas of parents and children, wife 
and husband etc are anyway strongly intertwined in many ways. It should be ok 
for them to do homam in the same fire, either together or one after the 
other.
 
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

Dear 
Narsimhaji,
 
Today with your inspiration and help, we did the short 
version of the MahaGanapathy Homam. After completion of the Homam, my mother 
felt like doing Sri Ganapathi Artharvashirsa so she sat down and contined in the 
same agni. 
Is it advisable to do multiple pujas in the same agni or should 
we start over again (rekindling) ? She did do the sankalpa 
again.
 
Regards,
