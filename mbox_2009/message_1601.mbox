Namaste,

Dharma shastras try to define dharma universally, undoubtedly an unenviable 
task. Even if one does a great job for the given desa, kaala and paatra 
(place, era and class), the rules given cannot be perfect. They can be taken 
as a general guideline, but they cannnot be absolute.

Regarding non-Brahmins:

If a person is interested in Veda and studies Veda, one IS a Brahmana. One 
who is interested in knowledge and spirituality is a Brahmana. One who is 
interested in power and authority over others is a Kshatriya. One who is 
interested in wealth is a Vaishya. One who is interested in pleasures in a 
Shoodra (that is why phala sruti of Vishnu sahasra naama stotra promises 
these respective results to the four varnas - see "vedaantago braahmanah 
syaat..."). Valmiki was born in a shoodra family, but became a brahmana and 
a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was born in a kshatriya family, but became a 
brahmana and a maharshi later and many veda hymns were actually revealed to 
the world through him!

The meaning of saying that only a Brahmana can deal with veda is that only a 
person interested in knowledge and spiritual progress (and not money or 
power or pleasures) can learn and teach veda. Others (interested in money, 
power and pleasures) are not qualified for self-realization. It has nothing 
to do with the the birth caste.

Regarding women:

Veda is for self-knowledge. Study and contemplation of Veda is for 
self-realization. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the potential energy and 
Shakti is the kinetic energy.  Men are supposed to have more Shiva than 
Shakti in them and women are supposed to have more Shakti than Shiva in 
them. If a man is really like Shiva, he can study and experience Veda and 
realize self and his wife can realize self through him. That would be a good 
strategy.

However, men are hardly like Shiva today. In fact, there is very little 
Shiva in anyone and there is more Shakti (kinetic energy) in women as well 
as men today. Moreover, most men do not do any spiritual sadhana at all. The 
rules make no sense anymore.

In the old days, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana, while their 
wives ran the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient for them and 
their wives. Today's men are different. Whenever I go to a poojas at the 
houses of friends, I see all women gathering at the pooja and chanting 
mantras, while all men sit elsewhere and chat about sports, politics and 
movies. The world is a changed place. Women cannot rely on their men to do 
spiritual sadhana for them and they are on their own. Men are not like 
Shiva. Rules composed long back do not apply anymore.

Upasani maharaj, who was worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a 
great Vedic scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his 
judgment and its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient 
dharma shastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to time by 
realized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.

This is the problem with some religions that are based on a written text. 
The text may have been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have 
become stale now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not 
depend on one specific text. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth rather 
than adherence to a text. This emphasis on active sadhana ensured a 
continuous flow of realized souls. We had many realized souls (like 
Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, 
Ramana Maharshi etc) from time to time and they refined our understanding. 
Religions that emphasized adherence to a text rather than active sadhana to 
realize truth depended on an old text put together by one realized soul and 
they may have become stale now.

Best regards,
Narasimha
