 18th October, 1947

Recently, owing to some maladjustment in diet,Bhagavan=
=92s health has been
somewhat indifferent. Noticing this, a rich devotee, b=
y name Kamala Rani,
sent a soup made of costly vegetables and sweet grapes =
to the Ashram one
morning, with a request that it might be served to Bhagav=
an.

As it was received just as Bhagavan was about to take his food, Bhagav=
an
accepted it.

Next day, she again prepared it in the same way and sent i=
t to the Ashram.
But this time, looking at his attendants,Bhagavan said, =
=93Why this daily?
Please tell her not to send it henceforth.=94

The lady,=
 however, sent it the following day too.

=93There!=94 said Bhagavan, =93It=
 has come again. She will not stop sending it. I
should have said =91No=92 =
at the very beginning. It was my mistake to have
accepted it.=94

A devotee=
 said, =93At present, Bhagavan is much run down.She is perhaps
sending it b=
ecause a liquid preparation with grapes might be good for
Bhagavan=92s heal=
th.=94

=93Oho!=94 Bhagavan exclaimed, =93Is that so? And have you authorit=
y to plead on
her behalf?=94

=93That is not it, Bhagavan. I am saying so b=
ecause I thought that such
preparations might be good for the health.=94

=
=93May be so,=94 rejoined Bhagavan, =93but such things are for rich people,=
 not
for us.=94

=93That devotee says that she herself will prepare it and =
send it,=94 persisted
the devotee.

=93That is all right,=94 replied Bhagav=
an, =93and if so, please find out if she
could supply the same thing for al=
l the people who sit here.=94

=93Our anxiety is that Bhagavan=92s body sho=
uld be healthy.=94

=93That is all right,=94 Bhagavan rejoined, =93but do y=
ou mean to say that health
could be maintained only if soup prepared from g=
rapes and costly vegetables
is taken? If it were so, then rich people shoul=
d all be enjoying good
health. Why is it then that they are more unhealthy =
and sickly than the
others? The satisfaction that poor people get by taking=
 sour rice-gruel
cannot be had from anything else. In olden days, when we w=
ere doing the
cooking during summer, we used to have a pot into which we pu=
t all the
cooked rice left over, fill it up with water, a little buttermilk=
,a little
rice-gruel, dry ginger and lemon leaves, and set it aside. It wou=
ld get
sour, cool and clear.

The liquid used to be drunk with a pinch of s=
alt by all of us by the
tumblerful,and we used to feel very happy. No one h=
ad any illness
whatsoever. Even now, if I were to drink two tumblerfuls of =
such water, all
my ailments would disappear.

But then nobody prepares it f=
or me. =91Aye! Aye! How could we give sour milk
gruel to Swami?=92 they say=
. What is to be done? To prepare soup of this sort
will cost a rupee. If, w=
ith that money, millet (ragi) were brought and
ground into flour, it would =
last for about a month for preparing gruel from
it Grape juice, tomato soup=
 and the like are offered to me. Why do I require
such things? Tell her not=
 to send the soup from tomorrow.=94

The thing stopped there. Bhagavan told=
 us several times that while he was
living on the hill he was eating bilva =
fruit (a sort of wood-apple) for some
days and sustaining himself on it.

B=
hagavan does not like to eat any food without sharing it with the people
ar=
ound him.
