Dear Narsimha and group,
It was year 2004, when i got chance to visit Calcu=
tta as part of my official visit. Since many of my colleagues were going to=
 Kalighat, i accompanied them. there was a big queue to have darshan of 'Ma=
a Kali'. It was an exhausting wait of 1 hour before we could enter 'Sanctum=
 sanctorum' where 'Maa' was standing in her full beauty. Moment I entered i=
t, i could immediately feel spiritual and divine presence of 'Maa'. That fe=
eling remained for quite sometime. This happened despite the fact that i am=
 very ordinary person. Only sadhana (if at all it can be called sadhana) wh=
ich i was doing was that i was observing 9 days fast during (winter) Navrat=
ri since 1995. Still I could feel divine presence. 
Above is narrated to st=
ate that no two persons may have same feeling and experience, some may expe=
rience and some may not. This is especially applicable to ordinary people l=
ike me. 

Yogis and saints are much elevated being they can perceive consis=
tently correctly.

As one progresses on spiritual path, one becomes more qu=
alified to feel spirituality of place and person. If an ordinary person is =
sitting next to a yogi, that person may not feel greatness of person, unles=
s yogi wills otherwise. But if someone is in serious sadhana, one instantly=
 recognizes spiritual energy of yogi, even if yogi is disguised. 

Places o=
f worship are thronged by multitudes of people, most of them with love and =
devotion to god. Sheer collective will and emotions of these many people, c=
reates spiritual environment. Hence, normally place of worship, do have env=
elope spiritual energy. Question can be of degree of spiritual energy, some=
 places with regular `pran pratishtha' , and attended  by elevated `Pujari'=
 will definitely offer better environment. This applies with every place of=
 worship. If a spiritual Hindu visits a `Mosque' or `Gurudwara' or any othe=
r place of worship, he will feel divine presence.
Place of worship serves a=
s symbol of almighty, which offers convenient and easy way for an ordinary =
people to remain connected with lord. But most of us fail to realize that t=
his is just a beginning, one has to cross this, progress further. If one re=
mains attached to place of worship and thinks that regular visits to holy p=
lace will elevate one spiritually, then he is mistaken. Most of the people =
are stuck at this level. This being `kaliyug' not many mahatmas are present=
 in society to help people to move forward.
Regards,
Sanjeev

         Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not ha=
