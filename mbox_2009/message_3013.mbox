 That was when I was in the Virupaksha Cave. At that time I was not coverin=
g
the upper part of the body with anything.

For some unknown reason the tr=
ouble from mosquitoes was unusually great that
year. Jayaraman bought a goo=
d shawl and pressed me to cover my body with
that. I did not even touch it.=
 He waited for some time.

The shawl remained folded. The mosquito trouble =
continued unabated. Unable
to bear the nuisance,the people near me conferre=
d amongst themselves and
without the knowledge of outsiders, made all prepa=
rations for going to
Tirupati.

They told me that we should go by this way =
and should come back by that way
and the like. I nodded my head in assent t=
o all that they said. They fixed
an auspicious day for the journey, packed =
everything and,before starting,
came to me saying, =91Swami, shall we start=
?=92 I said, =91Yes. Do go and come
back.=92 =91What about Bhagavan?=92

=
=91Where can Bhagavan go? Where is he staying?=92 I said. They said, =91We =
are
unable to bear this mosquito trouble, you see.=92 I said, =91If you are=
 not able
to bear it, you may go and come back. Is it for my sake that you =
are going?
Did I say that I was not able to bear the mosquito nuisance?=92
=

What more could they say? They felt that it was no use arguing further,gav=
e
up their journey, and began pressing me to cover my body with the shawl.
=
Jayaram=92s son Pichandi was at the time a very young fellow. He used to co=
me
every day covering
himself with an old rug.

As I felt that they would n=
ot leave me in peace until I covered my body to
avoid the mosquito bites, I=
 told them that I would wear the old rug if they
gave that young man the ne=
w shawl in exchange.

What could they do? Unwillingly they exchanged the ne=
w rug for the old one
and I covered myself with the rug. That was the begin=
ning of my covering the
body with anything.

When I began covering myself w=
ith that prickly type of rug, the mosquitoes
did not dare to come anywhere =
near me. It used to be warm too,=94 said
Bhagavan.
