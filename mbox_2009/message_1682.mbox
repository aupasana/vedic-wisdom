Namaste,

For more clarifications on the subject.

for example, can one rec=
ite 
"Sarva Mangal Mangalye..." and then start Prathama Charitra (Replacing=
 Aim at the start and end) and at the end again recite the same shloka. ?

=
will that be a example of proper Samputikarana.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
