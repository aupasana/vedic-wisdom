Namaskkaram Miteshji,
This is a simple feedback on the link suggested for S=
iddha Kunjika Stotra recital by Sri Maa.
I have downloaded the recital as g=
uided by you with a view to eliminate any doubts on pronounciation and "Paa=
tha-bheda"..... 
While appreciating the piety and devotion of the rendering=
 person -I found the pronounciations have diction problems-most likely it i=
s a foreigner reciting Sankrita.

I feel my objective remains unfulfilled.R=
equest you and other seekers to guide to any good MP3 source for correct re=
citation of Siddha Kunjika Stotra.

Humble regards
amit=A0 =A0 =A0

Namaste

Ku=
njika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do homan of it, atleast I 
have n=
ever heard anybody doing it but I am very ignonart too, instead 
there is a=
 Durga Sapta Slokas that may be more easier and lighter.

Only one Shri aga=
ram bagaram baba (I am sure my spellings are wrong) a 
disciple of swami mu=
ktananda has indicated that one can chant for 11 
times daily and that is e=
nough.

He seemed to be very realized and lived near Nasik, someone has wri=
tten 
his biography.

Kunjika Shortram one recites to overcome any mistakes=
 one may have done 
with reciting chandi paath. 


by the way one can liste=
n kunjika shotram in beautiful voice of shree 
maa as follows

http://www.s=
hreemaa.org/drupal/node/1546, on this page there is a link.

Best Regards
