INDIA'S GIFT TO THE WORLD (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 27, 1895)

Swa=
mi Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday night under
the=
 auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a fairly large
audienc=
e at the hall of the Long Island Historical Society, corner
Pierrepont and =
Clinton streets. His subject was "India's Gift to the World".

"In religion=
," he said, "she has exerted a great influence on Christianity,
as the very=
 teachings of Christ would [could] be traced back to those of
Buddha." He s=
howed by quotations from the works of European and American
scientists the =
many points of similarity between Buddha and Christ. The
latter's birth, hi=
s seclusion from the world, the number of his apostles,
and the very ethics=
 of his teachings are the same as those of Buddha, living
many hundred year=
s before him.

"Is it mere chance," the lecturer asked, "or was Buddha's re=
ligion but the
foreshadowing of that of Christ? The majority of your thinke=
rs seem to be
satisfied in the latter explanation, but there are some bold =
enough to say
that Christianity is the direct offspring of Buddhism just as=
 the earliest
heresy in the Christian religion =97 the Monecian [Manichaean=
] heresy =97 is now
universally regarded as the teaching of a sect of Buddh=
ists. But there is
more evidence that Christianity is founded in Buddhism. =
We find it in
recently discovered inscriptions from the reign of Emperor Os=
hoka [Asoka] of
India, about 300 B.C., who made treaties with all the Greci=
an kings, and
whose missionaries discriminated [disseminated ?] in those ve=
ry parts,
where, centuries after, Christianity flourished, the principles o=
f the
Buddhistic religion.

"The same holds good with respect to sciences. =
India has given to antiquity
the earliest scientifical physicians, and, acc=
ording to Sir William Hunter,
she has even contributed to modern medical sc=
ience by the discovery of
various chemicals and by teaching you how to refo=
rm misshapen ears and
noses. Even more it has done in mathematics, for alge=
bra, geometry,
astronomy, and the triumph of modern science =97 mixed mathe=
matics =97 were all
invented in India, just so much as the ten numerals, th=
e very cornerstone of
all present civilization, were discovered in India, a=
nd are in reality,
Sanskrit words.

"In philosophy we are even now head and=
 shoulders above any other nation, as
Schopenhauer, the great German philos=
opher, has confessed. In music India
gave to the world her system of notati=
on, with the seven cardinal notes and
the diatonic scale, all of which we e=
njoyed as early as 350 B.C., while it
came to Europe only in the eleventh c=
entury. In philology, our Sanskrit
language is now universally acknowledged=
 to be the foundation of all
European languages, which, in fact, are nothin=
g but jargonized Sanskrit.

"In literature, our epics and poems and dramas =
rank as high as those of any
language; our 'Shaguntala' [Shakuntala] was su=
mmarized by Germany's greatest
poet, as 'heaven and earth united'. India ha=
s given to the world the fables
of Aesop, which were copied by Aesop from a=
n old Sanskrit book; it has given
the Arabian Nights, yes, even the story o=
f Cinderella and the Bean Stalks.
In manufacture, India was the first to ma=
ke cotton and purple [dye], it was
proficient in all works of jewelry, and =
the very word 'sugar', as well as
the article itself, is the product of Ind=
ia. Lastly she has invented the
game of chess and the cards and the dice.So=
 great, in fact, was the
superiority of India in every respect, that it dre=
w to her borders the
hungry cohorts of Europe, and thereby indirectly broug=
ht about the discovery
of America.

"And now, what has the world given to I=
ndia in return for all that? Nothing
but nullification [vilification] and c=
urse and contempt. The world waded in
her children's life-blood, it reduced=
 India to poverty and her sons and
daughters to slavery, and now it adds in=
sult to injury by preaching to her a
religion which can only thrive on the =
destruction of every other religion.
But India is not afraid. It does not b=
eg for mercy at the hands of any
nation. Our only fault is that we cannot: =
fight to conquer; but we trust in
the eternity of truth. India's message to=
 the world is first of all, her
blessing; she is returning good for the evi=
l which is done her, and thus she
puts into execution this noble idea, whic=
h had its origin in India. Lastly,
India's message is, that calm goodness, =
patience and gentleness will
ultimately triumph. For where are the Greeks, =
the onetime masters of the
earth? They are gone. Where are the Romans, at t=
he tramp of whose cohorts
the world trembled? Passed away. Where are the Ar=
abs, who in fifty years had
carried their banners from the Atlantic to the =
Pacific? and where are the
Spaniards, the cruel murderers of millions of me=
n? Both races are nearly
extinct; but thanks to the morality of her childre=
n, the kinder race will
never perish, and she will yet see the hour of her =
triumph."

At the close of the lecture, which was warmly applauded, Swami V=
ivekananda
answered a number of questions in regard to the customs of India=
. He denied
positively the truth of the statement published in yesterday's =
[February 25]
Standard Union, to the effect that widows are ill-treated in =
India. The law
guarantees her not only her own property, before marriage, b=
ut also all she
received from her husband, at whose death, if there be no d=
irect heirs, the
property goes to her. Widows seldom marry in India, becaus=
e of the scarcity
of men. He also stated that the self-sacrifices of wives =
at the death of
their husbands as well as the fanatical self-destruction un=
der the wheels of
the Juggernaut, have wholly stopped, and referred his hea=
rers for proof to
Sir William Hunter's "History of the Indian Empire".
