Dear Narasimha,

As we have all come to expect from you, this is another nice gem. I
have a minor question. The fifth verse of the kAla-bhairava-aShTakam
in the manual reads: dharma-setu-pAlakam sva-dharma-mArga-nAshanam.

In place of 'sva-dharma' some internet versions read 'tvadharma',
which gives the opposite meaning. If the manual variant is typo-free,
can you please explain how I should understand
'sva-dharma-mArga-nAshanam'?

anugRhiito.asmi,

      ajit
