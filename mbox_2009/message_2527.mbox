Respected members.
I have heard that a Mantra to be effective has to be ass=
igned by a Guru, because
he can send His Shakti to the devotee.
But sometim=
es for some people is not possible to meet a Guru personally for many
reaso=
ns (distance karma etc)
Can someone pick a mantra, chanting it with bhakti =
and have some benefit, even
without a Guru guidance ?
I would appreciate yo=
ur opinion about my question.
Thank you
