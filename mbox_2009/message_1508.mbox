Namaste Rajarshi ji,

I know you must have taken medical advise.

what i su=
ggest is lesser intake then normally what yourintake at night.

If you are =
eating 5 chapatis, try to make it 3 or so. the point is that stumach shood =
not be full at night. that might help.

one more suggetion if it is accepta=
ble to you.
I chant following mantra while starting dinner (or whenever sta=
rt eating) and also pray :'Mother please remove any impurties from the food=
 and digest it in such a way that it doesnot result in to any bad thoughts =
but help in purifying the negativity'.

"Annapurne Sadaapurne Shankar Praan=
 Vallabhe,
Gnyaan vairaagya sidhyartham, BhikshaaNdehich paarvati"

just my=
 0.5 sents,

warm regards,

utpal
