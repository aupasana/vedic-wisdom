Namaste!

Ganesh Chaturthi is two days away. Why is it celebrated on the 4t=
h day of bhadrabada shukla paksha? Ever since i started doing homam to shri=
 ganesh there is a keenness to know more and more about him.

There is an i=
nteresting story about him that i would like to share in the cut and paste =
style. 

"There is also a story behind the symbolic snake, rat and the sing=
ular tusk. During one of his birthdays, His mother, Parvati, cooked for him=
 twenty-one types of delicious food and a lot of sweet porridge. Ganesha at=
e so much that even his big belly could not contain it. Mounting his little=
 mouse, he embarked on his nightly rounds. His mouse suddenly stumbled upon=
 seeing a huge snake. To adjust His belly, Ganesha put the snake on as a be=
lt around his stomach. All of a sudden, he heard laughter emanating form th=
e sky.

   He looked up and saw the moon mocking him. Ganesha infuriated, b=
roke off one of his tusks and hurled it at the moon. Parvati, seeing this, =
immediately cursed the moon that whoever looks at it on Ganesh Chaturthi wi=
ll be accused of a wrong doing. The symbology behind the mouse and snake an=
d Ganesha's big belly and its relationship to the moon on his birthday is h=
ighly philosophic. The whole cosmos is known to be the belly of Ganesha. Pa=
rvati is the primordial energy. The seven realms above, seven realms below =
and seven oceans, are inside the cosmic belly of Ganesha, held together by =
the cosmic energy (kundalini ) symbolized as a huge snake which Ganesha tie=
s around Him. The mouse is nothing but our ego. Ganesha, using the mouse as=
 a vehicle, exemplifies the need to control our ego. One who has controlled=
 the ego has Ganesha consciousness or God-consciousness."

Of course, this =
is just a story. But then i got curious to know if there is actually a tabo=
o abt. looking at the moon on this day.

Hope we can all come closer to Gan=
esh consiousness....with time and sadhana.

Regards and best wishes
