Respected Guru Narasimha ji,
A thought just crossed m=
y mind- in homa we make offerings in fire but offer bali outside, can we of=
fer the bali also in fire?
I usually do minimum procedure Ganapati homa ski=
pping this step but somehow this just floated into my mind while going thro=
ugh Chandi procedure.

with endless regards
