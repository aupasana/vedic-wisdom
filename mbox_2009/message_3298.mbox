Namaste, 
=A0
In Hindu religious culture, importance is not given to prayin=
g Brahma and consequently not many places of worship are available for Lord=
 Brahma. (Pushkar is the one that comes to my mind)
=A0
Vishnu being inchar=
ge of sustenance and BhuLoka being the karma bhoomi, it is very well accept=
able that Vishnu is prayed for deliverance from Karmaphala and similarly fo=
r shiva, for he being incharge of destruction (evil qualities, fears etc) a=
nd hence mukti. Please correct me if my understanding here is wrong. =A0
=
=A0
But Brahma, who is incharge of creation, is not prayed but his manifest=
ation Sarawati is prayed. Isn't creativity also important for human beings =
in the path of spiritualism? 
What is the spiritual signification for not p=
raying to Brahma?


Thanks & Regards,
