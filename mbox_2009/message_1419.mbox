Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar

I have been reading the posts regarding remedial=
 measures both on Sohamsa as well as this site. Very interesting to say the=
 least.

You say that astrological knowledge has been lost/corrupted is imp=
erfect etc..No doubt it is, especially in this day and age. 

My question t=
o you then, if you have a moment; what do you think of the Jyotirlinga Mant=
ras as remedies (done sincerely), are these "valid" mantras or just somethi=
ng made up, based off of corrupted knowledge? Are jyotirlinga mantras discu=
ssed in any ancient literature and/or Mantra Mahodadhi?

I only ask out of =
sincere curiosity, not to instigate things further. I respect your opinion =
highly.


All the best
