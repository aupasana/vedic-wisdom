Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.
I realize this may be an inappropriate forum for=
 this question but for some odd reason , I am unable to post this anwhere e=
lse (Sohamsa, Sri Jagganath etc..) and my emails don't seem to be reaching =
you.


Thank you very very much for including Chakra Dasha. 
Your work is s=
imply superb. 

Chakra Dasha in my experience is a very valuable Dasha syst=
em, showing a very fundamental 10-year cycle in a human being's biography. =
It simply works well, and sometimes it even can explain things which other =
Dashas cannot explain that easily. 

But, I think, Antar Dashas are to be f=
ormed like in Varnada Dasha, or other Rashi Dashas: counting forwards for o=
dd Rashis, counting backwards for even Rashis.
Could you please implement t=
his?

Furthermore, I - and perhaps some other people - would be grateful if=
 in Shodshottari and Ashtottari Dasha there would be an option to start Ant=
ardashas from the Mahadasha Lord.

Thank you very much in advance!

All The=
 Best!
