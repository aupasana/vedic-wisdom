e time electricity is turned on again. Similarly, some experiences from pas=
t lives remain in chitta as subconscious memories that influence our thinki=
ng in future lives, but many specific memories are lost.

is essentially the subjective element of buddhi, that controls this algorit=

ible to overcome latent tendencies by storing new information in chitta and=
 marking it as high priority.

the spiritual path knows what are good tendencies and what are not. Feeling=
 lust or desire when one sees a beautiful person or object is bad. Feeling =
anger when someone says bad things about one is bad. Feeling proud about wh=

dy knows these things. But knowing is not enough and one needs to act on th=
at knowledge! The problem is that these things are stored in chitta with a =
low weight and there are overriding memories stored chitta with much strong=
 weights. So it is difficult or even impossible for the subjective portion =
of one's buddhi to make them win in the final decision-making process.

 becomes stronger and stronger and latent tendencies become weaker and weak=
