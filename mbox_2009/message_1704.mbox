Namaste Rao Garu,

There are few questions-

>Accept whatever comes your wa=
y with neither happiness nor sadness, >but with a calm and relaxed mind. 

=
I am not able to understand this state. if person  is neither happy nor sad=
, then what kind of state of mind he/she is in?

is it dullness? or there i=
s some exalted state which can be defined as supremely happy state always o=
r is it a great peacefullness? i have read that Swami Vivekananda and other=
 brother desciples used to display many a times expression of extreme emoti=
ons such as anger, cry, heated arguments etc... did not they reach Sthithpr=
agya state?

Is it that a spiritually elevated person needs to have a blank=
 face? without any display of emotions?


***
another question is regarding=
 Karma(Action and Reaction)

Take a case - somebody, say a rawdy person Sla=
ps a person 'x'. Mr. X didn't do any wrong. now in this case, what should X=
 be doing. should he take the Slap and go away from there thinking that it =
was a result of his past Karma or he should give back the same medicine to =
the abuser.

In either of the above options, how Mr. X can remain (act) wit=
hout  detachment.how such state can be achieved. however we say that we sho=
uld do detached karma, it does not seem possible. how to achieve that?

it =
looks very difficult to understand.

Best Regards,

Utpal

level of mental equanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living pers=

does so and so things, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Pa=
dmaja, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of M=

As one dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one=
 body and environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Natu=

this life.

tc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one's sense of=
 I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver reactions to pr=
evious actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of previous good kar=
ma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or excited or elated. Do n=
ot think that a reaction from Nature to one's good karma is meaningful only=
 if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one =
is cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not t=
hink that a reaction from Nature to one's bad karma is meaningful only if t=
hat reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such=
 that that person cheats you now. How you feel about it now is not relevant=
 as far as the old action-reaction equation is concerned. Thus, being equan=
imous, equal-minded and calm does not stop Nature from doing its job.

 In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, =
one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous li=
fe. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His cheating =
you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it with self-id=
entification with the action, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, =
that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and without doing an=
ything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try=
 to stop the person from cheating you. Then your current actions would beco=
me a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction later. If you want to=
 pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you have to behave like the =
person you described below. Accept whatever comes your way with neither hap=
piness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep do=
ing what seems like the right thing to do at the moment, with as little sel=
f-identification (sense of "I am doing this") as possible. As you become be=
tter at this, your instincts and judgment will guide you better and show yo=
u the right action.
