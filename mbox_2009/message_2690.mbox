 Sometimes people here who receive books by post bring the books into the
h=
all together with the papers wrapped around them. Bhagavan nicely folds the=

wrapping and says to the attendants, =93Look! Keep this carefully.

We sha=
ll cover some other book with it. How can we get such paper if we need
it? =
What is thus acquired is a net gain.=94 Daily the inward letters are
brough=
t from the office for Bhagavan=92s perusal.Amongst them, officials like
you=
 fold the paper and write on one side, leaving the rest unused.

Bhagavan t=
ears off such bits of unwritten paper and keeps them. The same is
the case =
with pins. After reading the papers, the pins are taken out and
handed over=
 to the attendants, saying, =93These will be useful when we want
them.

The=
y will otherwise be merely thrown away. We shall use them. How should we
ge=
t new ones? They have to be bought. Where is the money?=94

While living on=
 the hill, Bhagavan personally used to prepare ladles,
spoons, cups and the=
 like from out of coconut shells.

Till recently he was making cups and spo=
ons of coconut shells and polish
them like ivory and tell the attendants,=
=93Look, keep these carefully.

They will be useful on occasions.How could =
we get silver and gold
articles? These
are our silver cups and golden spoon=
s. The hands won=92t get burnt.

Whenever Batavia or Kamala oranges and the=
 like are received, the skins are
not allowed to be thrown away, and chutne=
ys and pickles are made out of
them.

They are also used in soup or put to =
other such uses. Besides this, while
taking food, not a morsel is thrown aw=
ay or discarded. He thus shows us, by
his own example, that not a single us=
eful article should be wasted.

If someone brings roses and presents them, =
Bhagavan presses them against his
eyes, puts them on the clock, eats the pe=
tals when they get dry and fall off
and gives some of them to those near hi=
m.

Once when someone brought a rose garland, it was used to decorate the i=
dol
in the Mother=92s temple and afterwards thrown out by the priests into =
a waste
basket along with other flowers.

Bhagavan saw that when he went ou=
t and, getting angry with them, collected
all the petals and had them mixed=
 with payasam (pudding), which thus got a
delicious flavour and excellent t=
aste.

On his way to the hill, if he chances to see any useful leaves, he w=
ill
pluck them
along with his attendants, give instructions about cooking t=
hem and thus
arrange for a delicious dish. He likes preparations which do n=
ot cost
anything rather than those that are costly.

All this may appear to=
 be quite commonplace,but if we think it over
carefully, we will find it a =
good lesson for us. It means, he teaches us
that we could live comfortably =
on small means.
