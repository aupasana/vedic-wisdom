 Seamless blend of Raja, Karma, Bhakti and Gnana Yogas

   
Dear Shri. Nara=
simha,
I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still =
at my mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in Sa=
haja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things sho=
uld be. 

For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, r=
an away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fig=
hting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years later would advice=
 Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satisfying intellec=
tual answer to it if people raise questions?

Sri Aurobindo gave a beautifu=
l explanation about it. It was something like: If Krishna were constrained =
to win all times, that would be a limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses e=
ven defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more complete victory in the=
 scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the original to get his exac=
t words.. I read it long ago.

Another instance that comes to mind - Some t=
hieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ash=
ram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual=
 head of the Ashram and one can intellectually argue that it was his dharma=
 to protect the ashram and inmates from the thieves. 

Besides, there were =
certain things that I did not want to put in an public email. 

Some clues =
- AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhs=
n Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were several threats f=
rom certain militants from one community about planting bombs or disrupting=
 it in other ways police security provided was not sufficient for that size=
d gathering.

The concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the=
 participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.

Some people beli=
eve Sri Sri's presence in the event changed the heart of some miscreants.

=
Many does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with the future head=
 of state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting was to happen. Som=
etimes he attends some events which cannot be explained logically by his di=
sciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an enlightened=
 Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them in our mind=
. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher.

As the M=
other would say if something is beyond our mental understanding, we can mai=
ntain a respectable silence about it. 

I do not expect my answers to satis=
fy all the questions. I feel I have said everything I had to say. 

In hind=
 sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an intellectual e=
xplanation for something that I myself have not yet intellectually understo=
od.

I did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know wh=
at do say or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledg=
e or understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri =
Krishna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not=
 be intellectually explained. Having observed him in person with questions =
several times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that=
 it was not true. 

Best regards, 
-Siva.

 There are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda=
. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL i=
s a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it i=
n any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it,=
 it is a "Sunlit path". In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatC=
hitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadh=
ak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.

In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma =
yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan K=

Some clues - AOL si=
lverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya =
together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were several threats from cert=
ain militants from one community about planting bombs or disrupting it in o=
ther ways police security provided was not sufficient for that sized gather=
ing.<br>
<br>
The concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the=
 participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.<br>
<br>
Some peo=
ple believe Sri Sri's presence in the event changed the heart of some miscr=
eants.<br>
<br>
Many does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with=
 the future head of state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting wa=
s to happen. Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained log=
ically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty abou=
t an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain =
them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much h=
igher.<br>
<br>
As the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental u=
nderstanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. <br>
<br>
I d=
o not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said ev=
erything I had to say. <br>
<br>
In hind sight, I realize that I should not=
 have ventured to give an intellectual explanation for something that I mys=
elf have not yet intellectually understood.<br>
<br>
I did want to object t=
o some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do say or was confused. =
It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or understanding of Sri S=
ri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Krishna might judge him dif=
ferently for several of His acts which could not be intellectually explaine=
d. Having observed him in person with questions several times tricker than =
what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that it was not true. <br>
