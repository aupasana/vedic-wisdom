D.: How is the =91I-I=92 consciousness felt?

M.: As an unbroken awareness =
of =91I=92. It is simply consciousness.

D.: Can we know it when it dawns?
=

M.: Yes, as consciousness. You are that even now. There will be no mistaki=
ng
it when it is pure.

D.: Why do we have such a place as the =91Heart=92 =
for meditation?

M.: Because you seek consciousness. Where can you find it?=
 Can you reach it
externally? You have to find it internally. Therefore you=
 are directed
inward. Again the =91Heart=92 is only the seat of consciousne=
ss or the
consciousness itself.

D.: On what should we meditate?

M.: Who i=
s the meditator? Ask the question first. Remain as the meditator.
There is =
no need to meditate.
