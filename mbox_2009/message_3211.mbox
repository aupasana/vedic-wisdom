n the saptashati text, add a swaahaa whenever you encounter a number and ma=
ke an offering, whether the number is after a verse or after an "uvaacha" o=
r after an "UchuH". There should be about 700 offerings in saptashati like =
this.

like kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri sooktam and devi sooktam. In kavach=
am, no offerings are made. In argala and keelakam, only ghee is offered by =
adding swaahaa after each verse. I suggested reading raatri sooktam and dev=
i sooktam without swaahaa, because adding swaahaa at the end of a Vedic ver=
se with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa may require a modifcation in the =
intonation or even the anuswara of the last syllable of the Vedic verse to =
which you add swaahaa. That is why I suggested reading raatri sooktam and d=
evi sooktam without swaahaa.
