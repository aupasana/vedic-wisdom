Namaste Sri Radhakrishnan,
=C2=A0
While I respect the o=

north India during winter.=C2=A0Many priests do wear shirts when performing=
 homas in winter here, in Boston, USA.
=C2=A0
Honestly, the clothes that we=
 wrap around the body to hide the true body are not a major issue and have =
very little bearing on our sadhana. The layers of conditioning by various g=
unas that we wrap around our ego-consciousness to hide the true Self=C2=A0I=
S the major issue that blocks our spiritual progress. The former is a symbo=
l and the latter is the real thing that matters. Shedding those layers surr=
ounding the ego is far more important than removing shirt.
=C2=A0
Actually,=
 though I live in cold climate, the room in which I recorded the video was =
comfortable enough and I could have done without the shirt. But I conscious=
ly chose to record it with a shirt on, in order to not send a wrong message=
 to those living in cold climates and having to do homam in cold garages. I=
nstead of sticking to unnecessarily strict=C2=A0rules and ending up not doi=
ng homam as often, I want people to relax rules that do not matter=C2=A0and=
 do it as often as they can. I want to de-emphasize things that do not matt=
er that much.
=C2=A0
World is going to go through interesting times and we =
need many serious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many clothes on the b=
ody but shed off as many layers as possible on their ego=C2=A0- doing homam=
 on a regular basis.
=C2=A0
I use more materials in my daily Chandi homam (=
because I use a bigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, but ag=
ain that was a conscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I want=
ed to demonstrate how a very=C2=A0simple homam can be performed quite easil=
y with very few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple procedure =
like this will make a big difference in the world, if a lot of people are d=
oing this sincerely everyday.

Narasimha

am Video (based on the manual)

Namaste friends,

This weekend, Ravi shot v=
ideo of a 20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being 
performed by me, based on t=
he procedure in the manual. He uploaded it to 
Google Video and YouTube tod=
ay. What is in Google Video is one file that is 
20 min 28 min long (and 92=
 MB in size). It is downloadable to your computer 
and you can play it usin=
g free software QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored 
as three parts and has=
 a higher quality. You can play those three parts 
directly from YouTube.

=
If you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam =

page, you will see all related links right there.

To limit the video size=
, we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra 
and beeja mantra are ch=
anted 8 times each and Atharva seersham once. You can 
of course use higher=
 counts and do it longer.

Thanks to Ravi for his effort!

Best regards,
Na=
rasimha
