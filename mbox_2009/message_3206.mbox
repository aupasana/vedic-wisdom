Hi Sudha,
=C2=A0
If the purnahuti does not burn or some offering is left un=
burned, then use it=C2=A0the next time you do homa. 
=C2=A0
As for the Raks=
ha/Ash left, collect it=C2=A0for a few months=C2=A0and=C2=A0 then ideally t=
hrow it in flowing water - river, sea etc. Or I guess bury it if you don't =
find a way of disposing it off in flowing natural water.

Hi all,

During homam some of my=
 offerings don't get burnt properly. There are leftover halfburnt coconut p=
ieces, half burnt naievdyam etc. Is it ok to collect all these leftover hal=
fburnt pieces and use it for the next homam or will it be like giving stale=
 food to god. I have lot of raksha accumulating what do you all do with so =
much raksha. 

Thanks,

Sudha
