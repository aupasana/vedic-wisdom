Namaste Nitish Ji,


2. While it has been told explicitly in a mail address=
ed to you, that the debate is over as far as you are concerned, you continu=
e to send me mails on the same topic, without any reason whatsoever.

I am =
afraid you missed one important responsibility of Sri Narasimha. Apart from=
 being an individual contributor (in which case, he can choose which mails =
to respond and which mails to ignore), he is also the owner of the list and=
 has the responsibility to correct a thread if he thinks that the thread is=
 giving wrong concepts / ideas to the group.

The discussion might be betwe=
en a few individuals, but the rest of the group is closely following the th=
read and absorbing the concepts discussed. Having created a group for impar=
ting / sharing right spiritual knowledge to the needy, how can he choose to=
 ignore a mail, if he thinks it is giving wrong concepts to the group. By r=
emaining silent, would he not be guilty of propagating wrong knowledge thro=
ugh his forum and end up defeating the very purpose for which this group is=
 created ?

Actually, every member has right and responsibility=A0to respon=
d to any mail in the group. We all are different stages=A0of=A0spiritual de=
velopment and=A0learning together.=A0If one thinks something being discusse=
d is wrong, he better bring it up. If he is right, he would have saved the =
group from the wrong knowledge; if he is wrong, his concepts would get clar=
ified better. Is n't it ?


Thanks and Regards,
Ramakrishna

Dear Narasimha,

1. Fortunately or unfortunately you ha=
ve repeatedly broken the decorum yourselves. 
2. While it has been told exp=
licitly in a mail addressed to you, that the debate is over as far as you a=
re concerned, you continue to send me mails on the same topic, without any =
reason whatsoever.

3. By virtue of my spending precious time on writing th=
ese mails, I have a right to exercise on whom I entertain for further discu=
ssion.
4. If you are left with even a little respect for the individuality =
of another person, please ensure that you don't send unsolicited intercepti=
ng mails particularly when your name has not been mentioned inside the mail=
.
5. If you are interested in propagating your ideas, take up a new thread,=
 on a part of the mail and invite responses or criticism or what ever you w=
ant to.
6. You have no right to tell others that they have a limited unders=
tanding - as you just did in your mail on Ahamkara =3D Asmita - till you ar=
e an omniscient being yourselves.

7. If you tried this sort of a thing aga=
in, I will ensure that I don't reply to any of your mails ever again.

8. I=
f you don't give space to members, then, as a moderator, you won't ever be =
able to achieve the "state of discipline and decorum" and "participation of=
 group members" at the same time.
9. The only persons whom I consider as "s=
till active in Gyan Marg debate" include:
a. Sundeep
b. UtpalJi

c. probabl=
y those who have not yet replied.
10. As far as a ban or moderation is conc=
erned, there is no dearth of people, nor is it an issue to run a yahoo grou=
p of ones' own. We all know the fate of heavily moderated groups, like "soh=
amsa".Regards,
Nitish

People here are usually gentle, humble, compassionate and unassuming and I =

 uncivil posts. I will start to warn the offending members and ban them if =
they continue to offend after being warned.
