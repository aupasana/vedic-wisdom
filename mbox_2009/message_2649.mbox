Well, till the time, =
I realize I can control my mind and hence control if or not I should get a =
specific dream, I can not help what kind of dream I get. Yes, dream is a ma=
ya, but I do not control it.

How ever, I presume that the All mighty, Omni=
potent does know how to control maya. So, the God is playing the maya. His =
maya is intented and deliberate while my dreams are not deliberate.

So, co=
mparing dreams to His maya may not be appropriate. This still leaves two qu=
estions - Why is he playing this maya and how we can realise this is all ma=
ya.

On my part, I will try to purify my self and hopefully, I will realise=
 one day.

Best regards,
Vijay
