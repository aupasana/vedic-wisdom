Namaste Shri Rakesh,

Happy Deepavali !

Narasimha is an expert in Sanskrit=
 and earned the bachelors/masters degree when he was 13! So please do not c=
ompare yourself to him, at least not as of now. I take inspiration from him=
 and try to better myself , perhaps you should consider doing the same thin=
g, just a suggestion :).

Please keep trying and trying, and I am sure, one=
 day you will reach the speed. More importantly, the bhaava (emotion) is im=
portant! Focussing on speed makes it more mechanical and devoid of emotions=
.

However, I totally empathize with you and can only say out of experience=
, that if you focus and try, then you will see an improvement in yourself e=
very week. Try to benchmark it. 

Most importantly please make a sincere pr=
ayer to the GREAT GODESS herself to help you out! SHE will definitely answe=
r your prayers, based on my personal experience.


Here's wishing you all t=
he best in your spiritual endeavors.

Warm Regards
Narayan
