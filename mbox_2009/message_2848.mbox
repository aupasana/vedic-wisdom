Firstly I have not read Narasimha's mail fully and will read it more carefu=
lly. But, I have few thought I want to put in front of every one: 

1. When=
 we meet few people, some we like instantly and some we hate. Narasimha onc=
e told me this could be due to karmic debts between people. I would like to=
 extend the same to places, form of God/Goddess, template.

I was in Kolkot=
a for 5 years. I went to Dakshineswar several times but avoided visiting Ka=
lighat even once. Why? I heard the Kalighat is a red light area and you can=
 meet broken with in template premises. Also, I heard, that the temple cont=
inues to have jantu bali and that the temple floor has animal blood flowing=
. These may be exaggerations, but, I had developed a prejudice against the =
Kalighat temple.

Now a days, I repent my narrow mindedness.

My mental con=
dition between 1992-97 did not allow me to even consider going to Kalighat.=
 My mental condition now will allow it.

Our experiance may depend on our m=
ental condition.

2. To perceive spiritual energy, we may have to have a ka=
rmic relation with that energy. We may need to have matching wavelength to =
recieve the same.

If I sit in a place and here to the voices, I will under=
stand messages in Telugu/Hindi/English. How ever, if there is beautiful mes=
sage in Oriya or some other language, I may not perceive (I am not undermin=
ing Narasimha's ability to perceive energy).

God is omni present. His ener=
gy is present any where and every where. How ever, we do not perceive it ti=
ll we are pure and our mental and spiritual conditioning allow it.

If in a=
 place, there is any energy matching our conditioning, we may experience.

=
Best regards,
Vijay

 months later he ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed hi=

        If an incense stick with intense smell was burnt in a place, the ai=

             Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air th=

                I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (IS=
