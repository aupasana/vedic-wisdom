Namaste Dheeraj,
You can use as much =
quantity of offerings as you want, as long
as the offerings are properly co=
nsumed in the fire. It all boils down to
the amount of fire that is present=
 in the homa kunda. If there is good
amount of fire, even if you do not off=
er ghee, offering marmara , havan
samagri etc will be easily consumed. But =
if the fire is small, then you
do need to offer ghee drops to keep the fire=
 alive.
There were days when I used about 8-10 coconut halves for 1
chandi =
homam, ie started with 2 pieces of 1 coconut half, adding half
piece of coc=
onut half for each chapter and finally a piece for
purnahuti. Now, I am abl=
e to manage 1 chandi homa with about 2-3 coconut
halves. Others out there m=
ight be able to do with much less. It also
depends on the coconut pieces it=
self, some pieces burn slow and some
fast, so the quantity you may need may=
 vary.
Most importantly I suggest you follow an important advice of
Narasim=
haji. Pouring ghee drops around the corners of the coconut piece,
making su=
re the piece catches fire from all the corners. Doing this way,
at the end =
of the homa, all the coconut pieces are completely burnt,
almost like powde=
r.
So, my suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings at your
disposal=
, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does not matter). 
Make sure th=
e offerings that you put with each swaha (sloka) catch fire.
Hold your offe=
rings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc joining your
ring finger, middle =
finger and thumb. This way, you will be offering
decent amount with each sw=
aha.
Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, black and
whit=
e sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and used the
combination as=
 offering.
I am sure within first few days of your homa, you will have very=

good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you need to make.

All the =
Best.

Ravi
