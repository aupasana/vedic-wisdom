Namaste, 
=A0
Here is one of the questions posed by yaksha and maharaja yu=
dishtir's answer to the same: 
-----
What is the best for those who give bi=
rth? 
Son is the best for those who give birth. 
-----
=A0
Why is it that i=
mportance is given to Son's birth in Vedic scriptures? Is it to do with Tar=
pana? Doesn't daughter have the right to do the tarpana? Or is there any ot=
her reason for Son to Daughter? Please clarify.

Thanks & Regards,
--Muraha=
ri
