Namaste,

If you can do homam with attention and some sattwa (whatever *you* can 
manage), anytime is fine.

As night progresses, the quality of sattwa goes down in Nature and tamas 
increases. If your inherent sattwa is not high enough to resist the tamas 
outside, you may not be able to focus the mind on the ritual well and be 
alert.

Doing it after sunset is fine. But I suggest not waiting till late in the 
night and doing it as early as possible. If you do very late, there is NO 
harm. But simply the benefit may be les, if there is an additional layer of 
tamas on your consciousness due to the Nature of time.

Once I witnessed a Ganapathi homam performed in the backyard of a priest's 
house, next to a river, late in the night. There were four really good 
priests there and it was one of the most pleasant Ganapathi homams I 
witnessed. IF you have enough sattwa to mix with the quality of gunas in 
Nature during night, it can generate a different kind of nice feeling. Only 
thing is that not much happens if there is very little sattwa in you 
inherently.

Best regards,
Narasimha
