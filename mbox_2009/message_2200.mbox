Namaste Rajarshi,
      When I started out my Chandi homas  (elaborate procedure), it used to take about 3 to 3 1/2 hrs and I could easily manage the fire with coconut pieces (Each piece is a qurater of the whole coconut). Place 2 pieces side by side and the third one touching the sides of these 2, giving it a triangular shape if you look from top (white side facing up).
During homam make sure you turn the pieces side-ways so that all the sides of a single piece catch fire. When white side is burnt enough, turn it over to bring the dark side up.
At the beginning of each chapter, add a new piece, pushing the thoroughly burnt piece to the top side. So, at any time you should have 2 pieces burning so that one supports the other in case of an emergency.     
      It is very helpful if you can have the Chandipath script in front of you while listening to the audio.  Familiarize yourself with all the difficult words, underline the words that need extra care of pronunciation. Then read aloud while listening to the audio and when you feel comfortable, set a rule for yourself on 21 days or 40 days and start reading daily. Very soon, the total time will drastically reduce and you can start the homa. Try to bring down the total duration at an affordable level and at the same time to a comfortable level.
      When you do homa, use your left thumb to track the verse you are on. It will help initially. Also, if you are constrained by time, you can just follow what Narasimha does  as mentioned in an earlier post to Utpal. In addition to what Narasimha does, I read Ganapathi Atharvaseersham, Kavacha and Devi Suktam an addition of about 10 minutes.
      All the best.

Regards
Ravi

Hi,
 
This is indeed very interesting. I have one more question for you Narayanji. Do you do homa with wood or coconut? If you are doing it with wood, then initially when the Chandi homas took 4 hours, how did you keep the fire going continuously?
 
Did you play the CD and keep practicing the Chandi with it, or you played it while doing the homam and pronounced it along with hearnig it?
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi


The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra
