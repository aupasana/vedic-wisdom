Namaste Narasimha & other Sanskrit Scholars,

One pending issue with me whi=
ch i wish to put in front of all of you 
for clarifications-

Take instance=
 of Jyotish Classics. I've seen Scholars (Who are 
having knowledge of Jyot=
isha as well as Sankrita) debating endlessly 
on a particular verse . one o=
r two lines or sometimes even a couple 
of words in a verse seems to create=
 great confusions. we have seen 
that different scholars tend to interpret =
and derive different 
meaning from a same verse. i took the example of jyot=
ish classics 
because we are more familiar with controversies in that area.=


This confusion is also applicable in other literature of Sanskrit 
langua=
ge.

Why Sanskrit (Held as the finest language and mother of all the 
other=
 language - One Arabic language teacher recently made a bold 
comment that =
basis of Arabic language is sanskrit) should create so 
much confusions amo=
ng the scholars. is it that ambiguous or the 
writers didn't wrote in a clu=
tter-less fashion or the current 
generation is not sharp enough to grasp t=
he right meaning. Whatever 
may be the case, why a verse should fail to giv=
e one a simple 
undisputable meaning at least literally like in our modern =
languages?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
