 A GURU said to his disciple: "The world is illusory. Come away with me."
"=
But revered sir," said the disciple, "my people at home=97my father,my
moth=
er, my wife=97love me so much. How can I give them up?" The guru said: "No
=
doubt you now have this feeling of T and 'mine' and say that they love you;=

but this is all an illusion of your mind, I shall teach you a trick, and y=
ou
will know whether they love you truly or not." Saying this, the teacher =
gave
the disciple a pill and said to him:

"Swallow this at home. You will =
appear to be a corpse, but you will not lose
consciousness. You will see ev=
erything and hear everything. Then I shall
come to your house and gradually=
 you will regain your normal state."

The disciple followed the teacher's i=
nstructions and lay on his bed like a
dead person. The house was filled wit=
h loud wailing. His mother, his wife,
and the others lay on the ground weep=
ing bitterly.

Just then a brahmana entered the house and said to them, "Wh=
at is the matter
with you?" "This boy is dead", they replied. The brahmana =
felt the pulse and
said: "How is that? No, he is not dead. I have a medicin=
e that will cure him
completely." The joy of the relatives was unbounded; i=
t seemed to them that
heaven itself had come down into their house.

"But",=
 said the brahmana, "I must tell you something else. Another person
must ta=
ke some of this medicine first, and then the boy must swallow the
rest. But=
 the other person will die. I see he has so many dear relatives
here; one o=
f them will certainly agree to take the medicine. I see his wife
and mother=
 crying bitterly. Surely they will not hesitate to take it."

At once the w=
eeping stopped and all sat quiet. The mother said: ''Well, this
is a big fa=
mily: Suppose I die; then who will look after the family?" She
fell into a =
reflective mood.

The wife, who had been crying a minute before and bemoani=
ng her ill
luck,said: "Well he has gone the way of mortals. I have these tw=
o or three
young children. Who will look after them if I die?"

The discipl=
e saw everything and heard everything.

He stood up at once and said to the=
 teacher: "Let us go, revered sir. 1 will
follow you."
