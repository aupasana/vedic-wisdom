Dear Ravi:

However in the Mahaganapati homam audio, Shri PVR recommends
o=
ffering  Gayatri mantra  to the fire. I was wondering how
one would do that=
 if one cannot say it aloud. 
Are you saying it is not recommended to offer=
 it?

Regards

 I was told that the Gayatri mantra is the main food for one's spirituality=
 and hence it is advised to keep it to oneself, at all times.
