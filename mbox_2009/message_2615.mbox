Dear NarsimhaJi,
i found your astrology software to be limited as i do not =
know astrology
it may be a great tool for astrologers as it prepares all ch=
arts
it shows strength in one chart
it does not show interpretation results=

I think only a expert can interpret your software results
why you have not=
 given the weakness as you have explained positive strengths
why you have n=
ot given elaborate english comments for the various charts
so that ordinary=
 people like me can understand
thanks
