Namaste,

T=
hank you for sharing. You are lucky to have a conscience that guides you 
c=
orrectly. Listen to it and overcome fear, shame, embarrasment etc.

Emotion=
s like fear, embarassment, pride, sadness, anger, desire etc are all 
natur=
al to us. Cutting them off completely will take a long time. But one 
can a=
tleast try to learn to not dwell on them for too long. Normally, when a 
th=
ought like embarassment or fear or anger or pride disturbs the mental 
equi=
librium, it will linger in the mind for a while. It will not go away 
quick=
ly. Try to learn to move on, without protesting or fighting with such 
thou=
ghts. Take notice of the thought and move on without over-analyzing it. 
Do=
n't feel great or bad about any thought. Let the thought come and get its 
=
two seconds of space in your mind and then move on. Remember the analogy of=
 
a heckler I gave in a mail before. The distracting thoughts are like 
hec=
klers. Do not fight with them or reason with them. Notice them, ignore 
the=
m and move on.

When you do a sadhana, do not worry too much about the resu=
lts. Having the 
results or some expectations on the mind is an unnecessary=
 distraction. If 
you consciously (but not violently or with a sense of sha=
me or anger or 
disappointment) steer you mind away from such negative thou=
ghts during your 
sadhana, your sadhana will become fruitful sooner or late=
r.

Best regards,
Narasimha
