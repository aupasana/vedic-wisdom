Dear Sri Narasimhagaru, 

Thanks for all the clarifications. Just a couple =
of more questions. How often should I plan to get the chimney professionall=
y cleaned? I plan to do this Homam every Sunday, whenever possible. 

Also,=
 in the way you do / prescribe, I see that you are only using one spoon to =
put the ghee in the homam. Don't you use the Shruk and Shruvam? Because tha=
t is how I learnt it in the Chatushpatra Prayogam! It seems there is a Shat=
patra prayogam also. The Priest who taught me these said that these are the=
 two methods of performing homam according to the Apasthambha Sutram.


Reg=
ards, 

Nagraj
