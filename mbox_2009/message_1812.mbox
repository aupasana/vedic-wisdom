[vedic-wisdom] Dharma or Choice?





Is Dharma the right thing to follow o=
r personal choice?

My marriage is fixed with a girl who I said 'yes' but c=
urrently feel is not good looking enough. Marriage is next week - engagemen=
t is over. I feel the girl is not sufficient looks wise to me and I am disa=
ppointed.

Parents and elders have fixed the marriage - I said 'yes' like a=
n idiot owing to my mistake. The wedding card is printed.

Should I run awa=
y and not attend marriage and ditch the girl?
or should I accept it was my =
mistake and proceed with the marriage as it is the dharma to follow?
