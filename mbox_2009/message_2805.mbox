Dear Rajarshi,
 
Can you give examples of Vedic verses in which you believe=
 the word asura was used as an adjective for the Devas?

e word Asura
        Namaste,

        In the Vedas we often find that the =
word Asura is used as an adjective for the Devas, whereas during the Purani=
c times, Asura is clearly evil. How did the transition of the word come abo=
ut? What does the Vedic word Asura really mean?

        -Regards

          Excellent Article and may I add what a beau=
tiful picture. Please send
          us more !

          A couple of point=
s:

          1. The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali allowed for the=
m also
          signify how the lord will dissolve the maya and takes cont=
rol of our
          bodies and life. With the first step the lord took con=
trol over the
          Bhuva Loka (association with body and material aspe=
cts) and with the
          second step he took control over the higher lok=
as (indriyas) and finally
          the last step was left and only place l=
eft was Balis head (ahamkara)
          which was dissolved as well.

     =
     If you allow God to be part of your life then he will work in mystical=

          ways and take care of the illusion of your body, senses, and fin=
ally
          your ego

          2. The story cannot be complete without =
the role played by Shukracharya
          or the guru of the Asuras. He kne=
w that Sri Vamana was no other than
          Sri Vishnu and warned Bali bu=
t the latter out of pride and duty still
          gave his word (there was=
 still some goodness in Bali, maybe a small
          piece). To seal the d=
eal water was to be put out of the kamandalu of
          Sri Vamana onto t=
he hands of Bali. Shukracharya shrinks to a small size
          and tries =
to block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana
          take=
s a straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye. The
          g=
uru of the Asuras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).

          As=
 the devata tries to enter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element
       =
   will play all kinds of tricks and block the path. A straw
          (rep=
resenting qualities of Surya or the scriptures) accompanied by an
         =
 able Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.

          Regards

          V=
eenu

 The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali allowed 
          for them als=
o<BR>signify how the lord will dissolve the maya and takes 
          contr=
ol of our<BR>bodies and life. With the first step the lord took 
          =
control over the<BR>Bhuva Loka (association with body and material 
       =
   aspects) and with the<BR>second step he took control over the higher 
  =
        lokas (indriyas) and finally<BR>the last step was left and only pla=
ce 
          left was Balis head (ahamkara)<BR>which was dissolved as 
   =
       well.<BR><BR>If you allow God to be part of your life then he will 
=
          work in mystical<BR>ways and take care of the illusion of your bo=
dy, 
          senses, and finally<BR>your ego<BR><BR>2. The story cannot b=
e complete 
          without the role played by Shukracharya<BR>or the gur=
u of the Asuras. 
          He knew that Sri Vamana was no other than<BR>Sr=
i Vishnu and warned 
          Bali but the latter out of pride and duty st=
ill<BR>gave his word 
          (there was still some goodness in Bali, may=
be a small<BR>piece). To 
          seal the deal water was to be put out o=
f the kamandalu of<BR>Sri 
          Vamana onto the hands of Bali. Shukrac=
harya shrinks to a small 
          size<BR>and tries to block the flow of =
water from the Kamandalu and 
          Sri Vamana<BR>takes a straw and cle=
ars the way and Shukracharya loses 
          an eye. The<BR>guru of the As=
uras becomes half blind (opposed to 
          Brihaspati).<BR><BR>As the d=
evata tries to enter the body of a 
          devotee, the Rajas element<BR=

          the path. A straw<BR>(r=
epresenting qualities of Surya or the 
          scriptures) accompanied by=

 Lord Vamana immediately placed his

          of<BR>th=

          =
King Bali in accordance to the<BR>Brahmanic<BR>> (Brahmachari) form

          though he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way with

         his<BR>> intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara =
was 
          a Sattvik<BR>> Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strat=

 Avathara<BR>> 
          *<BR>><BR>> *Hidden behind every Avathar=
a of Paramatma there is 
          a message/moral<BR>> conveyed. In thi=
s Sri Vamana Avathara the 
          message is total surrender<BR>to the<B=
R>> God however mighty one 
          may be. When once you shed your eg=
o and<BR>surrender<BR>> totally 
          with devotion at the feet of =
the supreme Lord there is 
          nothing<BR>one<BR>> can worry about=

          This is what exactly<BR>has<BR>&=
gt; happened in case of Bali who had 
          no other alternative but to=
 surrender<BR>to<BR>> the Lord 
          Trivikrama who had conquered t=
he three worlds.*<BR>> *When King 
          Bali surrendered in front o=
f Lord Vamana with total<BR>devotion, 
          the<BR>> Lord was very =
much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily 
          without<BR>being<BR>=

          ruler of the n=

          would a=
lways protect his kingdom.<BR>He<BR>> also assured Bali that

he would become the Indra in the next<BR>Manvanthara. By<BR>> the 
     =
     touch of Lord's foot on the head of King Bali all his sins 
          =
got<BR>cleaned<BR>> up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is 
    =
      what one should<BR>understand<BR>> that we should never ask for

         alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you<BR>will<BR>> get only =
