To my mind the curses on Brahmins  are listed below:-
1. Overestimation of =
one`s knowlege on all matters  and finding fault with or criticizing  fello=
w  brahmins as a  form of sadistic pleasure.
2.Not co-operating with  fello=
w Brahmins in religious, social and other activities.
3.Poverty or hand-to-=
 mouth living  though classified as "Forward class or community" by powers =
that be. 
The above list is by no means exhaustive. Many more can be added.=


By and large Brahmins  are near intellectuals and do well academically. I=
n India,   since Brahmins   are not classified as "Backward" , even academi=
c toppers are denied admission in top  Government professional colleges  wh=
ere fees are relatively lower nor can all Brahmin parents meet the kind of =
demands in the name of capitation fees etc. made by private  professional  =
colleges. So much about social and  economic implications of being a Brahmi=
n now.

There were times when Brahmins were respected for their learning et=
c.  Now Brahmins are treated as outcasts. Brahmins were followers of script=
ures in toto  in those days. Do we measure up to the standards maintained b=
y our ancestors? We do not even now the compliance levels of say,our great =
grand-father or even our grand father.  Are not we Brahmins ourselves respo=
nsible for this state of affairs? Have we not turned a blind eye to the inj=
unctions of scriptures? How many of us know as to what our scriptures are a=
nd what they contain or as what they advise us.  Pl. think.

Dear Members
I fully agree with Swami Vivekanda.  Keeping fault on our s=
ide we can not find fault with others. See Muslims and christians they stri=
ctly follow their religion. Brahmins deviated from our path for the purpose=
s of livlihood. But how to correct. Kanchi Mahaperiyava introduced very sim=
ple systems to rejuvenite sanskrit studies etc but not followed whereas kar=
nataka govt. introcuced sanskrit as the language to be learnt by everybody.=
