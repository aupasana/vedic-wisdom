Respected Utpalji
Whatever you say is absolutely correct and have experienc=
ed the same .As i
live in kolkata i am very much acquainted with Kalighat a=
nd Dakshineswar
temples.There too the pandas or priests are terribleif not =
all the majority
of them.
I think u can feel the spirituality in a way that=
 i have found very
effective.The method is after your performance of all re=
gular rituals and
offerings are completed just unblinkingly gaze the face o=
f the idol then
slowly focus at the eyes i am sure you can feel something.Y=
ou can do your
gazing even from far off but give time i mean it can happen =
in 1 min or it
can take 5 or maybe 10 mins.I am definite u will feel the vi=
brations.While
focusing try to look for the expression in the face(i mean a=
ll smiles are
not happy smiles).U will come to know whether the puja is goi=
ng in a good
way i mean a way in which the deity wants or not(HE or SHE is =
satisfied or
not).
The same technique applies to the deities in your home t=
oo you start
watching them daily u will fell their facial expression change=
s.Some day you
find something not good in their face think about the puja y=
ou had done or
ur own daily activities on that day u will get the answer fr=
nd.
I dont know whether i can make u understand what i want to mean but i h=
ave
tried myself hard to express myself in words.

Holy places - i am thinking about how to decide if =
a certain place has good spiritual vibrations or not? Whenever i see writin=
gs from Narasimha or from others which talks about spiritual vibrations, i =
wonder! If it's a feel good factor within or without?<br>

<br>
If we g=
o to the famous temples of India today, it is almost sure that one will fin=
d lot of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, business, cheating, discrimina=
tion etc... etc...<br>
can that be criteria for judging the spiritual energ=
y of the place?<br>
<br>
my two distinct experiences (external):<br>
1) i w=
ent to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when i entered to take Darshan of al=
l the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the dogmatic behavior of the Pandas =
standing there near the Idols. they almost commanded me to put some money i=
n front of the Idol. one can imagine my condition. Instead of focusing on t=
he lord, i was angry at them and refused to oblige.<br>

<br>
2) Once we (g=
roup of friends) went to 'Mota Ambaji' (in Gujarat near Mount Abu).=
 one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entrance of the famo=
us temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made a mistake by n=
ot asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he asked us to pay=
 around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. we have to barg=
ain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja saamgri wheneve=
r i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temple of Mumbai,=
 i'll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSaraswati and t=
hat is all.<br>

<br>
However I must say that the above two bad experiences=
 did not discourage me.<br>
<br>
Such things as well as few other things li=
ke General atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external thi=
ngs IMHO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many pure hearte=
