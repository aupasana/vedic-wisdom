 Ramakrishna (smiling): Well, I went to some places. Hazra went farther and
higher up, to Hrishikesha in the Himalayas. I did not go so far or so high
up.

The vulture and the kite soar very high, but their eyes are all the while
directed to the charnel-pits below. Do you know what the charnel-pits are?
Lust and gold. If in going on a pilgrimage a man does not acquire Bhakti,
then his pilgrimage is fruitless; for Bhakti is the end of all; it is the
one thing needful.

Do you know what the vulture and the kite are? They are those who talk on
lofty subjects and say: "We have performed most of the works enjoined in the
Holy Scriptures," but whose minds are immersed in worldliness and strongly
attached to wealth, name, fame, and sense-pleasures.

Pandit: Yes, Revered Sir,that is true. Going on a pilgrimage is like casting
aside the precious stone worn on the breast of Vishnu and wandering about in
search of other jewels.

Ramakrishna: Again, you should know that although you may give thousands of
instructions, still they will not produce results until the time is ripe.

A child before going to sleep says to its mother: "Mamma dear, awaken me
when I shall feel hungry."

The mother replies: "Do not worry about that, my child; thy hunger will
awaken thee."

In the same manner one yearns after God when the proper time comes for it.
[p. 284 & 285]
