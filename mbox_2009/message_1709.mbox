Namaste,
 
(1) Display of emotions is different from feeling emotions. Sain=
ts like Sai Baba and Ramakrishna acted angry sometimes, but I am sure they =
did not feel any anger in their heart.
 
It is not about how you come acros=
s to others. It is about how you feel inside. A person who achieved sthitap=
rajnata feels the same way whether good things happen or bad things happen.=
 He is not dull. He may look happy, sad, angry and calm at different times,=
 but his heart does not feel much emotion and in a calm and stable state al=
wats.
 
"Yoga Vaasishtham" is a good book to read to understand various asp=
ects related to sthitaprajnata. But, more than understanding that state, it=
 is important to make progress towards reaching that state oneself. Not thi=
nking too much about what others do to you is a good starting point. 
 
(2)=
 One should always do one's dharma (right action). What Mr X should do in t=
his specific case depends on his dharma. The tasks assigned to Mr X by natu=
re may require him to ignore the distraction posed by the rowdy person and =
focus on his main task. In another case, the tasks assigned to Mr X by natu=
re may require him to beat up this aggressor and show something to some peo=
ple.
 
Either could be correct. Right action changes from person to person =
and situation to situation. However, as long as Mr X thinks "this person un=
fairly hit me. I should take revenge" and takes action based on that thinki=
ng, he will be stuck and what Nature expecs from him will not be clear to h=
im.
 
One who does not have a dense ego can mostly know what Nautre expects=
 from one, do the right actions and pay off karmik debts. One who has a den=
se ego, which keeps interfering with one's sense of dharma, will be lost an=
d engaging in unnecessary acts which increase the debts instead of reducing=
 them.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
