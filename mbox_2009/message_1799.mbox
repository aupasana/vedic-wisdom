Jitender,

like(whenever i feel the material in the kund is less) or it has to be adde=

Vijay: Yes. You can add ghee/coconut pieces any ti=
me, even if you are not saying Swaha.

uti because then i will be sure that it will get burned , otherwise some pi=
eces remain.
Vijay: Yes. No problem. BTW, if any pieces are not burnt fully=
, do not bother about them. It is alright. Imagine as if you were serving t=
he guess with some sweets. You will like if they eat them fully but, if the=
y leave some amount you wouldn't mind right? Leaving some does not mean you=
r guess did not appreciate your gesture.

> 3) Does it matter how i keep th=
at piece of coconut , which i kept in the kund for PURNAHUTI, i mean ,the p=
art6 thats cut upside or towards down. Hope this question is clear.
Vijay: =
No, it does not matter. If you keep the dark color up, it burns longer easi=
ly. Other than convenience how you keep does not really matter much. How ev=
er, try to imagine the purnahuti is your own igo/identification. I say "Lor=
d kill my ignorance and false identity" while placing purnahuti.
