Hi

You need to wait till 2011 to get an opening ....

You have to donate a=
n idol/picture  of  lord narayana in a temple and also you need to donate p=
erfumed oils and sandal wood paste to the lord which would resolve the bhad=
haka issue .

Yours is a kanya lagna and for this lagna 7th house would bec=
ome bhadhaka sthana which need immediate remedy.  I have given the remedy a=
bove and ensure that this is done on  your janma thithi  Sukla dasami which=
 would fall on any day of the month.  One this thithi enters in a day check=
 for the time and go to any temple and do the pooja.

Hope for the best and=
 god is great.


regards
Uma shanker achanta
