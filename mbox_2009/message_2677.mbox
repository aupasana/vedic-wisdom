Namaste Shri Girish,

Well Done & Congratulations! I think you did very wel=
l. We all went through the same thing and now you will just grow in confide=
nce. Practice makes us perfect. 

Don't worry about your neighbors. Conside=
r the burns as your trophies :), that is the nature of fire.

I hope you en=
joy your ride and I do (might I add along with the budding homam community)=
 certainly wish you the best in your fiery endeavors.

Regards
Narayan
