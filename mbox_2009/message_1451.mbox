Dear Kishore,
 
Until you reach that state, you meditate with a mantra or d=
o homas or do hatha yoga or do whatever you want to do.
 
But, when you rea=
ch that state, you can meditate on Shiva to identify with Shiva. The questi=
on was how to identify with Shiva. So I said first reach a state of equanim=
ity and then meditate on Shiva.
 
Like a very light leaf can fly in the dir=
ection of the wind and go anywhere, consciousness of a person whose ego has=
 been burnt fully can identify with deities.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 "The first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a

  state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the body a=
nd 
  praise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other people. Re=

  It could be as simple as you meant to writ=
e "Until you reach that state, 
  meditate with a mantra ...". If not, here=
 is a question:

  The state you defined is equanimity of mind  in all circ=
umstances. Sadhana
  is the tool to attain such state. Meditation is a sadh=
ana. So, a mantra has
  echo in ones mind and until this state is attained.=
 Did I understand it right?
