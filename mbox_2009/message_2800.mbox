Namaste,

nice explanation! you inspired me to look in to the story further=
 and i was thinking about the same during my Chandi Paath.

>After a while =
the third robber returned and said to the man: "Ah, I >am sorry. Are you hu=
rt? 

This also means that, no matter how badly a person is robbed by Rajas=
 and Tamas, Sooner or later (ultimately) Satwa will come back to him, free =
him from the bondage of Rajas and Tamas and show him the path of liberation=
 from the world of Maya.

so moral of the story is do not loose the hurt ev=
en if you (i) are the biggest sinner in the world. just cry to HER untiring=
ly and satwa will come running!!!

Best Regards,

Utpal

just want to point out one thing in the story. When the first robber (tamas=
