Respected Nitishji,
I am a layman and probably much younger then you of 27 yrs with not such
deep knowledge like you but i believe that God is everything and every
causation to my problems(though I think them purification kriyas of the
soul) and happiness(attachment kriyas of the soul) in this drama called
life.But I cant control my curiosity from asking:

What is your aim through this long discussion.Is it that you are commited in
proving Narasimhaji wrong which is your afterall aim.If that is so what is
your gain in it.For as far as I can understand these knowledge will not take
you to God .Whats the point in discussing them now when after we reach God
we will know everything.
Friend is not we taking the opposite way- Patanjali,Yogananda and all the
seers and Mahapurushas that we have mentioned in this thread have spoken
what we now read after they had realised God.But we are discussing these
things before realising God.If you had my friend realised God even if you
said wrong in this forum everyone would have accepted it to be right because
not of the knowledge but because of HIS blessings.Dont take whatever I said
in some other way .Just was thinking where this long discussion was going
and so spoke my mind out.
Pardon me if I hurt anyones feelings.
Thanking you.

Respected Nitishji,<div><br></div><div>I am a layman and probably much youn=

<div><br></div><div>What is your aim through this long discussion.I=

<div>Friend =

1. Do you realize what is being talked about =
and what you have ended up proving ? Wherein did I deny that Ahamkara is no=
t present in Astral/Causal bodies ?<br>
<br>
Ahamkara is an idea in Causal-=
body, so it is present all the time till the soul is freed of the three bod=
y containers.<br>
 <br>
2. OTOH, What I have stated, with reference to Pata=
njali Sutras, is that Ahamkara is "SUPPRESSED" in Astral and Caus=
al bodies. Meaning <br>
<br>
"Ahamkara isn't the dominant cause of=
 I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies"<br>
<br>
And as a result wouldn't=
 contribute to the acquisition of Astral/Causal Karma.<br>
<br>
Why is Aham=
kara not dominant in Astral/Causal bodies ?<br>
   The reason I have alread=
y given in the first mail in sufficient detail.<br>
<br>
IF THE AHAMKARA IS=
 NOT SUPPRESSED AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, THE PERSON WILL KEEP CARRYING THE SAM=
E EARTHLY IDENTITY TO THE ASTRAL PLANES, AND BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO TH=
E EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL RECLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CONF=
LICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE BEYOND ANYBODY'S CONTROL. <br>

    THUS,=
 THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS, while CAUSA=
L SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.<br>
<br>
Please read more of &=
quot;Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda", he has mentioned about all these =
things (what happens to a soul at death and so on) in such a simplistic man=
ner in his Gita commentaries, that even a layman can understand it.<br>

 All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideationa=
l or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (=
See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/ast=
ral body) don't have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.<br>=

Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the hum=

ixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is =
not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal bod=
y as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies=
. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) an=
d ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) =
and remain till the end.<br>

Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor min=
d) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyz=
es current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditio=
ned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observ=
ations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness pe=
rmeates through all layers of one's individualized consciousness.<br>
