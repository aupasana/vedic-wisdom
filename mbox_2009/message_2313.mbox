Narasimha Ji

Please excuse me for replying to the astrological post here,d=
o not have access to the other forum.I am simply speechless with this new c=
oncept that you have explained , it literally put all the things that were =
unexplained in a new perspective.

I just wanted to give you feedback that =
the method is working very well in some of the horoscopes have seen. It is =
simply fantastic , very very coherent approach and puts the special effects=
 of Jupiter,Saturn and Mars in perspective 

I am extremely curious now the=
 effect this will have on

1.Divisional charts
2.Asthakavarga
3.Lordship of=
 houses( Spanning across two would this mean two lordships will come into p=
lay ) 
4.Gandanta effects and definition

Please do a detailed writeup some=
time in the future , it would help the seekers immensely, cannot thank you =
enough for the service you are doing to the astrology community.

Regards
R=
amKishore
