Namaste 

Good work, great job

A slight mistake in sankalpam, it says abou=
t sani, just for 
correctness otherwise people familiar will be ok.

Also i=
t seems now you seem to accept aluminium foil on the homa kundam
for ease o=
f cleanliness, what happens to rahu's influence? Is it 
ok?...

I agree in =
principle what you suggest in email about faster progress, 
but, there are =
so many ways to realize god, bhakti, nam sankirtan, 
manav seva or any type=
 of seva or mantra yoga, hath yoga etc. There 
are so many, I am sure I can=
not list all.

It depends on the sanskars or accumulated impressions of a s=
adhak as 
to which path will help better, we donot know that for sure excep=
t 
for Siddha Sadaguru.

Also a lot of people donot even have means to eat =
or cloth how will 
they do homam, even if they read this on the internet? W=
hat will 
happen to their feelings and mind. Does that mean they cannot rea=
lize 
God in a speedy way?

Along with Parashara we also have bhagvatam whi=
ch signifies in 
kaliyuga naam sankirtan and similar other documents offer =
other 
methods, all these are equally important and valuable.

A good way i=
s to accept all paths that lead to self realization
and suggest that homan =
is also a very good way. I hope that you 
please accept this in a positive =
way.

Very Happy Shivratri to you and all members.

Best Regards
Mitesh
