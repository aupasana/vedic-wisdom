 In India there are countless holy places (kshetras) that are sacred to Lor=
d
Siva or to some other name and form of God, and many of them are more
wel=
l-known and popular than Arunachala. Yet there is a verse in the
Arunachala=
 Mahatmyam, which has been selected and translated into Tamil by
Sri Bhagav=
an, that says:

Arunachala is truly the holy place. Of all holy places it i=
s the most
sacred! Know that it is the heart of the world. It is truly Siva=
 himself! It
is his heart-abode, a secret kshetra. In that place the Lord e=
ver abides the
hill of light named Arunachala.

Whenever Sri Bhagavan asked=
 about the special sanctity of Arunachala, he
used to explain that other ho=
ly places such as Kailas, Kasi and Chidambaram
are sacred because they are =
the abodes of Lord Siva whereas Arunachala is
Lord Siva himself.

The uniqu=
e sanctity and power of Arunachala-kshetra was once confirmed by an
inciden=
t that happened in the life of Sri Bhagavan. Because of his great
love for =
Sri Bhagavan, a certain devotee wanted to take him to his native
place, Chi=
dambaram. But rather than directly ask Sri Bhagavan to come to
Chidambaram,=
 he began to ask him if he had ever been to see Lord Nataraja in
Chidambara=
m Temple. When Sri Bhagavan replied that he had not, the devotee
began to d=
escribe the greatness of Chidambaram, saying that it was the most
sacred Si=
va-kshetra in South India, that so many saints and sages had lived
there an=
d had sung in praise of Lord Nataraja, and so on and so forth. Sri
Bhagavan=
 listened to all he said with patient interest, but showed no signs
of want=
ing to visit Chidambaram.

Seeing this, the devotee at last said, 'Chidamba=
ram is even greater than
Arunachala, because among the panchabuta lingams [=
the lingams representing
the five elements] Chidambaram is the space-lingam=
 while Arunachala is only
the fire-lingam. Since the four elements, earth, =
water, air and fire,
finally have to merge in space, space is the principal=
 element.'

Hearing this, Sri Bhagavan smiled and said, 'All the five eleme=
nts come into
existence only when Sakti seemingly forsakes her identify wit=
h Lord Siva,
the Supreme Self (Paramatman). Since the five elements are thu=
s only the
creations of Sakti, she is superior to all of them. Therefore, m=
ore
important than the place where the elements merge, is the place where S=
akti
herself merges. Because Sakti is dancing in Chidambaram, Lord Siva has=
 to
dance before her and thereby make her become motionless. But in Arunach=
ala
Lord Siva remains ever motionless (achala), and hence Sakti automatical=
ly
and effortlessly merges in him through great love. Therefore, Arunachala=

shines as the foremost and most powerful kshetra, because here Sakti, who
=
has seemingly created all this manifold appearance, herself merges into the=

Lord. So for those mature aspirants who seek to put an end to the false
ap=
pearance of duality, the most powerful help is to be found only in
Arunacha=
la-kshetra.'

Sri Bhagavan summarized this reply of his in the form of a ve=
rse, which
later became the first verse of Sri Arunachala Navamanimalai. In=
 this verse
he says:

Though he is truly motionless by nature, in the court=
 [of Chidambaram] Lord
Siva dances before Sakti, thereby making her motionl=
ess. But know that [in
Tiruvannamalai] Lord Arunachala shines triumphant, t=
hat Sakti having merged
in his motionless form.
