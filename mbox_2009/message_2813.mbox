Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Right at the onset let me clarify that I have=
 no knowledge of Sanskrit. However, since the time you had adviced me to fo=
llow Aurobindo's writings on the Vedas, I have been doing so for some month=
s now. It is in his writings that I first came across this Asura paradox. H=
e mentions in some of his writings, plus in some of the conversations which=
 he had with his direct disciples which were recorded by Sri A.B. Puranic, =
that the word Asura in the Vedic sense ment "Mighty". 
=C2=A0
Later on with=
 time as the Puranas came along and classical Sanskrit developed - he consi=
dered Rig Vedic Sanskrit as pre-classical and mystical in nature like pre c=
lassical Greek - the word Asura become corrupted to mean "that which is not=
 divine". Following are some parts from his "Secret of the Veda":
=C2=A0

"=
In the first place, the Angirases are not merely the deified human fathers,=
 they are also brought before us as heavenly seers, sons of the gods, sons =
of heaven and heroes or powers of the Asura, the mighty Lord, divas putr=C2=
=AFaso asurasya v=C2=AF=C4=B1r =C2=AFah. (III.53.7), an expression which, t=
heir number being seven, reminds us strongly, though perhaps only fortuitou=
sly, of the seven Angels of AhuraMazda in the kindred Iranian mythology."

Translation:
=C2=A0
1. O Will, O Universal Power,1 the mighty O=
ne supreme in
vision, master of his being, lord of his plenitudes has given=

me his two cows of the Light that draw his wain. He of 
the triple dawn, s=
on of the triple Bull,2 has awakened to
knowledge with the ten thousands3 o=
f his plenitude.
=C2=A0
*The Triple Bull is Indra, lord of the three lumino=
us realms of Swar, the Divine Mind;
Tryaruna Trasadasyu is the half-god, ma=
n turned into the Indra type; therefore he is
described by all the usual ep=
ithets of Indra, =E2=80=9CAsura=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CSatpati=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=

triple dawn is the dawn of these three realms on =
the human mentality.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0



Further, while a=
nalysing a Hymn to Varuna-Mitra he says:- "Asura, a word used in the Veda a=
s in the Avesta for the Deva (Ahuramazda), but also for the gods, His manif=
estations; it is only in a few hymns that it is used for the dark Titans, b=
y another and fictitious derivation, a-sura, the not-luminous, the not-gods=

=C2=A0
Above are some of the example, not all of course, (there are qui=
te a few more from hymns on Indra and Varuna)=C2=A0where Sri Aurobindo cons=
iders that the word Asura is used as an adjective indicating supreme might.=
 
=C2=A0
The division of Asura meaning evil and Deva meaning divine has bee=
n used to further some theories about Aryan MIgration/Invasion. The Avesta =
too mentions the Daeva and Ahura (s becomes h) and their roles are reversed=
. The Avestan Ahura is truth, therefore Ahura Mazda was the greatest Truth =
for them while the word Daeva indicates falsehood and lies.=C2=A0 Some peop=
le have opined that this could be because one stream of the Aryans had sett=
led in Iran and another in India and these were at war, therefore one of th=
em called Devas as=C2=A0divine and Asuras as=C2=A0evil while the other reve=
rsed the terms. Of course, bothr Iranian and Sanskrit are have similar root=
s.

 [vedic-wisdom] The word Asura 





Namaste,
=C2=A0
In the Vedas we often =
find that the word Asura is used as an adjective for the Devas, whereas dur=
ing the Puranic times, Asura is clearly evil. How did the transition of the=
 word come about? What does the Vedic word Asura really mean?

Excellent Article and may=
 I add what a beautiful picture. Please send
us more !

A couple of points:=


1. The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali allowed for them also
signi=
fy how the lord will dissolve the maya and takes control of our
bodies and =
life. With the first step the lord took control over the
Bhuva Loka (associ=
ation with body and material aspects) and with the
second step he took cont=
rol over the higher lokas (indriyas) and finally
the last step was left and=
 only place left was Balis head (ahamkara)
which was dissolved as well.

If=
 you allow God to be part of your life then he will work in mystical
ways a=
nd take care of the illusion of your body, senses, and finally
your ego

2.=
 The story cannot be complete without the role played by Shukracharya
or th=
e guru of the Asuras. He knew that Sri Vamana was no other than
Sri Vishnu =
and warned Bali but the latter out of pride and duty still
gave his word (t=
here was still some goodness in Bali, maybe a small
piece). To seal the dea=
l water was to be put out of the kamandalu of
Sri Vamana onto the hands of =
Bali. Shukracharya shrinks to a small size
and tries to block the flow of w=
ater from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana
takes a straw and clears the way and=
 Shukracharya loses an eye. The
guru of the Asuras becomes half blind (oppo=
sed to Brihaspati).

As the devata tries to enter the body of a devotee, th=
e Rajas element
will play all kinds of tricks and block the path. A straw
(=
representing qualities of Surya or the scriptures) accompanied by an
able G=
uru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.

Regards

Veenu

<DIV>Right at the onset let me clarify that =
I have no knowledge of Sanskrit. However, since the time you had adviced me=
 to follow Aurobindo's writings on the Vedas, I have been doing so for some=
 months now. It is in his writings that I first came across this Asura para=
dox. He mentions in some of his writings, plus in some of the conversations=
 which he had with his direct disciples which were recorded by Sri A.B. Pur=
anic, that the word Asura in the Vedic sense ment "Mighty". </DIV>
<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV>Later on with time as the Puranas came along and classical S=
anskrit developed - he considered Rig Vedic Sanskrit as pre-classical and m=
ystical in nature like pre classical Greek - the word Asura become corrupte=
d to mean "that which is not divine". Following are some parts from his "Se=
cret of the Veda":</DIV>

</FONT><BR>Excellent Article and may I add what a beautiful picture. Please=
 send<BR>us more !<BR><BR>A couple of points:<BR><BR>1. The 3 steps taken b=
y Sri Vishnu after Bali allowed for them also<BR>signify how the lord will =
dissolve the maya and takes control of our<BR>bodies and life. With the fir=
st step the lord took control over the<BR>Bhuva Loka (association with body=
 and material aspects) and with the<BR>second step he took control over the=
 higher lokas (indriyas) and finally<BR>the last step was left and only pla=
ce left was Balis head (ahamkara)<BR>which was dissolved as well.<BR><BR>If=
 you allow God to be part of your life then he will work in mystical<BR>way=
s and take care of the illusion of your body, senses, and finally<BR>your e=
go<BR><BR>2. The story cannot be complete without the role played by Shukra=
charya<BR>or the guru of the Asuras. He knew that Sri Vamana was no other t=
han<BR>Sri Vishnu and warned Bali but the latter
 out of pride and duty sti=
ll<BR>gave his word (there was still some goodness in Bali, maybe a small<B=
R>piece). To seal the deal water was to be put out of the kamandalu of<BR>S=
ri Vamana onto the hands of Bali. Shukracharya shrinks to a small size<BR>a=
nd tries to block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana<BR>ta=
kes a straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye. The<BR>guru o=
f the Asuras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).<BR><BR>As the deva=
ta tries to enter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element<BR>will play all=
 kinds of tricks and block the path. A straw<BR>(representing qualities of =
Surya or the scriptures) accompanied by an<BR>able Guru (Sri Vamana) can cl=
ear the path.<BR><BR>Regards<BR><BR>Veenu<BR><BR>--- In <A href=3D"http://i=

BR>> *Significance<BR>> *<BR>><BR>> *Sri Vamana Avathara was fi=
fth in the line of Dasavatharas of Lord Sri<BR>Maha<BR>> Vishnu. This av=
athara took place during Treta Yuga before Sri<BR>Parashurama<BR>> Avath=
ara. Lord Maha Vishnu took this avathara in order to suppress the<BR>> a=
rrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor Bali (Bali Chakravarthi) and to<BR>&g=
t; restore the glory, power and authority of Lord Indra over the Heaven<BR>=
who had<BR>> lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to King Bali. Sri Vishn=
u Sahasra<BR>Nama<BR>> Sthothra
 describes in sloka # 17 and 56, the Lor=
d asUpendro Vaamanah<BR>and<BR>> Trivikramah. *<BR>> *Lord in this av=
athara was known as Vamana because he was dwarf in<BR>form at<BR>> the b=
eginning. He was known as Trivikrama because he is the one who<BR>has<BR>&g=
t; conquered the three worlds, Earth, Upper worlds and Nether worlds. He<BR=
>grew<BR>> to a gigantic size while suppressing the King Bali and conque=
red the<BR>> Universe with just three paces of his foot. He was also ref=
erred as<BR>Upendra<BR>> as he was known to be the younger brother of In=
dra. We find all the<BR>three<BR>> names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendra =
while reciting 24 Kesava Namas.<BR>An<BR>> exclusive Purana named after =
Lord Vamana called Sri Vamana Purana<BR>scripted<BR>> by Lord and Sage V=
eda Vyasa forms part of 18 great Puranas called<BR>Ashtadasa<BR>> Purana=
s.*<BR>><BR>> *Lord Vamana was born as the son of Sage Kashyapa (Kash=
yapa<BR>Prajapathi)
 and<BR>> his wife Aditi in accordance to the penanc=
e done by the couple and<BR>prayers<BR>> of Indra and other Deities. He =
was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi<BR>day<BR>> under the star constell=
ation of Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year<BR>is<BR>> celebrated as=
 Vamana Jayanthi the day on which Lord Sri Vamana was<BR>born. As<BR>> s=
oon as he was born He took no time in attaining the boyhood becoming<BR>a V=
atu<BR>> (Brahmachari) . Lord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Mant=
hra to<BR>Sri<BR>> Vamana. His attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brah=
machari, wearing<BR>a<BR>> Koupeena (Loin cloth), a sacred thread, holdi=
ng a Chatthra (Umbrella)<BR>in one<BR>> hand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick=
 and water jug) in the other, his<BR>upper body<BR>> covered with Deer s=
kin, wearing a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his<BR>third<BR>> finger.=
*<BR>> **<BR>><BR>> *Significance of Three Steps*<BR>> *Lord Va=
mana went to
 King Maha Bali and asks for three steps of land<BR>> measu=
red by his foot as charity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate<BR>just<BR>&=
gt; three paces of land as it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty<BR=
>to give<BR>> such charity. But later agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vam=
ana and<BR>promised<BR>> to give three paces of land as charity measured=
 by Sri Vamana's<BR>foot. When<BR>> Maha Bali completed the ritual proce=
ss of donating the land, Lord<BR>Vamana<BR>> assumed his cosmic form (Tr=
ivikrama) , measured the entire Earth<BR>including<BR>> the nether world=
s by his first step.*<BR>> *<BR>> With his second step He measured th=
e entire upper worlds. When his<BR>foot<BR>> reached the zenith it cross=
ed the Sathya Loka where Lord Brahma stays.<BR>> Seeing the foot of Lord=
 Maha Vishnu, Lord Brahma offered abhishekam<BR>and<BR>> washed the Lord=
's foot and the water that fell from His foot<BR>sanctified the<BR>> ent=
ire
 Universe. We find in the verses of great composer and Saint Sri<BR>>=
; Annamacharya referring to the foot washed by Lord Brahma (Brahma<BR>Kadig=
ina<BR>> Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri Venkateswara. *<BR>>=
; *<BR>> When the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces of Lor=
d Sri<BR>Maha<BR>> Vishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Univer=
se to keep<BR>Vamana's<BR>> third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali=
 the space to keep his<BR>third<BR>> pace, all the pride and vanity of M=
aha Bali had vanished and he had no<BR>> hesitation in surrendering befo=
re the Supreme Lord. Having realised<BR>the<BR>> Supreme Reality, Bali r=
eadily offered his own head to keep the<BR>Lord's third<BR>> step. Lord =
Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his foot) on the<BR>head<BR>> =
of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ahankara (egoism)<BR>of=
<BR>> Maha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with his
 kingdom.=
*<BR>> **<BR>><BR>> *Uniqueness*<BR>><BR>> *Sri Vamana Avath=
ara is the first Avathara where Lord Sri Maha Vishnu<BR>took<BR>> comple=
te human form though dwarf at the beginning. The uniqueness of<BR>this<BR>&=
gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not use any weapon. The only weapon he<BR=
>used<BR>> was that of begging in front of King Bali in accordance to th=
e<BR>Brahmanic<BR>> (Brahmachari) form he had attained. The Lord did not=
 kill the King<BR>Bali even<BR>> though he was an Asura. He conquered hi=
m in a Vedic way with his<BR>> intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vam=
ana Avathara was a Sattvik<BR>> Avathara. Lord had to resort to this str=
ategy due to the promise he<BR>had made<BR>> to his beloved devotee Prah=
lada not to kill any of his descendants.<BR>> Astrologically Jupiter (Gu=
ru) is said to be the Paramatma Amsa of<BR>Vamana<BR>> Avathara.*<BR>>=
; **<BR>> *Message from Vamana Avathara<BR>>
 *<BR>><BR>> *Hidd=
en behind every Avathara of Paramatma there is a message/moral<BR>> conv=
eyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the message is total surrender<BR>to the<=
BR>> God however mighty one may be. When once you shed your ego and<BR>s=
urrender<BR>> totally with devotion at the feet of the supreme Lord ther=
e is nothing<BR>one<BR>> can worry about and will get total protection. =
This is what exactly<BR>has<BR>> happened in case of Bali who had no oth=
er alternative but to surrender<BR>to<BR>> the Lord Trivikrama who had c=
onquered the three worlds.*<BR>> *When King Bali surrendered in front of=
 Lord Vamana with total<BR>devotion, the<BR>> Lord was very much pleased=
 and gave him boons voluntarily without<BR>being<BR>> asked by King Bali=
. He not only made him the ruler of the nether world<BR>> Suthala but al=
so assured him that He would always protect his kingdom.<BR>He<BR>> also=
 assured Bali that he would become the Indra
 in the next<BR>Manvanthara. B=
y<BR>> the touch of Lord's foot on the head of King Bali all his sins go=
t<BR>cleaned<BR>> up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is what on=
e should<BR>understand<BR>> that we should never ask for alms to the Sup=
reme Lord. If you ask you<BR>will<BR>> get only what you had asked. It y=
ou don't ask you will get<BR>everything that<BR>> you require.*<BR>> =
*<BR>> The story of Bali also bring out the reality that, there is nothi=
ng<BR>> permanent and nothing to be taken for granted in this world be i=
t<BR>wealth,<BR>> beauty, power, status, position or family and nothing =
belongs to<BR>anyone.<BR>> Even the mighty have to fall on one day or th=
