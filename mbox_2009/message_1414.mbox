Namaste Friends,

I was going through the index which is found online about=
 the Rudrayamala tantra (well this is the best that i got on the web world)=
 and the brief description of Chapter 7 drew my attention to the following =
(which i have copy pasted):

This starts with a description of Kumari Puja.=
 If performed, it is said to remove poverty and illness. The place of puja =
is either a Mahapitha or a Devi temple. The text lists the different maiden=
s including Nati (actress), Kapaliki, Rajaki, Napita, Gopala, Brahmani, Vai=
shya, Shudra and Chandala. The girls should be given sweets and other pleas=
ant things and treated as forms of the goddess incarnate. The mantras of th=
e Kumaris are given. 
_____________________________________________________=
________________

Further to this what is of particular interest to me is t=
hat the worship of the goddess as a gopala. 

My humble request to you frie=
nds...would be to throw some light on this aspect. 

Kind regards
Arunisha
