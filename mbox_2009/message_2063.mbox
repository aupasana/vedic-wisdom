Dear Narasimhaji,

Namaste. This is wonderful. Thank you for sharing these =
daily inspirational gems with us..I feel that your words certainly help us =
along our spiritual journey in some way or another. I got goosebumbs while =
reading the section about the Dakshina Kaali homam. Incidentally, it remind=
ed me of something that I had read before about a concept of 'Crystal Child=
ren' - A new generation of children born to ease us into a new era of spiri=
tuality:

4

"As babies, Crystal Children may take longer than normal to begin talkin=
g. They are highly telepathic, and their tuned-in mothers communicate with =
them nonverbally. Because they're so sensitive, the Crystal Children babies=
 may fuss and cry a lot in crowded places. They're also very fond of nature=
. Doreen once watched one Crystal Child walk from tree to tree, giving each=
 one a big hug.

Crystal Children are beautiful inside and out, like magnif=
icent little high-priests and priestesses. One look in their eyes, and you'=
ll recognize Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and o=
palescent=97they seem to glow from the inside! They talk about past lives, =
distant galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love. Most Cry=
stal Children's parents are aware that their kids are special, and they're =
thrilled to be parenting such delightful children."
