namaste,

See if you can get a copy of the book 'Yoga, enlightenment, and p=
erfection'
of Abhinava Vidyatheerth Mahaswamigal. This is a record of the s=
piritual
experiences of a former pontiff of the Sringeri mutt. It provides =
a rare
glimpse into the mind of a such a great man. After reading this,
I r=
ealized just how special these 'God-men' are . . . and just how far
I have =
to go.

bhavadiiyaH,

       ajit
