Namaskaaram Utpalji,
A real gem from you-how much to remember ?!? 
Suppose =
I have memorized this-how much to remember.
I am a researcher by profession=
 and often wonder -how much to remember ???

You are absolutely right in po=
inting out what I have mistakenly stated "Niti Shataka"-It should have been=
 VAIRAGYA SHATAKA...My sincere apology for the unintended misinformation.
S=
trange-i have wanted to write V.Shataka and wrote his being ascetic/renounc=
ing the 'Samsaara',etc.
A small clarification-I have not meant to say Raaja=
 Bhartruhari is the Chranjiva like Bhagwan Parashuraama or Sri Sri Ashwatha=
amaa- I have mentioned that many believe that R.B.still roams in India and =
grants Darshana to the deserving.

Again thanks for that poser on memory,
H=
umble regards,
amit

Namaskaaram Amit Bhai,

Our own resource=
ful Mitesh has provided good information of Ujjain 
and Shree Maa and other=
 places where Yagyas are performed.

"Ujjainiya Mahaakaalm..." ! My Parents=
 visited Mahaakaal last year. 
it is also said that, the main attraction of=
 Mahaakaal is to attend 
their early mroning Bhasma Aarati. and people told=
 me that it is a 
custom to bring the ashes of last cremated body from the =
nearby 
smashaan for the Bhasma Abhiskek. by the way it is well known that =

Amitabh Bachhan has a turn around in his career after rirual 
performed at=
 Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing happened and came out from 
debt etc..
Ujjain wa=
s once the capital of great king Vikramaaditya. Gujarati 
calander year, wh=
ich is Vikram Samvat is also named after him. so 
gujaraatis have connectio=
n to Ujjain:)

I am not sure but is Raja Bhartuhari considered as one of th=
e 
Chiranjivis? and was under the impression that the name of his 
treaty w=
as Vairaagya Shataka.

but not much important. how much information we'll s=
tore in this 
memory and what we will do with that.

warm regards,

utpal
