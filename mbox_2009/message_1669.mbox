Namaste

Samputikarana is true with all chantings of things like sundarkand=
, ramayana and others. 

It is mostly secretly passed in India via word of =
mouth from a saint to his/her devotees. It is very effective as the results=
 have been tested.

One such book that I have read is as follows:

Pronunci=
ation and the Chandi Samputs

By Swamiji and Shree Maa
www.shreemaa.org

Pr=
onunciation and the Chandi Samputs contains a collection of stories about s=
adhus' chanting, and about the constituent ingredients of intention, motiva=
tion, sincerity, attention, bhava, and understanding. It shares an outline =
of the history of Sanskrit literature, and details the origins of translite=
ration into Roman characters. It discusses the various styles of chanting a=
mong sadhus, and describes the differences in the alphabets of the differin=
g languages of India . Then it details the Sadhana of the Chandi: different=
 ways of chanting for different purposes. Ultimately it defines many of the=
 Chandi Samputs, and describes the siddhis for which each would be employed=
.
It's a small book, a simple book, but I think it is very important for st=
udents of Sanskrit.
