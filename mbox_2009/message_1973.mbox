Namaste,
 
Now a Vishnu sahasra naama homam manual is available. It contain=
s a very short procedure for Vishnu sahasra naama homam. It is very detaile=
d and pretty much anybody can follow it.
 
Those who regularly chant Vishnu=
 sahasra naama stotram should be able to perform a homam if they spend an e=
xtra 10 minutes, after a little practice. For those who are pressed for tim=
e and yet want to do a homam, a super-short procedure involving one verse i=
s also given.
 
The manual is available in English language, with mantras g=
iven in Sanskrit/Hindi, English, Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam scripts.
 
In=
 addition to this manual, manuals for Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Kr=
ishna homam, Shiva homam, Mahalakshmi homam, Sani homam and Kuja homam are =
available. More will be coming later.
 
Chanting Vishnu's 1000 names is ver=
y powerful in this age. It is the best antidote for many problems, material=
 and spiritual. Fire of a reasonable size augments the effect. The philosop=
hy of fire ritual is explained in the manual.
 
This is a part of the effor=
t to enable a community of sadhakas who worship various deities in fire, as=
 per the command of the divine Mother to my spiritual master at Kalikambal =
temple in Chennai in March 2006.
 
Please go to the homam website below to =
download the manuals. It is hoped that spiritual sadhakas interested in hom=
am will benefit from this and also help in increasing collective dharma in =
this world with their contribution. Please feel free to spread this link am=
ong interested people.
 
Any philosophical or practical questions on homam =
or any spiritual sadhana can be discussed on the yahoogroup vedic-wisdom.
 =

Best regards,
Narasimha
