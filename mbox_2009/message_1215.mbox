Namaskar, Narasimha!

Grateful if you could please explain what the followi=
ng represent, when 
viewed in light of a TP chart -apologies for posing thi=
s JHora related 
question, but I thought it does belong here, given its pro=
ximity to the 
topics discussed here.

1] Moon -Division -8, Index -8 -D-10=
 Amsa -ISAANA
2] Mars -Division -8, Index -8 -D-10 Amsa -ISAANA
3] Mercury =
[r] -Division 1, Index 10 -Ananta
4] Sat-Rahu & Ketu -all three with Divisi=
on 1, Index 10, in Ananta Amsa.

Most grateful if you could please explain,=
 since I could not find 
details in your published book.

Venkat
