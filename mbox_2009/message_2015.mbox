=C2=A0
Just to put things in perspective, from what I have read til=
l now, Sri Aurobindo does not speak about any Avatar coming at this moment.=
 He says the basic level of human conscinousness will undergo a change. Tha=
t is the next stage of evolution. Sir Aurobindo uses a different set of ter=
monilogies based on his study of the Vedas and the Tattriya Upanishad. Ther=
efore, when he says "soul" or other such words, they maynot=C2=A0 exactly m=
ean what we normally understand as the Atman - the eternal.
=C2=A0
The core=
 of his philosophy is one of evolution. If Humans have to survive on this p=
lanet, they must evolve and prove themselves worthy. Nature is too vast. We=
 live in one planet in one solar system in one milky way which is tucked aw=
ay in one corner of the universe. There are so many different elements in t=
he Universe, as well as different Universes, that compared to all that we a=
re too tiny as a species. So why should nature have any special liking for =
us? He says. Nature does not have any special liking or favouratism for hum=
ans as a species, untill humans can show that they have the capacity to evo=
lve into a higher level=C2=A0and are worthy. Or else, Sri Aurobindo says, t=
here have been previous creation cycles which had human like species which =
were destroyed by Nature because they could not evolve. Nature is the Sover=
eign of ALL UNIVERSES. Therefore Nature's perspective is different from tha=
t of an averge human.
=C2=A0
So the purpose of life and an Avatar is to pus=
h the species into higher realms of evolution. The next stage of evolution =
is a spiritual one. In simple words, a time is coming, unlike now, when spi=
ritual truths will establish themselves as obvious and possible in the aver=
age human mind, unlike what it is today - a mixiture of doubt and fantasy f=
or most. This=C2=A0he says, will start after 2000. That is teh descent of t=
he Supramental conscinousness.
=C2=A0
I may not have been able to do justic=
e to the exact shades and nuances of Sri Aurobindo's fascinating and comple=
x philosophy. Any mistakes in the above explanation is pure mine. Not His.

=C2=A0
I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurob=
indo's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.
=C2=A0
Near the=
 beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sa=
ge, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed be=
fore. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for =
a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to mani=
fest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into E=
arth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth ex=
perienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her mater=
ial body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo wa=
s joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who late=
r became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intens=
ive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertain=
ties we face today.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force perme=
ates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness=
. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called in=
volution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matte=
r is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a s=
tage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner =
visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he=
 called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would=
 entirely change everything on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is =
not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An im=
mortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, =
while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by=
 the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan =
in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.=


Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary =
crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendou=
s strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its=
 own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her=
 death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what m=
ay be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of =
the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellu=
lar consciousness.

Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of=
 Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of=
 another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence=
 of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolutio=
n, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. Th=
e first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational =
being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contac=
ting and merging with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=
=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence o=
f an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merg=
e and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. 
=C2=A0
=
Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense ph=
ysical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supra=
mental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 
=
=C2=A0
Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental =
Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matte=
r. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=
=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully reali=
zed upon Earth.

The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in brin=
ging supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of thei=
r own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the su=
pramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the conscious=
ness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its=
 full manifestation in collective matter.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdesc=
ent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mothe=
r speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essenti=
ally anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of =
Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of =
Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem =
to be in control of current global events. According to them the Asura of D=
arkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asur=
a of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still rem=
ain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Fals=
ehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and =
of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not=
 be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world lea=
ders in the current political sphere.

With the descent of this new vibrato=
ry consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. =
However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormou=
s they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatica=
lly erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood=
. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization whi=
ch could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and=
 violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emana=
tions of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate=
, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have e=
xperienced if not for this power of harmonization!

When does all this happ=
en? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for =
this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 19=
68 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it wou=
ld come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum=
 is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a tur=
ning point.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This was a very interesting read and matches what=
 Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.
