Namaste,

Thank you for sharing. You are lucky to have a conscience that guides you 
correctly. Listen to it and overcome fear, shame, embarrasment etc.

Emotions like fear, embarassment, pride, sadness, anger, desire etc are all 
natural to us. Cutting them off completely will take a long time. But one 
can atleast try to learn to not dwell on them for too long. Normally, when a 
thought like embarassment or fear or anger or pride disturbs the mental 
equilibrium, it will linger in the mind for a while. It will not go away 
quickly. Try to learn to move on, without protesting or fighting with such 
thoughts. Take notice of the thought and move on without over-analyzing it. 
Don't feel great or bad about any thought. Let the thought come and get its 
two seconds of space in your mind and then move on. Remember the analogy of 
a heckler I gave in a mail before. The distracting thoughts are like 
hecklers. Do not fight with them or reason with them. Notice them, ignore 
them and move on.

When you do a sadhana, do not worry too much about the results. Having the 
results or some expectations on the mind is an unnecessary distraction. If 
you consciously (but not violently or with a sense of shame or anger or 
disappointment) steer you mind away from such negative thoughts during your 
sadhana, your sadhana will become fruitful sooner or later.

Best regards,
Narasimha
