Namaste

If what you suggest is true, than in India a lot of seers did sad=
hana 
for many years in caves and many of them are underground too ...
I ha=
ve seen some of them.

I donot think underground=3Dtamasic.

In fact many a=
shrams in India I have seen have basement type rooms as 
meditation halls.
=

Any clean place is good, In Guru Gita Lord Shiva has described
the types o=
f asana materials and direction of seat.

As per guru gita, west is conside=
red good for wealth and woollen 
asana of yellowish color. 
There are more =
definitions one each for north, east and south. Along 
with Asana materials=
. I do not remember all though.
If anyone interested I can dig up.
