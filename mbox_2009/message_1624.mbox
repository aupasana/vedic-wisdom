Namaste
=A0
I will share my little understanding of this issue. First, the =
system used to be referred to as the Varnapratha. Just like our philosophy =
had the system of ashramas to define an ordinary man's life, like the Brahm=
acharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha etc.
=A0
Now of course not every man would,=
 I am presuming, would follow every one of the ashrams ideally. Everybody h=
as his her own nature. So, the first idea that one must understand is that,=
 like the Ashramas, the Varnapratha was a classification, which could be pu=
t to good use, IF, it was followed in the right spirit.
=A0
As we have alre=
ady seen, the varna of a person is a product of his birth (genetics/environ=
ment) and his own self-efforts. If one understands this, then things make m=
ore sense because change of own one varna is but a fundamental process in S=
anatana Dharma. It not change of a personality, from a limited flawed being=
 to something better and flawless the aim of ALL sadhana? So by that logic,=
 anyone who is making such an effort is by default striving to be a Brahama=
na. And that means, the change of varna is an accepted idea of Sanatana Dha=
rma. Because if it were not, it would be contradicting the essence of this =
Dharma.
=A0
Often, if you think carefully, you will find that a person acts=
 like different varnas at different times based on situations. So most peop=
le are but an amalgamation of all these four, with some tendencies predomin=
ating. Again, with time and experience, a person,s tendencies too change.
=
=A0
Now it has been asked why is Aswathama and people like that not conside=
red as Sudras. Well, maybe in THAT act he was a Sudra or a Chandal? Maybe i=
n his other acts he was a Kshtriya? Maybe when he mediates he is a Brahmana=
? The problem that we face today, which the ancients never faces, was our f=
ixation with tags. As the example of Gauthama Rishi accepting Satyakama as =
a student shows, tags were defined by the person. Out here we try to define=
 a person based on a tag, which is wrong, I feel. Swami Vivekananda was not=
 a brahmin by birth. But is he a 'Brahmin' or not a 'Brahmin'? And if he is=
 not a brahmin, then there can never be any more barhmins in India. 
=A0
It=
 was the writer of Manu Smriti (some scholars=A0say his name was Brhigu, no=
t Manu, and loived around the time of or just before Pushayamitra Sangha) w=
ho advoacted a rigid "caste system". This maybe been the necessity of the t=
imes. Infact even inside the Manusmriti, there are slokas that talk of flui=
dity of the system, but I guess people ignored them for their own vested in=
terests. It is from that time onwards that the present day caste system evo=
lved and took on a rigid, horrible, flawed shape, egged on by various secti=
ons of society out of circumstantial necessities (Like Buddhism) as well as=
 plain self interest. The Manusmriti, specially with respect to the issue o=
f castes, has run out its worth. No scripture, specially rule based once, c=
an be applicable across all lengths of time. Same here.
=A0
And today you h=
ave the goverments, every party, right or left, have used the castes as a v=
ote begging tool to stay in power.=A0 All this roots in the fixation with "=
tags", which probably was non existent during the time of the Mahabharatas =
etc.
=A0
So, practically, the caste system, as it stands now=A0must end. Pe=
riod.
