Dear Guruji's,

I have recently acquired a Japa Mala (Tulsi Mala) and plan =
to start
japa on a regular basis. All the beads (54) are gray colored excep=
t
one which is bright red/orange and is included like a pendant.

I was rea=
ding one of the posts in Mid Dec about a similar topic.
But I have some eve=
n more basic questions. Apologies for raising this
topic again.

Q) What is=
 "Crossing the Meru". Reading more about this, got me
concerned - Just woul=
d like to get full practical understanding.
Please explain this in detail. =


Q) Does the Japa mala go clockwise or counter clockwise.?

Q) Usually we =
are supposed to do 108 (or multiples) japa - So in my
case after 54 should =
I turn back (reverse) the direction or reverse
the mala.

Q) Is it okay to =
wear the japa mala on a regular basis. I would rather
wear it than keep it =
down or away or get mishandled.
This japa mala spent some time at Mantralay=
a Moola Brindavanam and is
given to me by the Pontiff.

Any help/directions=
 on these questions is highly appreciated.

Thanks
Shrikanth
