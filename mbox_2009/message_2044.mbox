Dear Narasimhaji,
I am confused after reading your post. Can we not just ch=
ant the mantra in mind? Will these rules still be applicable in that case? =
Will not chanting the mantra using mouth reduce its effectiveness?
Thank yo=
u,Manish

      Namaste,



I cannot =
point to any audio that I found satisfactory.



Please buy the book "Mantr=
apushpam" by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri 

mantra with intonation ma=
rked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too..



I will point out a =
few standard mistakes I have seen people make:



(1) People normally prono=
unce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines 

below or above) correctly=
, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row. For 

example, all the thre=
e letters in "dheemahi" are without any lines below or 

above. They have t=
o be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up 

introducing some pitch v=
ariation and mispronouncing them. In veda mantras, 

pronouncing all udatta=
s in the same pitch is the most important thing. Do 

not stress any letter=
 or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string of 

udattas.



(2) T=
he last syllable of "prachodayaat" is "yaat". It is supposed to be one 

sy=
llable. When you pronounce it correctly, "t" is hardly audible. If you 

ar=
tificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it "prachodayaatu" , you =


will end up introducing an extra syllable ("tu") and mess up everything. =
A 

lot of people do not pronounce "t" correctly. Probably some guru someti=
me 

back started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words =
ending 

in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what cons=
onant he 

was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This i=
s good for 

teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant=
, end it with 

a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried=
 hard) and do NOT 

add a brief vowel after that consonant.



(3) Take "dh=
iyo yo naH". The "H" in "naH" is a visarga (written in Sanskrit 

as ":" an=
d notated in itrans as "H"). Visarga means "letting go". You are 

supposed=
 to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation 

of "na=
H" is very close to "nah" though slightly different. Again, this is 

suppo=
sed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make 

i=
t "naha". Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added to =


the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.



In this=
 style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol "H" is pronounced 

diffe=
rently in "raamaH", "hariH" and "guruH". The same symbol

"H" or ":" is pro=
nounced as "ha", "hi" and "hu" in the 3 words, respectively 

(i.e. raamaha=
, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as 

letting air go, =
without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 

words.



Watch ou=
t for these 3 common mistakes.



However, as I keep saying, the pronunciat=
ion is only a small percentage of 

it. Creating the right mental images an=
d the perfect mental focus is more 

important. If you lose awareness of yo=
ur body, successfully shut down all 

other thoughts in the mind and achiev=
e a perfect mental focus on any veda 

mantra with correct pronunciation, i=
t will be a fantastic experience. Please 

note that correct pronunciation =
is not difficult to achieve, but the other 

things I mentioned here are no=
t that easy!



Best regards,

Narasimha
