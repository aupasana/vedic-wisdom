Namaste Sundeep,
 
Though you asked a very good question, we got sidetracke=
d with other discussions at that time and I did not get a chance to respond=
 to you.
 
*        *        *
 
A computer has different parts. The mother=
 board supporting the crux of computing, any daughter cards for specific al=
gorithms, I/O controllers and I/O cables, power supply circuitry and finall=
y the mechanical parts (e.g. chassis, hard disk, USB ports etc).
 
The kosh=
as are analogous to this. Aanandamaya kosha is like a motherboard containin=
g CPU, memory etc, vijnaanamaya kosha is like a daughtercard for algorithms=
, manomaya kosha is like I/O cntrollers and I/O cables, praanamaya kosha is=
 like power supply circuitry and annamaya kosha is like the mechanical part=
s.
 
Now, a computer may be operating in many modes. It may be running full=
 blast reading a huge video file from the network, storing to an external U=
SB drive and also showing video on the screen. Or it may be running in mode=
s with several levels of power saving, with some activities limited based o=
n the power saving level. Or it may be in a power standby. Depending on the=
 power saving mode, the functionality and workload of each of the above lay=
ers may change. But, a computer in a power save mode may still be checking =
the network or USB drive or key board or mouse and using the power supply c=
ircuitry.
 
Similarly, all the koshas are performing various functions norm=
ally. They are all busy with a lot of activity. As Kundalini rises through =
chakras, the activity may come down. But various koshas continue to functio=
n, albeit at a lower (or atleast altered) level of activity.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
Koshas are a breakdown of individualized consciousness based on f=
unctionality. Different parts of individualized consciousness play differen=
t roles to keep the individualization going.
 
Chakras are realms of awaren=
ess that consciousness can be in. As consciousness rises from one realm of =
awareness to another, activities of various koshas within the respective fu=
nctionality areas comes down. The koshas are layers that work together. You=
 cannot stop one layer and then stop another. You have to slow down all lay=
ers together, but the exact mechanism and impact of slowdown changes from l=
ayer to layer. So you keep slowing them down together, in steps.
 
Best reg=
ards,
Narasimha

just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a =
solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of=
 existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular thing (e.g. a=
 car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of ea=
rth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a hou=
se, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, di=
fferent mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.

 one may think of "I" as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, =
certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form o=
ne's self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini=
 cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature =
within one's cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini ca=

 Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notion=
