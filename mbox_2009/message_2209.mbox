Dear ALL,

Namaste.

2) SPIRITUALITY: Uninterrupted faith in our fundamenta=
l existence and faith
in its omnipotent nature is that substratum which thr=
ows wide open all doors
of progress. This self belief makes his will power =
strong and in turn
inspires him to give up his limited ego =91I=92 and inst=
ead merge it into the
cosmic soul (God). If we insist only calling this ill=
usory =91I=92 pure and
powerful like God know for sure that the fetters of =
such narrow mindedness
will become unbearably painful. On the other hand wh=
en we imbibe discipline,
gentlemanliness, cleanliness, oneness of soul with=
 others, great character
and generosity in our day to day life our soul exp=
ands so as to encompass
the entire world in its very existence. The 3 fold =
endeavor of self
transformation, self advancement and self creation rule th=
e roost. Man
transcends the binding clutches of greed, avarice, desires etc=
 and instead
uses his soul potential for world welfare activities. Such sac=
red sentiments
make an individual great and thus world glory becomes a fore=
gone conclusion.
3) RELIGIOSITY: True religiosity means adhering to ones ri=
ghteous duties.
One must be devoted not only to ones family but ethics and =
social well
being. Being responsible oneself and not trespassing on the rig=
hts of others
is true religiosity. God has given every human being certain =
powers. Know
for sure that these are not meant for eat, drink and be merry =
way of life.
Instead this God given potential must be used for ones own adv=
ancement and
that of society in a befitting manner. Man=92s one and ultimat=
e goal of life
should be lading a life of ideals and principles and hence i=
n this manner
like a cog in the wheel contribute towards a radiant future o=
f this world.
The underlying goal of religiosity is certainly not to bind m=
an in the
fetters of obsolete traditions and beliefs. Instead that righteou=
s duty
should be executed by every world individual, which will help manife=
st true
well being of the entire world.
4) PROGRESSIVENESS: Today we give i=
mportance to keeping our body fit and
healthy and eking out a handsome sala=
ry. What we fail to realize is that
equal importance should be given to pur=
ifying our intellect, experience and
viewpoint. In fact true human progress=
 is synonymous with soul progress. For
this self reflection and self intros=
pection are most required. When we
deeply understand the true goal of human=
 life we slowly get weaned away from
selfish attainments and instead our ps=
yche starts thinking of world well
being and peace. The more our soul expan=
ds so as to merge into the cosmic
soul (called God by laymen) means that we=
 are marching ahead on the path of
true advancement/progress. When our soul=
 becomes expansive we start
experiencing the sacred bliss of being one with=
 other beings. It is this
sense of oneness of soul that can help world bein=
gs live united in a
peaceful manner.
