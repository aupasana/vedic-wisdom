Namaste Sudha bahen,

If you can recite in Devanagari script, then you can =
order the book from 'Gita Press' (Gorakhpur India). You can also check with=
 them if CP is available in your 'mother Tongue' (Not only translation but =
also the verses)

If that's not possible, then you can think of ordering CP=
 in English by Deva datta Kali. Name of the book is 'In Praise of The Mothe=
r'. The link to order is given below:
http://www.amazon.com/Praise-Goddess-=
Devimahatmya-Its-Meaning/dp/089254080X.

This book has all the verses of Du=
rga Saptashati given in English so that you can read. i also suggest to dow=
nload MP3 from Narasimha's site where he has himself recorded the Durga Sap=
tashati in his own voice. That will be very useful to get familiarize with =
Original Sanskrit pronunciation of all the verses.
http://www.vedicastrolog=
er.org/
Click on 'Listen to Manta' and you will get to the link of MP3.

Pl=
ease listen many times to get familiarized.

As far as homam is concerned, =
add swaha (offering Aahuti at the same time) at the end of each verse and U=
chu/Uvach. Do not forget to refer to Homam manual and follow the instructio=
ns specifically given for offering Aahutis.

I think this should be enough =
to get started.

Best of luck.

Regards,
Utpal
