since this group focuses on vedic wisdom, and have seen learned 
dsicussion=
s by Narasimha and others, thought I send this out seeking 
the right (vedi=
c) way to remediate ..

for the past few years i am remembering my past how=
 people have 
influenced me badly and made me a weaker person. by lack of g=
uidance, 
these people who are very close to me (relatives, friends) have m=
ade 
me choose wrong choices etc. i am in a mess, psychologically and 
spir=
itually. I believed in god all along, did my japam etc. why did i 
fall pre=
y to these people? 

i realize now that after many years, these people are =
ignorant. I 
wanted to say 'ignorant fools' but there are some elders invol=
ved 
here.

i can assume this as karma phala, but the past is hindering me.=
 there 
is so much pent up anger, that i want to go back and kick these 
pe=
ople who have mis guided me.

how do I forigve these people and forget? eve=
n gita, or homam etc are 
not any reprive. the soul is frustrated ... what =
does god get out of 
this drama?

any thoughts, wise men and women?
