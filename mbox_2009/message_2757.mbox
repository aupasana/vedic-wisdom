Namaskar list members,

   This is a SELF-REFERENTIAL MAI=
L.

1. It is NOT addressed to any person on this list.

2. Self-Assertion

=
   "Anyone replying to it could only be a JNANI, in the sense of the term J=
NANI is being used inside of this mail."

3. It has been a few days that I =
have joined this list.

4. The impression after limited interaction with th=
e list members and reading their mails to which I have not replied:


     =
  KNOWLEDGE-DEPRIVED NON-JNANIS are "SCAPEGOATS"
               in the hand=
s of a handful of 
                  SELF-INDULGENT JNANIS
          where-=
ever they are to be found together.


5.  From time to time, I will sample =
mails on this list.
    I won't be mailing on this list except under except=
ional cases, 
    or to post an internet based article link.

6.  Await the=
 replies, and you all will know who all are the designated JNANIS of this l=
ist, while the rest are KNOWLEDGE-DEPRIVED NON-JNANIS.

7.  Thanks for Your=
 Time.

Regards,
Nitish
