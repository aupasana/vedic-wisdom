In my personal experience the day you are born counts. For eg: 
If you are =
born on Monday Shiva god helps you, Tuesday Ganesha or Vishnu and so on=A0.=
 I am born on Friday I have seen my prayers give result when I pray Lakshmi=
 or Durga goddess. My sister is born on tuesday and praying Ganesha god has=
 helped her. Hope this helps !

 knowledge is to follow your posts...

there is no direct guidance to follo=
w a specific way for me...i am assuming what is happening to me is to be ha=
ppened! its may be pre-programmed for my life cycle...as i am searching my =
ISHTA DEVATA, nobody helping me to find him/her out...this is the least nec=
essities for atleast a direct answer...
