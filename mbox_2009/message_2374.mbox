Namaste:

This thread brought back a memory from my childhood,
which I had=
 forgotten for so many years.

I recollect a very personal incident from my=
 own life
in this regard. When I was a young boy, I used to read many books=

such as Yogananda, etc. One day, I found a very old print of 
Swami Viveka=
nanda's collected works at a paper recyling shop.
With great interest I sta=
rted reading the pages, till I came upon
a passage where Swamiji tackles Lo=
rd Krishna's historicity.
I managed to find this passage once again now, af=
ter many years, just because  I  still remember some of his words very clea=
rly.  

Needless to say, a multitude of conflicts arose in my young impress=
ionable mind, as one great personality of India seemed to doubt Lord Krishn=
a's existence itself and I was not mature enough to deal with this conflict=
 at that time.

Perhaps being a realized seer doesn't necessarily imply  ha=
ving excellent grasp of material facts or analysis, something that we overl=
ook easily at times. Note for instance in the below paragraph, how Sri Vive=
kananda, ever the rationalist, calls milk-ocean , curd-ocean, as fantastic =
creations of the brain. Perhaps they are creations of the brain, or they pe=
rhaps are veiled pointers to some planes of existence, since the puranas an=
d vedas mostly talk in
covered terms.


Swamy Vivekananda on Lord Krishna f=
rom: Complete Works, Volume 4.
  "
Then as to the second point in question,=
 much doubt exists about the personality of Krishna. In one place in the Ch=
h=E2ndogya Upanishad we find mention of Krishna, the son of Devaki, who rec=
eived spiritual instructions from one Ghora, a Yogi. In the Mahabharata, Kr=
ishna is the king of Dw=E2rak=E2; and in the Vishnu Pur=E2na we find a desc=
ription of Krishna playing with the Gopis. Again, in the Bh=E2gavata, the a=
ccount of his R=E2salil=E2 is detailed at length. In very ancient times in =
our country there was in vogue an Utsava called Madanotsava (celebration in=
 honour of Cupid). That very thing was transformed into Dola and thrust upo=
n the shoulders of Krishna. Who can be so bold as to assert that the Rasali=
la and other things connected with him were not similarly fastened upon him=
? In ancient times there was very little tendency in our country to find ou=
t truths by historical research. So any one could say what he thought best =
without substantiating it with proper facts and evidence. Another thing: in=
 those ancient times there was very little hankering after name and fame in=
 men. So it often happened that one man composed a book and made it pass cu=
rrent in the name of his Guru or of someone else. In such cases it is very =
hazardous for the investigator of historical facts to get at the truth. In =
ancient times they had no knowledge whatever of geography; imagination ran =
riot. And so we meet with such fantastic creations of the brain as sweet-oc=
ean, milk-ocean, clarified-butter-ocean, curd-ocean, etc! In the Puranas, w=
e find one living ten thousand years, another a hundred thousand years! But=
 the Vedas say, ????????? ?????? =97 "Man lives a hundred years." Whom shal=
l we follow here? So, to reach a correct conclusion in the case of Krishna =
is well-nigh impossible.


It is human nature to build round the real chara=
cter of a great man all sorts of imaginary superhuman attributes. As regard=
s Krishna the same must have happened, but it seems quite probable that he =
was a king. Quite probable I say, because in ancient times in our country i=
t was chiefly the kings who exerted themselves most in the preaching of Bra=
hma-Jn=E2na. Another point to be especially noted here is that whoever migh=
t have been the author of the Gita, we find its teachings the same as those=
 in the whole of the Mahabharata. From this we can safely infer that in the=
 age of the Mahabharata some great man arose and preached the Brahma-Jn=E2n=
a in this new garb to the then existing society. Another fact comes to the =
fore that in the olden days, as one sect after another arose, there also ca=
me into existence and use among them one new scripture or another. It happe=
ned, too, that in the lapse of time both the sect and its scripture died ou=
t, or the sect ceased to exist but its scripture remained. Similarly, it wa=
s quite probable that the Gita was the scripture of such a sect which had e=
mbodied its high and noble ideas in this sacred book.
