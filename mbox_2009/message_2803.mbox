Namaste,
=A0

In the Vedas we often find that the word Asura is used as=
 an adjective for the Devas, whereas during the Puranic times, Asura is cle=
arly evil. How did the transition of the word come about? What does the Ved=
ic word Asura really mean?

Excellent Article and may I add what a beautiful picture. Please send
u=
s more !

A couple of points:

1. The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bal=
i allowed for them also
signify how the lord will dissolve the maya and tak=
es control of our
bodies and life. With the first step the lord took contro=
l over the
Bhuva Loka (association with body and material aspects) and with=
 the
second step he took control over the higher lokas (indriyas) and final=
ly
the last step was left and only place left was Balis head (ahamkara)
whi=
ch was dissolved as well.

If you allow God to be part of your life then he=
 will work in mystical
ways and take care of the illusion of your body, sen=
ses, and finally
your ego

2. The story cannot be complete without the role=
 played by Shukracharya
or the guru of the Asuras. He knew that Sri Vamana =
was no other than
Sri Vishnu and warned Bali but the latter out of pride an=
d duty still
gave his word (there was still some goodness in Bali, maybe a =
small
piece). To seal the deal water was to be put out of the kamandalu of
=
Sri Vamana onto the hands of Bali. Shukracharya shrinks to a small size
and=
 tries to block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana
takes a=
 straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye. The
guru of the As=
uras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).

As the devata tries to en=
ter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element
will play all kinds of tricks =
and block the path. A straw
(representing qualities of Surya or the scriptu=
res) accompanied by an
able Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.

Regards
