Dear Razen,

Since homam is important for spiritual progress, choosing a mu=
hurtha 
that is conducive for spiritual progress would be advisable. How ev=
er, 
since you have started it, do not think much about muhurtha.

Normally=
, for spiritual sadhana, Full moon day and no moon days are 
good.

All the=
 best and good luck.

Best regards,
Vijay
