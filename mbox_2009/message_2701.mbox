Dear Nitish,
=C2=A0
Allow me interject in your conversation with Narasimha.=

=C2=A0
You mentioned:
=C2=A0
Thus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lo=
west Mooladhara and the awakening of one of them affects the other, a fact =
rather well-documented in Yoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ga=
nesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipped first.
=C2=A0
Can you please elabo=
rate on what you mean by the terms "awakening" and "affects"? Let us be tec=
hnically precise and not use terms loosely to avoid confusion. What is the =
"awakening" of a chakra? What does it mean by "affecting"?
=C2=A0
The diagr=
ams, not just by Lahiri Mahasaya but even other books, explain the connecti=
on of the nadis etc, but no where in his description of spiritual progess (=
from the 26 dairies of Lahiri Mahasaya) does he say that awakening of the a=
gya chakra will automatically awaken the mooladhara. If you can provide an =
exact quote with page number and name of the book, I will try and check. 
=
=C2=A0
He explains in details about the "granthi bhedans" before one goes i=
nto actually awakening=C2=A0 any chakra for that matter. These granthis hav=
e a specific format in which they have to be pierced as per Lahiri Mahasaya=
 and it is here that a connection is drawn between Agya and Mooladhara with=
 Manipura in the centre. Not in the actual act of "awakening a chakra", if =
I use the same definitions as used in=C2=A0 the book by Lahiri Mahasaya him=
self.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Gunas, by inherent duality in nature, give rise to the =
6 tattwas, that is as simple. Now, the spiritual law of duality is very wel=
l described by the two birds analogy, as well as the 3 gunas are very well =
mentioned in the upanishads. Isn't it ?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Can you quote a scrip=
ture which says there are 6 tattwas? Tattwa has a very specific technical m=
eaning. When you say that Gunas by "inherent duality" in nature give rise t=
o 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x 2 and arr=
iving at six. My question, then why not a simple 3 raised to the power 2 re=
sulting in 9 tattwas?
=C2=A0
No, this is not really a case of basic maths I=
 presume. The scriptures are clear that there are exactly 5 tattwas, not mo=
re. Chitta is not a tattwa. 
=C2=A0
Thus, all our experiences of matter are=
 through non-material Chitta, and it doesn't imply that 6th tattwa doesn't =
exist. 
=C2=A0
No one denies the existence of Chitta, but the scriptures do=
 not bracket it as a "tattwa". 
=C2=A0
The tattwas are 5 in number as per m=
ultiple Hindu scriptures, both Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.
=C2=A0=

Dear Narasimha,
3 Gunas, by inherent duality in nature, give ri=

What do you =
mean by last 5 stages ? Where is the beginning and the end of the sushumna =
passing through 6 cerebro-spinal chakras ?

In the physical body, it appear=
s as a linear movement from the lowest mooladhara to the highest ajna chakr=
a - but the nadis' emanating from these "Shad-chakras" - meet in a circular=
 manner inside the Sahasrara Chakra (See the diagram of Astral Nadis' prepa=
red by YogiRaj ShyamaCharan Lahiri, published in Gita Commentary by Yoganan=
da).

Thus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lowest Mooladhara and the =
awakening of one of them affects the other, a fact rather well-documented i=
n Yoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhar=
a, is worshipped first.

> In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consci=
ousness (Brahman or >Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any objectificat=

normally.

With every invocation of Gayatri Mantra, we mention 3 or 7 of th=
ese lokas. Don't we do it "Normally" ? 

In any case, we are not discussing=
 about the actual experiences or undifferentiated consciousness, the 6 tatt=
was that cause creation are still very much differentiated in Nature.

Pata=
njalis' Chitta Vrittis' correspond to the 5 tattwas and are all happening o=
n the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tattwa. The normal-human-=
 experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (finest crea=
tion).

How would the Soul become aware of the more material Aakash Tattwa =
(and thus a single coherent self pervading the material physical body), if =
it were not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?

Thus, all our experi=
ences of matter are through non-material Chitta, and it doesn't imply that =
6th tattwa doesn't exist. If you could calm all those modifications of Chit=
ta, you would have your self-realized.

Nothing comes out from nothing. How can the lower tattwas evo=
lve from higher tattwas, if even their subtle representations are purged fr=
om existence altogether ?

Greatest of the Seers have already put down the =
scriptures in writing, so that people like us can benefit.

<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>Allow me interject in your conversation with Narasimha.</DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>You mentioned:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>Thus, the highe=
st Ajna is connected to the lowest Mooladhara and the <U>awakening of one o=
f them affects the other</U>, a fact rather well-documented in Yoga books. =
A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipp=
ed first.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>Can you please elabora=
te on what you mean by the terms "awakening" and "affects"? Let us be techn=
ically precise and not use terms loosely to avoid confusion. What is the "a=
wakening" of a chakra? What does it mean by "affecting"?</DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV>The diagrams, not just by Lahiri Mahasaya but even other books, =
explain the connection of the nadis etc, but no where in his description of=
 spiritual progess (from the 26 dairies of Lahiri Mahasaya) does he say tha=
t awakening of the agya chakra will automatically awaken the mooladhara. If=
 you can provide an exact quote with page number and name of the book, I wi=
ll try and check. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>He explains in details abou=
t the "granthi bhedans" before one goes into actually <EM>awakening</EM>&nb=
sp; any chakra for that matter. These granthis have a specific format in wh=
ich they have to be pierced <EM>as per Lahiri Mahasaya</EM> and it is here =
that a connection is drawn between Agya and Mooladhara with Manipura in the=
 centre. Not in the actual act of "awakening a chakra", if I use the same d=
efinitions as used in  the book by Lahiri Mahasaya himself.</DIV>

<DI=
V><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>Can you quote a scr=
ipture which says there are 6 tattwas? Tattwa has a very specific technical=
 meaning. When you say that Gunas by "inherent duality" in nature give rise=
 to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x 2 and a=
rriving at six. My question, then why not a simple 3 raised to the power 2 =
resulting in 9 tattwas?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>No, this is not really=
 a case of basic maths I presume. The scriptures are clear that there are e=
xactly 5 tattwas, not more. Chitta is not a tattwa. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV><EM>Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-material Chi=
tta, and it doesn't imply that 6th tattwa doesn't exist.</EM> </DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>No one denies the existence of Chitta, but the scriptures =
do not bracket it as a "tattwa". </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The tattwas =
are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scriptures, both Agamas/Nigamas as we=

t is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality=

 I get the thrust of your point. Yes, sadhana is the only way to know this =
for sure. And so also for everything else that is below the reach of the se=
nses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do read about them (all these=
 things e.g Atma etc), and about the significance of the vedic gods anyway,=
 dont we? They do offer a mild complement to sadhana, dont they? They do he=

 benefits of sadhana..<BR>> &=

 With all due respect to your query, I w=
