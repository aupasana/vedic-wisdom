Namaste Rajarshi,

>at that point of time Lord Rama was unaware of his divi=
ne nature at >that time and acted in the mould of any other human being.

I=
f you go through Yoga Vaasishtha, in the concluding part it is mentioned th=
at Raama went in to Samadhi and Vasishtha Rishi then declares in front of t=
he whole gathering that he is the Incarnation of all pervading Vishnu.

I u=
nderstand fully when Narasimha says that Rama realised his true nature late=
r (During Vasishtha's discourse) and not from the birth. but once he realis=
ed, then he realised. i fail to appreciate your argument that he forgotten =
his true nature during some course of events and acted against dharma or Ma=
ryaada. Bali's episode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama's Maryaada a=
nd conduct is questioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event, =
Sita's Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita Mata etc...

But i strongly feel tha=
t there will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and even=
ts are just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions. =
however people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above even=
ts for which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali's killing, i=
 may say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way he=
 was killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against Dh=
arma towards his brother. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on=
 himself in the later life during Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use =
of all these arguments? I have seen that (from my experience in Astrology a=
s well as other areas) they never end.

you said "we conclude that at that =
point of time Lord Rama was unaware of his divine nature at that time". i a=
m sorry Rajarshi, but i am sure we can never conclude especially in case of=
 Realised souls and when they are incarnations of Lord Vishnu.

plese corre=
ct me if my understanding is wrong.

Belated Happy birthday.

Warm Regards,=


Utpal

 with Lord Rama. The way he killed Bali. That indicates that the means is b=

can be explained if we conclude that at that point of time Lord Rama was un=

ciate your explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama was capab=
le of manipulating realm of Maya (Miracle worker) like Lord Krishna BUT the=
 role assumed by him in that incarnation was of that 'Maryaada Purshottam' =
and that is why he demonstrated 'Maryaada' in every aspect of life.he abide=
