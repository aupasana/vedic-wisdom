Namaste to all,

1)Can somebody tell me how to choose some form of ganpati =
for mahaganpati homam.There are already so many forms of Ganesh,so how to c=
hooose some form if i do not have any idea. Vimalanda in 2nd part says that=
 in the begining we need to create deity with the help of our astral deity,=
 so for that i think i need to know the proper roop for the homam.

2)if so=
mebody could please explain what are these astral,subtle body & kaaran,stho=
ol sharir, they are used a lot.

3)If in the beginning we see the deity fro=
m our very own astral body, then how is this experience different from hall=
ucination, because we are not experiencing any which is something special. =
We are seeing which we are constantly forcing upon our mind.Had the deity b=
een somewhere outside only then we were achieving something. Please clear m=
y doubts on this. i hope my question is clear.

Regards 
Jitender
