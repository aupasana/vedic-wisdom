Namaste all, 

Could you kindly help with this word in the famous Shri Vish=
nu Shlokam:
"Shaantakaram Bhujaga Shayanam...Vande Vishnu Bhava Bhaya Haram=
/Haranam?(..)". 
I have heard people saying both versions and I am confused=
 as to which Sanskrit word is the correct one as I am not well-versed in Sa=
nskrit. 

Please help me to clear my confusion.
Thank you.
Somanathan
