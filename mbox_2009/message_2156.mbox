Thanks for the reply. Somehow i feel that self conci=
ous always tries to tell us what is right and what is wrong.. i have experi=
enced it many times.. but as you have pointed out i supressed the voice of =
my conscious.. with my ignorance or may be deliberate attempt to do so to f=
ulfill my desire or may be my ego..
=A0
But sir, How one can live without a=
ny=A0desire and without any ego? 
=A0
I would admit this fact that yes.. I =
have desire to become famous writer. I have desire to become rich.. i want =
to see myself on top.. is it wrong to have such desires? 
=A0
I know that=
=A0sadhna is the only=A0solution of all my problems.. Sadhna will only brin=
g clarity to my mind.. but=A0these desires=A0are so strong in my mind.. tha=
t=A0it is becoming an obstables in surrendering myself during sadhna.. Hone=
stly i cannot supress this desires.. i cannot think of living life without =
these desires.. Perhaps this desires has become driving forces of my life n=
ow..
=A0
Many times i have felt that my doing ganpati homam is just a mecha=
nical=A0one..but still i do it.. i continue doing it.. if for lack of time =
i cannot perform.. i do MANASIK HOMAM.. just reading it.. but i do it with =
a hope that one day i will be able to feel divine..I am trying =A0to improv=
e the quality of doing homam by correct pronounciation.. I also know that t=
his is the only correct path where i am suppose to go..
=A0
In nutshell, I=
=A0know my problems and perhaps i know its solutions too..=A0=A0but still i=
 am in trouble.. why? Is it because of Previous karmas and rinas? Or is it =
because of my immaturity or =A0AGNANTA ( lack of right knowledge) ?=A0=A0Wh=
at=A0am=A0I=A0lacking and why?
=A0
I know i am encroaching upon your valuab=
