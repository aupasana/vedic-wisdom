|| OM TAT SAT ||
Namaskar Rajarshi,

Like all of us, you hav=
e picked up some pointers about the nature of things which is all the knowl=
edge available to you, but what you want to know is the complete picture. A=
s a rule of thumb, if one begins his study from a biased point of view, he =
will never have the complete picture, even if he is given all the relevant =
pointers.
:) :) I could not have agreed more.


Why do you think I would pa=
int the complete picture, somebody has already painted it time and again in=
 scriptures, but you seem to fail to read it ? 
=C2=A0
That is what I am sa=
ying, and your picture is not matching the one that has been already painte=
d! Therefore, the queries.

> If you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, o=
f which 5 are basic. 
> And the rest are subtle. So when normal creation is=
 spoken of, it 
> is spoken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. 

Despite=
 all the knowledge that you have - it is evident that you have not studied =
Sankhya thoroughly.
6 x 4 =3D 24
It actually refers to 6 tattwas - Where ar=
e the 4 antahkaranas' coming from NaraSimha - and why are they called Antah=
Karanas' at all ? Are your doubts over that Sankhya mentions about the 6th =
tattwa ?
=C2=A0

No, this increases some more questions. Firstly, some of t=
he interpretations of the Samkhya philosophy mention 3 antakaranas, some me=
ntion 4 and some mention 5 (taking Purusha also as one). Why should I stick=
 to 4?
=C2=A0
Secondly, if it is 4, why 4 x 6? What is the logic behoind it=
? No where in any Samkhya text does it mention that these antakaranas manif=
est as 6 tattwas. So, unless you can provide actual, factual quotes, I shal=
l take it that you are merely playing number games with no real basis.
=C2=
=A0


Given the amount of discord and contradictions amongst the scriptural=
 interpretations and authorities, Badrayana had to write "Brahma Sutras".

=
If you are discerning enough and re-read all the scriptures you have ever r=
ead, you will most certainly figure out that every scripture has mentioned =
about the 6th tattwa everywhere. All we need is to rise above the dogma pro=
pounded by a lot of people around us who have selfish motives, and keep wor=
king in the correct direction.

I am sorry, but I don't value=C2=A0personal=
 opinions too much in a scholarly debate. I need facts. Or else, I shall ta=
ke it as=C2=A0just some fanciful opinions with litte or no value.
=C2=A0

V=
ivekananda, mentioned it, but had not coined the term "superether" for this=
 6th tattwa, while Yogananda was not a Jnana Yogi - but I take his word as =
scriptural authority given his level of self-realization.
=C2=A0
Too vague.=
 In the analysis of Samkhya by Lahiri Mahasaya he never mentions Chitta as =
a sixth tattwa ever. I take his word as higher than Yoganandas, if it comes=
 down to X's word vs Y's word. 
=C2=A0
Let me clarify, if you feel happy in=
 believing in a 6th tattwa, feel free to do so, but if you expect=C2=A0othe=
rs like me to believe in a 6th tattwa, you need more facts on your side. 

=

> When you say that Gunas by "inherent duality" in nature give rise 
> to =
6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x > 2 and arr=
iving at six.

Also, what is so wrong with a simple multiplication where mu=
ltiplication is required ? Do you know what is "Law of Duality" ?
=C2=A0
Wh=
at is so wrong with addding, substraction, divsion, sqaure root, exponentia=
l, log 2 with base 3, etc etc? 
=C2=A0
As I said, you need more facts to su=
pport your statement, or else they remain merely as personal opinions. 
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0




BTW, don't really want to go into kriya yoga of lahiri mahas=
haya, because it is better learnt from a teacher than discussed.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
All aspects of real spirituality are better learnt from a teacher but y=
et discussion happen. I see no harm in it.


> "....Ajna and mooladhara cha=
kras are closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the othe=
r.

What is any other possible meaning of this line than that the two chakr=
as awaken each other and are related ?
=C2=A0
Sure, and that will depend on=
 how you define the word awakening which I had asked you to right at the be=
ginning. Here awakening could well be a euphemism for merely symptomatic pa=
rtial activation and nothing more. 


Ganesha is worshipped first because m=
ooladhara is connected with Ajna chakra and the breathing process involves =
these two chakras
(HaM-SaH). The breath connection makes it the most suitab=
le place to connect the highest and lowest expressions of God-consciousness=
, from brahma to a worm - every living creature breathes! 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0I see that you have merely given what you consider your understanding=
, in which case I have no further points to make except rejecting your unde=
rstanding. After all everyone is free to believe in what he/she thinks is c=
orrect. No issues with that. I firmly disagree to the explanation give by y=
ou regarding Ganesha. The scriptures state otherwise.

, but the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta i=
s a 6th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and "a fine=

 is not intellectually aware of the basic=C3=82=C2=A0idea of five creative =
elements. Otherwise, the "super-ether" needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti?=
 It is Chitta? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he =
calling it a vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas bey=

quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar=

his Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understa=
nding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaad=
haara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini le=
aves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces=
 of earth element are effaced in one's self-awareness. When Kundalini leave=
s Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces=
 of water element are effaced in one's self-awareness. And so on.

physical water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water e=
lement shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea =
that one "owns" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowl=
edge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that one "ne=
eds" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) i=
s of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas=
 can be mapped to the five elements.

 Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are =
often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (=
which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini =
actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not=
 perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Simil=
arly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one's c=
umulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level o=
f existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one's notio=
n of self ("I"), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.

 came the "vidhyut" of Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted with the chaos, i=

If you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the r=

 right upto the state of God, then we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your=

 The diagrams, not just by Lahiri Mahasaya but even other books, explain th=
