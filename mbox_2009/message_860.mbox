Namaste,
 
I forgot to add: It is not necessary to read loud in homam. Even=
 if you read almost mentally with a very small sound, that is fine. If voca=
l cords are vibrating with mantra, that is enough.

  Namaste,

  It hardly mat=
ters how people address me.

  A very short bare-bones Chandi homam can be =
done in one hour, if one does only 13 chapters and a small count of the Cha=
ndu moola mantra and one is proficient in reading saptashati. If one is not=
 fluent in the text, even bare-bones Chandi homam can take 1.5-2 hours. As =
things like kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, devi sooktam, parivaa=
ra devata aahutis etc are added on, it can go upto 3-3.5 hours for one not =
very fluent in the main saptashati text.

  If you can read saptashati in o=
ne hour, a bare-bones Chandi homam can be done in 1 hour 15 min.

  Best re=
gards,
  Narasimha

          Dear Utpalji,
          You have taken initiation from Narsimhaji=
 and you have really gained the knowledge. Your answers are also convincing=
 and you are also explaining elaborately. Can I ask one question? Why you a=
re addressing Narsimhaji as Garu instead of Guruji? 
          How much tim=
e is consumed to perform daily Chandi Homam? In simple chanting of only 13 =
chapters I take complete one hour.I am chanting mentally only. But if I do =
Homam, I think mentally it is not possible. Isn't it? Homam is to be done b=
y uttering loudly only, I think. What do you say?

      Dear Dhiraj Bhai,

            following are answers for most of your=
 questions to the best of my 
            expereince of Chandi Homam. these=
 are for 'One time' Chandi Homam 
            only.

            1) 1 kg Dr=
y Coconut Halves are sufficient. You can break each 
            coconut Ha=
lf with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.

            2) A very =
small bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is 
            sufficie=
nt as 'Ghee Aahutis' are to be given as only a single drop 
            whe=
never it is mentioned in the Manual.

            3) When Ghee Aahutis are =
specifically not mentioned, one can offer 
            Aaahutis of Mamara (=
Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya 
            etc... Now one=
 can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for 
            offering a=
s aahuti or can use single stuff.

            to elaborate, at each Swaha,=
 one can take One Kishmis or Few Mamara 
            or one almond or one c=
ahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer to Agni.

            If you have Havan S=
aamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuff 
            which can be o=
ffer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as 
            Aahuti s=
ame as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take 
            very=
 little 'Havan samgri powder and offer it.

            Thus one person can=
 easily perform homam as explained above because 
            firstly, one =
doesn't need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff 
            simultane=
ously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done with 
            left =
fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.

            2 kg of Havan Sa=
amagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms 
            will be suffi=
cient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..

            4) The Ho=
ma Fire represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. 
            hence =
it is suggested that Aahutis are only offered by You alone 
            whi=
le mother and others can sit beside you and concentrate. they 
            =
will gain lot of spiritual benefit just by attending.

            5) Woode=
n Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one can 
            als=
o be used.

            6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who=
 offer ghee 
            aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i th=
ink i've also seen 
            that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during =
Navaraatri. I suppose it 
            also must be one of the right ways. h=
owever i have complete faith in 
            what Narasimha has given in Ma=
nual and that also must be the other 
            right way of many ways. a=
lthough you can choose between the above 
            two, i recommend to g=
o as per the Manual if you are going to do as 
            per the manual g=
iven by him.

            Lastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself wi=
th much 
            technicalities and burden of perfection. in the first =
few runs, 
            there are many things during Havan which can go impe=
refct. do as per 
            manual and enjoy you Homam with your mother &=
 others and offcourse 
            with the mother of universe !!!

       =
     I hope, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.

            Warm Regard=
s,

>Dear Dhiraj Bhai,<BR><BR>following are answers for most of your 
         =
   questions to the best of my <BR>expereince of Chandi Homam. these 
     =
       are for 'One time' Chandi Homam <BR>only.<BR><BR>1) 1 kg Dry Coconut=
 
            Halves are sufficient. You can break each <BR>coconut Half wi=
th your 
            both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.<BR><BR>2) A ver=
y small bowl 
            of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is <BR>su=
fficient as 'Ghee 
            Aahutis' are to be given as only a single dr=
op <BR>whenever it is 
            mentioned in the Manual.<BR><BR>3) When =
Ghee Aahutis are 
            specifically not mentioned, one can offer <BR=
>Aaahutis of Mamara 
            (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, D=
aadiya <BR>etc... Now one 
            can choose each of the above stuffs =
one by one for <BR>offering as 
            aahuti or can use single stuff.=
<BR><BR>to elaborate, at each Swaha, 
            one can take One Kishmis =
or Few Mamara <BR>or one almond or one 
            cahsenut, or few Daadiy=
a and offer to Agni.<BR><BR>If you have Havan 
            Saamagri (I supp=
ose it is mixuture of some stuff <BR>which can be 
            offer in to =
Homa fire), then it can also be offered as <BR>Aahuti 
            same as =
like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take <BR>very 
            li=
ttle 'Havan samgri powder and offer it.<BR><BR>Thus one person can 
       =
     easily perform homam as explained above because <BR>firstly, one 
    =
        doesn't need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff 
            <=
BR>simultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done 
          =
  with <BR>left fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.<BR><BR>2 
   =
         kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms 
  =
          <BR>will be sufficient if you use along with along with Kurmura 
=
            etc..<BR><BR>4) The Homa Fire represents Bhootagni of the perso=
n 
            doing Homam. <BR>hence it is suggested that Aahutis are only=
 offered 
            by You alone <BR>while mother and others can sit besi=
de you and 
            concentrate. they <BR>will gain lot of spiritual be=
nefit just by 
            attending.<BR><BR>5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but i=
n the absence of 
            that copper one can <BR>also be used.<BR><BR>=
6) I have not much idea 
            about the way of priest who offer ghee=
 <BR>aahuti in Homa Agni as 
            well as in water bowl. i think i'v=
e also seen <BR>that during Chandi 
            Homam of Ashtami during Nav=
araatri. I suppose it <BR>also must be 
            one of the right ways. =
however i have complete faith in <BR>what 
            Narasimha has given =
in Manual and that also must be the other 
            <BR>right way of man=
y ways. although you can choose between the 
            above <BR>two, i r=
ecommend to go as per the Manual if you are going 
            to do as <BR=
>per the manual given by him.<BR><BR>Lastly, i would 
            suggest n=
ot to bother yourself with much <BR>technicalities and 
            burden =
of perfection. in the first few runs, <BR>there are many 
            thing=
s during Havan which can go imperefct. do as per <BR>manual and 
          =
  enjoy you Homam with your mother & others and offcourse <BR>with 
   =
         the mother of universe !!!<BR><BR>I hope, i gave you the answers -=
