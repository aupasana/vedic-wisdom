Namaste

In the Chandi homa manual, the one line mantra for parivara debata=
 ahuti is mentioned as:

om yoginy=E4dibhya=F9 ca=EB=F2ik=E4 pariv=E4ra dev=
at=E4bhyo nama=F9 sv=E4h=E4|

Whatd does the word yoginy=E4dibhya=F9 and de=
vatbhyo mean?


In the Shiva homa manual that one line is mentioned as foll=
ows:

om sad=E4=E7iva pariv=E4ra devat=E4bhya=F9 sv=E4h=E4| sad=E4=E7iva pa=
riv=E4ra devat=E4bhya ida=E0 na mama||

What is the difference in the meani=
ng and relevance of usage of the two mantras for parivar devata ahuti for C=
handi homa and Shiva homa?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
