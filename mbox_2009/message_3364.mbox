Namaste,
=C2=A0
I understand the example given in that superb mail, yet som=
e confusion exist (in my understanding).
=C2=A0
See, Sri Ramakrishna, when =
he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said he cannot describe it in words l=
ike the salt doll example provided by Hari. 
=C2=A0
> After all, Rigveda sa=
ys "ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti", which means

 learned call differently". 
=C2=A0
True. Now I see this line in different =
ways - 1) As different saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to ac=
hieve God. 2) Secondly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call=
 it differently.
=C2=A0
From=C2=A0from the diamond analogy I understand tha=
t if=C2=A0X reaches a certain face of the diamond and Y reaches another fac=
e of the diamond, they percieve it differently, thought both faces are the =
same diamond, just different aspects. This is OK. This can be equal to savi=
kalpa samadhi and may be experienced differently depending upon the individ=
ual.
=C2=A0
Now
=C2=A0
> As you break through any face of the diamond

 jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces=C2=

=C2=A0
1) Thi=
s seems logical and is also the main cause of my confusion. When=C2=A0we sa=
y that we enter the middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then ho=
w can it=C2=A0be experienced differently by different people? Shouldn't it =
be=C2=A0 the same? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as yo=
ur entry point, the middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly simi=
lar. Please correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2=A0=C2=A0And ye=
t these three spiritual gaints have spoken differently of their realization=
s. If duality itself does not exist, then how can the field of possiblity a=
t all arise? Which means, how can there be a difference in the "perception"=
 of the same One final Truth?
=C2=A0
2) Not to mention the query about whet=
her, that which is transcendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of =
the diamond),=C2=A0can=C2=A0at all be=C2=A0described from within the field =
of duality? Then I wonder why these three people - saints of highest order =
- try to describe it when all descriptions are from within duality...
=C2=
=A0
Considering the above, I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of why R=
amakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I also wond=
er whether=C2=A0the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and L=
ord Buddha were speaking from teh same realization of=C2=A0the One/Truth, o=
r was it different kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possibl=
e that there are different intermediate or not properly documented stages o=
f samadhi apart from the standard=C2=A0savikalpa/nirvikalpa/sajaha?
=C2=A0
=
PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not mention a void per se, he pr=
obably mentioned that there is nothing - for lack of any better words -=C2=
=A0and stopped further discussion. Over years his words could have=C2=A0got=
 corrupted to some degree and people mistook it to mean Buddha was saying t=
here is a void.

hi,

The bright star in the sky analogy that Narasimha posted (http://group=

F=

Sri Aurobindo's and Sri =
Ramana Maharishi's versions seems to be covered in the third and fourth sen=
tences. No objects or attributes may be equivalent to void as in Buddha's v=
ersion.
