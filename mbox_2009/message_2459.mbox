Namaste Smt Sudha/Naaraayana -

Gayatri Parivar does many samuhik homa and =
agnihotra in US. We also give
away Homa kundas. There is mango wooden stick=
s typically available in indian
stores that are smoke free. We also would h=
ave inverted pyramid shape small
copper agnohotra kunda. I also learnt in N=
J a source , who sells organic
pure cow dung tablets for homa.

If you need=
 more info contact a GP member closeby your location .
www.awgp.us. Let me =
know if I can be of any help in getting you started oing
homas.

Thanks,

S=
ubbu
