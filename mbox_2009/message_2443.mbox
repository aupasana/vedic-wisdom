First I started homam when I was in US inside the house.

How ever, after m=
oving back to India, to my current house, which had a terrace for myself, I=
 felt like doing homam in the morning in the open.

First day was fantastic=
, and with out problem. How ever, over the next few days, the wind was blow=
ing heavily and I could not keep the fire on for more than few seconds.

Fo=
ol of me, I got upset and was cursing the air god. How ever, with some pers=
istant, I got better. Here are my learnings:

1. Initially, while praying t=
o Ganesh before you start the fire, request him to avoid any blockings

2. =
Keep 3 dry coconus pieces instead of 2.

3. Put a slightly bigger piece of =
camphor, and surrouse it with 2 pieces of dry coconus (put vertically and n=
ot flat). This way, they block the air flow onto camphor.

4. Leave a small=
 gap on to your side, and ensure that the third peice is not wide and inser=
t into this gap. If this peice is wider, you will have to leave more gap an=
d air will blow easily through the gap.

5. Fire the camphor and be prepare=
d to use your palms to block any air putting the fire off. Initially, there=
 will be heavy smoke as the inside portion of verticle peices (which is whi=
te) will burn. Sooner, the outer side of the peices will catch fire and the=
n you can relax and remove your hands.

6. Keep few more pieces of coconus =
peices ready. Also have ghee ready for liveral use. Beyond this, even a str=
ong wind is likely to spare the fire.

7. Even after this if the fire goes =
off, don't get upset. It is not a bad omen and simply start the fire again =
and continue from where you were. Feeling urge to start all over again will=
 eventually get you frustated.

Best regards,
Vijay
