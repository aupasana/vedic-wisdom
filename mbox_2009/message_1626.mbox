Namaste Ajitji

I do not agree to this analysis of the incident. Here is=
 my view of it.
=A0
In
olden days, women married young, and did not ask que=
stions such as
"Who are you? What is your gotra?" to their husband. (In som=
e areas,
this is still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated=

during various samskara's, she would naturally remember it. The
conclusion=
 here is that her husband, whom she served with devotion,
died young.
=A0
=
=A0
Even today a traditional marriage cannot happen without knowing a perso=
n's gotra, so why assume that a woman married in the vedic times would not =
know her husband's gotra, irrespective of whether he dies young or old, or=
=A0whoever busy she may have been?=A0On the contrary, it could be more easi=
ly explained if it is assumed that the child was born outside of marriage. =

=A0
The seers were tri-kAla-darshi- s. 
=A0
Very true. So chances are Rish=
i Gautama already knew that the boy was a brahmin. But, he still=A0went thr=
ough this whole procedure. Why? Maybe to set an example for future generato=
ins that Brahmana is equally by action and not just by birth? That a person=
 of supposeldy unknown birth can become brahmana by his actions.

namaste,

Th=
is is a very strong statement.

ncident. The boy came to Gauthama Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked h=
im for his gotra. The boy goes back to his mother and finds out that his mo=

This is a popular misconception. =
Satyakama asks his mother this
question upfront. The mother does not know h=
er child's gotra. Why? In
olden days, women married young, and did not ask =
questions such as
"Who are you? What is your gotra?" to their husband. (In =

conclus=
ion here is that her husband, whom she served with devotion,
died young.

>=
 The boy comes back and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says that he s=
hall teach the boy as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and thus by de=
fault is a Brahmana.

The seers were tri-kAla-darshi- s. Gautama knew of hi=
s boy's pedigree
before asking him the question. After hearing his answer, =
he says "A
non-brahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved =
from
the truth". "satyam" is explained as "brAhmaNa-jAti- dharma".

First, =
you have a jAti-brAhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on
his own, duri=
ng childhood. He then answers the preceptor's question
truthfully, in his m=
other's own words, without embellishment. This is
a very rare set of events=
. Of course the acharyA sees the worthy
student in front of him.
