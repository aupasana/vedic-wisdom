Namaste,

Ravi and Utpal have replied to you. I will leave the questions they have 
already replied too. As Ravi said, the amount of materials you need depends 
on how big a fire you maintain. You will learn and fine-tune with 
experience.

There may be a tradition in some parts of India to offer a drop of ghee in 
water after offering it in fire. But it is not necessary. When doing Chandi 
homam, some people invoke the Mother in an idol and offer water to the idol 
with each mantra along with offering ghee in fire. Again, it is not 
necessary.

Managing ahutis and reading is difficult, but one can master it with 
practice. It is really advisable for you to do both reading and offering 
ahutis yourself.

Wooden spoon is perfectly alright.

Best regards,
Narasimha
