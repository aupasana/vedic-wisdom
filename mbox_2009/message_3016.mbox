Respected Sir,

Although it has been some time doing the homam I too need s=
ome clarification on few things:
While I understand the part about krishnaa=
rpanamastu in the beginning when we sip the water why do we have to imagine=
 Lord Vishnu drinking the water when we say it in the end that krishna is t=
he doership. Is it to avoid the I -factor again?  
 
In the manual its not =
mentioned how to invoke Varuna? If I invoke varuna is it necessary to do th=
e shodashodasopachaara pooja or a simple Panchopachara prayer can be done? =
Where can I find the Pavamana Sooktam? I couldn't find it in the manual.

I=
s darbha grass same as dhruva grass? Are they easily available in pooja sto=
res in India? If I want to use the twigs how do I place it as twigs both en=
ds look the same as in the manual it mentions 

"Take a darbha. Place it in=
side the homa kundam (on the base), with the tip of the darbha facing east =
and the other end facing west. Take another darbha. Place it inside, with t=
he tip of the darbha
facing north and the other end facing south."

For the=
 lakshmi homam I wish to pray the ashta mahalakshmi how do I do it?

One qu=
estion about pranpratishta: 

We pray gods in different forms so when we in=
voke the gods how does the prana come inside the idol in that form. For eg:=
 Goddess Lakshmi is associated with wealth so how does that shakti come on =
it. Is it due to the mantras and thoughts we recite changes the power? Than=
ks so much for all the guidance you have been giving so far,

Best regards,=

Sudha
