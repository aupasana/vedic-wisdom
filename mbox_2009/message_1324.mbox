Hello PVR Gaaru,

If possible can you please forward me the Telugu scripts =
of the Homam. 

Daily I hear and see your Ganapathi homam downloaded from g=
oogle, and 
became a fan follower, trust me.  This has become a habit for t=
he past 
couple of months.

I guess, if I do Homam on my own will get benef=
ited, hence this 
request.  Currently I'm going through Sade Sathi period, =
want to do 
both Ganapathi Homam and Sani Homam.

I'm worried to do Homam o=
n my own as I may mis-spell the mantras, as 
I'm not profecient with Hindi.=
  I have observed some difference between 
Hindi and English scripts, hence=
 requesting you to forward me the 
Telugu Homam Scripts if you have and if =
possible.

Thanks in anticipation,

CVRKumar.
