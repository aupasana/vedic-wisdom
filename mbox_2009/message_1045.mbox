Namaste Rajarshi ji,

Mi tumhala maje Don Adarsh Sangato - One is Shivaji t=
he Great(est) 
and the other is Sardar Vallabhbahi Zaverbhai Patel.
Just th=
at you reminded me of those Two Men came for Special mission.

***
What you=
 wrote make sense. Hanumaan Dada is hailed as Achaarya 
of 'Daas Bhakti'. I=
 read a story many years back. Sri Krishna one day 
suddenly told Rukmani t=
hat Hanumaan is coming to visit Dwaaraka hence 
let us change our forms to =
Raama & Sita because he would not like our 
current form.

BajarangBali is =
so steadfast in his devotion to Lord Raama. it is 
logical to think that An=
ajnaiya will obviously like it more if 
addressed as 'Raamdut' instead of a=
ny other names which does not 
contain word Raama in it.

best Regards,

Ut=
pal
