Namaste Janak Bhai,

Probably final words from me as i just wanted to corre=
ct your 
misunderstanding.

what Mitesh meant (if i understood correctly) w=
as not about the 
sharing of knowledge but Sharing of Joyfullness. i don't =
think that 
he also will have any dispute about sharing of knowledge.

don'=
t correct me if i amnt wrong ;-)

warm reagards,

utpal
