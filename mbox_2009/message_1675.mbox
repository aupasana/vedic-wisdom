Sri Narasimha Garu,

Thanks for your words of wisdom as always. I totally a=
gree with your examples and explanations.

Generally speaking, whatever you=
 said is very right in case of the children that when we teach them they do=
 not understand it ans will only understand them as they grow, here, the te=
acher knows it very well what he is teaching to the kid.

Unfortunately in =
case of rituals, not everyone is fortunate to find such a guru who can teac=
h those rituals to us (with the techer being fully aware of what is being t=
aught). Most often we just tend to observe what others or doing and just fo=
 things blindly not knowing weather we are doing it properly or not (in the=
 process there could be some mistakes that must have got creeped up in our =
process).Since there is not guru available for us to correct these, we cont=
inue to do the wrong process and eventually wonder if thesse rituals are an=
y beneficial (since the desired results are obtained).
Hence i believe is t=
he confusion why prople wonder about the rituals.

SO to me, key is to find=
 such a guru whom you can rely/trust on and follow his/her words blindly.

=
Thanks
KK

 Even if you explain to a one year old child what the word "sorry" means in=
 detail, the child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just get=
 the child into the habit of saying "I am sorry" in approapriate situations=
. Slowly, the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience and t=

ra everyday - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and vi=
sualization in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.

 So it is useful to get into the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sinc=
