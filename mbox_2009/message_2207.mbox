Thanks for this mail..

Indeed I will use the audio and the script in a =
40 days time along with underlining the difficult words as you suggested. W=
hen I first tried reading Chandi

Namaste Rajarshi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When I started ou=
t my Chandi homas (elaborate procedure), it used to take about 3 to 3 1/2 h=
rs and I could easily manage the fire with coconut pieces (Each piece is a =
qurater of the whole coconut). Place 2 pieces side by side and the third on=
e touching the sides of these 2, giving it a triangular shape if you look f=
rom top (white side facing up).
During homam make sure you turn the pieces =
side-ways so that all the sides of a single piece catch fire. When white si=
de is burnt enough, turn it over to bring the dark side up.
At the beginnin=
g of each chapter, add a new piece, pushing the thoroughly burnt piece to t=
he top side. So, at any time you should have 2 pieces burning so that one s=
upports the other in case of an emergency.=A0=A0=A0=A0 
=A0 =A0 =A0 It is v=
ery helpful if you can have the Chandipath script in front of you while lis=
tening to the audio. Familiarize yourself with all the difficult words, und=
erline the words that need extra care of pronunciation. Then read aloud whi=
le listening to the audio and when you feel comfortable, set a rule for you=
rself on 21 days or 40 days and start reading daily. Very soon, the total t=
ime will drastically reduce and you can start the homa. Try to bring down t=
he total duration at an affordable level and at the same time to a comforta=
ble level. 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When you do homa, use your left thumb to track =
the verse you are on. It will help initially. Also, if you are constrained =
by time, you can just follow what Narasimha does=A0 as mentioned in an earl=
ier post to Utpal. In addition to what Narasimha does, I read Ganapathi Ath=
arvaseersham, Kavacha and Devi Suktam an addition of about 10 minutes.
=A0=

This is indeed very interesting.=A0I have one more question for you =
Narayanji. Do you do homa with wood or coconut? If you are doing it with wo=
od, then initially when the Chandi homas took 4 hours, how did you keep the=
 fire going continuously?
=A0
Did you play the CD and keep practicing the C=
handi with it, or you played it while doing the homam and pronounced it alo=

Thats nice. All the best!

One more thing, I don't know to read tamil/m=
