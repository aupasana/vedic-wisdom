 A newly arrived Andhra youth told Bhagavan about the vagaries of his sense=
s
to which Bhagavan said, =93All that is due to the mind. Set it right.=94 =
=93That
is all right, Swami,but however much I try to reduce this anger, it=
 comes on
again and again. What shall I do?=94 said the poor boy.

=93Oh! I=
s that so, then get angry with that anger; it will be all right=94 said
Bha=
gavan. All people in the hall burst out laughing. A person who gets angry
w=
ith everything in the world, if only he introspects, and enquires why he
do=
es not get angry with his anger itself, will he not really overcome all
ang=
er?

Two or three years back a devotee who could freely approach Bhagavan c=
ame
and told him five or six times that somebody had been abusing him. Bhag=
avan
listened but said nothing. As there was no response from Bhagavan in s=
pite
of repeated and varied complaints and in a number of ways,this devotee=
 could
not contain himself any longer and so said, =93When I am abused so m=
uch
unnecessarily, I also get angry. However much I try to restrain my ange=
r I
am not able to do so. What shall I do?=94

Bhagavan laughingly said, =
=93What should you do? You too join him and abuse
yourself; then it will be=
 all right.=94 All laughed.

That devotee, unable to understand anything, s=
aid =93That is very good! Should
I abuse myself?=94

=93Yes indeed! What th=
ey are abusing is your body, isn=92t it? What greater
enemy is there than t=
his body which is the abode of anger and similar
feelings? It is necessary =
that we ourselves should hate it. Instead of that,
when we are unguarded, i=
f anybody abuses us, we should know that they are
waking us up.

We should =
realise at least then, and join them in abusing the body, and
crying it dow=
n. What is the use of counter-abuse? Those who abuse us that
way should be =
looked upon as our friends. It is good for us to be among such
people. If y=
ou are among people who praise you, you get deceived,=94 said
Bhagavan.

In=
 June 1924, thieves entered the Ashram and not only belaboured the
devotees=
, but also beat Bhagavan on his thigh.Subsequently, while relating
amongst =
themselves the
thrashing they had received, the devotees said, =93Bad fello=
ws,they beat even
Bhagavan.=94

Bhagavan is reported to have said, =93Oh, y=
ou all worship me with flowers and
they worshipped me with a stick. That is=
 also a form of worship. If I accept
yours, should I not accept theirs as w=
ell?=94 What he teaches is by practical
illustration. Is not this such an i=
nstance?
