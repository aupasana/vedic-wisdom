Namaste

While we are seeing some discussion on Destiny and Free Will going=
 on here, I would like to add the following:

We have two types of destiny =
or karma, one sanchit karma and prarabdh karma. Sanchit karma is our past k=
arma that is sitting bottled up in jars, out of which one jar is open and t=
hose sanchit karma become prarabdh karma, i.e. fruitification of sanchit ka=
rma. This karma we have to endure there is no way to get out of it.

Now fr=
eewill is that capacity gifted by god to human beings that dictates how we =
endure these prarabdh karma, i.e. do we accumulate more karmas or we endure=
 them such that our other sanchit karma also diminish. Remember there is no=
thing like good or bad karma, every one only have their relative way to app=
reciate.

Recently I read a very inspiring story in a newspaper although th=
e story was about aan dana for donation of food, but it applies here very a=
ppropriately.

The story goes like this, there was man who never got enough=
 food.
some days he would get very little and other days nothing. Tired of =
this hardship he goes to a fakir and complains about not getting enough foo=
d The fakir was a realized seer and sees what's in store for the man. The f=
akir tells the man, you have a very long life but you only have 5 bags of f=
ood that has come with it due to your past actions and so you go without fo=
od many days and somedays you get some food. The man thought for a moment a=
nd requested the faqir to get all remaining bags at once. The fakir was sur=
prised but gives into the wish of the man. Next day the man gets 3 bags of =
food, he cooks all the food at once, feeds himself nicely and donates the r=
est of the food to other needy people and they all enjoy food. He goes to s=
leep feeling satisfied. Next day he wakes up and again there is 3 bags of f=
ood, he does the same thing, what he did yestarday. He was very surprised a=
nd shocked. This goes on and on. After a while he goes back to the fakir an=
d narates everything and thanks fakir and god for a miracle. The fakir unde=
rstands the situation and suggests that the power of donating food to the n=
eedy is very great it is one of the best and greatest gifts anyone can make=
.

So here the man uses his freewill to change his destiny or accumulated k=
arma.

Sometimes in Life we have choice and our selection is the free will =
part, but again we still accumulate karmas after the selection.

Shri Aurob=
indo learns painting and music at a very old age. He wanted to set an examp=
le that one learn anything if one applies himself with dedication and works=
 hard, this is freewill. Now what karma he accumulated or not only he knows=
.

Best Regards
Mitesh
