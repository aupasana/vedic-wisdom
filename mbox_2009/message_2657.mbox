> Introduction*
> "Adi Sankara had once given his consen=
t to a cruel Kapalika to take his head and offer it as a sacrifice to Godde=
ss Kali in order to win favours from her. Kapalikas were followers of a par=
ticular Saiva sect (the left-hand order) who always carried human skulls, w=
ore them as garlands around their necks and even ate and drank from these m=
acabre vessels. Lord Siva himself is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famo=
us temple in Mylapore in Chennai is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is anoth=
er story.
> This Kapalika had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara =
whom he viewed as a potential threat to his faith and sect. He took the Ach=
arya to a nearby cave, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual=
 and prepared himself to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a=
 trance.
> However, when the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself =
to chop off his head Sankara's disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana)=
 envisioned this murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a t=
rice. In an 'avesa' (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, ve=
rily, became the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasim=
ha mantra siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the vi=
llainous Kapalika and tore him to pieces.
> Sankara Vijaya, published by th=
e Ramakrishna Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, =
scattering away the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew int=
o the cave, stunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha =
incarnation once again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by th=
e Lord with his leonine claws.
> Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars =
of a lion, awoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada's =
body was smeared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed =
with divine splendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the=
 awesome Lord Narasimha himself and pacified him with soothing and overflow=
ing devotion.
> On another occasion, Adi Sankara's hands got burnt (the Ama=
ruka episode) but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famo=
us hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as =
Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram'). These hymns are so titled because e=
ach of these verses ends with the same refrain 'Lakshmi Narasimha, mama deh=
i karavalambam' (O Lord Narasimha, please lend me your helping hand).
> It =
is believed that fervent recitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one o=
f the two stotras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will always help one smoothl=
y get over difficulties with the Lord's helping hand.
> Salagrama, the sacr=
ed stone found only in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishn=
avites in their homes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. T=
his is said to be specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to hav=
e been given to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.
