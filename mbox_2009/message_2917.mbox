tirumantram in tamil is a agama . tirumoolar wrote the follow 1558 tantra w=
hich made the shiva worshiping shaivaites angry and they classified tiruman=
tirum as the 10th important book as tirumoolar equates all religion as equa=
l.
tirumoolar has written books on astrology in tamil also. he has wrote ab=
out karma,gnana,bakthi,yoga, tantra, sex and medicine. in one tantra he tel=
ls his book is equivalent to veda and if you read his book it is equal to v=
eda.  he tells how being in samadhi for 11 years a yogi gets the gods power=
 and many more interesting yoga points.
look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wik=
i/Tirumandhiram
and look at http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books=
/tirumantiram/TantraFive.html
tandra number 1558 says
1558: All Faiths Lead=
 but to Lord
for one city there are six path
those who say this is good tha=
t is bad
are like dog barking at a hillstone
***********************
anyway=
 a unrealised sadhak must try to practise this
even when i believe the tiru=
mular who refers six subsets of hinduism sun,sakthi,ganesha,muruga,shiva an=
d vishnu
now it may be expanded to hinduism, muslim christianity etc
still =
i find hard to control myself against quran which advocates female genital =
mutilation
but i can not improve my spirituality without following this son=
g. i have to train myself

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] fanaticism

  
Namast=
e VemparlaRamKishore ji,

i am sorry to deviate from the Subject

> It is m=
y humble opinion that the Avatars of Christ and Mohammed >came to atleast s=
teer the western continent towards a little >dharma. The modern day version=
s of both these faiths have deviated >much from the original messages.

I a=
gree completely to your opinion. it is opinion of mine as well. IM not real=
ly humbleO, The west and the middle east was probably so much in dark perio=
d (spiritually) that there required some person(S) who can lead them to som=
e dharma in their daily routine. However i try, i can not agree to the noti=
on that *ours is the only right path and others will go to hell*. So either=
 the books available are not the same versions given by prophets like Jesus=
 and Mohammed OR it may have been the need of the time which was to be even=
tually a great threat in the future.

In the same breath, i have reservatio=
n about ISCON as well. I see fanaticism there as well. Their marketing real=
ly puts question mark and repel people. Some of the forcible teachings such=
 as Krishna is the supreme God and others are demi gods (Gods which hold le=
sser portfolios). It is very amusing at times ....They show in their Yearly=
 calendar that Vishnu and other Incarnations are actually of Krishna and no=
t of Vishnu. The same goes for different branches within Hinduism and their=
 fight of supremacy over each other such as Vaishnavites and Shaivites, Adv=
aitins and Dvaitins etc=E2=80=A6 etc=E2=80=A6

Apologizing in advance if wr=
itten something harsh but truth is sometimes better told as it is.

Best Re=
gards,

Utpal

I agree completely to your opinion. it i=
s opinion of mine as well. IM not really humbleO, The west and the middle e=
ast was probably so much in dark period (spiritually) that there required s=
ome person(S) who can lead them to some dharma in their daily routine. Howe=
ver i try, i can not agree to the notion that *ours is the only right path =
and others will go to hell*. So either the books available are not the same=
 versions given by prophets like Jesus and Mohammed OR it may have been the=
 need of the time which was to be eventually a great threat in the future.<=
br>
<br>
In the same breath, i have reservation about ISCON as well. I see =
fanaticism there as well. Their marketing really puts question mark and rep=
el people. Some of the forcible teachings such as Krishna is the supreme Go=
d and others are demi gods (Gods which hold lesser portfolios). It is very =
amusing at times ....They show in their Yearly calendar that Vishnu and oth=
er Incarnations are actually of Krishna and not of Vishnu. The same goes fo=
r different branches within Hinduism and their fight of supremacy over each=
 other such as Vaishnavites and Shaivites, Advaitins and Dvaitins etc=E2=80=
