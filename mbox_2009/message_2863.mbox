Namasthe Narasimha Garu

"Evn in really bad situations, people have several=
 options, more than what
they may think they have. However, the forces of h=
abit close their eyes to
certain options and make them see only certain opt=
ions. If one fights the
forces of habit by exerting free will, one may be a=
ble to see options one
did not see before and do something better than befo=
re."

Can I add here that sometimes sincere prayers to the divine can alter=
 the
course that would have been taken by the person, and make the person m=
ake
steer towards him i.e by giving material benefits?
What I mean is that =
once a person has the material stability to live in this
world i.e. not wor=
rying about a job, relationships, etc.
then he can start doing sadhana towa=
rds that Yoga with God.
