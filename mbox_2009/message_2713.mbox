Dear Narasimhaji,

What is your opinion on this: Clearly Adi Sankara's Vive=
kacudamani does two broad levels of classification (a) the material level o=
f classification, in which he quantifies materiality in its various levels =
of manifestation - karana sarira (gunas), linga sarira (tattwas) and sthool=
a sarira (mahabhutas) (b) the realization level of classification - annamay=
akosa, pranamayakosa, manomayakosa, vijnanamayakosa, and anandamayakosa. Th=
ere has to be a reason why he defined the realization levels of classificat=
ion into 5, right? Consequently, the "rising of kundalini" must also give a=
t some level of classification the same set of realizations, no? It would s=
eem at least superficially to fit on the 5 lower chakras. From that point o=
f view, the 6th chakra would be after the anandamayakosa. Clearly the anand=
amayakosa would be the final level of egoity, since by being released from =
it would leave one out of the linga sarira, but yet possibly still in the k=
arana sarira (gunas level). It would seem that any realization levels after=
 getting into the karana sarira would be ahamkara free (and of course tattw=
a free), yet guna bound. Final releas from gunas of course would lead to pu=
re awakening of Brahman.

The point above is - if the mayakosas are not rel=
ated to the kundalini chakras, what are they? They must be experienced at s=
ome level of realization, no?

Regards,

Sundeep

ng is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five c=
hakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ethe=
r, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth el=

> > >

, don't just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element =
shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid =
state of existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular thing=
 (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and ma=
de of earth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. a ca=
r, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. =
Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five element=
s.

 Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notion=
