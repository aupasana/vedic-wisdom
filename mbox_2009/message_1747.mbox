Namaste F=
riends,

I am trying to purchase the havan kund from the following online s=
tore, but they dont sell 'stand' for keeping the havan kund. 

I live in a =
rented apartment which has carpet floor.

One suggestion was to purchase a =
concrete slab from Home depot and place the havan kund. 

The online shop p=
eople also advised me that they would try to get havan kund with stand, as =
a special case but it can take few months. 

I am eager to find out how our=
 US friends are performing homa in their residences?

Another point is that=
, these people do not sell wooden spoons and they are offering copper spoon=
s for ahuti. Is it adviseable to use copper spoons? I look forward for your=
 advice.

Thank you,
Shankar 
Detroit, MI, USA
