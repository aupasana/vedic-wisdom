Namaste,
 
I am glad you tried it.
 
1. As I said before, anybody who wishes to formally have a guru figure in the mind for this procedure may think of me as the guru for this procedure, without asking specifically.
 
My permission is always there, but I am nobody to give blessings.
 
2. Yes, that would be alright. South-west is considered a good place for Ganapathi specifically.
 
3. Krishna needs to do nothing, but he does everything.
 
Krishna is the supreme cosmic being. He is the sum total of all beings. All the worlds and beings of this universe rest inside him. He sees, hears, eats, wishes, knows and acts through all beings of this universe.
 
The notion "I am doing it" causes pride and increases attachment to the result. The notion "god is doing through me" increases devotion and detachment to the result. In all rituals, they say krishnaarpanamastu at the end, as it is conducive to thoughts like "god is doing through me and I am a mere instrument".
 
4. Agni and other deities will be more offended by a proud person with good pronunciation who thinks "what a nice and competent ritual I am doing right now and how good my pronunciation is!" A person having humility and devotion but pronouncing weakly is in a much better position. 
 
One more thing.. Pronunciation can be improved easily. But humility and devotion cannot be improved that easily. It takes a much longer time.
 
So keep up your humility and devotion and slowly try to improve the pronunciation.
 
All the best with homam!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
