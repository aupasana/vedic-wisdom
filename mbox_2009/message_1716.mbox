Hi PVR,

Read the karma theory.. its a nice theory when it comes to calm ou=
r hearts when something grievious has happened in onr lives.. how to live w=
hen soemthing bad has happened and god does not appear to give any explanat=
ion.. we seek answers and karma theory gives a termination to our seeking. =
Its always calming to take blame on ourselves by saying 'oh may be i did so=
mething in my past life and i am paying it back' because if u do not think =
that,it means that somewhere something is unjustified and its far more pain=
ful to give blame to god than to ourselves.

Now for karma theory how does =
it explain the unspeakable crimes like rapes.. may be you heard about that =
case in Austria of Miss elizabeth Fritzl. (you can google it) how does karm=
a theory explain it. I don't think any dignified explanation excluding blin=
d beliefs can be given for it. I have found people to be very callous towar=
ds such issues and saying 'oh its just karma'. that would be very shameful =
if we give such an answer in this condition.

Also I would like to ask how =
wise it is to reveal important knowledge to naive minds? 

Regards,
Siya.
