Namaste Jitender,
=A0
Well, aakaasa is the most predominant element in univ=
erse and then air and then fire. Your friend is correct on that. However, w=
hy should that imply that aakaasa and air are better elements for spiritual=
 growth than fire? Why should spiritual importance be decided by numbers an=
d pre-dominance?
=A0
There may be only a handful of elevated yogis in the w=
orld and millions of greedy people. Should we say that association with gre=
edy people is better for spiritual growth than association with elevated yo=
gis?
=A0
Numbers and predominance do not decide what is more useful in spir=
itual growth!

Fire =
is pure. One of the names for fire is paavaka and means "purifier". Fire pu=
rifies whatever it comes in contact with.
=A0
Air can be pure or impure. If=
 you are able to perceive the underlying Brahman in air, then it is ever pu=
re. But, the problem is that you are not able to perceive the underlying Br=
ahman and you are perceiving a specific object with certain properties in t=
he field of duality. That is why you need to do sadhana in first place.
=A0=

Then why not use something that has good and purifying properties even in =
the field of duality? Like fire.

=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The method of using the element of aakaasa is jnaana yoga a=
nd Vedanta. Aakaasa (ether/space) is an element present in everything and y=
et imperceptible. Similarly, Brahman is present in every object we perceive=
 and yet we do not perceive Brahman - we only perceive various objects. A v=
edanti tells oneself that everything is Brahman. Perception of various obje=
cts as various objects with properties is an illusion, one keeps telling on=
eself. One tries to see everything as Brahman.
=A0
When one feels attractio=
n or repulsion for something, one reminds oneself "what I am doing? All is =
Brahman. There is no X and Y." When one feels pride or depression, one remi=
nds oneself "what I am doing? All is Brahman. There is no I or others. Ther=
e is no good or bad." With persistent contemplation and self-control exerte=
d like that for a long time, one finally overcomes the very seed of such th=
oughts that need to be countered with "everything is Brahman" logoc. One's =
mind is established in Brahman and one does not perceive objectification. T=
hat is moksha.
=A0
This path needs tremendous patience, perseverance and di=
scipline. It is not easy.
