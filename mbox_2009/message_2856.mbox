Dear All,

A question to all who do Chandi path/puja/homas. In different tr=
aditions we see different ways of doing the path. Some do the full text. Wh=
at is the bare minimum for other than the 13 chapters...?


Is it must to c=
hant SHAAP - VIMOCHAN mantra before trying to chant full Chandi?

-Thanks
