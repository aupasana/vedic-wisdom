Namaste,

In general, when svAhA is added to the end of a mantra, there can be some
changes to the intonation of the swaras at the end of the mantra. In
addition, for some reason, there is a difference in the pronounciation of
this mantra itself, when it is offered in homam (the chandas is different).
If possible, please clarify this with your elders in person.

bhavadIyaH,

          ajit
