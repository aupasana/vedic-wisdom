Dear Utpal, 
=C2=A0
Thanks a lot for the dohas! Did not know it was Hanuman=
 Jayanti. Would have tried doing a homa of Lord Hanuman. I wish someday I c=
an memorize the Hanuman Chalisa, its extremely beautiful.
=C2=A0
Just now a=
n interesting coincident (?) came to mind. That night before I wrote that m=
ail about my friend and the consequent chain of mails, I was talking to my =
mentor (guru). It was a normal conversation. At the end of the conversation=
 before he hung up, he paused for a moment and suddenly said "Jai Ram ji ki=
".I was little taken aback for a second, I did not expect to hear "Jai Ramj=
i ki". It is not like he normally uses that phrase often or anything. So I =
was a little frigid for a second, then he repeated it again, and I too repe=
ated it in a flow and said "Jai Ramji ki" - loud and clear. 
=C2=A0
Now as =
I look back I find it very interesting, because the next day while I was wr=
iting these mail I had spend the major part of the day thinking of Lord Ram=
a.
=C2=A0
I personally am a firm believer in Rama as God and have often pra=
yed to him. The name itself is so powerful, I feel.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Jai Sri R=
ama!
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


=C2=A0

The upsurge (of consci=
ousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

<DI=

numan Chalisa, its extremely beautiful.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Just n=
ow an interesting coincident (?) came to mind. That night before I wrote th=
at mail about my friend and the consequent chain of mails, I was talking to=
 my mentor (guru). It was a normal conversation. At the end of the conversa=
tion before he hung up, he paused for a moment and suddenly said "Jai Ram j=
i ki".I was little taken aback for a second, I did not expect to hear "Jai =
Ramji ki". It is not like he normally uses that phrase often or anything. S=
o I was a little frigid for a second, then he repeated it again, and I too =
repeated it in a flow and said "Jai Ramji ki" - loud and clear. </DIV>
<DIV=

<DIV>Now as I look back I find it very interesting, because t=
he next day while I was writing these mail I had spend the major part of th=
e day thinking of Lord Rama.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I personally am a=

; Regarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable to express the<BR>&=
gt; ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really saying<B=
R>> that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees th=
at<BR>> Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinio=
n)=C3=82<BR>> God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped.=
 He descended<BR>> in order to lead by example. That is why the text is =
called Rama+ayana.<BR>> A path that an ordinary man can and should follo=
w. One
 of<BR>> principles.=C3=82 Compare this to the name of the other =
great epic,<BR>> Mahabharata, which was not named "Krishna+ayana" . One =
cannot follow<BR>> Krishna's path.<BR>> > =C3=82<BR>> > When=
ever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our<BR>> subcs=
ious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper<BR>> a=
nd the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama<BR>&=
gt; did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobe=
l<BR>> man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following =
such a<BR>> life.<BR>> > An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a=
 God but he can follow the<BR>> life of a great man.<BR>> > =C3=82=
<BR>> > Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should tr=
y to<BR>> become like Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth =
to be like<BR>> Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada w=
as not a
 self<BR>> realized=C3=82 saint of highest calibre, but his lif=
e's image is like=C3=82<BR>> one who=C3=82 lived like a lion among sheep=
 of ordinary=C3=82 men, fearless<BR>> and uncompromising and principled.=

 projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire<BR>&=

 you will never hear anyone advising that<BR>> one should try to lead a =

 He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a<BR>> hodgepo=

thor's paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but<BR>&=

<BR>> with
 animals or something similar. He believes that was introduce=

ust.<BR>> Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to wome=
n.<BR>> Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then t=
