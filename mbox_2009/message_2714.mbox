Nitish,

You clearly contradict Adi Sankara's Vivekacudamani (VC from here =
on). Please tell us why we should listen to you, not him. Specifically, you=
 insist chitta is a tattwa. Whereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb,=
 i.e. consciousness, then this property is only possessed by Brahman becaus=
e only it is Sat-chitta-ananda. When VC uses this word as a noun, it is use=
d as a modification of antahakarana (whose other three modifications are ma=
nas, ahamkara and buddhi). So to put this is context, VC clearly implies th=
at at the material level of tattwas, we see the Linga Sarira. One of the co=
nstructs of Linga sarira is antahakrana. One of its "modifications" is chit=
ta. I take this to mean (since I take that only Brahman can have true chitt=
a (verb))it is that property of the antahakarana that, when enlivened by Br=
ahman, gives awareness/consciousness to the Linga sarira.

How exactly am I=
 wrong. Only facts and explanations please, no proof by ridicule/intimidati=
on. 


Regards,

Sundeep
