Namaste Ajit-ji,


   This is lucid, but where can i find "bodhAyaNa sheSh=
a sUtra-s" online?
i tried searching the same on the web but couldn't find =
any, can you
please point me to a link if the same is available online?

  =
 On a side note, the Sri Rudram (below link) that you have at your
web-site=
 is one more new variation that i am seeing for the first time,
it is inter=
esting from the fact that we can find contents which are not
in KYV 4-5-26 =
to KYV 4-5-27 interlacing in the 11th anuvaaka (with a
bottom note) between=
 the following suktas :-

     ye tiirthaani ... nishhaN^giNaH (AND) ya eta=
avantashcha ...
dhanvaani tanmasi.  i.e. between 11.9 and 11.10

      http=
://www.mudgala.com/articles/rudram.pdf
<http://www.mudgala.com/articles/rud=
ram.pdf>

     Till now i was under the notion that only 4.5.26 and 4.5.27 =
of KYV
form the 11th anuvaaka and none other than them,  are the above soug=
ht
of variations mentioned in bodhaayaNa sheSha sutra's as well?

  Thank Y=
ou,
sarma.
