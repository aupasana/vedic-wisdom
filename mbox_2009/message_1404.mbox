One of the things that I recently observed in this regard is also
fascinating.
 
I work for an IT based company - where you would expect people to be very
well dressed and particular about their
appearance. But on joining this company - I noticed that some employees were
sporting unkempt and long hair, 
untrimmed beards, wearing less than perfect dress. On enquiring further - I
learnt that each and every one of these 
were Subject Matter Experts in fields of Mathematics, Computers, Financial
industry etc.,. All of them carried Ph.Ds
and were involved in their fields for decades. And Yes - on talking to them
I have never seen more humble beings
Always willing to stoop down to your level and explain.
 
Then I reconciled that Sadhana does not always have to be Spiritual. Being
fully involved in a field is also Sadhana.
 
And further more - Sadhana probably some side effects. The human being has
only finite amount of focus - 
Each of us split it and use it in different ways - Some place all their
focus on the Divine (or their sadhana/work) and there is not much left
for the outwardly appearance.
 
In some cases I have noticed devotees emulating their Guru in terms of
dress, appearance or even accent. There is nothing wrong
in emulating - There is a special saying "Fake it till you make it" - As
long as we are truthfully on the path - everything is acceptable.
 
My two cents.
 
With Best Regards
Shrikanth
