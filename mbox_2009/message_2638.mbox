Dear Utpalji,
=A0
My apologies if I have broken the rules of th=
e forum.
=A0
We were discussing more about the Ishta Devata and if there wa=
s any co relation with the charts. I would presume that if Mohana Ranganji =
wishes to reply may do so in my mail id directly. 
=A0
Incidently I was jus=
t reading PVRji's mail replying to the same thread / question . It was just=
 the curiousity of the thread made me to ask the query.
=A0
Once again my s=
incere apoligies.
=A0
Jai Maa Kaali


Devbrato Sarkar

about making the money BUT making the=A0MAN while he is making money".
