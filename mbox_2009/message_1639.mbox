GRAHAYUDHA [(Graha =3D planet) + (Yudha =3D fight) planetary warfare]. An a=
stronomical phenomenon resulting from proximity between two planets. It aff=
ects their power to produce any result. The planets involved in this relati=
onship are rendered unable to bestow their beneficence, and become inauspic=
ious. Such a situation occurs when a planet other than Moon or the nodes (R=
ahu.or Ketu) is situated within 50 of the Sun. The planet so placed is cons=
idered Asthagatha or combust. When such a relationship takes place with Moo=
n, it is known as Saniaagama, or combination. Any of the five nonluminaries=
 within 50 of any other planet causes planetary warfare, or Graha yudiza, a=
nd one of the two involved in this relationship is said to be vanquished an=
d the other is a victor. The victorious planet produces powerful auspicious=
 effects, while the vanquished one becomes inauspicious. The house in which=
 this phenomenon occurs is destroyed and the individual suffers throughout =
his life in respect to that Bhava (q.v.). There are five kinds of planetary=
 warfare, viz., Bhedam, Ullekham, Amsumardhanam, Apasauyam, and Yuddham. Bh=
edain occurs when two planets are within 50 of each other though in differe=
nt asterisms. When they are between 30 and 50 of each other located in the =
same asterism, they are in Ullekha yuddham. When such planets are within a =
distance of 10 to 30 of each other in the same asterism, the relationship i=
s known as Amsumardlianam. If the planets are within one degree of the othe=
r, they are known as in Graha yuddham proper. If one of the two planets wit=
hin 50 of each other is direct while the other is retrograde, they form Apa=
savya Yuddham. The effects of planetary warfare depends upon the conditions=
 classified under Poura Graha, Akranta Graha, and Akrita or Yayee Graha. Po=
ura Graha is a planet in a state of opposition to another. Akranta Graha is=
 the overpowered, chased, or eclipsed planet. Akriti Graha is generally agg=
ressive on the move. The Sun is Poura up to 11 a.m., Akranta at noon, and A=
krita or feeble in the afternoon. Moon is always overpowered. Mercury, Jupi=
ter, and Saturn are always in opposition (Poura), while Mars, Venus, Rahu, =
and Ketu are always aggressive. The effect of Graha yuddha is conditioned b=
y the mood of these planets as indicated above. A planet with earlier longi=
tude is said to defeat the planet ahead of it. A planet in southern hemisph=
ere is considered defeated. But Venus is always victorious. The planet with=
 a fairly larger orb than the other becomes victorious. (See Brihat Samhita=
, Chap. XVII).
