Namaste,
 
There is no need to say that. Just add swaahaa first 11 times an=
d vaushat in the 12th time.
 
Saying "this is for XYZ god and not mine" aft=
er the mantra is needed if we are using fire to send generic aahutis to var=
ious deities like Prajapati, Agni, Vayu etc. If we invoke a specific deity =
in fire and worship him and then offer aahutis for him, you can merely read=
 the mantra and add swaahaa. No need to specifically say "this is for XYZ g=
od and not mine" after each mantra.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Sir,
        One more question for Homam.
     =
   Suppose I am giving 12 Ahutis daily to Maha Ganpati with (Aum, Shrim, Hr=
im Klim.....Vashamanaya Swaha) Maha Ganapati Mantra, is it necessary that I=
 have to speak - Idam Maha Ganapataye, Idam Na Mama - after each Ahuti?  
 =
       Or  It is OK if  I give 12 Ahutis first with the Mantras only and I =
will speak -Idam Maha Ganpataye,Idam Na Mama - only once at the last after =
12th Ahuti is completed?

          Namas=
te Dheeraj,<BR>> You can use as much quantity of offerings as 
         =
 you want, as <BR>long<BR>> as the offerings are properly consumed 
    =
      in the fire. It <BR>all boils down to<BR>> the amount of fire that=
 
          is present in the homa kunda. If <BR>there is good<BR>> amou=
nt of 
          fire, even if you do not offer ghee, offering <BR>marmara =
, 
          havan<BR>> samagri etc will be easily consumed. But if the =
fire is 
          <BR>small, then you<BR>> do need to offer ghee drops =
to keep the 
          fire alive.<BR>> There were days when I used abou=
t 8-10 coconut 
          halves for <BR>1<BR>> chandi homam, ie started=
 with 2 pieces of 1 
          coconut half, <BR>adding half<BR>> piece =
of coconut half for each 
          chapter and finally a <BR>piece for<BR>=
> purnahuti. Now, I am able 
          to manage 1 chandi homa with <BR>=
about 2-3 coconut<BR>> halves. 
          Others out there might be able=
 to do with much <BR>less. It 
          also<BR>> depends on the coconu=
t pieces itself, some pieces burn 
          <BR>slow and some<BR>> fast=
, so the quantity you may need may 
          vary.<BR>> Most importantl=
y I suggest you follow an important 
          advice <BR>of<BR>> Narasi=
mhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the 
          corners of the <BR>coconut =
piece,<BR>> making sure the piece 
          catches fire from all the c=
orners. <BR>Doing this way,<BR>> at the 
          end of the homa, all =
the coconut pieces are <BR>completely 
          burnt,<BR>> almost like=
 powder.<BR>> So, my suggestion to you is 
          to have plenty of o=
fferings <BR>at your<BR>> disposal, try to keep 
          the fire goin=
g ( big or small does <BR>not matter). <BR>> Make sure 
          the of=
ferings that you put with each swaha <BR>(sloka) catch 
          fire.<BR>=

          <BR=
>joining your<BR>> ring finger, middle finger and thumb. This 
         =
 way, you will <BR>be offering<BR>> decent amount with each 
          s=
waha.<BR>> Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, 
    =
      <BR>black and<BR>> white sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a 
    =
      container and <BR>used the<BR>> combination as offering.<BR>> I=
 
          am sure within first few days of your homa, you will <BR>have 
=
          very<BR>> good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you n=
