Dear Seekers....Namaskaaram,
Adding my bit of information,
The Gujarati wor=
d Bet signifies ' island ' or a land mass surrounded by water.
Bet Dwaraka =
is an island and one has to take a boat/launch from mainland Dwaraka.
There=
 is another place called Moola Dwaraka (the word Moola means 'Aadi' or 'ori=
ginal' in Gujarati) ... though not very near to Dwaraka but claimed by many=
 saadhu to be the 'real' Dwaraka of Bhagawan Sri Krishna.
Close to Moola Dw=
araka is a vey vibrating place -the seat of Maata Harasiddhi, who stays for=
 half the day in Ujjain(Madhya Pradesh State)-of valorous Mahaaraja Vikrama=
aditya.
Anyone visiting Dwaraka or Porbander should attend the Sandhyaa Aar=
ati at the dusk time- even people with=A0minimal=A0 daily Saadhana feel the=
 divine vibrations !!!
=A0
This=A0belt between Junagadha and Dwaraka=A0is f=
ull of shrines,spiritual places as already written.The local populace pride=
s in the lore that Arjuna-the ace archer was robbed,at Okha near=A0Dwaraka=
=A0by the local tribals,under the leadership of one 'Kaabaa'-who tamed Arju=
na with his Archery skills !!!
There is a saying in Gujarati- " Kaabe Arjun=
 lootiyo- Wohi Dhanush Wohi Baan"
The moral of this saying is to be humble =
and not get carried away by one's achievements,lest like the mighty Arjuna =
-one can get robbed of=A0pride(read 'Ahamkaara')=A0at the hands of ordinary=
 tribal leader....=A0=A0
The place Okha is a corrupt form of=A0sanskrit Ush=
aa - the daughter of 'Asura' who married after=A0a stormy romance, Anirudhh=
a-Son of Bhagawaan Sri Krishna.
=A0
As Resp.Narasimhaji has written-Girnaar=
 Parvata=A0has strongly=A0mystic vibrations -it is 
"The Seat" of Guru Datt=
atreya -No Wonder !!!
=A0
What is vey interesting to note is that old scrip=
tures and BPHS=A0term Saurashtra as originally the "Land of Asura"=A0people=
 wherefrom should be judged=A0using=A0Ashtottari Dasaa !
I hope,in my enthu=
siasm I have not egressed too much=A0from the spiritual trunk !
=A0
Namaska=
aram,
=A0=A0
=A0=A0
=A0=A0=A0

Namaste,
=A0
I heard it referred to as Bet Dwaraka by many people, but a=
s Brihad Dwaraka by a learned old man. So I assumed that Bet is from Sanskr=
it word Brihat. Thanks for correcting me.
=A0
Well, this is the land where =
Krishna lived and ruled, not too long back (just a few millennia back). No =
wonder it is full of devotional energy. Another place filled with an unbeli=
evable level of devotional energy is Mayapur in Bengal and Aalandi near Pun=
e. Girnar mountain at Junagadh in Gujarat and Arunachalam mountain at Tiruv=
annamalai in Tamil Nadu are filled with an unbelievable level of mystical e=

=A0
Actually, India is filled with many places that have a high leve=

Sir,
I have spent=

D=
ear Hari,
=A0
Repeating any combination of syllables with a focussed mind w=
ill eventually do the trick on the mind. So you may do either.
=A0
However,=
 some combinations tried by others successfully in the past are better and =
faster.
=A0
Regarding the specific mantra below: The words "raam" and "jay"=
 (or "jai") have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be "raama" and "jaya" =
respectively.. Arabic has words mostly ending in consonants (i.e. no vowel =
"a" at the end of the word). That Arabic influence made Indians change Sans=
krit words to remove "a" at the end of words. "Jaya Raama" becomes "Jay Raa=
m".
=A0
If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please restor=
e "a" at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra is "Sree Raama=
 Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama". You can add "Om" at the beginning.
=A0
*=A0=

=A0
On our India trip in the su=
mmer of 2008, I and my guru went to many temples.. There was one remote tem=
ple in BriahdDwaraka that had a nice level of spiritual vibrations. It is a=
 temple of Hanuman and Makaradhwaja (Hanuman's son) together. Apparently so=
me yogi did intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the m=
antra you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of the=
 temple.
=A0
Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by h=
is sadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent some time=
 there. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to BrihadDwaarakaa and=
 then go inside the village (a few km from the main Krishna temple at Briha=
dDwaarakaa) . It is a very small temple without any crowd, but has stronger=
 spiritual energy than many famous temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or =
Gujarat in general, I recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple =
of hours there.
=A0
The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.

Dear Fellow travellers, namaste


All this talk about Mangal re=
minds me about one question I've had for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanj=
ayji had advised me to go to any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for liftin=
g up the Mangal in my natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in r=
asi and neecha in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetiru=
ndha Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest about =
a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the walls of the t=
emple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7 word, 10 a=
ksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th house with the mantra=
 devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra teachings. I've been doing t=
his every evening since.


Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka man=
tra. My question is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of =
Mangal?


Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is i=
t


|om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas


or


|om s=
ri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas


Some say it sho=
uld be 13 aksharas....


Sorry for astrological content in this mail.

Hari

<DIV><SPAN class=Apple-style-span style="COLOR: rgb(255,102,0); FONT-FAMILY: 'comic sans ms'">All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I've had for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest about a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th house with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra teachings. I've been doing this every evening since.</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=Apple-style-span style="COLOR: rgb(255,102,0); FONT-FAMILY: 'comic sans ms'">Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?</SPAN></DIV>
