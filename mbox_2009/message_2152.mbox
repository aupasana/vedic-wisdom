Namaste Rajesh,
 
It is quite difficult to make a living without promoting =
adharma somewhere, in some way or the other. Actually, I am not sure if jus=
t writing scripts for dramas containing a lot of conflicts is adharma per s=
e. Mahabharata has a lot of conflict for example, but the story also teache=
s dharma to us. It is possible that your dissatisfaction has more to do wit=
h what you wanted to do and are unable to do, than what you are doing.
 
If=
 you have two options in front of you, it is useful to weigh them and try t=
o pick the best option. Right now, you are seeing only one option. So there=
 is nothing to think or analyze.
 
Sometimes, one has many options in front=
 of one, but does not see them clearly. It seems like there is only one opt=
ion and one keeps going. But as one becomes purer, one may see other more d=
ifficult options and have the courage to pick them.
 
*        *        *
 =

In other words, you do what you believe is your dharma (duty or right acti=
on). What you believe to be your dharma may or may not be your dharma in re=
ality. But, as your surrender increases, as your self-centeredness decrease=
s, as your sense of doership and ego decrease, you will become purer and pu=
rer. As you become purer and purer, your dharma will become clearer and cle=
arer to you. You have to somehow lower your ego and self-centeredness and i=
ncrease the sense of surrender.
 
*        *        *
 
Do the best your ca=
n, with respect to profession, family life etc and not worry about things o=
ut of your control. In addition, engage in some spiritual practice like hom=
am or meditation on a regular basis. If you persevere, you will eventually =
break through.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding the comment by Sri Uma Sha=
nker:
 
We are not only here "to do things", but also to do the "right" thi=
ngs. So, we should also "think whether we are doing right or wrong". Howeve=
r, we have to strike the right balance between thinking and acting. The bas=
ic problem is that the right action for a person depends on that person's k=
armas and rinas. It is not always easy to know one's dharma. Arjuna was luc=
ky that he had Krishna to tell him what his dharma was. Others are not so f=
ortunate. They are torn by different directions in life.
 
Though a part of=
 one's consciousness always knows one's dharma, that wise part of one's con=
sciousness is usually suppressed. As one removes layers of ego from one's t=
hinking, that part will shine and guide one correctly.
 
This is an iterati=
ve process that keeps getting better with sadhana.
 
*        *        *
 
=
If one has realized Self and surrendered to god completely, one will see al=
l actions performed by all as god's actions and not be excited or saddened =
by any of them. Krishna took Arjuna to such a state by imparting the knowel=
dge of Self through Gitopadesa, before Arjuna killed near and dear.
 
If so=
mebody who is not in that state engages in similar actions, one will be tor=
n by varying emotions resulting from the actions. Fruits of some actions wi=
ll make one very happy and fruits of some actions will make one very sad. I=
n other words, one will suffer from the bondage of duality. Thanks to Krish=
na, Arjuna was rescued from the bondage of duality before his big actions i=
n the big war.
 
Like I said earlier, one can do whatever pleases one and d=
eclare "god did it through me". That is too easy. Can one continue to see a=
ll as god's play and not be perturbed when something terrible happens to on=
e later? If one cannot, one is not self-realized and "god did it through me=
" is mere rhetoric. Instead of hiding behind rhetoric that does not help la=
ter when one time catches up with one, such a person should carefully choos=
e one's actions so that one slowly becomes purer and gets closer to one's d=
harma slowly.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Do your du=
ty and leave the rest to the god.  Sri Krishna himself has advised Arjun ab=
out doing ones  Karma.  We are here only to do things and not to think whet=
her we are doing right or wrong.

          Shri Narsimha Guruji,
=

          I am not sure, whether I have right to address you as Narsimha G=
uruji or not ? I donot know whether i have the eligibility to become your S=
hishya also. Still, i respect you as my Guruji and i am blessed to have fou=
nd you. I should thank my friend, utpal for this.. 

          I need your =
help. Professionally i work for private company in accounts and administrat=
ion department since past 20 years. Besides my profession, i am script writ=
er also.. To earn more money, to lead good standard of life and to pay back=
 my home loans, i have started writing script for Television serial as a pa=
rt time job. I am doing this script writing work since past 4-5 years. Cons=
idering my creative talents and good language control (not praising myself)=
I am getting good assignments of writing TV serials.

          All daily s=
oap television serials are glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.=
. enemities.. Sometimes i am feeling guilty of writing scenes which shows C=
onflicts between SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts=
 between BROTHER and BROTHER. I am compelled to write harsh dialogues which=
 hurts me sometimes.. 

          The formula on which TV serials are now b=
ased follow this: "More conflicts means more drama and more drama means mor=
e TRP(Television rating points)and More TRP means more benefits, more money=
 and popularity to the serial".

          Guruji, I feel that i am doing w=
rong by writing serials.. I am passing wrong messages to the society.. i fe=
el guilty about it. I am not in a position to leave this as it gives me mor=
e money besides it also gives me good standard of life and good recognition=
 also.. If i would leave this someone else would do it.. What should i do? =
I am really confused. If i will leave writing this, i will find more diffic=
ult to survive in this world with home loan and two small school going chil=
dren..I need your help

          I was fortunate to discuss this with utpa=
l. He guided me to write this mail to you.. to seek your guidance..

      =
    Waiting anxiously your reply.

          Respectful regards,

         =
 Rajesh
