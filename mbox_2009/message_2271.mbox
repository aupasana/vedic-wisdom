Knowing that all misery arises only as a result of the fundamental error =
=96
the original sin =96 of attending to second and third persons instead o=
f
attending to and knowing the true nature of the first person, Bhagavan Sr=
i
Ramana graciously appeared on earth to advise humanity, =93Throughout the=

waking and dream states you attend only to second and third persons, and i=
n
consequence you experience endless misery. But in sleep, when you do not
=
attend to any second or third person, you do not experience any misery.
Ove=
rlooking the peaceful happiness that you experienced while asleep, you
sear=
ch for happiness in the waking state by attending to innumerable
external o=
bjects. However, does not the fact that you experienced happiness
during sl=
eep in the absence of those objects, indicate that happiness lies
not in th=
e objects but in you, the first person or subject? Therefore why
not you tr=
y, even in the waking state, to attend not to second and third
persons but =
to the first person =91I=92 ?=94

On hearing this, however, some devotees w=
onder whether it is necessary then
to withdraw from all activities in order=
 to be able to practise
Self-attention. =93If we are to follow this sadhana=
 of Self--attention in all
earnestness, will not work prove to be an obstac=
le? But if we give up all
work, how are we to provide the food, clothing an=
d shelter required by the
body?=94 they ask. However, whenever devotees ask=
ed Sri Bhagavan such
questions, He used to reply thatwork need not be a hin=
drance to spiritual
practice (sadhana). This does not mean, of course, that=
 an aspirant should
work in the same spirit as a wordly man or that he shou=
ld work with the same
aim in view. The spirit in which and the aim with whi=
ch an aspirant should
work in this world, can be illustrated by the followi=
ng example:

Suppose a businessman rents a shop in the heart of a big city =
for Rs.
1,000/- a month. If from his business he aims to make only sufficie=
nt money
to pay the rent for the shop, will it not be a worthless business?=
 Should
not his aim in renting the shop be to earn a profit of Rs. 10,000/-=
 a month?
On the other hand, if he does not make sufficient money even to p=
ay the
rent, will he be able to remain in the shop to earn his profit?

Our=
 body is like the shop rented by the businessman.The aim with which we
rent=
 this body is to realize Self, while the rent we have to pay for the
body i=
s food, clothing and shelter. In order to pay this rent, it is
necessary fo=
r us to work, using the mind, speech and body as our
instruments. If we do =
not pay the rent, we cannot live in the body and earn
the great profit of S=
elf-knowledge. However, we should not spend our whole
life-all our time and=
 effortin working to pay the rent. The mind, speech and
body should work on=
ly for that amount of time and with that amount of effort
which is required=
 for paying the rent =96 for providing the food, clothing and
shelter neces=
sary for the body. If instead we devote all our time and effort
towards acc=
umulating comforts and conveniences for the body, as worldly
people do, we =
would be just like the worthless businessman who works only to
pay the rent=
 and who never tries to make a profit. Therefore, a sincere
aspirant should=
 arrange his work in such a way that he will spend only a
portion of his ti=
me and energy for maintaining the body, so that he can
utilize the remainin=
g time and energy in striving to earn the great profit
of Self-knowledge.

=
For some aspirants prarabdha will be arranged by God or Guru in such a way
=
that they need to do little or no work to maintain their body, whereas for
=
other aspirants it may be arranged in such a way that they have to spend
mo=
st of their time in working for the maintenance of the body. But in
whateve=
r way the prarabdha is arranged, it is arranged only for the
aspirant=92s o=
wn good, that is, for his ultimate attainment of
Self-knowledge. Moreover,
=
since prarabdha determines only the outward activities of the body and mind=
,
it can in no way obstruct the inward desire and yearning for Self-knowled=
ge.
If one has an intense yearning for Self-knowledge, the Guru=92s Grace w=
ill
certainly help one in all ways, both from within and without, to enable=
 one
to attend to Self.
