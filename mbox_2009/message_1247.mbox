Dear Group Members=
,

The following is the meaning given to me by my named Guru Shri 
Bhooshan=
 Priya Ji. 

'This is what the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra means:

Sukracharya =
said "The first pada is Triyambakam Yajamahe and means -
we worship or sing=
 the praise of Lord Trayambaka. Tryambaka is the 
name of Lord Shiva as the=
 father of the three worlds - bhu, bhuva 
and svarga lokas. He is the fathe=
r and lord of the three mandala's - 
Surya, Soma and Agni mandala. He is Ma=
heswara, the lord of the three 
Guna's - Satva, Rajas and Tamas. He is the =
Sadashiva, the teacher of 
the three tatvas - Atma tatva, Vidya tatva and S=
hiva tatva. He is 
the father (cause and source) of the three energies (agn=
i) - 
Aavahaniya, Garhapatya and Dakshinagni. He is the father of all 
phys=
ical creation through the three murti bhuta - Prithvi (solid), 
Jala (liqui=
d) and Tejas or agni (energy). He is the lord of the 
three heavens created=
 by the dominance of the three Gunas - Rajas 
(Brahma), Satva (Vishnu) and =
Tamas (Shiva). Know Him to be the 
nirakara (formless) Sadashiva as He is a=
bove this physical mode and 
is their Maheswara. This is the first foot of =
the mantra (composed 
of eight syllables)."

"The second pada of the mantra=
," continued Sukracharya, "is 
Sugandhim Pushtivardhanam. Sugandhim refers =
to the fragrance of the 
flower that spreads in all directions, and in a si=
milar way Shiva is 
present in the entire creation, both animate and inanim=
ate. In all 
the bhutas (modes of existence), in the three Gunas (nature of=
 
creation as being Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the ten indriyas (five 
gyan=
a-indriyas or senses and five karma-indriyas or organs of 
action), in all =
the devas (33 devas are the source of all 
illumination and enlightenment) =
and the ganas (hosts of demi-gods), 
Shiva exists and pervades as the illum=
ine atma (soul) and is their 
essence. Pustivardhanam is now being explaine=
d. That inward dwelling 
spirit (atman), the Purusha Shiva is the real sust=
ainer of Prakriti 
(and not vice-versa as all people perceive). Starting wi=
th the 
mahatatva (primordial state of matter/energy) to the individual 
pa=
rts of creation, the entire sustenance of the physically created 
beings (b=
oth animate and inanimate) is done by the imperishable 
Purusha. You, I, Br=
ahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & devas 
are maintained/sustaine d (=
by the atma and that is Him). Since the 
Purusha (atma - Shiva) is the gran=
ter of sustenance to prakriti 
(body/nature) , he is 'Pusti-vardhana' ."

H=
aving explained the first two pada of the mantra, Sukracharya 
continued to=
 explain the remaining two pada. He said " the next two 
pada (consisting o=
f sixteen syllables) is Urvarukamiva Bandhanam 
Mrityormukshiya mamritat me=
aning - Prabhu! just as the ripe cucumber 
is severed from the bondage of t=
he creeper, in the same manner may 
we be delivered from death for the sake=
 of immortality (moksha). 
Rudra deva is like amrita (nectar of immortality=
) . Those who worship 
Him with good karma, penance and repentance, meditat=
ion, 
contemplation, prayer or praise, will surely renewed life and vigor. =

The strength of truth force (in this mantra) is such that Lord Shiva 
shal=
l definitely free the worshipper from the bondage of death 
because Shiva a=
lone is the giver of bondage and moksha. 

This is the Mritasanjivani mantr=
a and has the power to give back 
life and rescue from death and great evil=
s. You should adore Lord 
Shiva and recite this mantra. Water sanctified wi=
th this mantra 
should be drunk all the time. [Authors note: It is well kno=
wn that 
the rudraksha bead is placed in a glass of water after being held =
in 
the palm during the recitation of the mantra. this water is drunk 
duri=
ng the day.]

Oblations in the sacrificial fire with this mantra is very 
p=
urifying. Now I shall teach the dhyana for the mantra." Saying so, 
Sukrach=
arya started reciting the shlokas for meditating on Lord 
Shiva.'

Trust th=
is is also available for the general viewing and clarity for 
the members o=
f the Group

Thank you all for providing your valuable view on the matter a=
nd 
enligten me on the subject
