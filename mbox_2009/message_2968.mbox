namaste,

I don't know of any English translation. The relevant section is on page 300
of the pdf (128 of 183) starting with "atha dvitiiya-prashne
aShTAdasho.adhyAyaH ... athAto rudra-snAnArchanavidhim vyAkhyAsyAmaH". It is
a fun read, but it does little more than satisfy intellectual curiosity.

bhavadiiyaH,

       ajit
