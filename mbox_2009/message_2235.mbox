Ajit,

Always refreshing to read your post...this one I could not resist replying
to! I must have read and re-read the book mentioned by you many times. And I
visited Sringeri in June. Now I am reading two books on Sri Abhinava
Vidyateertha Mahaswamigal's Guru, Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal.
Denied the physical presence of his predecessor, what this Mahaswamigal
achieved in his lifetime fairly stretches the imagination!

Anyhow when you refer to this book for the current discussion, are you
alluding to the difference between savikalpa and nirvikalpa samadhi?

best regards
Hari
