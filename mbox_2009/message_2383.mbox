THE FIRST STEPS
Volume 4, Addresses on Bhakti-Yoga

What can be a higher en=
d than God? God Himself is the highest goal of man;
see Him, enjoy Him. We =
can never conceive anything higher, because God is
perfection. We cannot co=
nceive of any higher enjoyment than that of love,
but this word love has di=
fferent meanings. It does not mean the ordinary
selfish love of the world; =
it is blasphemy to call that love. The love for
our children and our wives =
is mere animal love; that love which is perfectly
unselfish is the only lov=
e, and that is of God. It is a very difficult thing
to attain to.

We are p=
assing through all these different loves =97 love of children, father,
moth=
er, and so forth. We slowly exercise the faculty of love; but in the
majori=
ty of cases we never learn anything from it, we become bound to one
step, t=
o one person. In some cases men come out of this bondage. Men are
ever runn=
ing after wives and wealth and fame in this world; sometimes they
are hit v=
ery hard on the head, and they find out what this world really is.

No one =
in this world can really love anything but God. Man finds out that
human lo=
ve is all hollow. Men cannot love though they talk of it. The wife
says she=
 loves her husband and kisses him; but as soon as he dies, the first
thing =
she thinks about is the bank account, and what she shall do the next
day. T=
he husband loves the wife; but when she becomes sick and loses her
beauty, =
or becomes haggard, or makes a mistake, he ceases to care for her.
All the =
love of the world is hypocrisy and hollowness.

We say that a wife loves he=
r husband. She thinks that her whole soul is
absorbed in him: a baby comes =
and half of it goes out to the baby, or more. She
herself will feel that th=
e same love of husband does not exist now. So with
the father. We always fi=
nd that when more intense objects of love come to
us, the previous love slo=
wly vanishes. Children at school think that some of
their schoolfellows are=
 the dearest beings that they have in life, or their
fathers or mothers are=
 so; then comes the husband or wife, and immediately
the old feeling disapp=
ears, and the new love becomes uppermost.

The world presents to us manifol=
d stages of love. We have first to clear the
ground. Upon our view of life =
the whole theory of love will rest. To think
that this world is the aim and=
 end of life is brutal and degenerating. Any
man who starts in life with th=
at idea degenerates himself He will never rise
higher, he will never catch =
this glimpse from behind, he will always be a
slave to the senses. He will =
struggle for the dollar that will get him a few
cakes to eat. Better die th=
an live that life. Slaves of this world, slaves
of the senses, let us rouse=
 ourselves; there is something higher than this
sense-life. Do you think th=
at man, the Infinite Spirit was born to be a
slave to his eyes, his nose, a=
nd his ears? There is an Infinite, Omniscient
Spirit behind that can do eve=
rything, break every bond; and that Spirit we
are, and we get that power th=
rough love.

What is the use of writing a book either to prove or disprove =
God? What does
it matter to most people whether there is a God or not ?The =
majority of men
work just like a machine with no thought of God and feeling=
 no need of Him.
Then one day comes Death and says, "Come." The man says, "=
Wait a little, I
want a little more time. I want to see my son grow a littl=
e bigger." But
Death says, "Come at once." So it goes on. So goes poor John=
. What shall we
say to poor John? He never found anything in which God was =
the highest;
perhaps he was a pig in the past, and he is much better as a m=
an. But there
are some who get a little awakening.

There is a form of reli=
gion which is fashionable. My friend has much
furniture in her parlour; it =
is the fashion to have a Japanese vase, so she
must have one even if it cos=
ts a thousand dollars. In the same way she will
have a little religion and =
join a church. Bhakti is not for such. That is
not want. Want is that witho=
ut which we cannot live. We want breath, we want
food, we want clothes; wit=
hout them we cannot live. When a man loves a woman
in this world, there are=
 times when he feels that without her he cannot
live, although that is a mi=
stake.

When a husband dies, the wife thinks she cannot live without him; b=
ut she
lives all the same. This is the secret of necessity: it is that with=
out
which we cannot live; either it must come to us or we die. When the tim=
e
comes that we feel the same about God, or in other words, we want somethi=
ng
beyond this world, something above all material forces, then we may beco=
me
Bhaktas. What are our little lives when for a moment the cloud passes aw=
ay,
and we get one glimpse from beyond, and for that moment all these lower=

desires seem like a drop in the ocean? Then the soul grows, and feels the
=
want of God, and must have Him.

It is a wellknown psychological phenomenon=
. As the loving wife thinks of her
departed husband, with the same love we =
must desire the Lord, and then we
will find God, and all books and the vari=
ous sciences would not be able to
teach us anything. By reading books we be=
come parrots; no one becomes
learned by reading books. If a man reads but o=
ne word of love, he indeed
becomes learned. So we want first to get that de=
sire.

There is a proverb in our language =97 If I want to be a hunter, I'l=
l hunt the
rhinoceros; if I want to be a robber, I'll rob the king's treasu=
ry. What is
the use of robbing beggars or hunting ants? So if you want to l=
ove, love
God. Who cares for these things of the world?This world is utterl=
y false;
all the great teachers of the world found that out; there is no wa=
y out of
it but through God. He is the goal of our life; all ideas that the=
 world is
the goal of life are pernicious.
