Namaste,
 
No, we have not yet acted on that instruction. I am pleased that=
 some other people (e.g. Shree Maa and her sishya) have done regular Chandi=
 homam for a duration of time.
 
But, establishing the centres as per Mothe=
r's instruction, including the main one in Ujjain, has not happened yet.
 
=
It requires resources that we do not have now. Perhaps the time has not com=
e yet..
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Has any such centre been made yet, where d=

        Namaste friends,

          Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone=
 sent me a few snippets from an 
          interview posted on her website.=
 Please see below.

          It is interesting that she considers Ramakris=
hna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
          is interesting that Ramakrishna =
told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
          show what is truth" =
and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
          is simila=
r to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
         =
 him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

          She told him that man=
y people are and will be born who will perform a short 
          fire ritu=
al on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
        =
  world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that process=
. 
          Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along=
 similar 
          lines.

          My guru was also told by Mother that =
a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
          should be established arou=
nd the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
          day. These pl=
aces do not need to be near any temples or famous places and 
          can=
 be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
 =
         need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare m=
inimum 
          offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times=
 everyday. When a 
          few such centres are established, it will appa=
rently lead to a chain of 
          events that will help re-establish san=
atana dharma.

          Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a=
 Chandi homam everyday for 
          3 years in the same place and finishe=
d 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
          It is the sadhana and puri=
ty of sadhakas that creates energy and brings 
          deities to a place=
. While several ancient temples are without any divine 
          presence =
these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure 
         =
 souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.

 =
         As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam dur=
ing which 
          Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on sp=
reading homam was 
          taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and =
the time of sankalpa was within 
          a few minutes from the actual Ti=
thi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. 
          All of this was a co=
incidence and we were unaware of this significance when 
          we decid=
ed the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
          m=
ention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are 
   =
       similar to the words of Mother.

          Best regards,
          N=
arasimha

          <DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Shree Maa was referred=

          sent me a few snippets from an <BR>interview p=
osted on her website. 
          Please see below.<BR><BR>It is interesting=
 that she considers 
          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It <BR>=
is interesting that 
          Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire cer=
emonies and <BR>show what 
          is truth" and "at that time the whole =
world will be peace". This 
          <BR>is similar to what my guru was to=
ld by Divine Mother when she 
          appeared to <BR>him during Shata Ch=
andi homam at Chennai.<BR><BR>She 
          told him that many people are =
and will be born who will perform a 
          short <BR>fire ritual on a r=
egular basis, establish sanatana dharma 
          and peace in the <BR>wor=
ld and also make quick spiritual progress 
          individually in that p=
rocess. <BR>Shree Maa's statement about what 
          Ramakrishna told he=
r is along similar <BR>lines.<BR><BR>My guru was 
          also told by Mo=
ther that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
          <BR>should be es=
tablished around the world, where Chandi homam is done 
          3 times a=
 <BR>day. These places do not need to be near any temples or 
          fam=
ous places and <BR>can be anywhere. The ritual need not be 
          elabo=
rate. For example, there is no <BR>need to offer silk sarees etc 
         =
 in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum <BR>offerings is enough, 
     =
     but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a <BR>few such 
  =
        centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of 
   =
       <BR>events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.<BR><BR>Thoug=
h 
          not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam every=
day for 
          <BR>3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such hom=
as. That is 
          fantastic! <BR>It is the sadhana and purity of sadha=
kas that creates 
          energy and brings <BR>deities to a place. While=
 several ancient 
          temples are without any divine <BR>presence the=
se days, new places of 
          divine presence may be created by pure <B=
R>souls engaged in selfless 
          sadhana for establishing dharma in t=
he world.<BR><BR>As I mentioned 
          earlier, the sankalpa of the Sha=
ta Chandi homam during which 
          <BR>Mother appeared and gave instru=
ctions to my guru on spreading 
          homam was <BR>taken on Ramakrishn=
a' s birth anniversary and the time 
          of sankalpa was within <BR>a=
 few minutes from the actual Tithi 
          Pravesha time of the birth an=
niversary. <BR>All of this was a 
          coincidence and we were unaware=
 of this significance when <BR>we 
          decided the muhurta. It is int=
