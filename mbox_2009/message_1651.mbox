Namaste,

There are many ways to chant Gayatri mantra. All are valid and work 
differently.

Swami Vivekananda, in one of his books, recommended chanting as

"om tatsavitur ... prachodayaat om"

I recommend declaring "Om bhuurbhuvassuvaH" once at the beginning (but not 
repeat it) and then chanting the above many times.

Actually, for most people stuck in maayaa, it is very useful to chant

"om hriim tatsavitur ... prachodayaat hriim om"

Best regards,
Narasimha
