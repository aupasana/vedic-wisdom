Namaste,

Do not worry. Thoughts and desires without a strong force behind them are 
not a big problem. We engage in many of them. Small thoughts and desires 
without much force behind them are not a big problem.

The desires and thoughts with a strong force behind them are the ones that 
block people. So try not to get attached to anything too much and desire 
anything so badly.

Do your best at any point of time to get what you thing you should get or to 
do what you think you should do. But learn to accept whatever comes your way 
as a result and move on.

Best regards,
Narasimha
