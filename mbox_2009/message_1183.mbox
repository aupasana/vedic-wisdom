Bohra,

Not sure of your intent when you said you want to regulate personal=
 
abilities for maximum performance.

What is driving the desire to maximiz=
e our performance?

Desire is often detrimental to spiritual progress. Even=
 the desire to 
progress spiritually needs to be overcome eventually. How e=
ver, to a 
large part, having one genuine desire is useful to curb other de=
sires.

There is no better way to leverage your energies than believing tha=
t 
you have the energy. In the end, we are no different from the brahman 
h=
imself. It is lack of our realization that keeps us away from the 
limitles=
s energy/bliss.

The day one realizes that one is the brahman himself, ther=
e is no 
material interest in using the end less energy one may obtain!

Ti=
ll then, try to pray to the divine mother to bestow enough energy 
for you =
to carry on the spiritual journey.

Best regards,
Vijay
