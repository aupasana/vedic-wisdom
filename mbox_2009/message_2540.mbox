 If you wish to be a true reformer, you must possess three things.

The fir=
st is to feel. Do you really feel for your brothers? Do you really
feel tha=
t there is so much misery in the world, so much ignorance and
superstition?=
 Do you really feel that all men are your brothers? Does this
idea permeate=
 your whole being? Does it run in your blood? Does it tingle in
your veins?=
 Does it course through every nerve and filament of your body?
Are you full=
 of that idea of sympathy? If you are, that is only the first
step.

Next y=
ou must ask yourself if you have found any remedy. The old ideas may
be all=
 superstition, but in and around these masses of superstition are
nuggets o=
f truth. Have you discovered means by which to keep that truth
alone, witho=
ut any of the dross? If you have done that, that is only the
second step;

=
one more thing is necessary. What is your motive? Are you sure that you are=

not actuated by greed for gold, by thirst for fame or power? Are you reall=
y
sure that you can stand for your ideals and work on, even if the whole wo=
rld
wants to crush you down?Are you sure that you know what you want and wi=
ll
perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are yo=
u
sure that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is=

one pulsation left in the heart?

Then you are a real reformer, you are a =
teacher, a master, a blessing to
mankind.

But man is so impatient, so shor=
tsighted! He has not the patience to wait,
he has not the power to see. He =
wants to rule, he wants results immediately.
Why? He wants to reap the frui=
ts himself and does not really care for
others. Duty for duty=92s sake is n=
ot what he wants. =93To work you have the
right, but not to the fruits ther=
eof,=94 says Krishna. Why cling to results?
Ours is to do our duties. Let t=
he fruits take care of themselves. But man
has no patience; he takes up any=
 scheme that will produce quick results; and
the majority of reformers all =
over the world can be classed under this
heading.
