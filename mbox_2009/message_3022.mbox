Dear Narasimha,

Does this mean a Yogi or teacher who can easily get into n=
irvikalpa samadhi
be able to read
a student's mind who might be several mil=
es away? With nirvikalpa samadhi,
there is no I-ness
and so capabilities li=
ke attain oneness with student's mind might be an easy
task.

-Kishore

    <div>
      
      
      <p>Nam=
aste Hari,<br>
 <br>
Samaadhi is sam+aa+dhi. It is a state of intense menta=
l concentration on something.<br>
 <br>
Kalpa means create or perceive (the=
 word kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. S=
avikalpa means "with vikalpa". Savikalpa samadhi is a state of in=
tense concentration of the mind, while creational variety or objectificatio=
n still exists in the mind. One perceives that there is an "I" an=
d there are "other" objects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). B=
ut one is able to focus the mind intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and=
 able to achieve oneness with that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi =
is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa =
samadhi.<br>

 <br>
In nirvikalpa samadhi, the creational variety and objec=
tification ceases (nirvikalpa=3Dnir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches=
 a state where there is no perception of I and "other" objects. O=
ne's consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aat=
man), without any perception of a variety of objects. This state is reached=
 by very very few yogis.<br>

 <br>
Sahaja samadhi is a state where the min=
d is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* absorbed in the=
 supreme consciousness!<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
When one is=
 normally perceiving a variety objects, one's mind is absorbed in an *i=
ndividualized* consciousness that is colored with the conditioning of that =
individual's experiences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful =
person, one's mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experienc=
es, values and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is prais=
ing one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticiz=
ing one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One's mind=
 has likes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated=
 experiences, values and desires of that individualized consciousness.<br>
=

 <br>
In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one&#=
39;s mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness that is not col=
ored by the experiences and conditioning of a single individual. One is act=
ively living in the material world; one's mind is perceiving various ob=
jects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one's mind is en=
gaging in various actions in the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, o=
ne has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.<br>

 <br>
Very very very =
few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that state=
. For most others, that state is not really a possibility.<br>
 <br>
*     =
   *        *<br>
 <br>
I gave an analogy earlier to explain various aspect=
s of consciousness, using parts of a computer.<br>
 <br>
ahamkaara (I-ness)=
 - CPU<br>
chitta (conditioning) - DRAM<br>
buddhi - ALU or logic coprocess=
or<br>
manas - I/O controller<br>
jnanendriyas - input channels<br>
karmend=
riyas - output channels<br>
praanas - on-board power supply<br>
deha (body)=
 - mechanical parts, chassis etc<br>
 <br>
Normally, CPU is running a compl=
ex program where a lot of input channels and output channels are active. DR=
AM has a lot of stored data and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is run=
ning several algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets sto=
red/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person's n=
ormal state.<br>

 <br>
Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the comput=
er is in a power standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any pow=
er, all input and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned =
off and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power st=
andy and exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similar=
ly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume=
 previous activities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long=
, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. I=
f one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Br=
ahman and cannot resume previous activities.<br>

 <br>
Sahaja samadhi is a=
kin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program ru=
nning on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are ru=
nning on a central super computer and our individual computer's CPU sim=
ply has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running =
on the super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. Th=
ere isn't much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running lo=
cally. One's praanas are supplying power, one's jnanendriyas are ge=
tting inputs and one's karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one's =
manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is contro=
lling all this by running a small program that accesses a super computer th=
at is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding what this comp=
uter should do.<br>

 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
As I said, very ve=
ry very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of e=
ven the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa =
samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness =
after a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM=
). The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and accumul=
ating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization o=
f I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very diff=
icult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I nee=
d this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja sam=
adhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme univ=
ersal I-ness directly to one's mind and body.<br>

 <br>
I cannot make =
judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business. I will take o=
n individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my sense of dharm=
a dictates that I should take them on.<br>
 <br>
But the bottomline is that=
 sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis of an absolutely tremendous=
 caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are like the god - supreme co=
smic being - himself.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
Let me give a=
nother analogy. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like w=
akig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the d=
ream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake.<br>

 =
<br>
This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and diffic=
ult sahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things =
work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.<br=
