Very well said. If feathers are ruffle=
d, so be it!!! but it is a time to come out of the so called *Secular attit=
ude* which is nothing but beating around the bush.

by the way, you must ha=
ve read Naren's opinion on Mohammed's spiritual level in his great work - '=
Rajayoga'.

Warm Regards,
Utpal

There are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a=
