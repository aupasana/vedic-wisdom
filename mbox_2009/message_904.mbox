Dear Sir,
My one mail is still unanswered. Can I give Ahutis for=C2=A0 Ratr=
i Suktam, Devi Suktam, 4th Chapter and 11th Chapter independantly? I mean a=
ny of these four independantly ?
While Chandi Homam you have omitted Devi S=
uktam and Ratri Suktam from Ahutis in your Manual. This reading has created=
 this question in my mind.

r.Ashwin Rawal





Namaste,

Ravi and Utpal ha=
ve replied to you. I will leave the questions they have 
already replied to=
o. As Ravi said, the amount of materials you need depends 
on how big a fir=
e you maintain. You will learn and fine-tune with 
experience.

There may b=
e a tradition in some parts of India to offer a drop of ghee in 
water afte=
r offering it in fire. But it is not necessary. When doing Chandi 
homam, s=
ome people invoke the Mother in an idol and offer water to the idol 
with e=
ach mantra along with offering ghee in fire. Again, it is not 
necessary.

=
Managing ahutis and reading is difficult, but one can master it with 
pract=
ice. It is really advisable for you to do both reading and offering 
ahutis=
 yourself.

Wooden spoon is perfectly alright.

Best regards,
Narasimha
