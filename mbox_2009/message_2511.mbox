Respected Sir,

It has been two days since I have started my Mahalakshmi ho=
mam with sincere prayers. I have been an ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalaks=
hmi for a long time. On the second day itself I felt the presence of the di=
ety in the kund. I don't know if it is my imagination but at the same time =
I also see sudden bad events happening to me. Should I consider it a good s=
ign? Is God testing me or is it my karma? Kindly guide.

Thanks,

Sudha
