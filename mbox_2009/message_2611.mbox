Dear Vijay,
=A0
In my opinion, having a guru is a great thing but practical=
ly, if you do not have one, it should not prevent you from actively making =
self effort. If the self effort is right, someone somewhere will be sent by=
 Nature to give you the necessary guidance. Look=A0at it this way. You have=
 a car. A guru is a petrol pump. Once the car reaches the PP, it can get en=
ough fuel to reach the destination safely. But, to reach the PP one needs=
=A0some balance fuel.=A0=A0That is=A0the self effort you do before Nature d=
ecides to help you. 
=A0
Practically speaking, since the time I had read Ji=
ddu Krishnamurti, I disagreed with him on his ideas about Guru. Though I co=
ncede that a Guru will probably at the most give you the necessary push. di=
rection but finally it is you who must make the journey. The practical step=
 is to keep doing sadhana on your own which is any day better than waiting =
for the Guru to arrive and start things for you. Also, this is a weird age =
we live in. For one genuine person there are 90 fakes of all hues and colou=
rs. I know because I have met some awesome fakes.=A0A regular regime of sad=
hana can actually help you in this regard. One, it will tune your mind to s=
ome fundamental aspects of spirituality and in ways, help you to avoid inco=
rrect people. Some of these incorrect people are even dangerous.
=A0
For qu=
estions number two, my idea is no effort is wasted. Forget about the end of=
 the path, just keep walking. End is not in your hands. Only effort is in y=
our hands.
=A0
The third question is the best one. I do not have any answer=
s to this but merely some opinions which may or may not be correct. Creatio=
n is an act of joy on part of the Brahman. As they say, lila. Lila is play,=
 and play is always fun. Our scriptures say, the Supreme Being projected Hi=
mself/Herslf to into the different polarity to appreciate it's own beauty! =
Like looking in a mirror. Without a duality, one will not know the joy and =
beautify of the unity. A similar kind of explanation also is seen in many a=
ncient so called pagan cultures like Wicca etc.

Recently one of my friend had a question for me:

1. Can=
 a Guru help us? He took Jiddu Krishnamurthy' s view on this. JK claims tha=
t a guru can not help any one and the self realisation has to come from wit=
h in. My friend is asking, if a Guru is useless as JK claims, why did JK wr=
ite so many books (no offence to JK followers)

2. If a person has to reali=
se on himself, how it can be?

3. If the fact is that there is no I but for=
 Brahman, why all this Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go through the=
 misery and in the end realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be Brahm=
an and not create any thing?

I could not give convincing answers to any of=
 the questions.

Best regards,
Vijay
