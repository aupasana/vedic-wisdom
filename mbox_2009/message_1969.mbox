Namaste,

>  But, this has got me into egg-chicken problem.

When the chickens come to roost, there is not much you can do about it. The 
best you can do is to ensure that the eggs you are laying now are good.

The key is to realize that the chickens that come to roost are NOT laying 
the eggs. YOU are.

> Also, what is the extent of fate/free will in anybody's life?

Every conscious action of yours at every instant is done by your individual 
will. It is NOT forced by your fate. Fate does not force ANY actions. All 
actions are performed by YOU now.

But the problem is that the possibilities in front of you are sometimes 
badly limited by the fate.

But always people have more options before them than they think there are. 
Because fate *inclines* them to look at some options and ignore some others, 
they consider fewer options than they actually have.

Fate creates circumstances under which one's individual will performs 
actions.

The first step for spiritual progress is to realize that YOU are responsible 
for the actions of your individual will. The second step is to not cling on 
to your actions and let things go as soon as the action is over 
("krishnaarpanamastu"), i.e. do the action with attachment, but develop 
detachment as soon as the action is over and move on to the next action. 
Often people spend a lot of mental energy on an action that is already done, 
wondering whether it will give a specific result or not, whether a specific 
result that came is because of it or not, why people are reacting in a 
particular way etc etc. The mental energy spent on an action *after* the 
action is completely performed is often much more than the mental energy 
spent on an action while it is performed. All that shapes fate later. As it 
is very difficult to perform actions with detachment as Krishna teaches, I 
suggest performing actions with attachment, but let them go and detach 
yourself *after* they are done and not spend any more mental energy 
analyzing or speculating on .

The final step is to develop detachment even as you are performing actions. 
There is a part of you that is permanent and indestructible. It is watching 
all actions being performed. Attach your self-awareness to that part of you. 
Then your body may be engaged in several actions, but *you* are merely an 
observer. But then, this is not easy. But what I said above is easy. In 
fact, we do say "Krishnaarpanamastu" (may it be offered to Krishna) at the 
end of every ritual. We should do that with all actions.

Best regards,
Narasimha
