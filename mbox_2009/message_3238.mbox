Namaste rajarshi and others,

I too agree with the point that every human =
being(non-veg and veg) is
addicted to food and we can feel the positive dif=
ference experienced by
non-vegetarians when they turn into vegetarian.

But=
 I can't agree with the point say dharma as non-violence and adharma
as vio=
lence. These depends upon their karmic debts and too all plants
and animals=
 are *living beings*.

To my belief there is no point in discussing about v=
egetarianism and
non-vegetarianism.

To my knowledge (this is my personal t=
hinking) adharma is caused while a
person/living-being kills(/hurts) anothe=
r living-being due to his
pride/ego(/without any reason).here living beings=
 refer plants and
animals -plants too die when they are plucked from soil.
=

1.So if a person plucks the plant/flower for presenting to God, the
person=
 is done his dharma as presenting the flower to god and meanwhile
the flowe=
r is done his dharma of reaching god - so that person
indirectly helping th=
e flower to reach god.

2.If a person plucks the same flower for to use for=
 his regular purpose,
then too the person doing his dharma so do the flower=
, the flower done
its dharma of reaching its goal of that person needs.

3.=
If the same person plucks the same flower and throws it away, here the
flow=
er hasn't done it's dharma but the person has done his *dharma of
his sin* =
due to his karmic debt.

This example may be equated for all living beings(=
including animals,
plants and humans) and this may apply to de-forestation,=
 hunting animals
without any reason, etc., so I think there is no point in =
discussing
about vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism, and I think it's a "l=
aw of
the nature"

regards,

Surenthar P.

p.s: I'm not well versed in veda=
, this message is the instance of my
thought on seeing this thread.

After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached
t=
o its body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one.
This =
is not conducive to spiritual progress.

basically addicted to the taste of meat. When he =
forgoes the same, it
requires a degree of will-power and a conscious sense =
of direction in
the mind. Like overcoming any addiction with a clear sense =
of purpose
that I am doing it to help me spiritually benefit. This in turn,=
 when
successfully done, creates a sense of purity in the mind. The reason =
for
the purity is not so much about eating veg food, but more due to the
