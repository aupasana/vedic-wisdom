Dear Shri Narasimha Guru Ji,

Sadar Namaskar,

May request to call you my G=
uruji?

GuruJi, The example quoted is very interesting. My age is about 40 =
years and when at the age of 34 lost my job, meet my named guru Shri Gosain=
 Ji first time who taught me about how to recit various mantra given by him=
 to me. After reciting Mantra for about few month or so regularly my feelin=
g were also great as I used to experience full lightining light with my con=
centration remaining on the Mantra, although have full pleasures of those m=
oments. After being empoyed once again, which was also the motive at that t=
ime to recite those mantra, I used to recite them randomly at home at same =
place say once in a week time and that great feeling is not coming. Now aft=
er busy in my service I do not find time to recit mantra given to me by my =
Guru Ji but whenever find time I do the recitation in my mind. Again the ho=
me responsibilities are there as well. 

May request to know how to get the=
 same great feeling again and again with my busy office work schedule. 

Gu=
ruJi, I am able and trying to learn more and more from your write up on thi=
s blog. Whenever find some time will also try to see all of your earlier wr=
iteup.

Many many thanks

Yours sincerely,
Ganesh Gulati
