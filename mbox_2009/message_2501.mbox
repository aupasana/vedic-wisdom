OMAHA, NEBRASKA, =
September 7, 2009: When Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales) b=
egan teaching as the Resident Acharya of the Hindu Temple in Omaha, just tw=
o years ago, Hindu culture and spirituality blossomed in the community. Ach=
arya, who is the founder of the International Sanatana Dharma Society, used=
 books, lectures, seminars and practical classes to engage new and born Hin=
dus in the wisdom of Hinduism.

Now Acharya, who holds a Ph.D. in Religious=
 Studies, proposes to establish a permanent teaching center and ashram in t=
he Omaha area by this Fall, a resource facility for the dedicated study and=
 practice of Sanatana Dharma. Designed to serve both the local Hindu commun=
ity and be a preferred destination for Dharma students from throughout the =
world, it will house Sri Acharya's classes, satsangs, Hindu Youth Celebrati=
on events and seminars. In addition, the center plans to host seminars, tal=
ks and workshops by many of the world's leading Dharma teachers; house one =
of the nation's few Sanatana Dharma libraries; as well as operate a natural=
 health facility and school, offering such traditional Hindu healing modali=
ties as Ayurveda and Yoga.

The first-phase goal is to purchase a home-cum-=
ashram in the Midtown area of Omaha. With an immediate goal of raising $50,=
000 by December, 2009, the ashram is asking for contributions (all tax dedu=
ctible) you can see the plans here [http://www.dharmacentral.com/ashram.php=
