<p>"T=
he world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sac=
rifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for tha=
t sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment." (Gita III-9)</p>
=


<p>When we are born into a particular set up of circumstances which we ca=
ll a family, all the conditioning factors of the family are also born toget=
her with us. The tradition of the family grows when we grow. The pattern of=
 our character and conduct is entirely determined by the idealogical backgr=
ound that is at the very basis of the structure of that particular family. =
We are born not merely in a family but also in wider circumstances called t=
he community, nation, world, universe, etc., to all which we owe obligation=
s. Our obligation to a condition into which we are born is sacrifice or=A0<=
i>Yajna</i>=A0and that is what Bhagavan Sri Krishna speaks of in the above =
verse.</p>


<p>When we are born, we are born with certain obligations. Wha=
t are these obligations? They are the allegiance that we perforce owe to th=
ose factors that are responsible for our birth and maintenance. That is the=
 sacrifice which we are called upon to do. In the=A0<i>Vedas</i>, which are=
 antecedent even to the Mahabharata and the Bhagavadgita, we are given the =
first primeval concept of sacrifice. Supreme sacrifice is extolled in the=
=A0<i>Veda</i>, according to which the Absolute itself is the first perform=
er of the=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0and not a=A0<i>Pandit</i>. The Absolute did the =
first=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0and then the others followed. They are only imitatin=
g what the Absolute did, originally.</p>


<p>What was the sacrifice that t=
he Absolute did and who was the performer of that sacrifice? Where was the=
=A0<i>Vedi</i>=A0or the=A0<i>Yajna-kunda</i>=A0for that sacrifice and what =
was the material that was offered in that sacrifice?=A0<i>'Yajnena Yajn=
amayajanta Devah'</i>, says the=A0<i>Purusha-Sukta</i>.=A0<i>Yajna</i>=
=A0was the sacrifice,=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0was offered in=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0by=
=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0for the sake of<i>Yajna</i>. Sacrifice was offered in the=
 sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the sake of sacrifice. What do you u=
nderstand from this? You understand nothing, except a jumble of words. Simi=
lar to this enigmatic statement of the=A0<i>Veda</i>, we have another state=
ment in the Bhagavadgita also:=A0<i>'Brahmarpanam Brahmahavir-Brahmagno=
u Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma Samadhina'</i>. =
Brahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of Brahman. What d=
oes it mean? It seems as confusing as that=A0<i>Vedic Mantra</i>. But let u=
s remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It is a universal i=
nvolvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the property of the who=
le creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become the property of=
 everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us, and we must giv=
e it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. That obligation is=
 the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the=A0<i>Yajna</i>.</=
p>


<p>Our obligation is not merely to our parents, brothers and sisters, =
not merely to the government of our country that protects us, not merely to=
 the planet earth on which we live, not merely to the solar system which gi=
ves us light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger demands upon us a=
nd if we can think for a moment the obligations that we really owe to this =
wonderful creation of God, we will not be able to breathe for a moment! Bec=
ause we are not able to fulfil all these obligations in a short span of lif=
e, we are reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we have fulfilled or =
discharged all our duties in this very life itself, why should we take next=
 birth! But, life is short, and also we have not got the least concept of w=
hat obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Even when we are ni=
nety years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, naturally we die wi=
th ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not able to discharge ou=
r duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the duties and obligatio=
ns properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so long as we do not un=
derstand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected to perform and f=
ulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our existence, we ca=
nnot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.</p>


<p>What are =
the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning factor. They ha=
ve given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and educate us. Society=
 is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe to the society. T=
hough it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the society protects us, t=
akes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and the international=
 system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short, the whole cosm=
os helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to all things in the =
universe. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a part of our clo=
th gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a thorn and move =
forward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us from behind. When w=
e try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find ourselves unabl=
e to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are caught from ano=
ther side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we will find that a=
nother obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have an integral visio=
n of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have a very narrow vi=
sion of things and it is this narrow vision that is responsible for our bir=
th and death.</p>


<p>This mysterious law, the law of=A0<i>Yajna</i>, oper=
ates in the world.=A0<i>'Yajno vai Vishnuh'</i>--Supreme Narayana H=
imself is called=A0<i>Yajna</i>. The term '<i>Yajna</i>' signifies =
the whole of the culture of=A0<i>Bharatavarsha</i>. If you want one word wh=
ich can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture of India, '=
;<i>Yajna</i>' is that word. How meaningful it is, we can imagine. Ever=
y cultural pattern and every presupposition of human existence is contained=
 in this pregnant term '<i>Yajna</i>', which means the universal sa=
crifice that the soul performs. The performer of the sacrifice is the soul.=
 It is not an=A0<i>Acharya</i>=A0or a=A0<i>Pandit</i>.</p>


<p>In the=A0<i=
>Anugita</i>=A0of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the Bhagavadgita, t=
his=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is described in a very beautiful form. It states what=
=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0actually is. This=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is going on daily in t=
his body and it is going on everywhere in the world, outside and inside. It=
 is sacrifice of all those factors which tend to tether the soul to the bod=
ily tabernacle into the fire of the knowledge of the Absolute. This is call=
ed=A0<i>Jnana-Yajna</i>=A0which means the offering of knowledge into the fi=
re of Knowledge. Which knowledge is offered into which knowledge? The knowl=
edge of our individual existence in all its aspects is offered in the knowl=
edge of the Supreme Being. The concept of this mysterious=A0<i>Dharma</i>=
=A0before us cannot be contained in our minds. Our heads will burst if we s=
tart thinking deeply about these implications of our life.</p>


<p>Knowled=
ge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowledge neces=
sary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition, intuition =
or forevision that people cannot contain the=A0<i>Vedic</i>=A0knowledge in =
their heads.=A0<i>'Ananta vai Vedah'</i>--<i>Vedas=A0</i>are endles=
s or infinite, which means to say knowledge has no limit. People in this=A0=
<i>Kali Yuga</i>=A0especially are so feeble physically, morally and intelle=
ctually, that this truth has to be instilled into their minds through some =
other manner. This is why=A0<i>Vyasa</i>=A0wrote the great Epic Mahabharata=
. He found out that the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are of no use to poor human beings=
 in this=A0<i>Kali Yuga</i>. Whatever the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0say would not en=
ter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowledge. How ma=
ny of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in our way o=
f thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scientific thin=
king as is contained in the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0is far from us.</p>


<p>When =
I say the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are scientific, I am not making a joke. Masters =
like Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the=A0<i>Arya Samaj</i>; Sayana=
, the great commentator of the<i>Vedas</i>; Aurobindo, of our own times; th=
e Puri Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all have strug=
gled to point out that every science is contained in the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. Ev=
en subjects such as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the highest =
type in differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is in the=A0<=
i>Vedas</i>. Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called 'Vedi=
c Mathematics', and it has been published by the Benares Hindu Universi=
ty. The=A0<i>Veda Samhitas=A0</i>contain the highest reaches of Mathematics=
. Many think that the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are only some foolish chants of cowh=
erds of Punjab, as British historians tell us. The=A0<i>Aryans</i>=A0were r=
egarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and blabbering something a=
nd that became the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. This is the British interpretation of ou=
r culture, which has gone into our heads! The=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are not blab=
bering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic souls who=
 had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this vision-integral conta=
ins every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, mathem=
atics, astronomy, alchemy,=A0<i>Ayurveda</i>, military science and what not=
. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore, bid good-bye to=A0<i>=
Vedas</i>. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, wrote the Mahabha=
rata and the=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0to explain these very impersonal scientific=
 truths of the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0in personal Epic style.</p>


<p>In village=
s some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a Sari. She c=
annot tell directly to her husband, 'I want a Sari'. So, she will s=
ay: "The neighbour's wife has purchased a new Sari today; it is ve=
ry good, very nice; I saw it myself." Her husband understands her inte=
ntions. He will say: "Why do you describe all these things? All right,=
 I will purchase one for you." And the poor man purchases a Sari. The =
Epics and=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0follow a similar indirect way of instructing t=
he truths. But the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0directly tell the truth openly: 'Yo=
u must do this, it is like this.' This is scientific. Science always pl=
ainly tells the truth as it is, without any camouflage. The Epics and the=
=A0<i>Puranas</i>=A0do not say directly that you must be a good man. They s=
ay: 'Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so immense. He shared =
everything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous that as a result he =
got so many things.' One who hears this feels: 'Oh, I see, then I m=
ust also do like that.' These texts are called=A0<i>Suhrit-Sammitas</i>=
, while the=A0<i>Vedas</i>=A0are known as=A0<i>Prabhu-Sammitas</i>. The lat=
ter command like a master. Science always commands on principles. The Puran=
as and Epics give stories, ancient history and make us think scientifically=
 in an indirect manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is why it =
is said=A0<i>'Bharatam Panchamo Vedah'</i>. While the=A0<i>Vedas</i=
>=A0are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata is the fifth<i>Veda</i>. It is=
 as important as the=A0<i>Vedas</i>. Sometimes they say, it is even more im=
portant than the=A0<i>Vedas</i>.</p>


<p>Whatever it is, when knowledge ge=
ts adulterated through intense sensory activity, weakness of will and lack =
of moral force, the understanding of=A0<i>Dharma</i>=A0also falls. So we mu=
st have a whip to goad us to the path of=A0<i>Dharma</i>, spirituality and =
God-consciousness. The tradition of India, Bharatavarsha, is full of such g=
oading whips. While the=A0<i>Vedas</i>, the Puranas and the Epics may be sa=
id to be direct teachers in an institution or an academy, the culture of In=
dia has also instituted many occasions for bringing home to our mind facts =
of our eternal glory and our duties to God, the world and mankind. We owe t=
hree kinds of duty which are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of the Bha=
gavadgita<i>, 'Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani manishinam'</i>. T=
hey are=A0<i>Yajna, Dana=A0</i>and=A0<i>Tapas</i>.=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0itself =
contains in its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethics. S=
till we are told<i>Yajna</i>,=A0<i>Dana</i>=A0and=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0constitu=
te the highest necessity of religion. While=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0is the duty th=
at we owe to our own selves,=A0<i>Dana</i>=A0is that which we owe to others=
, and=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is that we owe to God.=A0<i>Tapas</i>=A0is austerity=
. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life.=A0<i>Dana=
</i>=A0is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in respe=
ct of others, while=A0<i>Yajna</i>=A0is the self-dedication we make of our =
own self wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.</p>


<p>We have various =
occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold duty. They are =
called=A0<i>Vratas</i>, some of which are annual, some monthly and some dai=
ly. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day (<i>Cha=
turdasi</i>) of the dark-fortnight in the month of=A0<i>Kartika</i>=A0(Octo=
ber-November). People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat delicio=
us dishes. Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. There =
is an atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped and =
Divine grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with this=
 celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon Nar=
akasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka, fro=
m where he brought the=A0<i>Parijata</i>=A0plant, to fulfil the wishes of S=
atyabhama, his consort.</p>


<p>The Dipavali festival is regarded as an oc=
casion particularly associated with an ancient event of Sri Krishna overcom=
ing the demoniacal force known as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and Pur=
anas. After the great victory over Narakasura in a battle, which appears to=
 have lasted for long, long days, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabhama r=
eturned to his abode in Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxious=
 about the delay caused in Sri Krishna's returning and it is said that =
they were worshipping Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare of e=
veryone and the quick returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. And=
, after Sri Krishna returned, the story goes that he took a bath after appl=
ying oil over his body, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic wo=
rk he had to do in the war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected wit=
h Sri Krishna's ritual is also one of the reasons for people necessaril=
y remembering to take an oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi, pr=
ior to the Amavasya, when Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India reme=
mbers to take an oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour of, =
Bhagavan Sri Krishna's doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Havin=
g taken the bath, they all joined together in great delight in the grand wo=
rship of Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. This i=
s the traditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the worshi=
ps connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.</p>


<p>There i=
s a third aspect of it which is called=A0<i>Bali Padya</i>, the day followi=
ng Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly connecte=
d with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another background alt=
ogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as Vamana, besto=
wed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when He took a Co=
smic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can read in the=
 Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.</p>


<p>Bali Chakravarti was himself a great=
 devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and having submitted himself to being th=
rown into the nether regions by the pressure of the foot of Narayana in the=
 Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of Him to have some occasion to come up =
to the surface of the earth and then be recognised as a devotee of Bhagavan=
 Narayana Himself. This recognition, this hallowed memory of Bali Chakravar=
ti, is celebrated on the first day of the bright fortnight following the Am=
avasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of the terms used to designate this =
occasion, the day next to Amavasya.</p>


<p>So, the sum and substance of t=
he message connected with Dipavali is that it is a three day festival, begi=
nning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to Amavasya; then the main Lakshm=
i worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and the third day which is Bali Pa=
dya connected with the honour bestowed upon Bali Chakravarti as a devotee o=
f Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion for spiritual exhilaration, a l=
ighting up of all darkness, socially as well as personally, outwardly and i=
nwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry of the Supreme Light of God i=
nto the hearts of all people.</p>

<i></i>
<p><i>Dipavali</i>=A0means the l=
ine of lights.=A0<i>Dipa</i>=A0is light; and=A0<i>Avali</i>=A0means line. S=
o,=A0<i>Dipavali</i>=A0or the festival of the line of lights is the celebra=
tion of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the victory of=
 the=A0<i>Sattvic</i>=A0or divine elements in us over the=A0<i>Rajasic</i>=
=A0and=A0<i>Tamasic</i>=A0or baser elements which are the real=A0<i>Asuras<=
/i>, the=A0<i>Rakshasas</i>,=A0<i>Narakasura</i>=A0and others. The whole wo=
rld is within us. The whole cosmos can be found in a microscopic form in ou=
r own body.=A0<i>Rama-Ravana-Yuddha</i>=A0and=A0<i>Tarakasura-Vadha</i>, an=
d all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside us. This Dipavali is t=
hus also a psychological context, wherein we contemplate in our own selves =
the holy occasion of self-mastery, self-subjugation and self-abnegation lea=
ding to the rise of all spiritual virtues which are regarded as lustre or r=
adiance emanating from Self-Knowledge.=A0<i>Bhagavati Mahalakshmi</i>, the =
Goddess of prosperity, does not merely mean the Goddess of wealth in a mate=
rial sense.=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>=A0does not mean only gold and silver.=A0<i>Lak=
shmi</i>=A0means prosperity in general, positive growth in the right direct=
ion, a rise into the higher stages of evolution. This is the advent of=A0<i=
>Lakshmi</i>. Progress and prosperity are=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>. In the=A0<i>Vis=
hnu Purana</i>=A0we are told if=A0<i>Narayana</i>=A0is like the sun,=A0<i>L=
akshmi</i>=A0is like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Whereve=
r=A0<i>Narayana</i>=A0is, there is=A0<i>Lakshmi</i>. Wherever is divinity, =
there is prosperity. So on this day of=A0<i>Dipavali</i>=A0we worship the S=
upreme God who is the source of all conceivable virtues, goodness and prosp=
erity, which is symbolised in illumination, lighting and worship in the for=
m of=A0<i>Arati</i>=A0and gay joyous attitude and feeling in every respect.=
 So, in short, this is a day of rejoicing over the victory of=A0<i>Sattva</=
i>=A0over the lower=A0<i>Gunas</i>, the victory of God Himself over the bin=
ding fetters of the soul.</p>
