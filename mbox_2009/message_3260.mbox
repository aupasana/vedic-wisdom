Namaste Narsimhaji,

>From your point of view, homam is the best option for =
spiritual growth.
But someone at  my workplace told me, if we go on giving =
weightage to the five elements then 'earth' element is least favourable for=
, then water ,then fire , then air and then comes akash tattawa for spiritu=
al growth.So, instead of taking the path of fire(homam) we should take path=
 of air(breathing practices).How far is this correct? and if it is true the=
n is there any method of using akash tattwa?

Secondly,do you plan to make =
a video of pitri tarpana? bcoz i have never seen any body doing tarpana.
