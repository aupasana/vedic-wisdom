Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I was throwing away old newspaper cuttin=
gs when I saw the following--
Savitarka Samadhi- 
Savitarka Samadhi is the =
pose in which there is a dialogue or argument in one part of consciousness =
with the other part of same consciousness. Here, there is a dialogue happen=
ing between the knower, known and knowing, meaning a dialogue with logical =
subtle reasoning happening within oneself
Samprajnata Samadhi-
The word Sam=
prajnata Samadhi is combination of Sam+Prajnata means---knowledge with awar=
eness--. And this awareness is in the form of reasoning, reflaction, bliss =
and individuality.
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -----------------
After Totapuri left =
Ramkrishan Paramhans decided to go in to Nirvekalpa Samadhi for long time i=
n the same small room where Totapuri had taught him.. During this time of n=
early six month a helper would put food forcefully in RKP mouth to keep the=
 body alive. Then Divine Mother asked RKP to come out of it return to Templ=
e after six months..

I was thinking that in Nirvekalpa state a soul or con=
sciousness (( are these two same things)) is merged in Nirgun Brahman, like=
 we pour water from a glass in to a lake.
So when we dip glass in to water =
to fill it, is it the same consciousness of the body with less impurities t=
hen before. If it is, then it did not merge fully. Something remain separat=
ed to identify it with body.
When RKP was leaving physical body he said to =
Swami Vivekananda that he is same as previous avatars but not in a vedatani=
c sense. It is quite possible as RKP was six months in Nirvekalpa Samadhi w=
hich in itself is a non human thing, his whole inner consciousness changed.=
 Only Mother knows what is real.

When I was living in a ashram a sadhu cam=
e to live in next room to me. After initial talks he said that his mind is =
fixed on God and deep meditation and things like that although he did not u=
se the word samadhi. I saw him sitting staring in distance.

Next day when =
I saw him I noticed his eyes were red. I said, are you alright?. Do you hav=
e fever. He said he is ok, no fever etc. I was very very very naive. He was=
 on ganja. I did not speak to him again. 2/3 days later he was asked to lea=
ve.

When I came to London I saw several writings where authors have descri=
be their experiences using mind altering substances. Who knows if it was a =
real samadhi or deep trances.
I have not used ganja etc ever but when I go =
back to India I will learn how to use it and then abracadabra I will be in =
samadhi. One small problem though. I need permission from Mother and She wi=
ll not give it.
