Namaste Mitesh,

Thank you for your suggestion. I will look into that.

To clarify, I wasn't specifically looking for just the Samputikarana
methods...it is the discussion that got me thinking about Chandi Paath
books in Sanskrit and if people have any direct experience reading them
and if they would recommend any.

I will follow Narasimha's advice and get the Gita Press book.

Chandraprakash

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Samputikarana with beejas (Re: a question on Chandi Paath..)





Namaste

Samputikarana is true with all chantings of things like sundarkand, ramayana and others. 

It is mostly secretly passed in India via word of mouth from a saint to his/her devotees. It is very effective as the results have been tested.

One such book that I have read is as follows:

Pronunciation and the Chandi Samputs

By Swamiji and Shree Maa
www.shreemaa. org

Pronunciation and the Chandi Samputs contains a collection of stories about sadhus' chanting, and about the constituent ingredients of intention, motivation, sincerity, attention, bhava, and understanding. It shares an outline of the history of Sanskrit literature, and details the origins of transliteration into Roman characters. It discusses the various styles of chanting among sadhus, and describes the differences in the alphabets of the differing languages of India . Then it details the Sadhana of the Chandi: different ways of chanting for different purposes. Ultimately it defines many of the Chandi Samputs, and describes the siddhis for which each would be employed.
It's a small book, a simple book, but I think it is very important for students of Sanskrit. 

Best Regards
Mitesh
