Pranapada and Gayatri Mantra
Posted: Apr 5th, 2009 | Comments: =

by Nitish Arya

This article explores the underlying un=
ity in concept of Prana-pada and
(Savitur) Gayatri Mantra. It explains the =
calculation of Pranapada,
given in Jyotish text by Sage Parashara, and its =
impact on the spiritual
evolution of man according to Yoga principles.

To =
understand the Prana-pada is to appreciate the impact of Sun (Nature)
on hu=
man evolution. Remembring the words of Paramahansa Yogananda in his
famous =
'Autobiography of a Yogi',  the ancient rishis discovered that
man's earthl=
y and heavenly environment, in twelve-year cycles, push him
forward on his =
natural path. It explains that the 6 spinal centers
(medullary, cervical, d=
orsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses)
correspond to the 12 astral =
signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man
(KalaPurusha in Jyotish). That=
 the astral/subtle system of a human being
is interrelated with the physica=
l sun and the twelve zodiacal signs.
This implies that movement of prana-pa=
da in Zodiac has an
interconnection with the movement of life-force in the =
astral/subtle
body of man.

Prana-pada is calculated as a function of longi=
tude of Transit Sun, time
elapsed (in ghati) since Sunrise and the Sign tha=
t Sun is transiting. 
We are only concerned with the movement of Pranapada =
at the time of
Solar ingress into the next Sign in Zodiac. This can be unde=
rstood as
follows:

1. Sun transits through a Zodiacal sign in about 30 day=
s. While in a
sign, owing to the Guna of sign, Sun acquires a predominant G=
una (i.e.
one of the three - Satva,Rajas, Tamas). Thus, Sun acquires Satva,=
 Rajo,
Tamo gunas in Dual, Fixed, Movable signs respectively. This happens
=
cyclically 4 times in an year (3 Gunas x 4 =3D 12 signs), as there are 4
Du=
al, 4 Fixed and 4 Movable signs each in the Zodiac.

2. When Sun moves to n=
ext sign it acquires another Guna. Also, during
transit to another sign, it=
 instantly pushes pranapada forward by 240
degrees ahead in the Zodiac or t=
o the beginning of the 9th sign. Note
that with every 240 degrees movement,=
 Guna associated with the Pranapada
(Pranapada being a reference point acqu=
ires the guna of the underlying
sign) changes. The change of Guna for Prana=
pada happens according to
Tamo->Rajo, Rajo->Satva, Satva->Tamo. This moveme=
nt of Prana-pada has
two-fold implications:

a.) In a metaphysical sense,  =
change of Guna activates the corresponding
channel (Nadi) in the subtle bod=
y (Chitra Nadi for Satva Guna, Vajra
Nadi for Rajo Guna, and Sushumna Nadi =
for Tamo Guna) since it is
accompanied with force, caused by Solar ingress =
into next Sign, that
instantly pushed prana-pada by 8 signs in the Zodiac. =
Thus, motion of
Pranapada in 3 months, acquiring three different Gunas in t=
he process,
and activating the Tamo, Rajo and Satva Gunas in a cyclic order=
 is an
indicator of gradual refinement of impressions (cleansing) in the as=
tral
system of man even as Sushumna, Vajra, and Chitra Nadis are successive=
ly
finer. This establishes the importance of Solar ingress in a Sign as
cau=
sing refinement of consciousness associated with the subtle channels
of ene=
rgy.

b.) Pranapada moving 240 degree or 8 signs ahead in a month, and thus=
 24
signs in 3 months. Putting mantra into the Zodiac, each of these 24 sig=
n
movements is likened to an Akshara of the Savitur Gayatri mantra of 24
Ak=
shara. Also, the Gayatri mantra is divided into three parts that are
arrang=
ed in the order of Tamo, Rajo and Satva Guna respectively*. The
relationshi=
p between Pranapada and Gayatri Mantra is underscored by the
fact that Gaya=
tri Mantra is dedicated to Sun, that Veda-mata Gayatri is
referred to as a =
sister to the Sun God/Surya, and that Gayatri mantra is
recited to protect =
ones' Prana. Thus, the cleansing and uplifting role
of Pranapada and Gayatr=
i mantra is clearly brought out and it can be
said that the subtle effect (=
on Prana) of movement of Sun in firmament
is same as recitation of Gayatri =
Mantra.

3. In 3 months, Prana(-pada) cleanses the subtle body impressions =
once,
4 times in an year and 48 times in 12 years. Since there are 49 Marut=
s**
in the astral body, the 49th being representative of the divine
awarene=
ss(Refer: Bhagavad Gita - Marichi among the Maruts) in
Kutastha(forehead), =
it is clear that the subtle body cleansing effected
by Pranapada in 12 year=
s, brings about "slightest spiritual evolution"
in the astral brain and eff=
ects a glimpse of divine Kutastha Chetana.

Thus, the relationship between =
the Prana-pada and Gayatri Mantra, as
well as the role of Pranapada in prog=
ressive cleansing of human subtle
body consciousness has been explained.

*=
 The three parts of the the tri-pad Savitur Gayatri mantra can be
understoo=
d as invocations to the three Gunas of Saguna Brahman as
follows, based on =
the objective of the invocation:
Tamo Guna  - Tat Savitur Varenyam
Rajo Gun=
a  - Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi
Satva Guna - Dhiyo Yo NaH Prachodayat
** There =
are 7 principle Vayus in the Astral system of man as well as in
the Univers=
e. These are further divided into 7 parts each giving rise to
49 Maruts or =
life-currents. These 49 Maruts are said to move at the
front of the chariot=
 of Sun God as it moves through the firmament. They
are also divided amongs=
t the 6 plexuses: medullary (1), cervical (16),
dorsal(12), lumbar(10), sac=
ral(6), and coccygeal(4).

Nitish
