Dear Devotees,

I am new to homam and this group. I was reading the homam m=
anual. Each and every detail has been explained with great clarity, but it =
doesn't mention as to how to turn off the fire after the homam's done. What=
's the ideal method of putting it off? 
Also I live in US, every room has a=
 fire alarm and outside its very cold. Anyone living in US and doing havan.=
 How do you manage any ideas would be of great help?

Thanks all,

Sudha
