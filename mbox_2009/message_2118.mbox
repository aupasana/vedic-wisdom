Namaste Vinita bahen,

It is again a coincidence. i thought in a simmilar l=
ine yesterday. See, The RT Ganapati who was not worshipped by you, actually=
 made you to worship him everyday by the way of Homam. now pl. listen to my=
 story.

Important thing which struck only yesterday after writing the emai=
l. I said that The RT Ganapati Idol which was not worshiped by me for long =
time. The Ganapati would have felt very annoyed. he would have thought i am=
 a GOD with Right side trunk and this stupid, ignorant fella is not worship=
ing me so finally he arranged for my Real Guru and made me to worship HIM d=
irectly by Homam:). by the way, the name of the apartment in Mumbai where i=
 stay is GANESH KRUPA.

Vigneshwaraay Varadaay Surapriyaay
Lambodaraay Saka=
laay Jagadhhitaay
Nagaananaay shruti yagna vibhushitaay
Gaurisutaay Gananaa=
th namo namaste.

utpal
