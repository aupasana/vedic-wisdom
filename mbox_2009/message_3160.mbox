Dear Siva,

know the May 13, 1956, Papanasam, TN part. I would love to have the exact t=

Thanks

r is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is ca=
pable of guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without =
having to be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams =
(I myself had that experience twice), some in person and several via variou=
s other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the =
Master is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri's e=
laborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enoug=
h to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru c=
an be established.

charging money for its courses: AOL is world's largest volunteer run organi=
zation. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monit=
ory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by =
volunteers. Many of the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative car=
eers and millions worth in property to become teachers and teach for free. =
Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers in=
cluding Sri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous con=
ditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highe=
st Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.

 paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is S=

e they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing sever=
al AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for=
 free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disa=
ster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL =
and teach courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not=
 advertise it or make a show of it.
