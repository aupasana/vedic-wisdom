Namaste

I was browing a web site (www.jyotishsastra.com)and found Gayatri =
mantra as follows:

The Mantra

Aum
Bhuh Bhuvah Svah(give a fraction of a s=
econd halt here)
Tat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of a second halt her=
e)
Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second halt here)
Dhiyo Yo=
 nah Prachodayat

I always pronounced as
Aum Bhur and not Bhuh.

What is co=
rrect way to saying it bhur or bhuh. 
The lokas are Bhu, Bhuvah and Svaha. =


I do believe above is the correct way of saying the verse, i.e. halting f=
or a second.


I always have used the above mantra except for slight confus=
ion with pronounciation of Bhuh versus Bhur

Any Thoughts or opinions

Best=
 Regards
Mitesh
