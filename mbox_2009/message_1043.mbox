Very true indeed. Hinduism has faced some of the severest as=
sults across histroy from various groups of invaders, we do not have a cent=
ral religious authority governing all Hindus and yet Hinduism exists inspit=
e of severe persecution that it had faced from other religions.=C2=A0It is =
truely amazing.
=C2=A0
And this too is correct, as you said, Sanatan Dharma=
 can never perish. Nature is with him who follows this dharma. Yet, when I =
see people and there are plenty of them, trying to malign, belittle or deli=
betaly spread misinformation and disrespect for Hinduism, it gets a little =
too much to bear. And then I wonder, inspite of so many great great souls h=
aving incarnated in this holy land, why does Sanatan Dharma=C2=A0have to go=
 through such phases.
=C2=A0
Maybe it is the disease of the age we live in.=
 One feels frustated and angry at how things are going and feel like doing =
something about it, yet we do not what needs to be done. Nor do we know whe=
ther we are even capable of doing anything. All this just makes me more dej=
ected and wonder at Nature's plans.
=C2=A0
By the way, Nepal is now officia=

Namaste,

Modern religions like Christianity and Islam almost completely w=
iped out 
native religions wherever they went (e.g. countries in Africa, So=
uth 
America, America etc). However, despite foreign invasion and complete =

foreign control of India for a millennium, Hinduism is still basically doi=
ng 
ok. True, some damage has been done, but it is still standing tall and =
firm 
enough. Isn't it amazing?

In fact, Hinduism is a word coined by outs=
iders. To Hindus, the correct term 
is "sanatana dharma", i.e. perennial sp=
irit of righteousness. By definition, 
it is perennial. I am firmly convinc=
ed that it cannot be destroyed. Even if 
it seems close to extinction, it w=
ill come back up. That is the nature of 
this dharma. I am not worried abou=
t Sanatana dharma being damaged or 
destroyed.

I will continue to discharg=
e what *I* believe nature expects from *me* and 
what I believe is *my* dha=
rma, without any worry whatsoever that sanatana 
dharma is in some kind of =
danger of extinction. However, such a belief is 
vital for some people to d=
ischarge *their* dharma and hence we have some 
people driven by that sense=
 of danger and the resulting fear and anger. That 
is ok too.

* * *

Sadgu=
ru Samartha Ramadas is not an ordinary soul. He is born with an amsa of 
Lo=
rd Hanuman. His words may be slightly misunderstood.

To somebody like him,=
 it would not matter whether a nation calls itself 
Hindu or secular or wha=
tever. What would matter is whether dharma is 
followed or not.

Right now,=
 we do not have sanatana dharma being followed in any country, in 
secular =
India or in Hindu Nepal or in many other countries following 
secularism or=
 various religions.

If it is indeed God's wish that sanatana dharma be est=
ablished in the world, 
it will happen when its time comes.

Best regards,
=
Narasimha
