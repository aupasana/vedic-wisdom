Dear Mitesh,

> Why coin new fancy names and definitions as there may already be
> appropriate names and definitions in our scripture.

Sorry, I may have confused you a little. The names of the tongues of fire 
were not "coined" by me. They are actually quite well-known. It is regarding 
the significance and meaning of each tongue that I had to fall back to what 
I referred to as internal sources. I thought you were enquiring about the 
interpretation and not about the actual names themselves, because the names 
themselves are quite famous. So I explained how I got that understanding of 
the meaning.

So, I did not really coin any "fancy names".

Usually scriptures only mention raw knowledge and interpretation is left 
out. A lot of interpretive knowledge is usually not found in scriptures. You 
usually do not get it by research or checking many references. You usually 
get it from either a learned person or from within.

*        *        *

Good or bad, I do not think in terms of whether a piece of knowledge I share 
here is an amazing insight that inspires someone or a "bastardization" that 
"eventually leads to wrong practices". What I know from inside and feel 
inspired to share, I share.

Someone may have a question. When She wants to answer, She may use me as an 
instrument. She may want to delude some with wrong knowledge in one case or 
inspire some with good knowledge in another case. In either case, I look at 
myself as a mere instrument and do not try to distinguish between the two 
cases. She does whatever She does in each case. I submit myself to Her and 
She can use me for *any* purpose. I am a servant who carries the parcel. My 
master is welcome to use me for carrying valuable articles or useless junk. 
My master must have a reason for giving me a parcel to carry and I carry it.

Best regards,
Narasimha
