Namaste Rajarshi,

Thank you for you explanation and admire your knowledge.=
 Yes if one can travel faster than speed of light, he/she/it can create a g=
reat confusion at our reference. i.e. as you said result will be before exa=
m.

>Thus the idea of God having fixed everything may not make any sense >t=
o God, but creates a lot of theoritical confusion for us. 

:) GOD is never=
 confused i guess but we are really (con)fused! (He is like sitting on a to=
p of mountain watching cars coming from both ends while we are like drivers=
 in the cars) and hence sometime we get in to such brain storming activitie=
s. moreover our commonsense, logic and other unwanted garbage helps adding =
more confusions and Some verse of Shastraas add spice in that.

big thank y=
ou for your response.

best regards,

Utpal

 Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to m=
