Talk 251

D. Can I engage in spiritual practice, even remaining in samsara?=


Maharshi: Yes, certainly. One ought to do so.

D.: Is not samsara a hindr=
ance? Do not all the holy books advocate
renunciation?

Maharshi: Samsara i=
s only in your mind. The world does not speak out, saying
=91I am the world=
=92. Otherwise, it must be ever there - not excluding your
sleep. Since it =
is not in sleep it is impermanent. Being impermanent it has
no stamina. Hav=
ing no stamina it is easily subdued by the Self. The Self
alone is permanen=
t.Renunciation is non-identification of the Self with the
non-self. On the =
disappearance of ignorance the non-self ceases to exist.
That is true renun=
ciation.

D.Why did you then leave your home in your youth?

Maharshi:That =
is my prarabdha (fate). One=92s course of conduct in this life
is determine=
d by one=92s prarabdha. My prarabdha is this way. Your prarabdha
is that wa=
y.

D. Should I not also renounce?

Maharshi: If that had been your prarabd=
ha, the question would not have
arisen.

D. I should therefore remain in th=
e world and engage in spiritual practice.
Well, can I get realisation in th=
is life?

Maharshi: This has been already answered. You are always the Self=
. Earnest
efforts never fail. Success is bound to result.
