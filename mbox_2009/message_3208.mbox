 Once, several men were crossing the Ganges in a boat. One of them, a
pandi=
t, was making a great display of his erudition, saying that he had
studied =
various books=97the Vedas, the Vedanta, and the six systems of
philosophy. =
He asked a fellow passenger, "Do you know the Vedanta?"
"No,revered sir." "=
The Samkhya and the Patanjala?"
"No, revered sir." "Have you read no philos=
ophy whatsoever?" "No, revered
sir."

The pandit was talking in this vain w=
ay and the passenger sitting in silence
when a great storm arose and the bo=
at was about to sink. The passenger said
to the pandit,
"Sir, can you swim?=
" "No", replied the pandit. The passenger said, "1 don't
know Samkhya or th=
e Patanjala, but I can swim."

What will a man gain by knowing many scriptu=
res? The one thing needful is to
know how to cross the river of the world. =
God alone is real, and all else is
illusory.
