Namaste Narasimhaji,


I recently started doing tarpana using your manual.=
I have couple of queries

1. In tarpana why is specific importance given to=
 Sesame?

2. As I know it one cannot do puja for some days when somebody in=
 the family has expired. Similarly can one do Japa during that period? 

3.=
 I collect water used during tarpana in a vessel. Now can that water be tak=
en inside the house. The reason I am asking this is because I throw that wa=
ter on plants and for that I have to go through rooms in the house as the p=
lants are kept elsewhere.

4.Restrictions are mentioned in the documents fo=
r certain days, what happens if we could not follow that by mistake?

5. In=
 one Gita press book it is mentioned that those desiring servants, children=
 and female should not do tarpan. I see that you did not mention this.
Is t=
his really applicable ?

Thank you for the manuals !!

Thank you,
Manish
