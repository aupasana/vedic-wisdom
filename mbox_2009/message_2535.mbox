Namaste Shri Somanathan,

Firstly, good luck with your spiritual endeavors =
and I pray that Lord Ganesha removes all your obstacles (mental & physical)=
. I guess most/all the people go through the dilemma that you are facing, s=
o there's nothing new in that.

Now, regarding your objections. Please don'=
t listen to anyone. Most of the objections are either from people who are s=
elfish, ignorant or downright lazy!!! They don't even make any sense. I am =
not even going to bother why they are incorrect!!!

Now, to your other obje=
ction. See, when you tackle mundane challenges, like say, you want to learn=
 a new computer language or a new operating system (like windows), what do =
you do? Obviously, you start working on it, and over a period of time, with=
 dedication and perseverance, you overcome all the obstacles, and become fl=
uent in it. Right? So why not adopt the same attitude in your spiritual pat=
h? Most people whom I know, including myself at one time, had similar reser=
vations, when it came to spirituality! There is nothing that cant be achiev=
ed through hard-work, sincerity and dedication. Period!

Secondly, when you=
 started out with school by joining Kinder Garten (KG), did you ever pause =
for a moment and thought ... Wow!! Somewhere down the line, I am going to b=
e solving quadratic equations, probability, differential calculus, which ar=
e so tough that you might run into tons of problems ... so let me not get i=
nto school??? If you think about your questions, they are similar in nature=
 to the one above :) !!

Don't worry about your worthiness, we all are defi=
nitely worthy!! You see, when GOD made us in his own mold, he performed pra=
na pratishthapana on us, i,e, we all have GOD inside us, through which we a=
re divine, and get in touch with him!!! 

All your other questions are just=
 unnecessary obstacles you are creating for your self. Stop it and get goin=
g. I remember Shri Manish Pandit telling me, that the best thing about spir=
ituality is that if you have sincere intentions, then no matter what, it wi=
ll definitely work out. You don't have to start out as Einstein to succeed!=


Once again ... Good Luck!

Regards
Narayan

hough, are personal objections that I create for myself..I call it the "I-a=

pletely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is that =
I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfi=
sh) enough. At some point or another won't one end up automatically asking =
for one's personal gains? After all, isn't it human nature to confide every=
thing/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please giv=

r reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the Brahm=
adi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to 'white-wash' one's selfish motives?

 Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about regular=
 recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with 'Kundalini jagran', I=
 am a bit worried. Can sadhana and 'kundalini jagran' ever be mutually excl=
usive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they stil=
