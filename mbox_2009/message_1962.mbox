Namaste,
 
> Can you please elaborate more on "how and why sadhana

to accumulation of energies"? 
 
If you are controlling the mind from thoug=
hts and focusing the mind on something for a short duration, it purifies th=
e mind and generates a small amount of energy. Energy here can be loosely t=
ranslated as ability to get something. You get the ability to get something=
 as a reaction to your action of conserving mental energy that could've bee=
n spent on wandering here and there.
 
As you do the sadhana (homam or japa=
m or whatever) by controlling the mind for a long time, you start to accumu=
late more and more energy. Some of it may be used up to pay back some energ=
y you owe, on account of your karmik debts. This may help avoid some negati=
ve results in reaction to previous actions. We also term this as burning of=
f of bad karmas.
 
Some of it may be used up to fulfil your wishes. Suppose=
 you strongly thought in the past "I wish I had xyz". Nature may give you x=
yz, if you have enough energy to get xyz by using up some of it. Nature act=
s as an intelligent bank that keeps track of your balance and automatically=
 pays off some debts and automatically buys with credit some things you wan=
ted to buy.
 
Every action and reaction in the field of duality is essentia=
lly a play of various energies.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppose one is doin=
g intense sadhana with a good level of control over the mind. Suppose one i=
s not excited by seemingly good happenings and suppose one is not angered o=
r saddened by seemingly bad happenings. Suppose one maintains an equanimous=
 and stable mind. Then one keeps generating energy while consuming very lit=
tle of it for mental activity. Of course, if there is ANY mental activity (=
e.g. anger at someone, desire of something, disappointment with something, =
excitement at something etc), the activity of the mind uses up some energy.=

 
If a yogi maintains a peaceful, relaxed, calm and equanimous state of mi=
nd over a long time, one can generate a tremendous amount of shakti. Rishis=
 used to have enough shakti, generated from great tapascharya and maintenan=
ce of mental equanimity for decades or centuries and millennia in some case=
s, that they could cause big changes in the entire universe.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
Everything boils down to control and mind and mental activity. Al=
l sadhanas we do are for enhancing control over mind. It does not come in o=
ne day.

Narasimha

          =EF=BB=BF 


          Dear =
Hari,

          Never hesitate to ask or say anything that may seem impert=
inent.

          *        *        *

          When a mantra is spoken, s=
ound is produced at 4 levels. The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sou=
nd at the physical level. When you say something by moving the physical bod=
y parts (lips etc), their movement vibrates the air particles and those vib=
rations vibrate the physical body parts in the ears of listeners and people=
 around you can "listen".

          At the same time, the subtle thoughts =
in the mind accompanying the chanting of the mantra result in movement in p=
arts of your "subtle body", which vibrate the subtle space around you and t=
hose cause some vibrations in the subtle bodies of people around you.

    =
      In this way, sound (or vibration) is produced at 4 levels. The subtle=
r the level, the longer the signal can carry without decaying.

          *=
        *        *

          If one has some shakti accumulated with a spe=
cific mantra, one's chanting of that mantra is infused with that shakti.

 =
         The energy infused when one chants a mantra is carried mainly in t=
he subtler levels of sound. The energy carried at the physical level (vaikh=
ari) of sound is very small compared to the energy carried in the subtler l=
evels. However, the vaikhari level sound contains the key to the subtler le=
vels for most people.

          I can explain this using an analogy. One m=
ay have a powerful concept or idea in mind that one is thinking of. Most ot=
her people cannot read one's mind and cannot access that concept or idea. H=
owever, if one expresses the idea in words, people will be able to access t=
hat idea. Most of the power is in the idea and not in the exact words used.=
 However, the written/spoken words that are tangible to others act as a key=
 to one's thoughts. World can now access the power of one's idea!

        =
  Similarly, the exact letters or words of a mantra are not really alive wi=
th energy. But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one's chanting of th=
e mantra is infused with some power. Other people cannot access that power =
normally. But, once one says the mantra in an audible form (just like expre=
ssing the idea in tangible words above), the power in one's chanting of the=
 mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not re=
ally in the audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key to the =
inaudible sound and world can now access the power of one's chanting (just =
as the written words act as a key to one's idea and the world can now acces=
s the power of one's idea).

          When you chant a mantra silently, yo=
u are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world. When you chant a m=
antra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the mantra with the world. Som=
e of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped by someone.

          *=
        *        *

          If leaves, flowers and fruits are plucked fro=
m a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one's shakti =
with a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud now and th=
en. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining some yama an=
d niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.

          If you do n=
ot intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too. That is N=
OT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However, certai=
n tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti with a =
mantra. If one's guru wants one to do something in future and asks one to a=
ccumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.

          *    =
    *        *

          Manish's guru was a realized man. His name was Na=
khate Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darsha=
n of Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. =
He remained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world=
 to perform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.

          Even=
 a realized man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, w=
hen he gave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite o=
ld-fashioned. He did not say the mantra in Manish's ear. Instead, he asked =
Manish to sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish's templ=
es. He asked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra =
in Devanagari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and=
 did sadhana with that mantra.

          *        *        *

          Th=
ese methods are used for a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are tw=
o main reasons:

          (1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated =
with that mantra, because there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but g=
iving indiscriminately is unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to =
optimize what one does.
          (2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If=
 one gets a million bucks easily, one can waste it. Instead of giving milli=
on dollars to someone, it will be better if you teach one how to work hard =
and make money.

          Sharing various thoughts and spiritual truths an=
d inspiring people to do sadhana is one thing and sharing one's accumulated=
 shakti with a mantra with people another.

          *        *        *

=
          As I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want to mention a small story a=
bout him.

          When Nakhate Maharaj left this world, his sishyas had =
an interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditating at that time. He sud=
denly felt that his guru was in front of him. He opened his eyes and saw th=
at Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him physically. He held his pal=
m up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as if saying good bye. Th=
en he disappeared. When Manish called India later, he found out that Nakhat=
e Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. He also found out that h=
is other sishyas too had the same experience in different parts of the worl=
d around the same time.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

            =EF=BB=BFNamaste,

            It is what you=

. So I keep it to myself and do not share it with all.

            But man=

extinct in this commercial age. If possible, meet him and take his blessing=

            My intuition tells me that you are a man made for karma yog=

 your ability and teach them about god. After helping them materially first=

 In my opinion, this is the right path for you.

            Actions perfor=
