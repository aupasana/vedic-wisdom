Nice mail. Bama Kshepa was considered an amsa of Bhairava.

=C2=A0

The ups=
urge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Bama, who practiced a form o=
f kundalini yoga, was interviewed by Promode Chatterji. The author tells so=
me of Bama's ideas in his book of interviews with saints: Tantrabhilasir Sa=
dhu-sangha:=C2=A0
Ma (the Mother goddess) is asleep in the muladhara chakra=
 and should be awakened- if she is not awake, who is there to give one libe=
ration? Only she can do this.... The first sign of the awakening of Kundali=
ni is that the person does not feel satisfied with the ordinary state of li=
fe- one gets a great urge within to get over this confinement. The awakenin=
g of Kundalini gives men great pleasure, a kind of pleasure that ordinary m=
en never attain ... as you pass through and move from one chakra to another=
, you feel the manifestations of the varied bhavas of Kundalini Sakti. But =
what is important, as a result of kundalini Shakti's functions in every cha=
kra, is the kind of bhava it creates, a different bhava in each place, and =
the feeling of these bhavas brings such a state of bliss that it cannot be =
described.=C2=A0
He felt that the soul departs the body through the spinal =
channel at death, through an aperture in the skull, and it enters a state o=
f emptiness and peace, nirvikalpa samadhi. This is the home of Tara Ma, whi=
ch is beyond the material world, the heaven worlds, and the home of Kali. T=
ara's grace is necessary to reach this state.=C2=A0


Some incidents in the=
 masters life


The Widow's Marriage

One day a young, beautiful girl and h=
er father came to see Bama Kshepa. The=C2=A0
young girl bowed down to the M=
aster and offered him some Indian sweets which=C2=A0
she herself had prepar=
ed. Bama was extremely pleased with her and said, "I=C2=A0
am blessing you.=
 You will be blessed in the future with a beautiful son."=C2=A0

The girl c=
ried out, "Father, Father, look what this sadhu is saying! How=C2=A0
can I =
have a child when I have lost my husband? I am a widow."=C2=A0

Bama said, =
"You are a widow. So what! You will be remarried. My words will=C2=A0
prove=
 true."=C2=A0

In three months' time a very rich young man fell in love wit=
h her.=C2=A0
Although in those days it was not at all appreciated if a wido=
w remarried,=C2=A0
this girl did get married in a special Hindu Vaishnava m=
anner. Needless to=C2=A0
say, in a year's time after she got married, she w=
as blessed with a beautiful=C2=A0
son.=C2=A0


The Dying Man

A young man s=
uffering from a serious case of tuberculosis was brought by=C2=A0
his relat=
ives to Bama. The young man's days were numbered. Bama said to them,=C2=A0
=
"Why did you bring him to me? Am I a doctor? You rascals, you will never=C2=
=A0
give me peace of mind."=C2=A0

Then the Master stood up and started str=
angling the patient. Everybody was=C2=A0
stunned. The man was already so we=
ek. The disciples started crying because=C2=A0
if the young man died, the M=
aster and all of them would be in serious trouble.=C2=A0

But Bama continue=
d to strangle and abuse the man like anything, saying, "When=C2=A0
you do b=
ad things, unbearable things, don't you know you will pay the penalty?"
The=
n he said, "All right, I have forgiven you," and he threw the man down
on t=
he ground. Everybody thought he was dead.=C2=A0

But in a few minutes, to e=
veryone's astonishment, the young man stood up=C2=A0
and said, "I am so hun=
gry. Please give me something to eat. I have never=C2=A0
felt this kind of =
hunger in my life." The dying man was now totally cured.=C2=A0
The relative=
s left the Master's house offering utmost gratitude to Bama,=C2=A0
whom the=
y affectionately called the "insane spiritual Master."=C2=A0



The Suicide=
 Attempt

Once in the thick of the night a middle-aged man named Nimai was =
tying a=C2=A0
rope to the branch of a tree and was about to hang himself. H=
e could not=C2=A0
support his family, and for this reason the members of hi=
s family had tremendous=C2=A0
disrespect for him. Therefore he wanted to co=
mmit suicide.=C2=A0

At that moment Bama appeared in his subtle body and sa=
id, "What are you doing?=C2=A0
You rascal, don't you know that committing s=
uicide is the worst possible=C2=A0
sin? Don't you believe it?"=C2=A0

Nimai=
 said, "All right, I will not commit suicide, but I will never go home=C2=
=A0
again."=C2=A0

Bama said, "You don't have to go home. Come and stay wit=
h me, in your real=C2=A0
home. God will take care of your family, I assure =
you."=C2=A0

Bama's words proved true. Very soon, two of Nimai's older sons=
 got jobs and=C2=A0
were in a position to support the rest of the members o=
f the family.


=C2=A0The Leper
Bama had a dear attendant named Nanda, who =
had developed leprosy. Even then, Bama used to take food from him regularly=
 and not from other disciples. Gradually, Nanda's case became extremely ser=
ious. His hands and arms were totally covered with infected wounds and it w=
as a very ugly sight. So he stopped coming to=C2=A0
his Master's place.=C2=
=A0

One day, Bama's attendants said to their Master, "Master, you have the=
 capacity to cure your dear disciple, Nanda. Why don't you cure him?"=C2=A0=


Bama said to them, "All right, bring him today."=C2=A0

When Nanda came, =
Bama started striking him, saying, "Can you count on your fingertips how ma=
ny times you have done unthinkable things? I say you can't, you rascal. I h=
ave forgiven you and I am curing you, but in the future never, never do any=
thing immoral or undivine."=C2=A0

In a month's time Nanda was totally cure=
d. Then he once again started preparing meals for Bama and serving him with=
 utmost love and devoted surrender.


=C2=A0Calcutta Kalighat temple


At t=
he Calcutta Kalighat temple, while in a state of bhava, he tried to lift th=
e statue of the Mother and take her on his lap. When stopped by the priests=
, he shouted, "I do not want your black Kali! She looks like a demoness com=
ing to devour [someone]. My Tara Ma is beautiful, with small feet. I do not=
 want your black Kali- my Akasa Tara is good enough for me." People would c=
all on him, asking him to pray to their household images, to enliven them w=
ith his bhava. He would fall into trance when he visited their statues, and=
 often he performed neither worship nor chanting of mantras. He would loudl=
y call into the air for the Mother, and many observers saw the statue appea=
r to take the form of a human being.


His Holiness's worship of Maa Tara

=

He took a handful of flowers marked with sandal paste and stood before the=
 goddess. He cursed her and threw the flowers at the statue. He wet the flo=
wers with his tears. Although the flowers were thrown with an attitude of a=
buse instead of reverence using mantras, they arranged themselves into a ne=
at and beautiful garland around the goddess' neck, and the observers were a=
mazed at the mantraless form of worship of the madman. He then went into tr=
ance which continued all day, and he emerged from it on the following day. =
He was not a priest who followed schedules- often the time for worship woul=
d have passed and no one could find Bama anywhere. He would later be seen i=
n trance under a Hibiscus tree, on in the jungle, having arguments with the=
 goddess.=C2=A0


Bama,Maa Tara's dearest son


He would eat food to be off=
ered to the goddess before the worship ceremony was finished thus making it=
 impure and unsanctified. The caretakers of the temple were angry at this a=
nd beat him severely. He insisted that the goddess Tara asked him to take f=
ood in this way. After this, the temple owner, the Rani of Natore, had a dr=
eam:=C2=A0

She dreamt that the stone image of Mother Tara was leaving the =
temple at Tarapith and going to Kailasa. Tara Ma looked very sad, and tears=
 were flowing down her face, and she wore no mark on her forehead. She was =
bewildered and emaciated. Her back was bleeding and full of cuts, and vultu=
res and jackals followed behind her, lapping the blood from her wounds.=C2=
=A0
In fear, the Rani asked, "O Ma, why do you show me these terrible thing=
s, and why are you leaving us?"=C2=A0

The goddess answered, "My child, I h=
ave been in this sacred place (mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have b=
eaten my dear mad son, and as a mother, I have taken these blows upon mysel=
f. See how my back is bleeding, I am in great pain ... For four days I have=
 been starving, because they have not allowed my mad son to eat my ritual f=
ood. So for four days I have refused to take their offerings of food ... My=
 child, how can a mother take food before feeding her child? You must arran=
ge for food to be offered to my son, before it is offered to me, at the tem=
ple. If not, I will leave there permanently."=C2=A0Bama got his priest job =
back, and people began to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to see =
him.


Shortly before his Mahasamadhi in 1911, he became withdrawn and spen=
t most of his time in trance and meditation. He ceased to talk with his dis=
ciples, speaking only rarely about death and Tara Ma. His love-hate relatio=
nship with her continued until his death in 1911.=C2=A0=C2=A0

 leaving us?" <BR><BR>The goddess answered, "<I>My child, I have=
 been in this sacred place (mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have beat=

 back, and people began to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to see=
 him.</SPAN></B></SPAN></DIV>
