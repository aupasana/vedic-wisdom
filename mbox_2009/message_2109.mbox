Namaste Jiten,

1) Yes, as Naraayan replied, i too agree and practically i =
suppose, anybody who does homam needs to do that.

2) I am little surprised=
 with this point. i am not facing this problem my self. very rarely i've ob=
served that some coconut pieces are left un-burnt.

I can point out one pri=
me cause here. It has been observed that if you place coconut pieces where =
white portion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then there are all the =
chances that pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal experience. so=
 i can suggest few things as under:

- Keep Dark side up
- Keep the pieces =
such that they don't pile on each other.
- Keep the pieces such a way that =
it forms a pyramid shape (top of that shape is opened so that Aahuti can be=
 offered conveniently in that. i mean, there should be a scope for air to p=
ass under the pieces.

It is my experience that coconut peices do get burnt=
 completely.

Best Regards,

Utpal
