Utpalji, Miteshji, many thanks for your views.

i have been following the "=
bare minimum" procedure and not the more elaborate and full mahaganapati ho=
mam procedure of the manual. 

in the manual of mahaganapati homam there is=
 a shorter procedure at appendix B...but this is a little bit at variance w=
ith the bare minimum procedure specified later by narasimhan ji. i follow t=
he latter.

In the bare minimum procedure there is only one ganapati mantra=
 which i keep repeating. That appears to be fine to me right now because of=
 its simplicity. However, at some point of time i may like to graduate to m=
ore mantras and therefore wanted to know what different mantras to the same=
 deity signify. But all that can wait, if need be, so long as i get establi=
shed in the main practice.

i understand that total surrender and love towa=
rds the deity may be the stepping stones to deepening the sadhana. However,=
 in my present stage of sadhana i have a long long way to go. 

for many ma=
ny years i have been struggling with different practices thinking that the =
ultimate goal of all this is to feel unshakled / have the experience of inn=
er freedom and joy. This has eluded me so far...and may never be part of my=
 present life's experience, ...but the sadhana continues in one form or ano=
ther...in the hope that the vighnas may dissolve, to some extent, in some s=
ubtle way...that i may not be aware of in my present state of consciousness=
.

i have started looking at ganapati as a remover of vighnas...mostly inte=
rnal blocks in my case...


yes, it appears that from a stage when rituals =
appeared to be ridiculous, and i couldn't imagine which deity i could pray =
to...some changes have surely come about.

thankyou

love and best wishes

should understand about different mantras and firmly pick quickly with conv=

ould consult experts on mantra shastra, and many times the karmas do play t=
