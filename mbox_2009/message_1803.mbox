Namaste Vinitaji,

Congratulations on your getting started! I pray you are =
able to continue this forever.

You can do ahooti for any diety, provided y=
ou start with the ahooti of the pradhaan/main diety. Rest all is OK. Also, =
we need to add svaahaa at the end of the mantra even if it has namah in it =
... like om namah shivaaya would become om namah shivaaya svaahaa.

Doing a=
hooti for Kula/Graama deva/devi is an excellent idea and I do it too. Infac=
t you might want to remember them (along with your parents/and the rishi wh=
o originated your gotra) when you start the homam procedure, but right afte=
r Shuklambhara dharam mantra, which one utters at the start of the homam pr=
ocedure.

Hope this helps.
-Narayan-
