Dear Rajarshi,

Thank you for these informations on Sufis. But one informat=
ion still needed about their Krishna Bhakti. were there any saints among Su=
fis who actually sang Bhajans in praise of Krishna?

***
>Communion with Go=
d is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. >The creator is always se=
perate from the creation.Period. Anything >else is Kufr

That is a right st=
atement.
That is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men are G=
od, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We say that everyt=
hing is of Allah (God).

***
a different Note:

one intresting point - Ther=
e is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire.

We every=
day do Fire worship ritual!

Incidently one of my very good friends, who is=
 Muslim is coming to my home with Family and will stay with me for a week. =
he'll see me doing Homam everyday. He and his wife knows about it. infact i=
've done many Chadi Paath recitations at his home and even my Maha Lakshmi =
vratam if it happened to be a friday. Whenever i visit their home, his wife=
 sees to it that there is no Non veg food brought in his home.
He'll offer =
his Namaz ritual at my home. so Homam and Namaz will go parallelly. This pa=
rallel of different rituals has a meeting point in both of our hearts. sadl=
y in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart =
in different directions or actually they try to make it such that they neve=
r meet.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 The creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is =
Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my i=
nterpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Is=
lamic garb.
