Namaste friends,
 
As Vimalananda wisely declares, an ounce of practice is =
worth more than a ton of theory. However, sometimes the only thing we can d=
o to inspire practice is to discuss theory and try to put things in the rig=
ht perspective. It may inspire someone to do sadhana.
 
*        *        *=

 
The ten mahavidyas are considered by many people to be "taantrika" godde=
sses. Some people also think that you *have to* do specific sadhanas to get=
 knowledge from them or experience them.
 
Mahavidyas, as the name implies,=
 are essentially personification of supreme liberating knowledge of ten kin=
ds. The names, imagery, various symbols and procedures employed in various =
taantrika sadhanas are *metaphors* for *esoteric truths*. One engages in th=
e practices that are designed to make one *realize* certain esoteric truths=
 in the long run. However, dealing with those symbols and engaging in the p=
ractices is neither necessary nor sufficient for realizing the esoteric tru=
ths and for getting the essential knowledge.
 
If a deity wants to bless on=
e, the deity can just come to one in several forms. One may see the deity a=
s a person externally. One may see the deity internally as a person, fillin=
g one's existence. One may experience the deity in all pervading light or s=
ound forms also. Also, one may see a deity in different forms at different =
times.
 
One example of an experience of a mahavidya is narrated in the art=
icle below, from the archives of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. After the experie=
nce, that person's knowledge expanded and his thinking changed completely.
=
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951
 
*        *      =
  *
 
Sometimes a deity may not come to one in a tangible form, either exte=
rnally or internally, but just come to one as internal knowledge. In other =
words, one may not see the deity or experience her as a person or as light =
or as sound and yet she may enter one as knowledge. Slowly, this may bloom =
and result in a maturing of thinking and a supreme kind of knowledge and se=
lf-realization.
 
In fact, I will go on to say that every self-realized per=
son from every religion until today has been blessed by one mahavidya, whet=
her or not he or she realizes it or not and thinks in those terms or not.
 =

*        *        *
 
If you look at Buddha's works, it is clear he was bl=
essed by Maatangi and filled with the realization personified by Maatangi, =
though I do not believe he did any Maatangi sadhana formally.
 
Of course, =
according to Munda Maalaa Tantra list, Maatangi is equated to Buddha. Also,=
 Matangi khanda of Rudrayamala says that Matangi and Buddha are essentially=
 the same.
 
*        *        *
 
We talked about Chhinnamasta, the deity =
standing near a copulating couple and holding her own severed hand. While s=
ome people associate her with Rahu, I associated her with Venus as Munda Ma=
ala Tantra equates her to Parasu Rama (who is Venus according to Parasara).=

 
Parasu Rama's mother Renuka saw a gandharva called Chitraratha and an ap=
sara (celestial couple) having a lustful union in the forest and she had a =
desire to enjoy in the same manner with her husband. She lost her brillianc=
e due to this thought and Jamadagni ordered his eldest son to kill her. Whe=
n the first four sons refused, the fifth son Parasu Rama agreed to kill his=
 mother and the boon he got from his father as a result was that Renuka wou=
ld be alive again and be perfectly pure.
 
Renuka means the pollen and coul=
d also mean seminal fluid at the gross level and self-awareness (Kundalini)=
 at a subtle level. Chitraratha means various strange desires. Chitraratha'=
s lustful activities in the forest are metaphors for various desires that s=
pring in the forest of one's mind. Desires and lust in one's mind stop one =
from mastery over Self. They make one's shakti impure. The five sons could =
show the five chakras from moolaadhaara to visuddhi. As shakti rises, still=
 one is susceptible to desires. When the shakti comes up to visuddhi chakra=
, one's self-awareness is cut off from earth, water, fire and air elements =
and one attains self-mastery and freedom from various forms of lust. Then o=
ne's self-awareness has a new birth in a purified form.
 
If you understand=
 this story at an esoteric level, you understand what knowledge Chhinnamast=
a represents. Just as the story of Parasurama and Renuka esoterically symbo=
lizes reaching a pure state of consciousness where desires and lust do not =
trouble one anymore, Chhinnamasta makes one a yogi with perfect self-contro=
l, who is unaffected by sensory inputs and untouched by thoughts of lust.
 =

Also, she is the mahavidya who cuts off her head to feed her associates (a=
nd herself) with the blood and then re-attaches the head. Please note that =
Venus is the one associated with mrita sanjivani vidya.
 
*        *       =
 *
 
> Indeed Bagalamukhi is unmistakably Mars. Sadhakas will know that.
 
=
Bagalamukhi's consort Maharudra is shown by Mars. Thus, is not surprising i=
f sadhakas of Bagalamukhi experiece a Martian influence.
 
Similarly, Kaali=
's consort is Mahaakaala shown by Saturn and Taara's consort is Akshobhya s=
hown by Jupiter. Again, some influence of Saturn and Jupiter may be felt by=
 their sadhakas.
 
*        *        *
 
> Different Avatar-Mahavidya co-re=
lations are given in the
> Guhyatiguhya Tantra, the Todala tantra, the Mund=
amala
> Tantra and some other articles as well. .. another list
> given by =
Swami Sadhananda Shastri of Varanasi ..
 
Guhyatiguhya tantra and Todala ta=
ntra lists do not stick to 10 mahavidyas and 10 Vishnu avataras. Sri Shastr=
i's list also does not stick to 10 avataras of Vishnu and includes various =
other gods. Only Munda Mala tantra list gives the exact lists of 10 maha vi=
dyas and 10 avataras of Vishnu. Moreover, it explains the essence of each m=
ahavidya very well. That is why I accept Munda Maalaa Tantra list.
 
*     =
   *        *
 
One may read about how deities are difficult to reach and h=
ow austere sadhanas are to be done by others for many years.
 
The final go=
al of all spiritual sadhana is internal transformation and self-realization=
. Various sadhanas and austerities were designed to slowly bring that trans=
formation. One may do austere sadhana for 50 years and yet not achieve. One=
 may achieve in a single day like Sarvananda or Kalidasa did. We don't know=
 who is capable of what. More importantly, it is Her grace at the end.
 
If=
 you have an inclination to do sadhana, do the sadhana you are capable of, =
without worrying about success or failure or without being daunted by what =
you hear from others. Do your chosen external practices, but do augment the=
m with constant comtemplation and conscious self-criticism of your motives =
in your actions. Put in a conscious effort to detect ego when it starts to =
control your actions and cut it down. When constant contemplation and consc=
ious self-correction aids, external practices work faster.
 
Many capable s=
adhakas fall in the trap of pride, possessiveness or entitlement when they =
make some progress ("I am good and I got this", "I did good sadhana and so =
I got this", "I deserve this" etc) and get stuck there. Remembering the nee=
d to keep a tab on ego is very important, in addition to the external pract=
ices.
 
Again, one should remember as one engages in spiritual sadhana that=
 the final goal is an internal transformation to remove identification with=
 one's actions and remove ego from one's thinking.
 
*        *        *
 
=
I finally think that all the points I wanted to make on this topic have bee=
n made. I sign off from this topic and I will wait for the next inspiration=
. Of course, this is w.r.t. astrology lists and I will continue to write on=
 vedic-wisdom regularly.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
