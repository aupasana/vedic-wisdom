Namaste Girish,
 
1) Even animals have emotions, ability to think and free =
will. Though their ability to think is highly restricted compared to us, th=
ey do have the ability and some amount of free will. For example, a cat tha=
t has just been fed and not hugry at all may spot a mouse and either kill i=
t or leave it. It is a decision that that cat makes.
 
The actions done by =
exercising free will accumulate as the karma of an animal. However, these m=
ay usually be too small to not give a human birth. There is another point t=
o be made.
 
The karmas of an animal get intertwined with the karmas of ani=
mals that it associated with during its lifetime (e.g. killing, being kille=
d, raising children, mating etc). When an animal's next life is decided bas=
ed on all of its karmas, Nature finds a solution that enables a payback of =
karmas by all parties with intertwined karmas. Thus, a deer may be born as =
a fox and vice versa.
 
After going through the cycle many times, an animal=
's kaarmik path may cross with some human beings and it may get an opportun=
ity to be born as a human being.
 
BTW, we should realize that some human b=
eings are actually not better than the stereotype of animals. They live for=
 eating, mating and other basic needs and do not use the thinking ability a=
nd free will that much. Of course, such people may have been animals in man=
y lives and recently born as human beings. The mental conditioning stays fr=
om previous lives and slowly changes based on the latest life experiences a=
nd lessons.
 
2) Your actions are NOT governed by your past karmas. Instead=
, the possible field from which you can *choose* your current actions is *l=
imited* by your past karmas. Though past does not determine present, past d=
oes restrict present. Based on what one has done before, there is a strong =
mental conditioning to do certain things and the "forces of habit" are diff=
icult to tame. Even when one wants, the external circusmstances may make it=
 very difficult. When one exerts freee will to fight the "forces of habit" =
and do something unselfish, dhaarmik and useful to others, one grows spirit=
ually and accumulates good karma. One slowly comes out of the grip of the f=
orces of habit by forming new habits.
 
This is a slow process, but it is s=
omething that one has to start sometime.
 
Evn in really bad situations, pe=
ople have several options, more than what they may think they have. However=
, the forces of habit close their eyes to certain options and make them see=
 only certain options. If one fights the forces of habit by exerting free w=
ill, one may be able to see options one did not see before and do something=
 better than before.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
