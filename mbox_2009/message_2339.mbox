If someone in the Ashram behaved in a very unjust manner,Sri Bhagavan used
=
to know it (even though no one expressed it to him) and inflict some
self-p=
unishment and deny himself some dishes or courses, etc., without
expressing=
 anything to anybody.

Everyone used to come together to find out why Sri B=
hagavan has given up a
certain thing. As no one was bold enough to face Bha=
gavan and ask the real
cause, they used to examine their own conduct and be=
haviour and discover the
causes that might have caused displeasure to Bhaga=
van. They used to approach
Bhagavan, prostrate, beg his pardon, and promise=
 to be more careful in the
future. This is Sri Bhagavan=92s way of rectific=
ation of wrongdoers.
