Namaste Smt Lakshmi,

Yes, you can cover the homa kundam, once the fire goe=
s off. If your neighbors know you perform the ritual, they are bound to mak=
e some noise. The smell from the ghee burning is much much milder than thei=
r barbeque sessions!!  So, just ignore them. Use incense sticks liberally, =
which helps in spreading the pleasant smell. I sprinkly sambrani powder on =
the embers in the kundam. You can also use the pleasant smelling jawar, whi=
ch have an awesome aroma, and serves as a room freshener when sprinkled on =
the embers.

Hope this helps
Regards
Narayan
