Namaste RJ Bhai,

I liked your message very much. I share one sentiment com=
pletely -
 "His thinking is crystal clear". i have said this in my message =

some 6/8 months back.
please don't think that your message does not carry =
any value 
addition. it does, really does carry lot of value addition.

a m=
onth back i have written that There will be so many *Rantna* 
presnt on thi=
s list who choose to remian silent but i request them
(which includes you)t=
o write once in a while to share their Wisdom 
on this list so that it help=
s the people like me and many others. 
it'll lessen the burden for Narasimh=
a and also make the archives of 
this list more resourceful for current as =
well as future generation 
of members or elase the archives will be full of=
 blabbering from me. 

***

as you said, Narasimha is strong enough. he doe=
sn't require 
anybody's support for his writings. as you would have noticed=
 that 
he is being criticised invariably for his astrolgical writings. I've=
 
hardly sent any message for support, even if sometimes i get hert 
with v=
ery harsh comments towards him(Such as Shakti yoga destroying 
Jupiters sig=
nificance etc..) because i know that he doesn't need it 
and to be honest b=
ecause i consider him my Guru, doesn't 
allow/validate me to write in suppo=
rt for the issues which i myself 
has not understood properly. I need to sa=
y one thing here, 
especially for Astrological writings of his, that I like=
 his 
approach of getting basics right. i have felt for some years now 
tha=
t his thinking matches my thinking in many ways though i am also 
not doubt=
proof w.r.t. him. i mean i have raised my own doubts to him 
whenever they =
arised. even if they meant herting my dear Garu.

***  
In my opinion, It i=
s good to laugh at some critical comments which 
also has the tickling valu=
e. it makes the atmosphere lighter. but i 
must say that your way of gently=
 reminding Mitesh was very accurate 
and agreeable. am sure Mitesh will agr=
ee.

having said all these, in my opinion, crtical comments are always 
wel=
come for anybody including Narasimha, when the intentions behind 
are genui=
ne and not intended to insult or hert somebody.

***
Narasimha might object=
 to this message but as you know i write what 
i feel like writing.

Warm R=
egards,

Utpal
