Dear Laxmi Narayan,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I was intrigued by above line in your mail=
 and want to know more about this devotee. Do you know him as a friend and =
is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyas=
in or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life after=C2=A0 =
he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.
=C2=A0=

=C2=A0
Yes he is a friend of mine.=C2=A0 I can only tell you very little a=
bout his spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He i=
s married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.
=C2=A0
Before I tell you a=
nything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I know, let me say=C2=
=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about two=
 years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him was his impeccabl=
e honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=A0honestly.=C2=
=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simpl=
e, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Ther=
efore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2=A0spoke=
n even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his sch=
ool, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than Englis=
h, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more com=
prehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since=
 that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one H=
indi and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading the English dict=
ionary and
 one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C2=A0u=
p volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked him why, he ju=
st said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at both the langua=
ges so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth a=
bout=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncomp=
romising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By=
 education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, =
from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most p=
laces. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskr=
it, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry i=
n all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an=
 atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for religi=
on as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that bla=
nk space, he asked
 my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote=
 "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore =
it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hi=
ndu in the form would have been a lie. 
=C2=A0
So this gives a basic idea o=
f the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls him R=
ama of Kaliyuga.
=C2=A0
One day, long back, he was going to office for some=
 urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was pa=
ssing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into th=
e temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but=
 he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch =
it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. Wh=
en he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat do=
wn and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The p=
riest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why thi=
s happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.
=C2=A0
Then =
he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he got visions et=
c of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know=
 him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours=
, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same pos=
ition for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0Only his wife and close relatives know =
about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he=
 often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt duri=
ng samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from m=
e. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women,=
 children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger=
 than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He considers Sri K=
rishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does=
 not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2=A0Rama =
to the
 level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was =
to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The difference he says is =
that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and =
should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordina=
ry men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to lead his life li=
ke Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea=
. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people =
to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist a=
ny more.
=C2=A0
Later he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation he ha=
d with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was=
 his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on dif=
ferent internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2=A0with those i=
n=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything with t=
hem, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is=
 to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the future of this c=
ountry.
=C2=A0
He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fis=
h, meat etc.
=C2=A0
I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had =
not asked his permission before mentioning him.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajar=
shi


PS: I would not like this mail to be considered as a part of the deba=
te. This mail is just because Laxmi Narayan asked for information.

I know a devotee=

Krishna=C2=A0during his=

over, who is=C2=

Hello Rajarshi,

rt of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Di=
d specific changes happened in his life after=C2=A0 he had these samadhi an=
d visions.Any other special things about him.

In the Gita Lord is saying w=
hatever you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is offering all these non-ve=
g to Lord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all around??

My curious ques=
tions are not against your acceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.A=
fter all he is part of hidden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome=C2=
=A0 pain and misery on animals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming =
them and yet he is experiencing all these exotic=C2=A0 visions, But no feel=
ing of kindness towards birds and animals.

Where did I go wrong? Simple da=
l/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? 

Wh=
en we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/artic=
le=C2=A0 about Dayamata who succeded=C2=A0 Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she we=
nt to India and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has stopped. Mast=
er said, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was doing=C2=A0 se=
cretly.

This is very complex world. No outright solutions for so many diff=
icult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east =
are fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of=
 Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also enemies there?? Thei=
r Gods said in their holy books that animals are their food. So they cannot=
 even think about souls in animals or their pain and emotions.

Then I have=
 read stories about several people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg=
 and how they exexperience=C2=A0 spiritual highs and other such phenomena. =
It is so difficult to comprehend.=C2=A0 Would they remain in the cycle of b=
/d=C2=A0 till they learn about kindness???

Kind Regards
