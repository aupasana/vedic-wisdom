Thanks for your sincerity. I am grateful fo=

You see a larger purpose in Sri Krishna's act because you have faith=
 in Him as a Purna Avatar. If you were a non believer in Sri Krishna, you c=
ould not have agreed to these arguments that justify Sri Krishnas' act. Sim=
ilarly, a believer in Sri Sri may see a higher reason in this episode. He m=
ight say that Sri Sri being a trikal gnani knew this had to happen and volu=
ntarily went through this with equanimity. You have to use the same yardsti=
ck in both sides of the argument. Faith free logic is not possible in Spiri=
tuality...at least not till the end. At some point a leap has to be made, w=
hich may be different from person to person.

It has been my position that th=

"A faith that is not blind is not a faith at all".=
 Didn't Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo say this? (exact words may be dif=
ferent) If you are looking for a faith supported by logic / intellectual un=
derstanding, then that "faith" could not be complete / integral faith, imho=
.

How do we know that? Dr. Naik was using =
vaikhari as was evident from his body language. Sri Sri was totally compose=
d throughout the meeting and afterwards, which is not possible for someone =
not established in equanimity. Para, pasyanti, madhyama will work only to t=

 to have said very casually shook up my being, sometimes immediately or som=
etimes much later. I was/am a very logical person living in the mind.. it w=
as/is not easy for me to have such experiences.

The mechanism=
 differs from Master to Master. Vivekanda's speech and writings are powerfu=
l. For Sri Sri, it is his presence. Few years ago in D.C, while Sri Sri was=
 giving a talk, a well built American suddenly came running towards hims me=
nacingly shouting "Anti Christ" and some other abuses. As he hurled towards=
 him, Sri Sri just looked at him with total compassion and within a fractio=
n of a second, that person fell at Sri Sri's feet sobbing. Now he is one of=
 the sadhaks of AOL. There are several several such instances where people =
have transformative effect just in his mere presence. He may not even look =
at them or talk to them. It can arguably said that during a comparable time=
 period, Sri Sri has had mesmerizing effect on several times more people th=
an Swami Vivekananda had. Several muslim terrorists, naxalites have embrace=
d Art of Living. There are Art of Living teachers among Pakistani muslims a=
nd Iraqis! Do you suppose it is possible with pure logical arguments?

I disagree. Each Master's way is different. An englightened M=
aster that has come down for a Mission is not just a personality that react=
s to situations in some pre-set way. They are manifestations of their missi=
on. There is such an integrity in their whole being that every act, breath,=
 word and body language will radiate one vibration which is the core of the=
ir mission. 

Swami Vivekananda came down to awaken India and her youth. Hi=
s mission was to give the Shakthi to a comotose Hindu soul of that time. So=
 naturally his very being radiated a Force needed for that mission. 

Sri S=
ri on the other hand has come down with a different mission - that of creat=
ing a one world family and reviving spiritual values in a manner that cuts =
across religions. His mission is to spread harmony, love, joy, and lightnes=
s everywhere and unite people that way. His very personality is harmonious,=
 soft and his being radiates such an unconditional love. Whatever act he do=
es, his very being will radiate harmony, love, joy and light. One needs to =
be in his presence for some time to realize this.

IMHO, it is foolish to c=
ompare Masters for this very reason. Even though they both could have come =
from the same source, Vivekananda is not Sri Sri and for him to do the work=
 of Sri Sri, he has to come down as another Sri Sri (personality wise)! Vic=
e versa is true as well.

Btw, that is one reason why Sri Krishna is called=
 Purna Avatar because he radiated with all possible vibrations to its full =
effect in one life time!
