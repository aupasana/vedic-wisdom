Sri RamaKrishna was seated on His seat as usual with His face to the north.
The western and northern doors of the apartment in which He latterly passed
His days looked out on the sacred waters of the Ganges. Balaram, Rakhal, and
other devotees and visitors were seated on a mat spread out on the floor of
the room. They were singing hymns to the accompaniment of musical.

One of the songs had particular reference to the six Lotuses marking the
different stages of the Yogi's progress toward union with the Universal
Spirit.

At the close of this song the Bhagavan said: The six Lotuses mentioned in
the Science of Yoga correspond to the seven mental planes mentioned in the
Vedanta.

Seven mental Planes

When the mind is immersed in worldliness, it makes its abode in the lowest
lotus at the end of the spine. Sexual desires rise when the mind is in the
second lotus, the sexual organ. When it is in the third, the navel, the man
is taken up with things of the world--eating, drinking, begetting children.

In the fourth mental plane the heart of the man is blessed with the Vision
of Divine Glory and he cries out: "What is all this! What is all this!"

In the fifth plane the mind rests in the throat. The devotee, talks only on
subjects related to God and grows impatient if any other subject comes up in
the course of conversation.

In the sixth plane the mind is localized between the eyebrows.The devotee
comes face to face with God; only a thin glass-like partition, so to speak,
keeps him separate from the Divine Person. To him God is like a light within
a lantern, or like a photograph behind a glass frame.

He tries to touch the Vision, but he cannot. His perception falls short of
complete realization, for there is the element of self-consciousness, the
sense of "I," kept to a certain extent. In the last or seventh plane it is
perfect Samadhi. Then all sense-consciousness ceases and absolute
God-consciousness takes its place.

In this state the life of the saint lingers for twenty-one days, after which
he passes away. During these days he ceases to take any food. Milk, if
poured into his mouth, runs out and never gets into the stomach. [p. 290 &
291]
