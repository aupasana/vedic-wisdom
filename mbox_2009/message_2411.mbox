Temples may not accept the idol unless it meets the requirements of Agama Sastra.  No harm in trying your luck. If accepted by temple, you may have to donate money to the temple for conducting daily pooja. In Tamilnadu, Rightside trunk Ganesha is called  Valamsuzhi   Pillayar . Best of Luck!

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Right-sided Trunk Shri Ganesha Idol

   
OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya

Dear All,

This ia my first posting in this forum.

Am writing in as am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during puja in our home. This idol has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it since then. 

I feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have advice as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doing the same.

Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a query.

Thanks,
Ramesh M
