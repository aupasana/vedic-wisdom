Namaste,
 
Solar eclipse, even when not visible, has an effect on one. If the eclipse is not visible, it may not be necessary to follow all those traditions you mentioned. But it is still a good idea to spend some time during eclipse in spiritual sadhana.
 
Thanks,
Narasimha

From NASA Eclipse page I see that the eclipse path starts little west of India and ends in Marshall islands or so. Actually, all of Americaa and especially the North East USA doesn't seem to be even in the penumbral region. In such a case, do we still observe the eclipse time niyamas like bathing (before/after), disposing off cooked items, protection using dharbha grass etc. Please do clarify, if you get some time before the solar eclipse starts.

This is a great time for spiritual progress. In Boston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 am on 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is from 5:28 am to 9:48 am on 2009 July 22. In GMT, it is from 11:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 4:18 am on 2009 July 22.

Especially the solar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun's Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.

Microcosmically, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual mind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.

Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, which are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably halted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization. This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefits, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.
