Namaste,

Veda mantras are in a different league compared to other mantras. As I said 
earlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of mind on any 
combination of sounds. When one's mind repeats the same combination of 
sounds over and over again, eventually one's mind may lose all other 
thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN one's mind 
experiences the energy represented by that combination of sounds.

Different combinations of sounds have different energies. But experiencing 
the energy of any combination of sounds is a better experience for the mind 
than the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of thoughts.

The energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a different 
league. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in 
today's times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, veda 
mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras and do not 
really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one 
experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the original veda 
mantra.

The expression "Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah" is not part of the actual savitru 
gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with "tat savitur" and ends 
with "prachodayaat".

I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only hummed the ups 
and downs to show the intonation. I was instructed to never chant Savitru 
Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my food and I get 
whatever little energy I have from it. In order to continue doing my dharma 
in the world, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything 
else with the world.

Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient to give 
perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job than astrology 
as we understand it.

I have seen my guru make some interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I 
once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits me often and meditates when I 
do homam. Manish said, "he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. 
If at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach 
him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like 
Vishnu sahasra naama stotram." I had not mentioned much about that person to 
Manish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is 
indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a person who 
loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and interested in 
doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, "if he wants, he can do 
Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he needs to do. 
He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one whole 
year. It will transform his life." I had not mentioned anything about that 
person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he was a sishya 
of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas 
(considered to be born with  Lord Hanuman's amsa). He said to me later that 
his guru had also advised him in the past to just stick to Hanuman chalisa! 
Interestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish's mind.

Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and says 
whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance to 
someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get correct 
guidance and he is just a nimitta.

I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and in tune with 
Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spiritual sadhana than 
astrology as we know it today.

For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.

Best regards,
Narasimha
