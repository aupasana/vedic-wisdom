Dear Ravi
=C2=A0
Beautiful mail. I saw the vedio of Narasimhaji as well. On=
e thing I realized that my pronounciations, unlike the way Narasimhaji says=
 swahaa etc etc, are horribly wrong. I just cant get the chanda and intonat=
ions correct. Its just a flat tone in my voice.
=C2=A0
How wrong is wrong p=
ronounciation? I am trying hard to change but sad;y I guess I have no sense=
 of rhythm or intonations etc at all.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

 upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste Nalini and Hari,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 I agree with Hari. Starting off with Ganapathi Homam is definitel=
y better. The procedure is short and it helps one practice the fire managem=
ent, the mantras, the swaras and the whole nine yards. Moreover, the Chandi=
 Homam Manual by itself is not self-sufficient. It relies on Ganapathi Homa=
m manual. So, you have to go back and forth between the 2 manuals to perfor=
m Chandi Homam which can be done but gets little bit tricky in the beginnin=
g. So, get comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 After you feel comfortable with the Ganapathi H=
omam procedure, while continuing to do Ganapathi Homam daily, you can actua=
lly do Chandi Homam occasionally on certain days say weekends, or on Ashtam=
i, Navami and Chaturdasi which are especially auspicious for Chandipath/Cha=
ndi Homam. When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip your Ganapathi Homam for t=
hat day. After doing this for few months or when you feel you are comfortab=
le with the Chandi Homam, finally settle down with it.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 It's getting close to an year since I did my first=
 Chandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding me with fire management =
and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my pronunciation and all. =
I used to do it over weekends, which for me was taking about 3- 3 1/2hrs in=
itially, owing to my poor Telugu reading skills. Then, slowly switched to d=
aily after the whole process started taking about 2 hrs. While still, I am =
not perfect, I continue to practice. On this note, I am reminded of Narayan=
.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The idea of writing a Maha Gan=
apathi Homam manual started off as Narayan asked Narasimha to help him out =
with the Homam Procedure. (Narayan's own inspiring message in this regard c=
an be read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 727). =
After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed the first copy to Naraya=
n. Such was Narayan's dedication that he started going through the manual o=
ver and over. A few days later I met Narayan and enquired about the Homam m=
anual and all. He very casually mentioned that he was doing the Homam menta=
lly. I was dumbstruck. I said "What?". He said he would perform the whole p=
rocedure as mentioned in the document, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, i=
magining Agni pratishtapana, imagining invoking Ganesha, imagining offering=
 ahutis, everything, start to finish in mind. I was really bowled over by h=
is creative thinking. That is how Narayan practiced. Later, Narasimhaji gif=
ted us Homa Kundam and
 we started our Homas. After few months passed by an=
d I had to go on couple of trips where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and=
 all the samagri. I implemented Narayan's idea and did my homam mentally fo=
r those few days. It then helped me avoid that feeling that I missed my hom=
am. Though this process is not a replacement for the Homam with all the phy=
sical materials, yet, it is a form of a prayer to God. Something is better =
than nothing.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Naliniji, She has =
already decided when you would start the Homam, it's just that we have not =
been informed yet. 
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I wish you a=
ll the very best.

Ravi

Dear Nalini, namaste












...thought I =
should probably start with Ganapati Homam and=C2=A0wondered if I also start=
 Chandi homam...=C2=A0






=C2=A0
{Hari} I also had similar thoughts like=
 you but I think that starting with Ganesha homam is better and then one ca=
n 'graduate' to Chandi homam.

=C2=A0







Sadly, when I enquired locally=
 (New Zealand) at the Indian shops I could not find Homa Kundam...






{H=
ari} Why not try to purchase it from rediff.com? A small copper homa kundam=
 will cost around Rs 150 or so. Additionally you could ask the priest at th=
e local temples there...I am sure they will guide you.=C2=A0


After the fi=
rst attempt to do Ganesha homam on 26 January, I did the homa again last Su=
nday and this time, it worked out fine. =C2=A0


best regards
Hari
