Respected members.
First of all I wish to express my appreciation for the h=
igh level of the matters discussed in this group.
This is my first question=
 here.Here it is.
I noticed that Mantras sometimes are written  with the en=
d of the word related to the divinity "yei" and some other times for the sa=
me mantra is "ye"
For instance:
Om Gum Ganapatayei namaha instead of Om Gum=
 Ganapataye namaha, or
Om Dum Durgayei namaha instead of Om Dum Durgaye nam=
aha
I read an explanation saying that the end "yei" was to arise the kundal=
ini shakti, so I thought that this is the best way of chanting mantra. Am I=
 wrong? What is the right way to chant?

Warm regards
Armando
