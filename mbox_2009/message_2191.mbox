Namaste Rajarshi ji,

Yes, there are differences between the Gita Press & R=
K publications. Manishi Panditji asked me to stick to the Gita Press versio=
n.

Regarding the mp3, you can get the CD from Giri Trading (branches in Ma=
tunga, Mylapore, Malleshwaram) or any place which sells South Indian/Tamil =
devotional CD's.

Regards
Narayan

 I would also like to add that I was able to reduce the time by practicing =
it regularly and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaus=
hik's Durga Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has =
a great voice, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can pause and =
repeat it. I tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast fo=
r my liking.

 I started out to do Chandi Homam, it took me 4Hrs to perform it. So, I sta=
rted reading the script daily to familiarize myself with the text. After pr=
acticing for a month, I got it down to 1Hr-1.15Hr.
