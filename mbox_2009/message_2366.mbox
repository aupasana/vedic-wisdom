Namaste Aditi ji,

Thank you very much for sharing this knowledge. Out of w=
hat all you've mentioned, i was aware of only 'Rest' part.

Though one ques=
tion comes in my mind after reading your message. on physical level, do the=
 Men really require cleansing every month as the women require it? may be n=
ot?
I am not sure of Spiritual cleansing you mentioned for women. may well =
be true or may not be.

any ways, it was a fresh read.

Best Regards,

Utpa=
