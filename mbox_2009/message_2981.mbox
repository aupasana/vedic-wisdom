Namaste,
 
Though people do not use left hand in homam or any religious act=
ivities normally, let me give *my* view on it.
 
The left and right hands a=
re connected to the brain differently. Exercising the motor sensory functio=
ns of the right and left hands more will strengthen different parts of the =
brain and program the neural networks differently. The part of the brain as=
sociated with the left hand has more to do with Ida nadi and creative, intu=
itive and emotional thinking. The part of the brain associated with the rig=
ht hand has more to do with Pingala nadi and systematic, rational and logic=
al thinking. Tradition and rituals prefer systematicity to creativity.
 
Ho=
wever, this is a minor factor and not all left-handers are more intuitive a=
nd not all right-handers are more systematic. The difference between the tw=
o hands is practically very small.
 
Overall, my view is that it is fine if=
 a left-handed person uses left hand to make offerings in a homam.
 
Howeve=
r, there is one more factor at play here. In some cultures, left hand is us=
ed for "dirty" activities such as cleaning the bottom after bowel movement.=
 Thus, use of left hand brings negative connotations in the mind. If such t=
hinking is present, it will be good to avoid using the left hand for homam =
and other rituals. All activities in a ritual are aimed at evoking certain =
thoughts and imagery in the mind, filling the mind with that imagery and ta=
king the mind to the absolute through that imagery when situation is conduc=
ive and all things line up. If one has negative thoughts in the mind associ=
ated with the use of left hand or has a sense of wrong-doing, it will becom=
e a blockage. So one should use the right hand then.
 
Bottomline: If one d=
oes not use left hand for any activities that have a negative connotation i=
n one's mind and if one does not have any feeling of guilt or wrong-doing, =
it is perfectly fine in my view to use left hand to make offerings in fire.=

 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Namaste E=
veryone,
         
        If a person is left handed, is it ok for him to =
do homas? I mean he has to give his ahuti with left hand if he does homa. 
=
         
        Also, normally we consider the right hand to be for auspi=
cious activities, and most people indeed are right handed. But then some le=
ft handed people are also born. Is there any spiritual/karmic reason for th=
is, why a small percentage of people happen to be left handed?

      -Regards
         Rajarshi
