Hi, 

Thanks, but I didn't mean Kaala Bhairava Ashtakam. 

I could find a Bhairava Ashtothara naamaavali in Sanskrit.gde, I was searching for that Ashtotharam in verse.

Regards, 
Hari

I think you r meaning Bhairava Ashtakam by the Great Bhagvat Adi Sankaracharya. If that is so then go to http://www.Agasthia r.Org/kb. htm scroll the page and click on Bhairava ashtakam
