Thanks, Utpalji for pointing out the correction in "Ganapataye".

Is not "N=
ama:" equivalent of NamaH?

I also need confirmation about Vighneshwara who=
m we worship as remover of obstacles being the creator of obstacles as well=
.

Afterall was he not the vighna in is father's path as a result of which =
he lost his head?

Furthermore, is there some significance of the trunk tur=
ned to the right as opposed to the left or the middle?

Any meaning attache=
d to what Ganapati holds in his hands and in the trunk?

What is the meanin=
g of "Gana"?...is it the elements or the energies that underlie creation?

=
Or is it the Ganas in Shiva's retinue?

Who are the ganas who accompany Shi=
va?

i saw some videos of ganapati "drinking" milk and was very impressed!
=

Regards and best wishes
