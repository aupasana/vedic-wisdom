Friends, 
Our Scriptures(Sastras) declare that the time, the environment and the circumstances of  a rebirth will take place precisely as per our accumulated karmas(Sanchita karma) that have to mature and fructify in  that birth. This will also depend upon with whom all one has to come in contact in that birth, and with/through  whom the obligations generated by past karmas  have to be discharged, be it partially or totally.  The doctorine of   Karma is essentially one of opportunities and effort at self-improvement. Life offers us innumerable opportunities to improve.  At every step  Nature is ready to help us further. If we have no self-will, Nature takes us through life in its own in the shadow of the inseparable Maya, with all the temptations, desires and urge for  self-gratification crowding upon us.  Though  there is no escape from the Law of Karma, the law is not one of eternal condemnation or eternal damnation.  It is entirely upto us whether we want to
 get ensnared by the wiles and traps of   Maya or whether we would like to get liberated from the cycle of births and deaths.  If we continue to drift along with the currents of fate with all its swirls and eddies, by not exercising our inborn gifts of willpower and discernment( Viveka)  and keep excusing ourselves for our psychic lethargy, we will continue to be tormented by fate, by destiny,  thus remaining a hapless victim. Certainly it is possible to acquire control or even mastery over our future Karmic directions.  How can this be achieved is a question that is bound to come to all of you. The answer is very simple. Follow the path shown to us by  Bhagawan Sathya Sai Baba. Love all,Serve all. Help ever Hurt Never. Shun ego and attachments. Acquire control over desires(lust), anger,   greed,  pride,jealousy   etc. Cultivate detachment. Inculcate the spirit of Nishkamya seva and karma ie., not claiming ownership for actions done, not expecting fruits
 for  those actions  and dedicating all actions to God.  These are not mere empty advices . The prescription for conquering the effects of Karma or at least not adding further Karmas is shown to us by  Baba.  Why then hesitation for treading that path.?  Pl. think.
