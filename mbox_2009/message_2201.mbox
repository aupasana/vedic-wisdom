Dear ALL,

Namaste.
 These are those very 4 legs of religious duties which =
help both individuals
and world society to attain both material and spiritu=
al bliss. Imbibing true
religion connotes absorbing those principles which =
are universally
acceptable at all times by world humanity. Space, time nor =
religious sects
can ever influence them. Barring those rare exceptions, all=
 world religions
directly or indirectly inspire their followers, to imbibe =
these principles
and actually put them into practice in their day to day li=
ves. If only all
religious leaders of the world continue to urge their foll=
owers to do this
know for sure that human glory will climb great peaks. In =
this manner apt
social governance is totally dependent on this axis.

We ha=
ve already said that these 4 precepts demarcate the various streams of
soci=
al life. In order that the layman imbibes these and puts them into
practice=
 he must be given knowledge regarding the various classifications of
each p=
recept. No doubt if we delve deep very minutely the number of these
classif=
ications will be so high that a layman=92s mind will be incapable of
rememb=
ering them. Hence keeping in mind our present circumstances and
requirement=
s they have been classified into 14 precepts based on their
social applicat=
ions. This number is certainly not that less that it is
difficult to includ=
e all the streams of life within its realm and nor is
this number very high=
 which could confuse the common man=92s psyche. Like the
14 jewels of Samud=
ra Manthan (churning of the ocean in Indian Mythology
called Puranas) the e=
ternal principles of human religion/duty have been
classified as the follow=
ing 14 precepts:
1) theism 2) spirituality 3) religiosity 4) progressivenes=
s 5) self control
6) unity 7) looking upon the world as one peaceful family=
 8) socialism 9)
sacredness 10) punctuality 11) integrity 12) discriminatio=
n between right
and wrong 13) attaining the spiritual goal 14) radiant skil=
ls. In this
manner when man imbibes these 14 jewels of ethics true religios=
ity will
bloom in his psyche/soul. Human transformation and social progress=
 will be
attained only when these are truly imbibed in great measure.

Now =
let us study all these individually and in a systematic manner:

1) THEISM:=
 The very spine of human ethics and values is faith in God=92s
existence. F=
aith in the fruits of ones deeds, ethics and imbibing discipline
is possibl=
e only when we are very sure of an omnipotent power controlling
this cosmos=
. Faith that God does exist helps man refrain from sinning and in
its place=
 inspires him to walk on the path of integrity. This is that golden
fetter =
which can induce man to imbibe greatness at all times. True socialism
and a=
pt management of society can proliferate only when ethics and
discipline ru=
le the roost and that we harbor unshaken faith in them. When we
lack this f=
aith unruliness and crime breed like deadly mosquitoes. This in
turn not on=
ly mars the institution called a family but that tension and
chaos enter ou=
r society in a big way. Hence faith in the existence of a
subtle divine and=
 all powerful principle (God) helps ward off illegal and
criminal activitie=
s in mankind=92s life.
