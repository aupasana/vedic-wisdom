You are certainly welcome to your opinions. However, the view I shared
is the traditional one, and it makes quite a bit of sense to me. I am
content with the traditional understanding, which shows this woman as
a pativrata. In the famed 3-volume set "Upanishad Bhashyam", the
editor, Sri S.N.Sastri has a very lengthly footnote on the subject.
Those who are interested can go through it.

bhavadIyaH,
