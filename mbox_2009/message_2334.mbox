Namaste
=C2=A0
To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that ver=
y statement proves that the whole thing was a fraud, because the temple of =
Jagannath is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and others over and re-=
Hinduised them. 
=C2=A0
With all due respect to the great man that Swamiji =
was, he was possibly not=C2=A0aware what kind of effects an ill-researched =
statement may have in future.
=C2=A0
That statement above is very controver=
tial and possibly incorrect. But the fact that it comes from Vivekananda, o=
ften people may consider it to be sacroscant and land up with wrong conclus=
ions. Without a doubt, Swamiji was a spiritual Giant, but he=C2=A0was not a=
 historian. He naively accepted most of the ideas about Indian history as p=
ropagated by western scholars.
=C2=A0
Therefore, my advise, read lots and f=
orm your own opinions. When it comes to aspects of materialistic knowledge,=
 NOTHING and NO ONE is beyond questioning.

THE SAGES OF INDIA
Volume 3, Lectures f=
rom Colombo to Almora=C2=A0

This mind is continually changing, always in a=
 state of flux; it is finite, it is broken into pieces. How can nature tell=
 of the Infinite, the Unchangeable, the Unbroken, the Indivisible, the Eter=
nal? It never can.Even in our lives, in the life of every one of us here, t=
here come moments of calmness, perhaps, when we see before us the death of =
one we loved, when some shock comes to us, or when extreme blessedness come=
s to us. Many other occasions there are when the mind, as it were, becomes =
calm, feels for the moment its real nature; and a glimpse of the Infinite b=
eyond, where words cannot reach nor the mind go, is revealed to us.=C2=A0

=
Consciousness is bound by the senses.=C2=A0Beyond that, beyond the senses, =
men must go in order to arrive at truths of the spiritual world, and there =
are even now persons who succeed in going beyond the bounds of the senses. =
These are called Rishis, because they come face to face with spiritual trut=
hs.

Any attempt to modernise our women, if it tries to take our women away=
 from that ideal of Sita, is immediately a failure, as we see every day. Th=
e women of India must grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that =
is the only way.

A great landmark in the history of religion is here, the =
ideal of love for love's sake, work for work's sake, duty for duty's sake, =
and it for the first time fell from the lips of the greatest of Incarnation=
s, Krishna, and for the first time in the history of humanity, upon the soi=
l of India.=C2=A0The religions of fear and of temptations were gone for eve=
r, and in spite of the fear of hell and temptation of enjoyment in heaven, =
came the grandest of ideals, love for love's sake, duty for duty's sake, wo=
rk for work's sake.

There was a book written a year or two ago by a Russia=
n gentleman, who claimed to have found out a very curious life of Jesus Chr=
ist, and in one part of the book he says that Christ went to the temple of =
Jagannath to study with the Brahmins, but became disgusted with their exclu=
siveness and their idols, and so he went to the Lamas of Tibet instead, bec=
ame perfect, and went home.=C2=A0

To any man who knows anything about Indi=
an history, that very statement proves that the whole thing was a fraud, be=
cause the temple of Jagannath is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and=
 others over and re-Hinduised them. We shall have to do many things like th=
at yet. That is Jagannath, and there was not one Brahmin there then, and ye=
t we are told that Jesus Christ came to study with the Brahmins there. So s=
ays our great Russian archaeologist.

This one great Northern sage, Chaitan=
ya, represented the mad love of the Gopis. Himself a Brahmin, born of one o=
f the most rationalistic families of the day, himself a professor of logic =
fighting and gaining a word-victory =E2=80=94 for, this he had learnt from =
his childhood as the highest ideal of life and yet through the mercy of som=
e sage the whole life of that man became changed; he gave up his fight, his=
 quarrels, his professorship of logic and became one of the greatest teache=
rs of Bhakti the world has ever known =E2=80=94 mad Chaitanya.=C2=A0

His B=
hakti rolled over the whole land of Bengal, bringing solace to every one. H=
is love knew no bounds. The saint or the sinner, the Hindu or the Mohammeda=
n, the pure or the impure, the prostitute, the streetwalker =E2=80=94 all h=
ad a share in his love, all had a share in his mercy: and even to the prese=
nt day, although greatly degenerated, as everything does become in time, hi=
s sect is the refuge of the poor, of the downtrodden, of the outcast, of th=
e weak, of those who have been rejected by all society. But at the same tim=
e I must remark for truth's sake that we find this: In the philosophic sect=
s we find wonderful liberalisms.=C2=A0
