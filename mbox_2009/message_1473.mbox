Namaste,

Relevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiograp=
hy of Shri Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Ku=
ndalini Awakening is not mandatory for realization. A person can realize hi=
ghest truth without experience of Kundali awakening.
	
Warm Regards,

Utpal=

 Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in t=
