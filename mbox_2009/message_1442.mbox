Namaste Mitesh,

I appreciate you knowledge in various branches. what you s=
aid about integrated approach is also suitable for some or many. Even i am =
thinking of doing Sudarshan kriya in front of Homa fire but it is not happe=
ning.

My question was rather academic and out of curiosity. i am not reall=
y worried about air or fire or something else. actually i am not worried of=
 anything in life.
I have done Sudarshan Kriya, PadmaSadhana, Hariom Pranaa=
yam etc... Taught by AOL, and now doing Homam, i realized that when the wor=
k of one tool is done, if one is sincere, one is automatically lead to the =
next tool for further progress.

I am not aware of Kriya yoga as it is taug=
ht by society founded by ParamaHansa Yogananda. and actually now i don't de=
sire to know that. I read many a books in last 4/5 years and now it seems t=
hat they have done their job and hence i have no inclination to read any bo=
ok now. what i am interested now is the internal transformation and Sadhana=
 for that. not much interested in intellectual discussions also but some ti=
me one get in to that.
All the knowledge of Mahavakya and Theory of Kundali=
ni Shakti etc.. are of no use unless it is experienced and that is what now=
 interests me.

I think now i have found my Guru and Narasimha's instructio=
ns are the one on which i wish to settle down with all my faith but before =
that i need to clear every question that arises.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
