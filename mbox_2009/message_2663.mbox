Hello;
=A0
There is a similar underwater city located under the Pacific Oce=
an between NW Taiwan and Okinawa, the area is one large ancient metropolis,=
 but the lamestream press ignores this. 
=A0
Yonaguni is the name of the so=
uthernmost Japanese island where structures were first found 20 years ago.
=
=A0
The aborigines of Australia have a civilization acknowledged to be 40,0=
00 years old, and they are mistreated and abused rather than protected.
