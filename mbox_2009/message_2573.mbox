 =93Once upon a time, Lord Parameswara wanted to teach a lesson to His son
=
Lord
Subrahmanya who fancied Himself to be a great sage; so Parameswara sat=
 on
the top of Mount Kailasa with Parvati,with a fruit in His hand.

Seeing=
 the fruit both Ganapati and Subrahmanya asked their father,
Parameswara fo=
r it. Then Ishwara said that He would give the fruit to
whoever of them got=
 back first after going round the whole world.

With selfconfidence and pri=
de that he would win the race, Subrahmanya
started immediately riding on hi=
s favourite mount, the peacock,and began
going at a fast pace, frequently l=
ooking behind to assure himself that his
elder brother Ganapati was not fol=
lowing.

What could poor Ganapati do, with his huge belly? His vahanam (mou=
nt) was
after all a mouse. So he thought it was no good competing with Subr=
ahmanya
in the race round the world, and went round Parvati and Parameswara=
, bowed
before them and claimed the reward.

When They asked him whether he=
 had gone round the world, he said, =93All the
worlds are contained within =
you; so if I go round you, it is as good as
going round the whole world.=94=
 Pleased with his reply, Parameswara gave him
the fruit and Ganapati sat th=
ere eating it.

=93In full confidence that he would be the winner,Subrahman=
ya finished going
round the world and arrived at the starting point, but fo=
und Ganapati seated
before Parvati
and Parameswara eating the fruit.

When =
he asked Parameswara to give him the fruit for winning the race,
Ishwara sa=
id, =91There it is, your elder brother is eating it.=92 When he asked
his f=
ather how that could be fair, Ishwara explained to him all that had
happene=
d.

Subrahmanya then realised his vanity in thinking that he was a great sa=
ge,
bowed before his parents, and asked to be pardoned. That is the story. =
The
significance is that the ego which goes round like a whirlwind must get=

destroyed, and must get absorbed in Atma. That is Atma Pradakshina,=94 sai=
d
Bhagavan.
