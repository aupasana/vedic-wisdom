Dear Sir,
In our daily worship, it is not possible to do all rituals like- =
routine worship plus Homam plus Chandi path plus Japam plus Pitru tarpanam =
and other stotra pathas too. We have feeling to satisfy Pitrus. Can we just=
 give some water Arghya by just pouring some one or three spoons water in t=
he plate saying=A0 - Mam so and so Pitrum Tarpayami swadha, Mam so and so M=
atram tarpayami swadha and like (without Darbha and Vedmantras) ? Will it b=
e suffice if we are doing this with great love and faith?

            Namaste,



This is the right=
 forum.



Tarpana need not be performed only oneday a year. It can be a re=
gular 

sadhana. It is not for giving moksha to a soul. It is for releasing=
 a few 

negative attachments that are blocking a departed mind from going =
to higher 

lokas or take birth again. If one has rina (debt) with such a m=
ind, the 

negative attachments and tendencies of that departed mind will i=
nfluence 

one's mind too. Rituals like tarpana free the dearted mind from =
the blocking 

predispositions and also free one's mind of that influence.
=



Here is an answer from the pitri tarpana manual:



------------ -------=
-- --------- --------- --

"External rituals are meant to create the intern=
al visualization needed to 

affect desirable internal changes in the long =
run. For example, one offers a 

full coconut into fire as poornaahuti (com=
plete offering) at the end of a 

homam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of =
surrendering one's head or ego 

(sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in=
 the fire of wisdom and becoming 

free from ego. As one keeps engaging in =
this act again and again, the 

visualization becomes stronger and stronger=
 and ego is slowly reduced.



"One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana=
. Tarpana means "satisfying" or 

"satiating". One acknowledges the debt on=
e has to devas (gods), rishis 

(sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tr=
ies to satisfy them using this 

ritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire i=
n a homam, pitris are invoked in 

water in this ritual, then held in the p=
alm and released in a specific way 

conducive to freeing them.



"One owe=
s a lot to one's parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, 

one o=
wes all of one's genetic characteristics to one's parents and 

ancestors. =
Each ancestor is actually present in the person as a genetic 

characterist=
ic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karmas of one's parents 

and ancest=
ors and each ancestor is actually present in the person as a 

kaarmik pred=
isposition. The latter approach obviously extends to multiple 

lives and s=
ome karmik predisposition is inherited from the ancestors from a 

past lif=
e too, though they may not be related to one in this life.



"By thinking =
of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to give 

them an emanc=
ipation, one is actually trying to free oneself from various 

kaarmic pred=
ispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) 

with sever=
al people. One can view this as an external event of satisfying 

and emanc=
ipating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view 

this as a=
n internal event of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik 

predispo=
sition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to 

externalize f=
irst and perform external rituals, while thinking of what it 

means intern=
ally. This builds up one's visualization and slowly brings about 

internal=
 changes and eventually the desired internal change itself."
