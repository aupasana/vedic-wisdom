Namaste,
 
Not based on any analytical logic.
 
However, the field of duali=
ty is too vast and tricky for one to be sure. Even a vision that a great sa=
int has is not assured to happen. She has the capability to delude *anyone*=
. Only Brahman is beyond delusion. It is possible to get deluded by *anythi=
ng* in the field of duality.
 
I write what I am inspired to see and what I=
 am inspired to write. But you should take what you read with a pinch of sa=
lt.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

                I have seen you mentioning this very of=

                Just curious.

                  Namaste Sri Radhakrishnan,

    =
              While I respect the orthodoxy of Kerala temples, it will not =
work in cold countries and even in north India during winter. Many priests =
do wear shirts when performing homas in winter here, in Boston, USA.

     =
             Honestly, the clothes that we wrap around the body to hide the=
 true body are not a major issue and have very little bearing on our sadhan=
a. The layers of conditioning by various gunas that we wrap around our ego-=
consciousness to hide the true Self IS the major issue that blocks our spir=
itual progress. The former is a symbol and the latter is the real thing tha=
t matters. Shedding those layers surrounding the ego is far more important =
than removing shirt.

                  Actually, though I live in cold cli=
mate, the room in which I recorded the video was comfortable enough and I c=
ould have done without the shirt. But I consciously chose to record it with=
 a shirt on, in order to not send a wrong message to those living in cold c=
limates and having to do homam in cold garages. Instead of sticking to unne=
cessarily strict rules and ending up not doing homam as often, I want peopl=
e to relax rules that do not matter and do it as often as they can. I want =
to de-emphasize things that do not matter that much.

                  Wor=
ld is going to go through interesting times and we need many serious sadhak=
as - those who may be wearing many clothes on the body but shed off as many=
 layers as possible on their ego - doing homam on a regular basis.

       =
           I use more materials in my daily Chandi homam (because I use a b=
igger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, but again that was a co=
nscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I wanted to demonstrate=
 how a very simple homam can be performed quite easily with very few materi=
als and a simple setup. Even a very simple procedure like this will make a =
big difference in the world, if a lot of people are doing this sincerely ev=
eryday.

                  Best regards,
                  Narasimha

asimha,

                          r u living in a foreign country. Normall=

te friends,

                            This weekend, Ravi shot video of a=
 20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being 
                            performe=
d by me, based on the procedure in the manual. He uploaded it to 
         =
                   Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Video =
is one file that is 
                            20 min 28 min long (and 92=
 MB in size). It is downloadable to your computer 
                        =
    and you can play it using free software QuickTime. On YouTube, it is st=
ored 
                            as three parts and has a higher quality. =
You can play those three parts 
                            directly from Y=
ouTube.

                            If you go to the homam homepage (see b=
elow) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam 
                            page, you=
 will see all related links right there.

                            To li=
mit the video size, we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra 
     =
                       and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times each and Atharv=
a seersham once. You can 
                            of course use higher =
counts and do it longer.

                            Thanks to Ravi for hi=
s effort!
