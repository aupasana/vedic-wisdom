why do such situations arise where the dharma of a person has to be that he=

karma is far more profitable I feel.

 Can there is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important vs=A0le=
ss important dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant Tulsidas's=A0 br=
oader dharma may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma sho=

   Namaskaram all my friends,
Please forgive me to say this , by=
 reading of Hanuman chalisa for 108 times or more in a day, i think this wa=
y is not usefull. By reading morning and evening at same time and at same p=
lace with Concentration give much more Good results, that is sankalapm or y=
our Iccha or wish, and i think that this is not enough, in every movement w=
e have to remember, and feel that The God or Godess name in every movement,=
 like comeing out of home, sitting on bike or chair like this with feeling =
that they are with us. Here we get the rsults.

Regards
Harikishan.
