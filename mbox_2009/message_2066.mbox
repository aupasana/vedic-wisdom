Dear Utpal

Then what would be the sense of Hari Hara author of Prasna Marga 
advising us to cast prashna chart to see how the karma from this birth 
influence our future life?

What would be the sense of Brhaspati troubling Himself to write 
dharma-sastra?

I liked your analogy of multiple versions of a movie however my
understanding is that there is nothing called Free will in truest
sense. everything is pre-ordined. anything and everything is shoot in
advance. even if multiple versions are recorded, which version is
actually going to be played is also fixed. it is all FIXED.<br>

However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes
