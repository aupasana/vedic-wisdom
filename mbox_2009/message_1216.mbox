Dear Mitu Bhai,

Naaraz Shu kaam thao chho?

[
We need to enjoy the moment,=
 be joyful, laugh atleast 20 times a day
and most important make others lau=
gh too. We all need to be less
sensitive and more accomodating, this one is=
 for me, be joyful in
pleasure and pain or praise and criticism. I am tryin=
g now to do this
and learning to be the best.
]

don't you think that this =
is the very good opporunity to learn to be 
calm, joyful, accomodative and =
Sthitpragnya in pain when you are 
critcised. The criticism was really gent=
le. think if you are 
criticised badly what will be your reactions?

Didn't=
 i say that your comments were Hilarious :))

Agni sab kuchh jala ke Pavitr=
a kar deta hai.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
