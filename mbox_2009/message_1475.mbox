Namaste,

The poornaahuti is symbolic of the head. You are cutting off your ego and 
offering it and surrendering completely. Coconut is normally used as a 
symbol of head. Alternatives are other fruits. You can put another fruit - 
fresh or dry. The smallest thing is perhaps a raisin (kismis).

Of course, even a small dry coconut piece can be offered as poornaahuti. 
Just imagine it as your head and ego.

Best regards,
Narasimha
