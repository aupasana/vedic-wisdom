Namaste,

I was wondering if other people have the issue of a lot of black soot
being emitted during homam--possibly through the burning of camphor.
When I do a homam of about an hour's duration, I notice that a lot of
black smoke and soot gets generated that covers the room and also
enters into my nose. I was wondering whether this is due to something
I am doing incorrectly (or possibly due to using an inferior form of
camphor), or whether it is a natural effect of doing the homam. I've
been doing weekly homas for a while now, but for Navaratri, I have
started daily homa and the effect has been more pronounced.

For the homa, I use two camphor tablets (one to light the fire, one as
nirajanam offering), dried coconut halves, ghee, and havan samagri
consisting of seeds, leaves and herbs.

I would appreciate anyone's feedback (or suggestions on how to reduce
the amount of soot).

Or, perhaps the soot is an auspicious thing, and I should not be
wanting to reduce it!

Warm regards, and best wishes for Navaratri,
Aditi
