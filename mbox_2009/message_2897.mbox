For the first time, I felt the urge to do tarpanam today and I had only 20 =
min left in amavasya to do the same. It just took slightly more than 10 min=
 to do the same, but, I have lot of questions:

The restrictions to do pitr=
i tarpanam:
Sunday that has saptami tithi
Friday that has a nanda tithi (1s=
t, 6th and 11th tithis)
Sunday with Moon in Bharani, Krittika and Magha
one=
's birth day

Do we have any explanation as to why?

Also, if on a Sunday h=
as Saptami till 10:13 am, can we do pitri tarpanam after 10:13 am (i.e. aft=
er Saptami is over)?
Similarly, if Sunday has sashti till 16:30, can we do =
pitri tarpanam before 16:30?

Does nanda tithi has any relavance to the pak=
sha? (Pratipat in both kshaya and Sukla paksha is nanda tithi. Right?)

For=
 verifyinng Sunday with Moon in Bharani, we should consider the time at whi=
ch you are doing tarpanam and not the whole day. Right?

What is the defini=
tion of birthday? (sorry for silly question).
I am born on a Bhadrapada Suk=
la ekadasi in Uttarashada on a Thurday.
- Should I avoid pitri tarpanam on =
any Thursday?
- Should I avoid pitri tarpanam on any sukla ekadasi?
- Shoul=
d I avoid pitri tarpanam when moon is in Uttarashada?
- Should I avoid pitr=
i tarpanam on nija bhadrapada month sukla ekadasi?
- Should I avoid pitri t=
arpanam in nija bhadrapada month when moon is in Uttarashada?

I see deva a=
nd rishi tarpanam water is left from fingures (position 1 in picture). pitr=
i tarpanam water is left from middle of thumb and index finger (position 3 =
in picture). What about position 2 (below little finger)? When do we let wa=
ter flow out from it?

Please note that 3 offerins are made to 3 generation=
s of maternal and paternal ancestors, while only one offering is made to ot=
her people.

Why? If I offer to others 3 times, any thing wrong?

Also, nor=
mally, we do not seem to be allowed to do9 tarpanam inside home where peopl=
e may be sleeping. Why is this? If we do only deva and rishi tarpanam, can =
we do the same inside home with out any restrictions?

If ancestors are reb=
orn or in hell, how can then come to accept our offering?

If any of the an=
cestors are not satisfied and end of as ghosts, when you invite them, can t=
hey come and occupy either you or some one mentally weak in the family (and=
 hence the restrictions on doing tarpanam when some one may be sleeping) an=
d on some specific days (when your mind may be inherantly week?
