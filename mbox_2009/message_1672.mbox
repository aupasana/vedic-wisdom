Namaste,

By the way, pronouncing "bandhanaan" is not a mistake as you write here. It is the correct pronunciation. The pronunciation changes because of the sandhi as I have written below (vyanjana sandhi).

However, in some mantras if you make a mistake in pronunciation, it could change the meaning of the particular word or the whole mantra. Please get a Guru to teach you the mantra so that you pronounce it correctly.

If you make mistakes inadvertently (it happens!!), then apologize to the Lord and seek forgiveness for any and all mistakes made. And ask Him to consider the ritual complete. You could recite the following for that:

mantrahinam kriyahinam bhaktihinam janardana, yat kritantu maya deva paripurna tadastu me ||

puja madhye mantra tantra svara varna nyoona atirikta lopa dosha praayaschittaartham nama traya mantra japam karishye ||
achyutaaya namaH | anantaaya namaH | govindaaya namaH || (recite 3 times)

Regards,
Dr. Narasimhaswamy Banavara

Dear members,
what could be implications if someone recite mantra with slight miistakes likes pronouncing 'bandhanaan' instead of 'bandhnaat'.
