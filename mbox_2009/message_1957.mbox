Dear Narasimha,

The thread is very interesting and enlightening.

How ever=
, I have one reservation with some of your argument. A=3DB, B=3DC and hence=
 A=3DC is not always correct statement.

Let us take an example:
A does a b=
ad karma to B
As per adwaita, A=3DBrahman.
B =3D Brahman
C =3D Brahman and =
hence Brahman =3D C
A has done bad to B. B =3D Brahman. Hence, A has done b=
ad to Brahman. As Brahman is C, A has done bad to C.

Is this logic incorre=
ct? Not really, but, it is not correct also.

To argue, Kali =3D Krishna, u=
sing Kali=3DMoon, Moon=3DKrishna and hence Kali=3DKrishna is not a fully co=
rrect argument. How ever, this could be an argument give proper considerati=
on to the statement that Kali=3DKrishna. How ever, in my opinion, this is n=
ot a conluding argument.

One of main duty Krishna served was destruction. =
He played to ensure that there is a battle and that mass destruction happen=
ed. He allowed his beloved die with out any attachment and infact instrumen=
tal in some of those deaths (Ghatotkaca for example).

How ever, I keep won=
dering why Krishna saved Parikhit (son of Abhimanyu and Uttara) (who was ki=
lled by Brahmasironamakastra from Aswathama).

Best regards,
Vijay

 Take Chhinnamasta. She is equated to Bhaargava Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantr=
a and Bhaargava Raama is equated to Venus by Parasara. So Chhinnamasta is s=
hown by Venus. From the perspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duality need=
s to be enjoyed and not run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnamasta de=
picted accompanied by a naked couple in copulation and associates drinking =
wine is that nothing is impure and all is Brahman. That is the take of Venu=
s (enjoyment).
>  
> During this process, the ideal companion of Venus (enj=
oyment) is Ketu (detachment and egolessness). Only when the enjoyment is go=
ne through without ego and identification can it be conducive to liberation=

Ketu. Kabandha means the headless one.

ter (dhee, i.e. intellect and discrimination), there is no need for a compa=

 your example. Mahatripuarasundari is equated to Kalki by Munda Mala Tantra=
 and Kalki is equated to lagna by Maharshi Parasara. So Tripura is lagna.
>=
 
> While Sun and Moon show the soul and mind, lagna shows the individualiz=
ed consciousness through which we operate in the world. It includes body an=
d more. It is lagna through which we act in the world. From the point of vi=
ew of lagna, duality is to be overcome by doing what is expected from us by=
 Nature and engaging in actions. Tripura personifies the supreme liberating=
 knowledge of using the individualized consciousness to engage in perfect a=
ctions in the world to liberate oneself.
> 
> Now, the most useful companio=
n of lagna in this process is Moon (mind). The actor within you (lagna) nee=

gna is Moon. Accordingly, the consort of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna =
is Somanatha shown by Moon.

aatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the duality as that wh=
ich needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome. Free thinki=
ng without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal companion in this =
