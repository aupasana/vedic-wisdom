Namaste,

I asked the same question to my Guru few months back and he repli=
ed in a characteristically humble manner. I feel it is ok to send it to lis=
t without permission of his. 

***
I get up at 5 am, do surya namaskar, lit=
tle praanaayaam, inhale steam with turmeric, take bath, do Chandi homam, a =
couple of malas of Gayatri and go to work. I drive to work for one hour. I =
do Gayatri mantra in the car. I leave for work at 9:30 am and reach at 10:3=
0 am. I come home at 8 pm. I eat, read mails, reply to some, do some astrol=
ogy or other reading and sleep at midnight.
***

Warm Regards,

Utpal
