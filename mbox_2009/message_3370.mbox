Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya
(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)
=

Throughout our history, a wide variety of diverse cultures and authors hav=
e created written works of such notable aesthetic grandeur that they deserv=
e to be termed "great literature".   Such illustrious names as Homer, Shake=
speare and Kalidasa come to mind when we contemplate some of the authors of=
 this literature.  Within this grand literary corpus of great literature, h=
owever, a further qualitative distinction can be made.  There is great lite=
rature, to be sure, but then there is eternal literature.  Eternal literatu=
re is comprised of such works that do much more than to merely inspire only=
 a specific group of people, or to endure for many generations, or even to =
inspire us to think great thoughts and to aspire toward lofty heights.  Rat=
her, eternal literature serves the additional vital function of being clear=
 windows upon the Transcendent reality, revealing that Transcendent to us i=
n the most accessible of ways, and providing us with a means by which we ca=
n, in turn, manifest the Eternal in our own mortal lives.  An encounter wit=
h a truly eternal work of literature has more than the mere potential to co=
nvey to us a great idea; it has the potential to make us into enlightened b=
eings.

There are several works that fall under the category of eternal lit=
erature, of which one of the most profoundly illuminating is the ancient Bh=
agavad Gita, or The Song of God.  The Bhagavad Gita is the historical recor=
d of a conversation that took place in 3102 B.C., just before the commencem=
ent of the great Mahabharata War.  This was a philosophical conversation be=
tween the great warrior Arjuna and Bhagavan Sri Krishna, the incarnation (a=
vatara) of God who appeared at the very beginning of our era, the Kali Yuga=
, to restore Dharma and Truth to the world.  So important has this profound=
ly illuminating dialog between man and God been throughout history, that th=
e Bhagavad Gita has often been called the "Bible" of the tradition of Sanat=
ana Dharma, the Eternal Natural Way, which is commonly referred to as "Hind=
uism".  There has been almost no important scholar, philosopher or samprada=
ya Acharya (lineage preceptor) in the history of Sanatana Dharma who has no=
t written a commentary upon this work.  In a further display of the truly g=
lobal significance of this Song of God in the last two hundred years, speci=
fically, the Gita has been translated into the English language alone over =
650 separate times.

Of course, having outlined the ubiquitous number of En=
glish translations of the Gita, this begs the natural question: Why have ye=
t another translation?  The answer lays in a proper understanding of the ep=
istemic nature and soteriological function of the Gita itself.  For, again,=
 the Bhagavad Gita is not an ordinary piece of literature in the normative =
sense.  Rather, it is a work of truly divine origin, having God as its dire=
ct source, and radical existential freedom (moksha) as its purpose.  This b=
eing the case, the Gita cannot ever be understood by a merely academic or t=
heoretical exegetical analysis alone.  Rather, the truths that the Gita rev=
eal can only be fully understood as a result of a direct, non-mediated expe=
rience of Truth.  It is only through the practice of the teachings of the G=
ita that the mysteries of the Gita can be known.  It is only as a result of=
 intense spiritual practice in the form of Yoga and meditation, under the t=
utelage of an authentic and self-realized guru, that the teachings of Sri K=
rishna come to life within the heart, the intellect, and the very soul (atm=
an) of the spiritual seeker.  Sadly, the vast majority of the 650 English t=
ranslations of the Gita tend to take a dry academic approach, at the very e=
xpense of just such a dynamically experiential spiritual understanding.

In=
 the following translation and commentary upon the Bhagavad Gita by Sri Shi=
vadasa Bharati Swami, however, we find one of the brightest and most refres=
hing exceptions to the above scenario.   Sri Shivadasa Swami represents one=
 of the very few Gita translators who has possessed both the academically c=
ultivated methodological ability, coupled with the spiritual insight of a d=
evoted Hindu practitioner of over forty years, necessary to finally do just=
ice to the eternal spirit of the Bhagavad Gita.  With his highly traditiona=
l religious training, rigorous philosophical background and initiatory cred=
entials firmly cemented in the orthodox Smarta tradition of the Advaita sch=
ool of Vedantic Hinduism, Sri Shivadasa Swami has the ability to speak in t=
his work with a quietly humble, yet powerfully forceful, authority that few=
 other contemporary translator-commentators have been able to raise.

In an=
 age in which authenticity, honesty, inspired numinous insight and philosop=
hical acumen seem to have taken a backseat - albeit however so temporarily =
- to the latest commercially oriented, new age mystical fads of the day, th=
e writings of Sri Shivadasa Bharati Swami have courageously echoed the eter=
nal voices of the great sages, the rishis, reminiscent of an ancient Golden=
 Age of spiritual attainment.   Sri Swamiji has revealed to the world once =
again that clear window to Transcendent reality, and allowed that eternal w=
ork of literature known as the Bhagavad Gita to shine forth for the world t=
o marvel at.  I await eagerly to witness what additional jewels of writing =
are destined to be unleashed from the pen of Sri Swamiji in the future.

m Shanti
