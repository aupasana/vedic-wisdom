Dear all,

I have a few questions which I hope to get the answers here.  

=
A =3D do homams for all gods daily
B =3D do homams daily according to the r=
uling day god
C =3D do Ganesha's homams daily too

Should I do option "A" d=
aily ? or option "B" + "C" ? or should it be option "A" + "C" ?

Please hel=
p me in clearing my confusion.  I am very confused at the moment.

Last but=
 not least, I would like to thanks PVR.N.Rao ji for his infinite contributi=
ons (all what he've been doing so far).  I really appreciate this kind sens=
e of spreading bhakti to people.

Regards,
anooj
