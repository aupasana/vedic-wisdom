Namaskaram Narasimhaji and all others as well,
I had a very elementary ques=
tion on Karma for which I have not been able to get a satisfactory answer s=
o far. Request you to kindly answer them for me. I have read books on Vedan=
ta and Advaita but the answer still eludes me or may be I am not able to co=
mprehend the hidden meaning because of my limited knowledge.

1) Karma as d=
efined in wiki "Karma (Sanskrit: कर्म  k=A8=A2rma (=
help=A1=A4info), k=A8=A2rman- "act, action, performance"[1]; Pali: kamma) i=
n Indian religions is the concept of "action" or "deed", understood as that=
 which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called =
saṃs=A8=A1ra)"

If the soul is in the garb of an animal, lets say a D=
og or a cat or any other non human entity , what karma can it do so that it=
 can progress to the next level. I mean We humans can understand what is go=
od and what is bad, but animals lack the sixth sense (or atleast we think s=
o) fail to differentiate this and hence what is that they are supposed to d=
o so that they perform their karmas to the best to go forward?

2) If my ac=
tions are already governed by my past karmas then how do I justify the good=
 and bad that I do? I mean whatever good or bad that I do is already predef=
ined . In such a case how can I be held accountable for a good or a bad dee=
d? Because its the karma that is driving me to do something. So this become=
s a infinite loop. as Adi Shankara says in Bhaj Govindam , "Punarapi janana=
m , punarapi maranam"... there seems to be no way out of this

Please forgi=
ve me for my ignorance but I felt I need to get this very elementary query =
clarified .

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
