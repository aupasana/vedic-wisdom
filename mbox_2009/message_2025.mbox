Dear Utpalji and=A0All
=A0
There is an interesting description from Sri Aur=
obindo regarding the "Ashura of falsehood". This he said was not just a gen=
eric name but indeed a real and powerful being, that was created at the poi=
nt of creation. It exists from a differnt plane and it aims to destroy life=
 on earth. It cares nothing for humans and loves eventual wanton destructio=
n of life.
=A0
Hitler was used as a medium by this Ashura, once after Hilte=
r had an epileptic fit in a trench and was taken to a hospital. Since that =
time, this being used to come to him in a silver armour, completely covered=
, and calling itself as the Lord of Nations when infact he was the=A0Lord o=
f Falsehood. =A0This Ashura used to direct Hilter's every move, and it was =
the power of this Ashura that flowed when Hilter delivered his speeches, me=
smeizing the whole German nation. He said this Ashura does not die and has =
the ability to control many different people simultaneously. Only someone s=
piritually evolved can see through this Ashuras activities.
=A0
During the =
war, Sri Aurobindo publicly stated that this Second World War was a fight b=
etween Ashuras and Devas. And whoever faugh against Germany will become an =
instrument of nature, even if that entity has other flaws in it. Nature alw=
ays looks at a greater evolutionary dharma.=A0 To illustrate this he gave t=
he example3 of the Kurukshetra war. Even though each of the Pandavas had in=
dividual flaws, yet Krishna alligned himself with them, because they were f=
ighting for a greater, evolutionary dharma pertinent to=A0 that time and pl=
ace. 
=A0
The defeat of Hilter had been orchestrated by Sri Hitler and the =
Mother. The Mother went to Hitler in the exact form as the Asura used to ta=
ke - silver armour etc - and advised Hitler to attack Russia. That was begi=
nning of Hitler's downfall. The Russian winter weakened his troops.
=A0
=A0=

Interestingly, years later, the head of the exorcism division of the Roman=
 Church mentioned in an inteview that Hitler was a man posessed by the devi=
l. The then Pope had tried an exorcism from Vatican but it did not work.

Yes. quite evident. I have realized this very fact a cou=

To Rajarshi - It was a fantastic read. I liked your delineation and de=
tailed understanding of Aurobinod's article. As you rightly mentioned, when=
 we sum up the article and Narasimha's feeling (and foresight of few others=
 as well), it can mean that the Age of Truth or Dharma (However small durat=
ion it may last) within Kaliyuga is about to Start - Probably, in the comin=
g few decades or centuries ground will be prepared.

>There are so many dif=
ferent elements in the Universe, as well as >different Universes, that comp=
ared to all that we are too tiny as a >species. 

If Information from one p=
articular slide (About Physical Universe)is any way close to authentic, the=
n, the scaling of Milky Way and our solar system can be relates thus: if Mi=
lky way is mapped to 130 Km in Diameter - Our entire solar system is reduce=

So now any scale to map our physical ego?

r the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yo=
gi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been express=

 for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to=
 manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence i=

consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter=
 is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards=

a of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so ou=
twardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events.=
 According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a tran=
sformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and=
 so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly=
, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through=
 Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in count=
ering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura m=

 With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =
human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=
 although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=
rophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=
r the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=
 carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=
eans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =
be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=

ne, 2009, 9:31 PM<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Namaste<BR>> <BR>> I foun=
d an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writing. I am posting it =
here for anyone interested.<BR>> <BR>> Near the beginning of the 20th=
 century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=
an to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=
es of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=
lution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=
th and that the time for this divine
 emergence into Earth life was now. He=
 spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown=
 due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this=
 =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<BR>> =EF=BF=BD<BR>> Sri Aurobindo was joi=
ned in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later bec=
ame known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive c=
ellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties =
we face today.<BR>> =EF=BF=BD<BR>> Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine =
force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of co=
nsciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter i=
s called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards o=
ut of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has =
reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in=
 his inner visions, he foresaw that we
 would soon be experiencing a descen=
t of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=
=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.<BR>> =EF=BF=BD<BR>&g=
t; Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in=
 what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if =
seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even=
 if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality.=
 There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer =
senses seems to contradict it.<BR>> <BR>> Sri Aurobindo recognized th=
at humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reac=
hed in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, bu=
t is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species.=
 Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousne=
ss higher than the human rational mind, what
 may be termed the Supermind, =
has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active the=
re. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.<BR>> <=
BR>> Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and l=
ater with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another lea=
p forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supe=
rmind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we =
will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =
=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=
ssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=
rging with it.<BR>> =EF=BF=BD<BR>> Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=
=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influ=
ence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able t=
o merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than
 mind-consciousness. <=
BR>> <BR>> Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still i=
nhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Ligh=
t, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular=
 consciousness. <BR>> <BR>> Finally, our ultimate goal as a species i=
s the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within=
 the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=
=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and =
spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.<BR>> <BR>> The great work =
of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness d=
own into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a un=
ified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simu=
ltaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiti=
ng the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation
 in collecti=
ve matter.<BR>> Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is c=
orresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experi=
ence with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces=
, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of =
Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the fo=
rces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of cur=
rent global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has =
gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has retu=
rned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on E=
arth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneli=
ng=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive =
inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see ho=
w this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current
 po=
litical sphere.<BR>> <BR>> With the descent of this new vibratory con=
sciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. Howeve=
r, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they=
 would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically er=
ases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet,=
 the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which cou=
ld overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and viole=
nce. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations =
of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with=
 all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experie=
nced if not for this power of harmonization!<BR>> <BR>> When does all=
 this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage wa=
s set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent.
 The Mother=
 said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and =
that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough t=
his minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 wou=
ld be a turning point.<BR>> <BR>> This was a very interesting read an=
d matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.<BR>> =
