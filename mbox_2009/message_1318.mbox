Dear Amitji 
Nama=
ste

The voice is of Shree Maa, a very realized soul, who lived for a long =

period of time in the North east India, near Assam.
She did a lot of penan=
ce in that north east region.

She lives now in California, USA.

She has d=
one Chandi Paath for many thousands of time. She in her 
prevoius birth was=
 born along with RamaKrishna Paramhans.

Their books on poojas and chandi p=
aath are one of the best, very 
methodical, correct, and a detailed process=
 oriented. I like it very 
much. Good explaination and Translation in engli=
sh.

Their site have a lot of material on chandi paath and many doubts can =

be resolved by reading or searhing their site or even asking 
questions to=
 her or swamiji too. They do respond via email.

She has a bengali/assamese=
 accent. I think all of us have an accent 
and it is ok.

This is the only =
rendering I knew of, if others have better rendering 
please share.

Best R=
egards
Mitesh
