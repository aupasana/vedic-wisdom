Pranam!

As suggested by you i have switched over to Ganapati mantra. I pic=
ked on "om gam ganapataye namah" because it is short and simple. 

My curio=
usity has been aroused about the different "quality" of mantras. The above =
mantra is supposed to be a "moola" mantra and also a "bija" mantra for gana=
pati. Can you explain the significance of this?As a remover of obstacles wh=
ich other mantra would you suggest for ganapati? i am drawn to "aum vakratu=
ndaya hum" also, but do not know how to pronounce the mantra correctly and =
neither do i know what is the "correct" intonation for this. Should i stick=
 to one main mantra only? Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneou=
sly towards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it mentally. S=
hould i resist doing this since you have advised that i should do Ganapati =
mantra at least for a month?

Thankyou

Regards and best wishes.
