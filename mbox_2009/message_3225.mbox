Dear Rajarshi,

Do not think that I'll be offended or misunderstand you to=
 be a cruel
hearted etc...

In this message, i am giving only what i feel r=
ight as per me and how i
think about the whole issue myself.  so pl. take t=
hat in consideration.

But to say that it is  immoral or that one does not =
reach God if one
consumes non-vegetarian food, is illogical, incorrect and =
pure bunkum.
In my previous message, i've clarified some points.  i put it =
again
below:

Please do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspecti=
ve of
Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point in=

Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non
Violenc=
e)
against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).

***

Anyway, my point is=
, I understand that it is good to eat totally
vegetarian food when you enga=
ge in sadhana, specially things like
havans, or else it conflicts with your=
 system badly.

In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not=
 correct will
remain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not right=
 then for
me it'll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a different =
matter,
if in future i succumb to challanging conditions and start eating m=
eat
but even then it'll not justify and make it proper thing.

***
Dear Raj=
arshi, Now i hope you don't get offended by my message. i
apologise in adva=
nce for my bluntness.

  your second Para and some writings in your earlier=
 message gives me
impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, D=
esh/kaal etc...
does not appeal me. to be very honest.

In my opinon, if on=
e can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc..
then anything under the=
 Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those people
who choose to eat Crab, Sna=
kes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly
alright. even people who have starte=
d eating human flesh are also
acceptable and not doing anything wrong as pe=
r the 'their' thinking.

To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc...,=
 and try to make
quality judgements by the logic of 'Direct killing' and 'e=
ating meat of
already dead' does not go well with me. it is just a philosop=
hy to cover
up.

Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becua=
se they hate
killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and the=
re are few
more i know. howvever they are very very very rare.

***

The ab=
ove arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people who
provide =
such arguements,  but these arguments are nonsensical and
childish. Almost =
Zakir Naik style of arguments.

  I agree completely. it is childish, Laugh=
able and cruel jokes. Thats
how i also take it when such people talk such n=
onsense.

***

Lastly, i'll add a philospohical thought. If so much of kill=
ing every
hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in=
 the
world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have =
a
peacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma
=
(Cause & effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human
societies=
.

Om Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:

Warm Regards,

Utpal

One cannot avoid it however
much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are hea=

many of my friends who were=C2 vegetarian people would give me a simil=
ar logic, as you mentioned in your first writing. My point is, as a non-veg=
etarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, ov=
er animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C2  this logic that many vege=
tarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating non=
-veg, does not hold good.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> I personally can not lo=
ok at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. Peop=
le in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a ch=
icken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered =
Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they jus=
t overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water i=
s such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don't have proper English wo=
rd to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fis=
h thus is so tasty.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> =C2 <BR>> I understan=
d and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me =
cruel hearted. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> When the question of sensitivity =
comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of c=
onditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect anothe=
r. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C2  <BR>> =C2 <=
BR>> Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel w=
here they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My fri=
ends seemed disgusted. I asked them, "Why?". If you can eat a chicken or a =
fish, what is wrong=C2 if someone eats an insect. Just because one is =
born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one =
gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I to=
ld them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they w=
ould gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. =
We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinio=
n is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are th=
e only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don'=
t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the wor=
ld diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a<=
BR>> vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/family =
in a later lifetime which=C2 eats non-vegetarian food, he would not ev=
en bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C2 people who faint at=
 the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations daily=
. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an ind=
ividual, but it=C2 cannot be=C2 a universal logic applicable to a=
ll.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> A far better angle of tackling this is the id=
ea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing=
 an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead =
meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someo=
ne (a non-vegetarian)=C2 does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he ca=
n buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would g=
et for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C2 It is s=
imilar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal which has come =
to the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer,=
 or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat i=
n this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which n=
ever hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they never grow=
 into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does one get for c=
onsuming that? God knows.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> An average non-vegetari=
an, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple =
diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. F=
rom a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who feed=
 on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to se=
