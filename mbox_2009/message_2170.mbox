Namaste Narasimha gAru,
   Is this Solar Eclipse a valid eclipse(in the tra=
ditional sense) in North East USA? From NASA Eclipse page I see that the ec=
lipse path starts little west of India and ends in Marshall islands or so. =
Actually, all of Americaa and especially the North East USA doesn't seem to=
 be even in the penumbral region. In such a case, do we still observe the e=
clipse time niyamas like bathing (before/after), disposing off cooked items=
, protection using dharbha grass etc. Please do clarify, if you get some ti=
me before the solar eclipse starts. 
Thanks and Regards,
-Prasad

three consecutive eclipses - a lunar eclipse on 2009 July 7, a solar eclips=

n is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun's Mrityu Bhaga (death inflic=
ting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ke=
tu and ascendant are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a pro=
blematic eclipse.

can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra d=
