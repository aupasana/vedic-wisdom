Namaste,

(1) Our current goal is to create a group of people who do a homam everyday 
and short procedure is conducive to it. Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 
hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday. It is like 
fasting everyday and eating a 30-course meal once every few months vs eating 
dal and rice everyday.

However, your request is good and I will try to create a long procedure 
manual atleast for Mahaganapathi homam.

(2) I have all of them in mind. Purusha sookta homam is the simplest homam 
and very useful for spiritual progress. I do have that in mind. Sudarsana 
homam can also be done on a regular basis quickly. But navagraha homam is 
more time-consuming. I will eventually put all of them up.

Best regards,
Narasimha
