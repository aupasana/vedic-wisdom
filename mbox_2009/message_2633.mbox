 1st January, 1946

The other day I learnt of one more incident in Bhagavan=
=92s life on the hill
and so I am writing to you about it.

When Bhagavan w=
as living in Virupaksha Cave, the roar of a leopard was heard
from the plac=
e where drinking water was available nearby.

By the time the scared devote=
es had gathered some plates and drums in order
to make a noise and drive th=
e leopard away, it had drunk the water it
required and gone away with one m=
ore roar.

Bhagavan looked at those frightened devotees and said to them in=
 an
admonishing tone, =93Why do you worry so much? The leopard intimated to=
 me by
the first roar that she was coming here. After drinking water she to=
ld me by
another roar that she was going. She went her own way.

She never =
meddled with your affairs. Why are you so scared? This mountain is
the home=
 of these wild animals, and we are their guests. That being so, is
it right=
 on your part to drive them away?=94

Perhaps with the intention of relievi=
ng them of their fears, Bhagavan added,
=93A number of siddha purushas (hol=
y beings) live on this mountain. It is
perhaps with a
desire to see me that=
 they come and go, assuming various shapes. Hence, you
see it is not right =
for you to disturb them.=94

>From that time onwards, the leopard used to co=
me frequently to that place to
drink. Whenever the roar was heard, Bhagavan=
 used to say, =93There you are!
The leopard is announcing her arrival.=94 T=
hen again he used to say, =93The
leopard announces her departure.=94 In thi=
s manner he used to be quite at ease
with all the wild animals.

One devote=
e asked Bhagavan whether it is true that,when living on the
mountain, he wa=
s friendly with snakes,and one snake crawled over his body,
one climbed up =
his leg and so on. In reply, Sri Bhagavan said:

=93Yes, it is true. A snak=
e used to come to me in all friendliness. It used to
try to crawl on my leg=
. At its touch my body used to feel as though it was
tickled, so I withdrew=
 my leg; that is all. That snake used to come of its
own accord and go away=
.=94
