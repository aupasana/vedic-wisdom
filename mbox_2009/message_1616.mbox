Utpal Ji,

I agree with your comments. But i have my own doubts about wheth=
er an individual can be identified by just one caste even if that has to be=
 identified by his karma/deeds? meaning, leaving about the rishis, rajas (k=
ings) for normal people he might be doing lot of activities like he must be=
 doing lot of sadhana (a brahmin deed), must be working like a butcher (say=
 as an example) performing some sudra act or a vysya act to earn money..in =
that case what caste can he be classified as?

Thanks
KK
