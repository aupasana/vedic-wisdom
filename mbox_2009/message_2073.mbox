Namaste Rafal,

I understand your words but i wish to point out that "Every=
thing is pre-defined" is not against Dharma. Fixed will does not in any way=
 goes against Dharma Shastra by Brihaspati or any other moral codes given b=
y Manu and others.

Say for instance: A is suppose to be a fool in a birth =
so 'A' does foolish activities and gets the fruits of the same. B is suppos=
e to be a demon in one life. it is ordained that way and hence B keeps on e=
ngaging in gruesome activities due to wrath, jealosy, pride, etc..does exac=
tly as ordained and gets the fruits accordingly. when A and B are destined =
to realise self, they will think and act accordingly, they will meet a righ=
t Guru, do lawful activities, sadhanaas etc.. and the fruit of all these wi=
ll be self realisation which was already fixed. so every activities and cor=
responding Fruits (mental and physical), would be in compliance with the la=
w of nature and ther is no violation just becuase the drama is fixed. 


Wa=
rm Regards,

Utpal
