Namaste Garu!

One questioning thought which is stuck in my mind which i wi=
sh to put it in front of you & list.

Agni is purer then Vayu - this compar=
ision statement is not very difficult to accept.

BUT i am thinking about Y=
ogis, who reached the truth by first holding on to the silk thread (breath)=
 which is the only available external link which connects external and inte=
rnal world contineously.

for example take a couple of cases such as Babaji=
 and his leanage. Sri Sri Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many such known =
and unknown.
these people (especially the first to names) advocated 'Kriya =
Yoga' in a very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebrated work 'The =
autobiography of a yogi' categorically mention that Kriya Yoga is like a Je=
t Flight to reach the truth in comparision to the other methods which are l=
ike bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first taught by Kris=
hna to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again revived by Mahaava=
tar Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.
It is claimed =
that Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for some 8 days in the yea=
r 1980 and he came out with 'Sudarshan Kriya Yoga' for the world. he starte=
d teaching that and now it is practised regularly by millions of people.
I =
know from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of Babaji and Sudarshan k=
riya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say that because one day i=
 yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kriya yoga and within a m=
onth i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.
***
The point is that thes=
e people are advocating some or the other form of Kriya yoga, Raja Yoga, Ha=
thyoga etc.. for all of these initial base is external medium which is Air =
(Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya for some 2 years.
***
Babaji or =
Sri Sri or any other master (present day or ancient) have stressed on this =
medium. they actually didn't advocate Agni for the masses (Though as i said=
 in prevous message that some have started advocating Homa of late). it is =
obvious that they may not be oblivious of the fact that Agni is more purer =
medium then air.

***
I Wish to have your views on this whole subject.

you=
rs spiritually,

Utpal
