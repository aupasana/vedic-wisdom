Dear Mitesh,

It is originally

om bhuuH bhuvaH suvaH

Then sandhi (joining) is forced on the words and it becomes after sandhi:

om bhuurbhuvassuvaH

Thus, both versions are valid. However, it is more logical to force sandhi.

Also, for suvaH, there is another version "svaH". While "suvaH" is more 
popular where I am from, "svaH" is more popular in north India. Both are 
valid.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Pronounciation of Gayatri Mantra


> Namaste

> I was browing a web site (www.jyotishsastra.com)and found Gayatri mantra 
> as follows:
>
> The Mantra
>
> Aum
> Bhuh Bhuvah Svah(give a fraction of a second halt here)
> Tat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of a second halt here)
> Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second halt here)
> Dhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat
>
> I always pronounced as
> Aum Bhur and not Bhuh.
>
> What is correct way to saying it bhur or bhuh.
> The lokas are Bhu, Bhuvah and Svaha.
>
> I do believe above is the correct way of saying the verse, i.e. halting
