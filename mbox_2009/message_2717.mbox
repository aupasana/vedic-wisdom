 GOD laughs on two occasions. He laughs when the physician says to the
patient's mother, "Don't be afraid, mother, I shall certainly cure your
boy."

God laughs saying to Himself, "I am going to take his life, and this man
says he will save it!" The physician thinks he is the master, forgetting
that God is the Master.

God laughs again when two brothers divide their land with a string, saying
to each other, "This side is mine, that side is yours."

He laughs and says to Himself, "The universe belongs to Me, but they say
they own this portion or that portion,"
