          Dear Manish,



> What does self identification with a deity mean=
s?



Who are *you*? Are you really this body?



One normally identifies w=
ith a body, a name and a limited identity that goes 

with that body. This =
identification is very very strong.



You are actually Brahman, the all-pe=
rvading, all-knowing and all-being 

essence of the universe. The same esse=
nce manifests as various beings, 

including various deities and various pe=
ople, including your own body. And 

*you* really are that essence and not =
the body. Still you identify only with 

the body.



It is possible to des=
troy this self identification with the body and 

identify with another obj=
ect such as a deity. When you identify with a 

deity, your consciousness i=
s in communion with that of the deity. Your will, 

thoughts and actions ar=
e those of the deity.



*        *        *



> When somebody says me to =
self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to 

> do ?



First I can tel=
l you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself 

that you will =
now identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want 

to be great.=
 In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, 

until ego com=
pletely goes, it is not even possible.



Before you can self-identify with=
 any deity, first your false 

self-identification with body has to cease. =
You should absolutely not think 

of your body as "I".



Your will, though=
ts and actions should be those of Shiva.



Will Shiva think of a specific =
physical body as "I"? No. If a specific 

physical body has good or bad thi=
ngs happening to it, will Shiva feel 

pleasure or pain? No. If people are =
praising a specific person, will Shiva 

feel proud? No. If people are atta=
cking and criticizing a specific person, 

will Shiva feel angry? No.



Th=
e first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a 

sta=
te where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the body and 

=
praise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other people. Reach a =


state where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all circumstances.


=

WHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking =
of 

Shiva.



*        *        *



Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could self-id=
entify with not only deities, but 

pretty much any object of the universe.=
 Once he went into deep meditation 

while admiring the beauty of grass in =
the lawn with dew on it. As he was 

absorbed in deep meditation, a bird ca=
me and walked on the grass. His 

sishyas observed that some bruises appear=
ed on his body suddenly then!



Best regards,

Narasimha
