Namaskaram.

I was wondering if there is available a homa vidhi for Satyanarayana to be
performed on Purnima. I know that often, alongside the puja, a separate homa
is conducted for Sri Satyanarayana, and while I have the puja vidhi I do not
have the homa vidhi.

I have just joined the group and am enjoying learning so much from all of
the sadhakas on the list.

My humble and deeply grateful prostrations to Shri Narasimha on this divine
seva he is performing. I have been learning and conducting the Lakshmi Homa
for the past few months, and it is a very fulfilling puja and I am so
grateful that this auspicious and potent form of sadhana is being made
accessible to the public in such a clear and authentic form.

Warm regards,
Aditi
