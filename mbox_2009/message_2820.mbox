Rajarishi Ji

Please treat these as just my thoughts.I am very much junior =
in both wisdom and scripturual knowledge.

"To add to my query,=C2 a good n=
umber of=C2 religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying t=
ruth is one, how can it be so contradictory? "

The Abrahamic faiths also d=
o not beleive in Reincarnation. In reality the underlying truth is there is=
 a lot of contradiction ...but then the face of christianity you know today=
 might not even be what it was originally.

1.The version of Christianity y=
ou know today is the one obtained after Ceasar forcibly burnt all the gnost=
ic bibles and differing versions of truth ....

2.All upcomign historical e=
vidence points to the fact that Christ had a wife by name Mary Magdalene...=
.

Now Christianity condemns the very concept of sex as cardinal sin and as=
sumes every human being is born in Sin.

3.In Kashmir there is still a plac=
e where they worship the padukas of christ when he visited Kashmir...

Hist=
ory and Religion are written by the victors.

Same is the case with Islam..=
.If you open any authentic version of the holy book you will be surprised b=
y some of the inconsistent verses which often smack of hate...of a world fi=
lled with Kafirs and Non beleivers and Explicit prohibition of Idol worship=
 etc.


It is my humble opinion that the Avatars of Christ and Mohammed cam=
e to atleast steer the western continent towards a little dharma. The moder=
n day versions of both these faiths have deviated much from the original me=
ssages.

Hinduism also has deviated from the spirit of the vedas with corru=
ptions entering into the practise of caste etc...but still is much better i=
n preservation of the original meaning.


Yogananda, Sivananda , Maharishi =
Mahesh Yogi and various saints including Srila Prabhupada when they entered=
 the west in the early 1960's had the unenviable task of explaining some of=
 the concepts in terms which the westerner could understand. The parallel i=
magery is what comes from that...


If somebody could separate the chaff fr=
om the grain and read the books they will definetly reach salvation in thos=
e paths, if not it is much better to stick to Hinduism.

I apologize before=
hand if any feathers are ruffled.

Regards
VemparlaRamKishore
