Namaste

Recently someone refered me to a sloka from the Padma Purana which=
 goes this way:


Padma Purana:

shAstrANyapi cha sarvANi trividhAni mahAma=
te ||
yAni satyavaraM viShNuM vadanti parameshvaram.h |
tAni shAstrANi sarv=
ANi sAtvikAni matAni vai ||
prajApatiM kR^ishAnuM cha tathA devIM sarasvatI=
m.h |
paratvena vadachChAstraM rAjasaM parichaxate ||
yachChAstraM liN^gapA=
ramyaM vAmadevamumApatim.h |
tamaH pravartakaM vakti tattAmasamudAhR^itam.h=
 ||

All Shastras are of three types. That Shastra which praises Lord Vishn=
u as Parameshvara is Satvika. That which praises Brahma or Agni or Sarasvat=
i Devi is Rajasika. That which praises Shiva, since it leads to Tamas, is T=
amasika shAstra


Why are the Puranas classified as Satwik, Rajasik and Tam=
asic? Is this a contradiction to say teh Linga Puran which exhalts Shiva? O=
r, over time, did the scriptures get corrupted by people of various sects w=
ithin Sanatan Dharma?

-Regards
