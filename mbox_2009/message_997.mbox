Dear Friend,
Yours is a very good matching. You are made for each other. Ve=
ry good tuning. Girl is also possesive, emotional, God fearing, dedicated. =
The only thing is there can be some delay in progeny and better to have a r=
outine check up for the girl so that proper treatment can be started. There=
=A0can be =A0some Fellopean tube problem or problem related to Overy functi=
on. May be, she may be alright but I have some doubts. So far married life =
is concerned, a very good match. God bless you both. Forget about other pre=
dictions.
