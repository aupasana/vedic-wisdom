Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
You ask a very good question.
=C2=A0
Agni is the =
element of transformation. It symbolizes absorbing and digesting experience=
s. As you make offerings in fire and they burn in fire, various spiritual e=
xperiences are processed and digested by your internal fire.
=C2=A0
Tongue =
is that which allows one to taste things that one is going to accept inside=
 and digest. Each tongue of fire stands for=C2=A0a spirit that controls how=
 you absorb spiritual experiences.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The seven=
 tongues of Agni are: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava, Sulohita, Sudhoomra-Varna, =
Sphulingini, and Vishwaruchi.
=C2=A0
Kaali is the dark and black/blue=C2=A0=
fire. It symbolizes=C2=A0the spirit of detachment. Spirit of detachment con=
trols how you absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue=
 of fire.
=C2=A0
Karaali is the=C2=A0monstrous, dreadful fire that looks li=
ke a wide=C2=A0open mouth. Spirit of attachment and desire controls how you=
 absorb your experiences, when you are offering in=C2=A0that=C2=A0tongue of=
 fire.
=C2=A0
Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering=C2=A0and unstable =
flame. Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls how you abso=
rb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.
=C2=A0
S=
ulohita=C2=A0is=C2=A0the=C2=A0(copper like) dark red color flame. Spirit of=
 determination and strength controls how you absorb your experiences, when =
you are offering in that tongue of fire.
=C2=A0
Sudhoomra-Varna is the grey=
ish/purple/ smoke-colored fire. Spirit of confusion=C2=A0(could also be res=
olution of confusion) controls how you absorb your experiences, when you ar=
e offering in that tongue of fire.
=C2=A0
Sphulingini is the fire with spar=
ks. Spirit of aggression and haste=C2=A0(could also be a great intuition/in=
sight) controls how you absorb your experiences, when you are offering in t=
hat tongue of fire.
=C2=A0
Vishwaruchi is the bright fire. Spirit of focus,=
 knowing, being and=C2=A0bliss controls how you absorb your experiences, wh=
en you are offering in that tongue of fire.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
=
As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed between you and f=
ire, the external fire in the homa kundam will reflect your internal fire. =
When your mind is well-focused and blissful, the fire=C2=A0will automatical=
ly burn bright.
=C2=A0
The state of your=C2=A0mind will decide how you will=
 taste the spiritual experiences you are going to absorb from around you. T=
hat=C2=A0in turn decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal fi=
re are=C2=A0receiving food right now. That in turn decides which tongues of=
 the external fire are=C2=A0receiving offerings right now.
=C2=A0
The exter=
nal fire is a mirror to your internal state. An adept may=C2=A0be able to d=
etect, looking at the fire, which tongues of=C2=A0fire are active right now=
 and hence guess the state your mind is in.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
=
Of course, trying to pay too much attention to this technicality and becomi=
ng over-conscious of the nature of fire is unneeded.=C2=A0Though external c=
an be=C2=A0used to manipulate the internal (within some limits), it can bec=
ome a distraction.
=C2=A0
Whether internal follows external or=C2=A0externa=
l follows internal a invalid question. The reality is that the two change t=
ogether. Neither is the cause=C2=A0and neither is the effect. They just hap=
pen together.
=C2=A0
Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fir=
e with the *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen automati=
cally. It may take time, but it will happen by itself.
=C2=A0
Best regards,=

Narasimha
