Discipleship (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900)
Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses

The first condition is that the student who wants to know the truth must give
up all desires for gain in this world or in the life to come.

The second condition is that the disciple must be able to control the
internal and the external senses and must be established in several other
spiritual virtues.

The next qualification is that the disciple must have faith in the Guru
(teacher). In the West the teacher simply gives intellectual knowledge; that
is all. The relationship with the teacher is the greatest in life. My
dearest and nearest relative in life is my Guru; next, my mother; then my
father. My first reverence is to the Guru. If my father says, "Do this", and
my Guru says, "Do not do this", I do not do it. The Guru frees my soul. The
father and mother give me this body; but the Guru gives me rebirth in the
soul.

Some years ago one of your Christian teachers, a friend of mine, said, "You
believe in Christ?" "Yes," I answered, "but perhaps with a little more
reverence." "Then why don't you be baptised?" How could I be baptised? By
whom? Where is the man who can give true baptism? What is baptism? Is it
sprinkling some water over you, or dipping you in water, while muttering
formulas?

Baptism is the direct introduction into the life of the spirit. If you
receive the real baptism, you know you are not the body but the spirit. Give
me that baptism if you can. If not, you are not Christians. Even after the
so - called baptism which you received, you have remained the same. What is
the sense of merely saying you have been baptised in the name of the Christ?
Mere talk, talk -- ever disturbing the world with your foolishness! "Ever
steeped in the darkness of ignorance, yet considering themselves wise and
learned, the fools go round and round, staggering to and fro like the blind
led by the blind." Therefore do not say you are Christians, do not brag
about baptism and things of that sort.

We are like moths plunging into the flaming fire, knowing that it will burn
us, knowing that the senses only burn us, that they only enhance
desire. "Desire
is never satiated by enjoyment; enjoyment only increases desire as butter
fed into fire increases the fire." Desire is increased by desire. Knowing
all this, people still plunge into it all the time. Life after life they
have been going after the objects of desire, suffering extremely in
consequence, yet they cannot give up desire. Even religion, which should
rescue them from this terrible bondage of desire, they have made a means of
satisfying desire. Rarely do they ask God to free them from bondage to the
body and senses, from slavery to desires. Instead, they pray to Him for
health and prosperity, for long life: "O God, cure my headache, give me some
money or something!"

The fourth and last condition of discipleship is the discrimination of the
real from the unreal. There is only one thing that is real -- god. All the
time the mind must be drawn to Him, dedicated to Him. God exists, nothing
else exists, everything else comes and goes. Any desire for the world is
illusion, because the world is unreal. More and more the mind must become
conscious of God alone, until everything else appears as it really is --
unreal.
