Dear Rajgor bhai,

There is local dialog in Mumbai for our situation - "Abh=
i Homam shuru karake jumma-jumma Char din huen hai"

Dear, when you or i or=
 anybody else, does the homam consistently for say a year or two and at the=
 same time ciritically looking and correcting thought/feeling/reaction all =
the way, we stand some chance of having some recognizable transformation.

=
performing homam or any saadhana for few days and then becoming like 'brood=
ing hen over china egg over our shortcomings and different negative emotion=
s will not do any good to us.

aankh bandh karake chup chap Homa karate rah=
o. Homam ka anand lete raho. saal bhar ke baad hisab karenge;)

Raju, conte=
mplation is also needed. we may need to work on our attitude, observe them,=
 recognize the fault in our thinking and behavior and struggle to rectify t=
hose. let us keep homam continuous at the same time correction in our attit=
ude also continuous and then we'll take a stock of things after a year to s=
ee if there is some real progress or not.

by the way, please read followin=
g two messages which explains lot of deeper meaning of stories of Chandi pa=
ath.

 When mother completely destroys Nishumbha (Aasakti), Shumbha is furious an=
d even challenges the mother with the abuses such as Dushte, Anyasa Balamaa=
shrita. he is furious because he lost his brother which is like a soul mate=
. Inseparable. once aasakti is finished, Ahamkaar becomes weaker and then m=
other finally mounts concluding attack on the demon Shumbha to finally libe=
rate the soul.

to the point that Raktabeeja becomes bloodless and then detroyed completely=
. Hence Kaali has capacity to destroy all the vaasanaas and the beeja of va=
