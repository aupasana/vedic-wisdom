Namaste,

1. You can collect the homam ashes. The recommended method of disposal is to 
scatter them in a flowing stream of water such as a river or an ocean.

2. No need to dip in ghee. You can offer sesame seeds separately sometimes 
and ghee separately sometimes etc.

3. I replied separately.

4. Perhaps in future..

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Questions on the Homam Procedure


> Dear Sri PVR:
>
> thank you for doing this service to all of mankind.
>
> I have a few questions and some suggestions on the procedure.
>
> 1. I am curious as to how you dispose of the homam ashes everyday?
>
> 2. On the usage of puffed rice, dhanyams etc, Are these to be used
>   dipped in ghee?
>   I have read somewhere for e.g. that sesame seeds are dipped in ghee
>   for the offering.
>
> 3. Like another gentleman asked, What is the brihat or extended
>   procedure? I see that the Jayadi homam step and
>   punyahavachanam, Varuna pooja at the beginning etc are missing.
>   For completeness, would you elaborate on the missing steps?
>
> 4. A suggestion.
>   Please post references to the source of each step/mantra.
>   I feel that this would greatly solidify the document and make it
>   formal. I completely understand that this is meant as a spiritual
>   guide, and yet one doesn't preclude the other.
>
>   For example: What is the source of using the chamakam verses in
>   the Vasordhara step?
>   My suggestion is to post it exactly as one would in a scientific
>   paper, with a reference number, and the last page listing
>   the reference sources.
>   Similarly on the verses used in Uttarangam etc.
