This is easy to say for bad karma. Call it your duty! How do you know it is=
 your duty do some thing bad? We always have an option not to do it and exp=
eriance the consequence.

Let us say, some one gives you a gun and says sho=
ot him, or else I will shoot you. We have two options:
1. Shoot the person
=
2. Deny to shoot


In the outset, the first option seem to be easy. But, lo=


Look at possible outcome of your choice:
1.1 The other person may still s=
hoot you
1.2 The other person may hit you and go
1.3 The other person may h=
it you and imprision you.
1.4 The other person may continue forcing you to =
kill few more

2.1 Then other person may shoot you
2.2 Other person may hit=
 you and go
2.3 Other person may hit you and imprision you.

Are we sure, w=
e made the correct choice?

Apart from it, killnig some one to avoid your o=
wn death may not be your duty! Knowing what is your duty is far more deffic=
ult than making choices best suited for your comfort, name and convenience.=


Sorry, if I am hurting any one, but, I thought, it is important to know t=
he difference between:
1. Saying you did it because you had to do it
2. Doi=
ng it because you had to do it.

Like Narasimha pointed in another email, t=
hese days the villan in the movie says "Krishna made me kill. Who am I to k=
ill?"

Also, pretending unattachedness for a bad karma is relatively easy. =
Please don't fall into the trap.

Best regards,
Vijay
