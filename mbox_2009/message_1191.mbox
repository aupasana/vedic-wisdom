Dear learned Gurujis and friends, 

I have a little question and I was hopi=
ng someone could help me shed
some light on it. 

Should immediate (same 'k=
ula') family members observe sutak time if
the deceased had changed their r=
eligion and had stopped pratising the
sanatan dharma tradition and had also=
 instructed their sons not to
perform any pinda/shraddha rites? 

Many Than=
ks,
Somanathan
