We all hear about universal brotherhood, and how societies stand up
especia=
lly to preach this. I remember an old story. In India, taking wine is
consi=
dered very bad. There were two brothers who wished, one night, to drink
win=
e secretly; and their uncle, who was a very orthodox man was sleeping in
a =
room quite close to theirs. So, before they began to drink, they said to
ea=
ch other, "We must be very silent, or uncle will wake up."

When they were =
drinking, they continued repeating to each other "Silence!
Uncle will wake =
up", each trying to shout the other down. And, as the
shouting increased, t=
he uncle woke up, came into the room, and discovered
the whole thing. Now, =
we all shout like these drunken men," Universal
brotherhood! We are all equ=
al, therefore let us make a sect." As soon as you
make a sect you protest a=
gainst equality, and equality is no more. Mohammedans
talk of universal bro=
therhood, but what comes out of that in reality? Why,
anybody who is not a =
Mohammedan will not be admitted into the brotherhood;
he will more likely h=
ave his throat cut. Christians talk of universal
brotherhood; but anyone wh=
o is not a Christian must go to that place where
he will be eternally barbe=
cued.

So far we see that it is hard to find any universal features in rega=
rd to
religion, and yet we know that they exist. We are all human beings, b=
ut are
we all equal? Certainly not. Who says we are equal? Only the lunatic=
. Are we
all equal in our brains, in our powers, in our bodies? One man is =
stronger
than another, one man has more brain power than another. If we are=
 all
equal, why is there this inequality? Who made it? We. Because we have =
more
or less powers, more or less brain, more or less physical strength, it=
 must
make a difference between us. Yet we know that the doctrine of equali=
ty
appeals to our heart.

The unity of sameness can come only when this uni=
verse is destroyed,
otherwise such a thing is impossible.

We must learn th=
at truth may be expressed in a hundred thousand ways, and
that each of thes=
e ways is true as far as it goes.We must learn that the
same thing can be v=
iewed from a hundred different standpoints, and vet be
the same thing. Take=
 for instance the sun. Suppose a man standing on the
earth looks at the sun=
 when it rises in the morning; he sees a big ball.
Suppose he starts on a j=
ourney towards the sun and takes a camera with him,
taking photographs at e=
very stage of his journey, until he reaches the sun.
The photographs of eac=
h stage will be seen to be different from those of the
other stages; in fac=
t, when he gets back, he brings with him so many
photographs of so many dif=
ferent suns, as it would appear; and yet we know
that the same sun was phot=
ographed by the man at the different stages of his
progress.

Even so is it=
 with the Lord. Through high philosophy or low, through the
most exalted my=
thology or the grossest, through the most refined ritualism
or arrant fetis=
hism, every sect, every soul, every nation, every religion,
consciously or =
unconsciously, is struggling upward, towards God; every
vision of truth tha=
t man has, is a vision of Him and of none else. Suppose
we all go with vess=
els in our hands to fetch water from a lake. One has a
cup, another a jar, =
another a bucket, and so forth, and we all fill our
vessels. The water in e=
ach case naturally takes the form of the vessel
carried by each of us. He w=
ho brought the cup has the water in the form of a
cup; he who brought the j=
ar =97 his water is in the shape of a jar, and so
forth; but, in every case=
, water, and nothing but water, is in the vessel. So
it is in the case of r=
eligion; our minds are like these vessels, and each
one of us is trying to =
arrive at the realisation of God. God is like that
water filling these diff=
erent vessels, and in each vessel the vision of God
comes in the form of th=
e vessel. Yet He is One. He is God in every case.
This is the only recognit=
ion of universality that we can get.

I have also my little plan. I do not =
know whether it will work or not, and I
want to present it to you for discu=
ssion. What is my plan? In the first
place I would ask mankind to recognise=
 this maxim, "Do not destroy".
Iconoclastic
reformers do no good to the wor=
ld. Break not, pull not anything down, but
build. Help, if you can; if you =
cannot, fold your hands and stand by and see
things go on. Do not injure, i=
f you cannot render help. Say not a word
against any man's convictions so f=
ar as they are sincere. Secondly, take man
where he stands, and from there =
give him a lift.

Each of us is naturally growing and developing according =
to his own nature;
each will in time come to know the highest truth for aft=
er all, men must
teach themselves.

What can you and I do? Do you think you=
 can teach even a child? You cannot.
The child teaches himself. Your duty i=
s to afford opportunities and to
remove obstacles. A plant grows. Do you ma=
ke the plant grow? Your duty is to
put a hedge round it and see that no ani=
mal eats up the plant, and there
your duty ends. The plant grows of itself.=
 So it is in regard to the
spiritual growth of every man. None can teach yo=
u; none can make a spiritual
man of you. You have to teach yourself; your g=
rowth must come from inside.

What can an external teacher do? He can remov=
e the obstructions a little,
and there his duty ends. Therefore help, if yo=
u can; but do not destroy.
Give up all ideas that you can make men spiritua=
l. It is impossible. There
is no other teacher to you than your own soul. R=
ecognise this. What comes of
it? In society we see so many different nature=
s. There are thousands and
thousands of varieties of minds and inclinations=
. A thorough generalisation
of them is impossible, but for our practical pu=
rpose it is sufficient to
have them characterised into four classes.

To be=
come harmoniously balanced in all these four directions is my ideal of
reli=
gion. And this religion is attained by what we, in India, call Yoga =97
uni=
on. To the worker, it is union between men and the whole of humanity; to
th=
e mystic, between his lower and Higher Self; to the lover, union between
hi=
mself and the God of Love; and to the philosopher; it is the union of all
e=
xistence. This is what is meant by Yoga. This is a Sanskrit term, and these=

four divisions of Yoga have in Sanskrit different names. The man who seeks=

after this kind of union is called a Yogi. The worker is called the
Karma-=
Yogi. He who seeks the union through love is called the Bhakti-Yogi.
He who=
 seeks it through mysticism is called the R=E2ja-Yogi. And he who seeks
it =
through philosophy is called the Jn=E2na-Yogi So this word Yogi comprises
t=
hem all.

The first test of true teaching must be, that the teaching should=
 not
contradict reason. And you may see that such is the basis of all these=

Yogas. We take the Raja-Yoga, the psychological Yoga, the psychological wa=
y
to union. It is a vast subject, and I can only point out to you now the
c=
entral idea of this Yoga. We have but one method of acquiring knowledge.
Fr=
om the lowest man to the highest Yogi, all have to use the same method;
and=
 that method is what is called concentration.

Now take Karma-Yoga, the att=
ainment of God through work. It is evident that
in society there are many p=
ersons who seem to be born for some sort of
activity or other, whose minds =
cannot be concentrated on the plane of
thought alone, and who have but one =
idea, concretised in work, visible and
tangible. There must be a science fo=
r this kind of life too.

Karma-Yoga teaches us how to work for work's sake=
, unattached, without
caring who is helped, and what for.

There is then th=
e Bhakti-Yoga for the man of emotional nature, the lover. He
wants to love =
God, he relies upon and uses all sorts of rituals, flowers,
incense, beauti=
ful buildings, forms and all such things. Do you mean to say
they are wrong=
? One fact I must tell you. It is good for you to remember, in
this country=
 especially, that the world's great spiritual giants have all
been produced=
 only by those religious sects which have been in possession of
very rich m=
ythology and ritual. All sects that have attempted to worship God
without a=
ny form or ceremony have crushed without mercy everything that is
beautiful=
 and sublime in religion.

We lastly come to the Jnana-Yogi, the philosophe=
r, the thinker, he who wants
to go beyond the visible. He is the man who is=
 not satisfied with the little
things of this world. His idea is to go beyo=
nd the daily routine of eating,
drinking, and so on; not even the teaching =
of thousands of books will
satisfy him. Not even all the sciences will sati=
sfy him; at the best, they
only bring this little world before him.

Upon t=
he same tree there are two birds, one on the top, the other below. The
one =
on the top is calm, silent, and majestic, immersed in his own glory; the
on=
e on the lower branches, eating sweet and bitter fruits by turns, hopping
f=
rom branch to branch, is becoming happy and miserable by turns. After a
tim=
e the lower bird eats an exceptionally bitter fruit and gets disgustful
and=
 looks up and sees the other bird, that wondrous one of golden plumage,
who=
 eats neither sweet nor bitter fruit, who is neither happy nor miserable,
b=
ut calm, Self-centred, and sees nothing beyond his Self.

The lower bird lo=
ngs for this condition but soon forgets it, and again
begins to eat the fru=
its. In a little while, he eats another exceptionally
bitter fruit, which m=
akes him feel miserable, and he again looks up, and
tries to get nearer to =
the upper bird. Once more he forgets and after a time
he looks up, and so o=
n he goes again and again, until he comes very near to
the beautiful bird a=
nd sees the reflection of light from his plumage playing
around his own bod=
y, and he feels a change and seems to melt away; still
nearer he comes, and=
 everything about him melts away, and at last he
understands this wonderful=
 change.


The lower bird was, as it were, only the substantial-looking sha=
dow, the
reflection of the higher; he himself was in essence the upper bird=
 all the
time. This eating of fruits, sweet and bitter, this lower, little =
bird,
weeping and happy by turns, was a vain chimera, a dream: all along, t=
he real
bird was there above, calm and silent, glorious and majestic, beyon=
d grief,
beyond sorrow. The upper bird is God, the Lord of this universe; a=
nd the
lower bird is the human soul, eating the sweet and bitter fruits of =
this
world. Now and then comes a heavy blow to the soul. For a time, he sto=
ps the
eating and goes towards the unknown God, and a flood of light comes.=
 He
thinks that this world is a vain show. Yet again the senses drag hint d=
own,
and he begins as before to eat the sweet and bitter fruits of the worl=
d.
Again an exceptionally hard blow comes.

His heart becomes open again to=
 divine light; thus gradually he approaches
God, and as he gets nearer and =
nearer, he finds his old self melting away.
When he has come near enough, h=
e sees that he is no other than God, and he
exclaims, "He whom I have descr=
ibed to you as the Life of this universe, as
present in the atom, and in su=
ns and moons =97 He is the basis of our own
life, the Soul of our soul. Nay=
, thou art That." This is what this
Jnana-Yoga teaches. It tells man that h=
e is essentially divine. It shows to
mankind the real unity of being, and t=
hat each one of us is the Lord God
Himself, manifested on earth. All of us,=
 from the lowest worm that crawls
under our feet to the highest beings to w=
hom we look up with wonder and awe
=97 all are manifestations of the same L=
ord.

Lastly, it is imperative that all these various Yogas should be carri=
ed out
in, practice; mere theories about them will not do any good. First w=
e have
to hear about them, then we have to think about them. We have to rea=
son the
thoughts out, impress them on our minds, and we have to meditate on=
 them,
realise them, until at last they become our whole life.

No longer w=
ill religion remain a bundle of ideas or theories, nor an
intellectual asse=
nt; it will enter into our very self. By means of
intellectual assent we ma=
y today subscribe to many foolish things, and
change our minds altogether t=
omorrow. But true religion never changes.
Religion is realisation; not talk=
, nor doctrine, nor theories, however
beautiful they may be. It is being an=
d becoming, not hearing or
acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming cha=
nged into what it believes.
That is religion.

alm and silent, glorious and majestic, beyond grief, beyond sorrow.=A0<span=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">The upper bird is God, the Lord of this univers=
e; and the lower bird is the human soul, eating the sweet and bitter fruits=
 of this world.</span>=A0Now and then comes a heavy blow to the soul.=A0<sp=
an style=3D"font-weight:bold">For a time, he stops the eating and goes towa=
rds the unknown God, and a flood of light comes. He thinks that this world =
is a vain show. Yet again the senses drag hint down, and he begins as befor=
e to eat the sweet and bitter fruits of the world. Again an exceptionally h=
ard blow comes.</span>=A0<br>


<br>His heart becomes open again to divine =
light; thus gradually he approaches God, and as he gets nearer and nearer, =
he finds his old self melting away. When he has come near enough, he sees t=
hat he is no other than God, and he exclaims, "He whom I have describe=
d to you as the Life of this universe, as present in the atom, and in suns =
and moons =97 He is the basis of our own life, the Soul of our soul. Nay, t=
hou art That."=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">This is what this Jn=
ana-Yoga teaches. It tells man that he is essentially divine. It shows to m=
ankind the real unity of being, and that each one of us is the Lord God Him=
self, manifested on earth. All of us, from the lowest worm that crawls unde=
r our feet to the highest beings to whom we look up with wonder and awe =97=
 all are manifestations of the same Lord.</span><br>


<br>Lastly, it is im=
perative that all these various Yogas should be carried out in, practice; m=
ere theories about them will not do any good. First we have to hear about t=
hem, then we have to think about them. We have to reason the thoughts out, =
impress them on our minds, and we have to meditate on them, realise them, u=
ntil at last they become our whole life.=A0<br>


<br>No longer will religi=
on remain a bundle of ideas or theories, nor an intellectual assent; it wil=
l enter into our very self. By means of intellectual assent we may today su=
bscribe to many foolish things, and change our minds altogether tomorrow. B=
ut true religion never changes. Religion is realisation; not talk, nor doct=
rine, nor theories, however beautiful they may be. It is being and becoming=
, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into =
what it believes. That is religion.<br>
