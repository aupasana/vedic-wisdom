 Once, while going to Kamarpukur, I was overtaken by a storm. I was in the
middle of a big meadow. The place was haunted by robbers. I began to repeat
the names of all the deities: Rama,Krishna and Bhagavati. I also repeated
the name of Hanuman. I chanted the names of them all.

What does that mean? Let me tell you. While the servant is counting out the
money to purchase supplies, he says, "These pennies for potatoes,these for
egg plants, these for fish." He counts the money separately, but after the
list is completed, he puts the coins together.

Is there anything impossible for faith? And a true devotee has faith in
everything: the formless Reality, God with form, Rama, Krishna and the
Divine Mother.
