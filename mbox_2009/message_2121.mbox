Namaste,

i think we have to discover our own techniques to ensure that the=
 pieces burn completely. i continue to place the white side up.  the shape =
of the cocunut being curved this nicely accomodates the kapoor by the side.=
 As a result the dark side burns first from the bottom up and in no time en=
gulfs the whole piece. A smaller piece to rest the bigger piece ensures tha=
t air circulates at the bottom. generally the middle part, the "core" remai=
ns unburnt. but when the side is inverted...made upside down, it ensures th=
at the middle part also  gets burnt.

best wishes

 here. It has been observed that if you place coconut pieces where white po=
rtion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then there are all the chances =
that pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal experience. so i can s=
uggest few things as under:

 2)Almost every time some pieces are left  unburnt, so i do not remove the =
remains from the kund and next time use it as it is and add fresh pieces of=
 coconut.Is it fine??
