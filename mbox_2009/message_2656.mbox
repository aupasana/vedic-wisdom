As far as my abilities i can find the english transliteration and meaning o=
f "LakshmiNarasimha Karavalamba stotra" on the net which I am posting here.=
But as respected members may acknowledge that for proper pronounciation and=
 recitation the original Sanskrit dialect is of utter importance.Hoping any=
one could lend a helping hand to the matter.

Introduction*
"Adi Sankara had once given his consent to a cruel Kapali=
ka to take his head and offer it as a sacrifice to Goddess Kali in order to=
 win favours from her. Kapalikas were followers of a particular Saiva sect =
(the left-hand order) who always carried human skulls, wore them as garland=
s around their necks and even ate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lor=
d Siva himself is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapo=
re in Chennai is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.
This Kapa=
lika had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he viewed as a p=
otential threat to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a nearby cave=
, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself=
 to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.
However, whe=
n the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his head Sa=
nkara's disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned this murder=
ous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an 'avesa' (po=
ssessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, became the man-li=
on Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra siddhi and, b=
ecoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous Kapalika and t=
ore him to pieces.
Sankara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishna Math in Che=
nnai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering away the cloud=
s with a slash of his mane, and literally flew into the cave, stunning all =
beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha incarnation once again wh=
en the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lord with his leonine c=
laws.
Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of a lion, awoke from his t=
rance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada's body was smeared with the b=
lood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed with divine splendour like =
a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the awesome Lord Narasimha him=
self and pacified him with soothing and overflowing devotion.
On another oc=
casion, Adi Sankara's hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but he was cure=
d by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famous hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi=
 Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa =
Stotram'). These hymns are so titled because each of these verses ends with=
 the same refrain 'Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam' (O Lord Naras=
imha, please lend me your helping hand).
It is believed that fervent recita=
tion of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two stotras Adi Sankara c=
omposed on Him) will always help one smoothly get over difficulties with th=
e Lord's helping hand.
Salagrama, the sacred stone found only in the Kandak=
i river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in their homes, is used in=
 the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to be specially sacre=
d to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given to Adi Sankara by Lo=
rd Narasimha himself.
