Namaste Utpal ji
=C2=A0
Yes you are so correct. I consider Shivaji Maharaj =
to be one of the best things that happened to Hinduism when it was needed m=
ost. A blessing from Ma Durga Herself.
=C2=A0
Infact recently I had been re=
ading on some history of India and I realized that had it not been for Shiv=
aji Maharaj inspired by his Guru Swami Ramdas, places like Kasi, Prayag and=
 Mathura would have become Mecca and Medina.
=C2=A0
And you are also correc=
t that we must all do out part to see that this glorious tradition of Sanat=
an Dharma is never diminished. But the question is, what is it that one can=
 do at an individual level? How does one know what is the best course of ac=
tion? 
=C2=A0
I keep pondering over these things and I get confused and fru=
stated. Infact since the time I started doing homa regularly, these questio=
ns keep goign around in my mind endlessly.
=C2=A0
It was nice reading your =
mail.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


=C2=A0

The upsurge (of consciousnes=
s) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste !

>Hinduism is a word coine=
d by outsiders. To Hindus, the correct term 
>is "sanatana dharma", i.e. pe=
rennial spirit of righteousness

Intrestingly, last week i was in Oman and =
i had a same discussion 
with one of the client's representative. He was Aa=
rab national and 
wanted to know something about Hindu religeon. First thin=
g i told him 
that 'Hindu' is a foreign word and none of our scripture uses=
 this 
word.

***

This is my long time belief that Sanaatan Dharma will ne=
ver perish. 
my logic is simple. in the recorded history, People from Sanaa=
tan 
Dharma has never attacked the other religion. The glorious example 
(w=
hich i am very proud of quoting) is Paarasi Community. They came to 
India =
for saving their community and religeon and our people niether 
rejected th=
em nor influenced them to convert in to our religeon. they 
flourished in o=
ur country in trade.

***

When Sanaatan Dharma was in great danger, Lord s=
ent Shivaaji to 
control it. earlier Addi Shankara camedown for it. Now it =
is our 
responsibility to see to it that we live its value in our life. and=
 
we need not forget the famous assurance "Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!"

but is =
everybody's duty to do their bit so that this glorious 
Tradition of Sanaat=
an Dharam never gets diminished.

best Regards,

Utpal
