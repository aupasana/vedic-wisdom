 Akhilandamma was born in 1871 in a small village called Desur, located
abo=
ut fifty kilometres northeast of Tiruvannamalai. Following a tradition
that=
 was still prevalent at the time, she was =E2=80=98married=E2=80=99 at the =
age of five.
Such child brides usually lived with their parents till they r=
eached
puberty, at which point they would move to their husband=E2=80=99s h=
ome. However,
since Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s husband died when she was only s=
even years old, she
spent all her childhood and youth at her parents=E2=80=
=99 home. Under the social
conditions that prevailed at the time, it was no=
t possible for her to
remarry, so when she grew up she decided to devote he=
r life to serving
sadhus. Though she was primarily attracted to Ramana Maha=
rshi, she also
served Seshadri Swami and Vitthoba, an eccentric saint who l=
ived in Polur,
about thirty kilometres north of Tiruvannamalai.

She first =
saw Bhagavan in 1896 while he was residing in the Arunachaleswara
temple. O=
n that occasion she saw the temple priest collecting the abhishekam
milk fr=
om the Amman shrine and giving it to Bhagavan. This darshan did not
make a =
great impression on her. It was not until 1903, when she visited Sri
Bhagav=
an on the hill, that she first felt his power. From 1903 onwards she
was a =
regular visitor. She invariably came for Bhagavan=E2=80=99s birthday
celebr=
ation, for the Deepam festival and for Jnanasambandhar Guru puja. She
frequ=
ently came at other times during the year. On each visit she would
bring fo=
od for Bhagavan and his devotees.

When she stayed in her native village wi=
th her mother, many of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
devotees used to come and stay at=
 her house. With the object of serving such
devotees, Akhilandamma and Mast=
han Swami (whom she introduced to Bhagavan)
established a math or centre th=
ere in 1914. Called Sri Ramanananda
Mathalayam, it was the first =E2=80=98R=
amana Centre=E2=80=99 to be established outside
Tiruvannamalai. Many of Bha=
gavan=E2=80=99s early devotees such as Kunju Swami,
Ramaswami Pillai, Madha=
va Swami and Ramanatha Brahmachari were taken there
to recuperate from vari=
ous illnesses they had contracted in Tiruvannamalai.

Kunju Swami, one of h=
er cured patients, made this comment in the
introduction to her biography: =
=E2=80=98I know that for the last forty years this
lady has been engaging h=
erself in serving food to Bhagavan Sri Ramana
Maharshi and Mahan Seshadri S=
wami. Even from the days when Bhagavan was
living at Skandashram, whenever =
any devotees there fell ill, it was her
custom to take them to the math in =
her village and look after them. She
would only send them back after curing=
 their illness.=E2=80=99

There are two principal sources for information o=
n Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s life: a
Tamil biography written by Sadhu Om in 196=
0, and a Telugu account by
Nageswara Rao. Nageswara Rao, who interviewed Ak=
hilandamma himself,
incorporated many of Sadhu Om=E2=80=99s stories in his =
own account, but also added
incidents that Sadhu Om did not cover. The foll=
owing story, from Nageswara
Rao=E2=80=99s account, was published in the Aru=
nachala Ramana magazine in 1982. It
does not appear either in Sadhu Om=E2=
=80=99s account or in the =E2=80=98Power of the
Presence=E2=80=99 chapter o=
n Akhilandamma:

Whenever Ganapati Muni saw me coming, he would exclaim wit=
h delight, =E2=80=98Oh!
Akhlkandamma has come!=E2=80=99

Emboldened by this=
, his favourable disposition towards me, one day I asked
Ganapati Muni in a=
 plaintive tone, =E2=80=98I am utterly unlettered while you, I am
told, are=
 a Master of all the Vedas and the Upanishads. What is the way for
me?=E2=
=80=99

The great scholar explained to me, with great respect and sweetness=
,
=E2=80=98Akhilandamma, you are really blessed. You are feeding Bhagavan R=
amana who
is the very avatar of Kumara Swami. This is a sure sign of the Lo=
rd=E2=80=99s
grace. Bear
it in your mind and take heart. No austerities can=
 give fruit by themselves.
Remember this always: it is Iswara who is the di=
spenser of the fruit [of
karma]. Sent by that Iswara himself, Sri Ramana ha=
s come down to earth. So
what can please Iswara more than devoted service t=
o Sri Ramana? When you
recognise this secret, your fruit will increase all =
the more.=E2=80=99

I have already acquainted you with the fact that my fam=
ily was very poor. We
were always beset with economic difficulties. In addi=
tion to this, there
arose, at one time, differences in the family. Unable t=
o bear that
affliction, I came before Bhagavan, cried, and broke down I tea=
rs.

Bhagavan, after remaining silent for some time, opened his mouth and k=
indly
said, =E2=80=98Tesuramma [=E2=80=9CMother from Desur=E2=80=9D, her vi=
llage], you are under the
impression that difficulties have come to you alo=
ne. This life is a blend of
pain and pleasure. One should have no elation w=
hen there is pleasure, and no
dejection when there is pain. Take my example=
. I came here at the age of
seventeen. I had no mother or father here. I ha=
ve spent my time in caves and
under trees in sun, in showers, and in the co=
ld. I begged alms to pacify my
hunger. It is only nowadays that all of you =
have come here to minister to my
needs.=E2=80=99

Still shedding tears, I s=
aid to Bhagavan in a begging tone of voice, =E2=80=98You,
Bhagavan, are an =
incarnation, so you can bear all that. But what about a
woman like me? I ha=
ve no one but you to help me. You alone have to have
compassion on me.=E2=
=80=99

These plaintive words moved Bhagavan, and his eyes became moist. Af=
ter
remaining grave and serious for a while, slowly and steadily these supr=
eme
words emerged from his mouth: =E2=80=98Hereafter, remember me whenever =
you face
calamities.=E2=80=99

With these mighty words of grace ringing in =
my heart, I came out of the
cave, followed by Ganapati Muni.

=E2=80=98Akhi=
landamma!=E2=80=99 he cried with great elation. =E2=80=98Your virtue has ri=
pened.
Bhagavan has bestowed a rare boon on you. Never before have I seen B=
hagavan
bestowing a boon like this. And this boon is for future lives also.=
 This day
is one of extreme rejoicing for me, for the mighty power of confe=
rring
boons, till now hidden in Bhagavan, has now broken out for your sake.=
 The
hidden powers of a great and genuine Guru do not easily come out to wo=
rk in
the external world; they do so only for the sake of worthy disciples.=
 The
credit of drawing them out, pure lady, goes to you now.=E2=80=99

It w=
as really a boon to me as my subsequent experience proved. When
difficultie=
s surrounded me like threatening clouds, when life itself became
a dungeon,=
 I would utter =E2=80=98Lord Ramana, my Lord Ramana=E2=80=99, and call on h=
is
protection and help. Then, in a trice, the difficulties would disappear.=

However severe the calamity, because of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s protection, my =
mind would
not get agitated.

Desuramma alias Akhilandamma, who was serving=
 food for Bhagavan Ramana, was
in due course, desiring to take up 'sannyasa=
' by wearing ochre robes. She
wanted to have inititation by Bhagavan Ramana=
, by one of the three methods
mentioned in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai,th=
at is either by 'look', 'touch'
or through His thought. She narrated her in=
tention to Chinnaswami, who said
that it would be difficult to
persuade Bha=
gavan Ramana in the matter, since He did not initiate anyone and
further, e=
ven if He took an exception, many others like Echammal and
Kamakshi Ammal w=
ould also desire to have initiations by Him.

Akhilandamma kept quiet for a=
 few months but she was eager to embrace
sannyasa with initiation by Bhagav=
an Ramana. One day she had a dream where
Bhagavan Ramana gave her vibhuti. =
She took this dream as a good omen, and
then made the white sari into an oc=
hre sari by dipping it in the red dye,
dried up the sari and kept it in a v=
essel, closed it with a leaf and went to
the Asramam next morning. She was =
scared as to how to go about further. She
merely kept the vessel in the pre=
sence of Bhagavan Ramana and was waiting
with bated breath. Bhagavan Ramana=
 knew everything even without words. He
came to the Hall, opened the vessel=
 and looked at the robes, as if there was
some food, and then looked at Akh=
ilandamma.No one knew the implication. The
eyes that burnt Tripura and also=
 the karmas of devotees, the eyes of
Siva-Ramana gave her inititation. Akhi=
landamma rushed back to her home and
came back to the Hall in the new attir=
e!

Elsewhere in in Nageswara Rao=E2=80=99s account Akhilandamma recounts s=
ome of the
incidents from Bhagavan=E2=80=99s early days on the hill when he=
 was harassed by
jealous sadhus. These have been well documented in other b=
ooks, but
Akhilandamma adds a few details that I have not seen elsewhere. B=
efore I
give her version of events, I should mention that many of these sto=
ries
appeared in the first edition of Self Realization that came out around=
 1930.
Bhagavan had not been shown the book prior to publication. When he s=
aw all
the stories about the hostile sadhus, he asked that they be removed =
from the
next edition. He was not questioning the validity of the stories, =
he was, in
characteristic fashion, trying to avoid causing offence to the p=
eople who
had given him so much trouble. He apparently said that many of th=
ese sadhus
were still alive and might be upset if they found their stories =
in print.
Towards the end of his life Bhagavan said that the accounts could=
 be
republished because the sadhus had all passed away, and were therefore
=
beyond taking offence. However, they were not included again until a few
ye=
ars ago when Sri Ramanasramam made a reprint of the first edition of Self
R=
ealization that included all the original incidents.

Here are Akhilandamma=
=E2=80=99s sadhu stories:

I found that Arunachala is the abode of sadhus, =
and that among these there
are both good and evil ones. In truth, the evil =
far outnumber the good. Even
Bhagavan Ramana had been severely molested by =
these devils of sadhus. Sri
Ramana himself treated us time and again to tho=
se incidents, which he
narrated to us as interesting anecdotes. Now I shall=
 recall one or two of
them which still linger in my memory.

Bhagavan would=
 be surrounded by devotees and these would offer fruits to him
=E2=80=93 a =
glorious sight. But this became an eyesore to a sadhu from Kerala, who
out =
of sheer envy, rolled down a big boulder against Bhagavan and
Palaniswami, =
who were seated at a lower lever on the hill.

Palaniswami began to cry.

=
=E2=80=98What=E2=80=99s the matter, Palani? What has happened?=E2=80=99 enq=
uired Bhagavan.

Then Bhagavan discovered that the attack had badly cut one=
 of his toes, and
that it was bleeding.

=E2=80=98Oh,=E2=80=99 said Bhagava=
n, =E2=80=98is it for this that you are crying?=E2=80=99

Bhagavan then too=
k the flesh that was hanging from his toe, restored it to
its original plac=
e, and stroked it a couple of times. How strange! By the
next day it had be=
come whole, without even leaving a scar.

At one time there was another sad=
hu living in the same cave as Bhagavan. He
would tell all the devotees who =
came to see Bhagavan that he himself was
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Guru, and he wo=
uld gather into his own bag all the fruits and
coins that had been offered =
to Bhagavan. This was too much for Palaniswami,
who rebelled against the ch=
eating sadhu.

The sadhu himself brought pressure on Bhagavan to drive out =
Palani, but
Bhagavan paid no attention to his demands. The devil-sadhu, hav=
ing been
rebuffed by both Palaniswami and Bhagavan, became enraged and spat=
 squarely
on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s face. Even that did not affect Bhagavan=E2=
=80=99s silence or
demeanour.

Later on a third sadhu appeared on the scene=
. He was foolish enough to offer
to pass on his spiritual energy to Bhagava=
n. Bhagavan declined the sadhu=E2=80=99s
offer, but despite this the sadhu =
put his hand on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head to effect
the transmission. The res=
ult? The foolish sadhu passed out and became
unconsciousness.

Last in this=
 list of stories is that of a sadhu from North India.Approaching
Bhagavan, =
he said, =E2=80=98I have come at the command of God himself to initiate
you=
 with the mantra of Lord Dattatreya, so you must take it.=E2=80=99

Bhagava=
n, ever-resourceful, responded by saying, =E2=80=98Good! Let the same Lord
=
God appear to me and direct me to take the mantra. Then I shall surely do
i=
t.=E2=80=99

e Echammal and Kamakshi Ammal would also desire to have initiations by Him.=
=C2=A0<br><br>Akhilandamma kept quiet for a few months but she was eager to=
 embrace sannyasa with initiation by Bhagavan Ramana. One day she had a dre=
am where Bhagavan Ramana gave her vibhuti. She took this dream as a good om=
en, and then made the white sari into an ochre sari by dipping it in the re=
d dye, dried up the sari and kept it in a vessel, closed it with a leaf and=
 went to the Asramam next morning. She was scared as to how to go about fur=
ther. She merely kept the vessel in the presence of Bhagavan Ramana and was=
 waiting with bated breath. Bhagavan Ramana knew everything even without wo=
rds. He came to the Hall, opened the vessel and looked at the robes, as if =
there was some food, and then looked at Akhilandamma.No one knew the implic=
ation. The eyes that burnt Tripura and also the karmas of devotees, the eye=
s of Siva-Ramana gave her inititation. Akhilandamma rushed back to her home=
 and came back to the Hall in the new attire!<br>

<br>Elsewhere in in Nage=
swara Rao=E2=80=99s account Akhilandamma recounts some of the incidents fro=
m Bhagavan=E2=80=99s early days on the hill when he was harassed by jealous=
 sadhus. These have been well documented in other books, but Akhilandamma a=
dds a few details that I have not seen elsewhere. Before I give her version=
 of events, I should mention that many of these stories appeared in the fir=
st edition of Self Realization that came out around 1930. Bhagavan had not =
been shown the book prior to publication. When he saw all the stories about=
 the hostile sadhus, he asked that they be removed from the next edition. H=
e was not questioning the validity of the stories, he was, in characteristi=
c fashion, trying to avoid causing offence to the people who had given him =
so much trouble. He apparently said that many of these sadhus were still al=
ive and might be upset if they found their stories in print. Towards the en=
d of his life Bhagavan said that the accounts could be republished because =
the sadhus had all passed away, and were therefore beyond taking offence. H=
owever, they were not included again until a few years ago when Sri Ramanas=
ramam made a reprint of the first edition of Self Realization that included=
 all the original incidents.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Here=
 are Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s sadhu stories:</span><br><br>I found that Aruna=
chala is the abode of sadhus, and that among these there are both good and =
evil ones. In truth, the evil far outnumber the good. Even Bhagavan Ramana =
had been severely molested by these devils of sadhus. Sri Ramana himself tr=
eated us time and again to those incidents, which he narrated to us as inte=
resting anecdotes. Now I shall recall one or two of them which still linger=
 in my memory.=C2=A0<br>

<br>Bhagavan would be surrounded by devotees and =
these would offer fruits to him =E2=80=93 a glorious sight. But this became=
 an eyesore to a sadhu from Kerala, who out of sheer envy, rolled down a bi=
g boulder against Bhagavan and Palaniswami, who were seated at a lower leve=
r on the hill.=C2=A0<br>

<br>Palaniswami began to cry.<br><br>=E2=80=98Wha=
t=E2=80=99s the matter, Palani? What has happened?=E2=80=99 enquired Bhagav=
an.<br><br>Then Bhagavan discovered that the attack had badly cut one of hi=
s toes, and that it was bleeding.=C2=A0<br><br>=E2=80=98Oh,=E2=80=99 said B=
hagavan, =E2=80=98is it for this that you are crying?=E2=80=99=C2=A0<br>

<=
br>Bhagavan then took the flesh that was hanging from his toe, restored it =
to its original place, and stroked it a couple of times. How strange! By th=
e next day it had become whole, without even leaving a scar.=C2=A0<br><br>
=
At one time there was another sadhu living in the same cave as Bhagavan. He=
 would tell all the devotees who came to see Bhagavan that he himself was B=
hagavan=E2=80=99s Guru, and he would gather into his own bag all the fruits=
 and coins that had been offered to Bhagavan. This was too much for Palanis=
wami, who rebelled against the cheating sadhu.=C2=A0<br>

<br>The sadhu him=
self brought pressure on Bhagavan to drive out Palani, but Bhagavan paid no=
 attention to his demands. The devil-sadhu, having been rebuffed by both Pa=
laniswami and Bhagavan, became enraged and spat squarely on Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s face. Even that did not affect Bhagavan=E2=80=99s silence or demeanour=
.=C2=A0<br>

<br>Later on a third sadhu appeared on the scene. He was fooli=
sh enough to offer to pass on his spiritual energy to Bhagavan. Bhagavan de=
clined the sadhu=E2=80=99s offer, but despite this the sadhu put his hand o=
n Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head to effect the transmission. The result? The fooli=
sh sadhu passed out and became unconsciousness.=C2=A0<br>

<br>Last in this=
 list of stories is that of a sadhu from North India.<span style=3D"font-we=
ight:bold">Approaching Bhagavan, he said, =E2=80=98I have come at the comma=
nd of God himself to initiate you with the mantra of Lord Dattatreya, so yo=
u must take it.=E2=80=99<br>

<br>Bhagavan, ever-resourceful, responded by =
saying, =E2=80=98Good! Let the same Lord God appear to me and direct me to =
take the mantra. Then I shall surely do it.=E2=80=99</span><br><br><span st=
