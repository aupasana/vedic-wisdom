  Namaste,

  Veda mant=
ras are in a different league compared to other mantras. As I said 
  earli=
er, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of mind on any 
  combi=
nation of sounds. When one's mind repeats the same combination of 
  sounds=
 over and over again, eventually one's mind may lose all other 
  thoughts =
and become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN one's mind 
  exper=
iences the energy represented by that combination of sounds.

  Different c=
ombinations of sounds have different energies. But experiencing 
  the ener=
gy of any combination of sounds is a better experience for the mind 
  than=
 the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of thoughts.

  Th=
e energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a different 
  =
league. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in=
 
  today's times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, veda 
=
  mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras and do n=
ot 
  really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, on=
e 
  experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the original =
veda 
  mantra.

  The expression "Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah" is not part o=
f the actual savitru 
  gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with =
"tat savitur" and ends 
  with "prachodayaat".

  I never recorded an audio=
 clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only hummed the ups 
  and downs to show th=
e intonation. I was instructed to never chant Savitru 
  Gayatri mantra lou=
d. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my food and I get 
  whatever littl=
e energy I have from it. In order to continue doing my dharma 
  in the wor=
ld, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything 
  else =
with the world.

  Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insuf=
ficient to give 
  perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better=
 job than astrology 
  as we understand it.

  I have seen my guru make som=
e interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I 
  once mentioned to Manis=
h a friend who visits me often and meditates when I 
  do homam. Manish sai=
d, "he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. 
  If at all he do=
es, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach 
  him Vishnu=
 sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like 
  Vishnu =
sahasra naama stotram." I had not mentioned much about that person to 
  Ma=
nish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is =

  indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a person wh=
o 
  loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and interested=
 in 
  doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, "if he wants, he can do 
=
  Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he needs to =
do. 
  He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one w=
hole 
  year. It will transform his life." I had not mentioned anything abo=
ut that 
  person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he =
was a sishya 
  of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samar=
tha Ramadas 
  (considered to be born with Lord Hanuman's amsa). He said to=
 me later that 
  his guru had also advised him in the past to just stick t=
o Hanuman chalisa! 
  Interestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish's m=
ind.

  Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and=
 says 
  whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance =
to 
  someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get corre=
ct 
  guidance and he is just a nimitta.

  I believe that a sadguru with v=
ery limited individual ego and in tune with 
  Nature will be able to give =
far better guidance in spiritual sadhana than 
  astrology as we know it to=
day.

  For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.

  Best r=
egards,
  Narasimha
