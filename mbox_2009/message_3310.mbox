 I know no such period ( or purgatory or sadhana). I never performed any
pr=
anayama or japa.I knew no mantras.I have never done any sadhana.I did not
e=
ven know what sadhana was.I have no idea of mediation or comtemplation.Only=

long afterwards I came to know what sadhana was and how many different kin=
ds
of it there were.It is only if there was any object or anything differen=
t
from me that I could think of it.Only if there was a goal to attain,I sho=
uld
have made sadhana to attain that goal.

There was nothing which I wante=
d to obtain.Even when i came to hear of such
things later I was never attra=
cted to them.Even now my mind refuses to pay
attention to them.

Sadhana Im=
plies an object to be gained and the means of gaining it.What is
there to b=
e gained which we donot already possess? In
meditation,concentration and co=
ntemplation,what we have to do is only not to
think of anything but to be s=
till.

This natural state is given many names - moksha,jnana,atma etc.. and=
 these
give rise to many controversies.
