Namaste friends,
 
Manish made a film called "Krishna: History or Myth". He worked on it for the last 18 months. I was assisting him with the shooting when we were traveling in India last summer. After all the post-production work, the 35-minute documentary movie is finally ready. Manish was recently in India showing the movie to some media people and giving a few interviews.
 
Please see the link below for Manish's interview in dnaindia.com:

Best regards,
Narasimha
