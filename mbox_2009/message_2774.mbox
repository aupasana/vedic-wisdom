Sri Narasimhaji,


Please answer this question for me if you have time. In =
the phrase "Tat Savitur Varenyam", how is Varenyam pronounced? Actually, I =
just wanted to know if at the end of "Varenyam" the "m" is actually a littl=
e vibrated just as we do for "Om" and many bijas that end with "m" like hri=
m, klim etc..


Best Regards,
SB
