 A householder should take care of his children, but at the same time he
should think of them as Baby Krishna, or as children of God. Serve your
father as God, and your mother as Divine Mother. After realizing God, if a
man lives with his wife, he has no physical relation with her. Both live
like Bhaktas or true devotees.

They talk of spiritual subjects and spend their time in thinking of God and
in caring for His Bhaktas. They serve God who dwells in all beings.
Householder: But, Revered Sir, we do not find any such husbands and wives.

Ramakrishna: Yes, there are some, but they are very rare. Worldly people do
not easily recognize them. But in order to live like this both must he
spiritual. If both enjoy Divine Love, then such a life is possible;
otherwise there will be no harmony, but discord and trouble between husband
and wife.

Perhaps the wife will complain, saying: "Why did I marry this man! What
pleasure does he give me? He simply sits quietly and thinks of God. He is
losing his mind." A devotee: These are some of the obstacles; but there may
be others. The children may be disobedient or may be diseased.

Then, Revered Sir, what is to be done? Ramakrishna: It is very difficult for
a householder to practise devotion. There are many obstacles. You all know
them very well,--disease, sorrow, poverty, disharmony with the wife,
disobedience and evil tendencies in the children; but there is a way out of
it. One should occasionally live in solitude and pray and struggle hard to
attain to God.

A householder: Revered Sir, is it necessary to leave one's home?
Ramakrishna: Not for good; but occasionally when you find opportunity, for a
day or two, leaving behind responsibility, care and anxiety. But during this
time you should not mix with worldly people or think of worldly affairs.
Either live alone, or in the company of some saint or holy man.[p. 77 & 78]
