Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,

                              I want to do=
 homam for chandi devi.I 
had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost=
 1 feet by 1 feet. 
So is it good measurement or not ? I also bought havan =
samagri, dry 
coconuts etc.

                    Actually i want to start w=
ith short cut method 
so please advice me that ,how much ghee,havan samagri=
, dry coconut 
etc are used in one havana, so that i will plan these items =

accordingly.I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry coconuts 
etc.=
.So how to divide this in ratio as per single day process.How 
much ghee in=
 grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf notes 
on homam again and =
again but doing practical things r difficult and 
need much more focus and =
methodology.

               Although  by God grace and your encouragement =
to 
people for doing homams, even i myself get transformed towards 
homam ,=
so thanks for that. But i need your step by step guidance as 
everything is=
  not included in your notes( although its best notes 
on homam). Its my we=
akness actually.


               In normal homams by priests in India ,the=
y do swaha 
with ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they=
 pour 
ghee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of ghee 
=
in water too. So is it correct way or not ?

               
              =
 If single person is doing a homam then how to manage 
ahutis of ghee and s=
amagri both and of course mantra mala or notes u 
provided ? Bcz in India, =
normally full group or family do homams and 
priest only says mantras.So i =
think two people r must for homam.

               I have spoon made of woo=
d ,Is it ok or i have to buy 
of copper metal ?

                I am still=
 unmarried so can i do with my mother this 
chandi homam ?

             
 =
      Please provide me some beautiful answers of these queries.And 
dont m=
ind if my queries prove to be very simple and illogical.But i 
have to star=
t from basics .So just cooperate with me as i love the 
work with perfectio=
n.In next mail i will ask some queries on mantras 
in order to understand p=
roperly.

U r really spreading vedic wisdom in true practical sense. I salu=
te 
to u.
