 Once, a man was going through a forest, when three robbers fell upon him
and robbed him of all his possessions. One of the robbers said, "What's the
use of keeping this man alive?" So saying, he was about to kill him with his
sword, when the second robber interrupted him, saying: 'Oh, no! What is the
use of killing him? Tie his hand and foot and leave him here." The robbers
bound his hands and feet and went away. After a while the third robber
returned and said to the man: "Ah, I am sorry. Are you hurt? I will release
you from your bonds." After setting the man free, the thief said: "Come with
me. I will take you to the public high way." After a long time they reached
the road. At this the man said: "Sir, you have been very good to me. Come
with me to my house." "Oh,no!" the robber replied. "I can't go there. The
police will know it."

This world itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here are Satva,
rajas, and lamas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of Truth. Tamas
wants to destroy him.Rajas binds him to the world.

But Satva rescues him from the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the
protection of Satva, man is rescued from anger, passion and other evil
effects of tamas.

Further, Satva loosens the bonds of the world. But Satva also is a robber.
It cannot give man the ultimate Knowledge of Truth, though it shows him the
road leading to the Supreme Abode of God.Setting him on the path, Satva
tells him: "Look yonder. There is your home." Even Satva is far away from
the knowledge of Brahman.
