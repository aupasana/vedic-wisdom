Namaste,
 
Some intelligent and rational people wonder why we need to do ri=
tuals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want to explain this ba=
sic point with an analogy.
 
We teach some phrases and manners to small chi=
ldren. For example, we tell small children to say "thank you" when someone =
helps or say "I am sorry" when they do something wrong. A really small chil=
d does not even understand what those words mean, but repeats them out of h=
abit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of w=
hat one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean =
comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually understood from e=
xperience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you=
 cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumula=
tes more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external world thr=
ough senses), the child's thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the=
 words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one then =
clearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain emotion (=
sadness and compassion).
 
Similarly, one may be doing rituals like homam, =
pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully understanding or =
appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many years without fully=
 understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand and even exp=
erience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spiritual =
truths are actually understood from experience alone. One can never fully u=
nderstand what one has never experienced. As we accumulate more experiences=
 (stored perceptions of the external and internal world through external se=
nses and the inward directed mind), one's thinking expands and one gets mor=
e clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths one has been exposed to.
 
R=
ituals in various religions are designed to symblize some truths that gives=
 bliss when experienced by one. A mere explanation of the symbolism is ofte=
n useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain to a one yea=
r old child what the word "sorry" means in detail, the child will not under=
stand. The best thing to do is to just get the child into the habit of sayi=
ng "I am sorry" in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning will become=
 clearer and clearer with experience and the correct emotions will come aut=
omatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibly with mista=
kes and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mind - will sl=
owly understand it and experience it.
 
Some religions have done the mistak=
e of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the final truths=
. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former helps one in gett=
ing to the latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the base of hill before=
 reaching its top, one often needs to engage in some external practices in =
order to realize internal truths. Of course, it is good to remind one that =
reaching the top is the goal, lest one should get stuck at the base or in t=
he middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate the first steps. Just sayin=
g "you are That. Just realize that you are That" is not an action plan. It =
does not work for most. One has to take some baby steps.
 
If we don't teac=
h a toddler to say various words because the toddler does not anyway unders=
tand them, one will never learn anything. Correct knowledge evolves from ha=
lf knowledge and habits that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments=
 and experiences more. Similarly, correct spiritual knowledge evolves from =
half knowledge and ritualalistic practices that may be devoid of knowledge,=
 as one experiments and experiences more. Most of us, when it comes to spir=
itual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get into the habit of=
 doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
