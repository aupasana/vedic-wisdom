Dear Friends,

Because our all Vedas,Puranas,Ramayan are written in Sanskri=
t
only.Which ancient Granth available to us is in Sanskrit only,why any
one=
 have objection to say 'Sanskrit is mother language"?

That period where Sa=
nskrit is main language East to West,North to
South so it used thoroughly a=
nd we have all the "Shastra" in
Sanskrit.To understand it is difficult beca=
use the link from that
period to Mugalkal we lost by offender cause,they bu=
rn all most all
our literature to destroy our culture and History.After Mug=
alkal
English came and the impose English.Now English is International
lang=
uage,after 22 century if people will say English is mother language.

Thank=
s,

M.S.bohra
