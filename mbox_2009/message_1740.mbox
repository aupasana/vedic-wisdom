Sri Narasimha Garu and Others,

Can we read the Veda mantras during the nig=
ht time?

Typically in today's busy world we are all occupied with work dur=
ing most of the day. Before sleeping, if one wishes to do some japa mentall=
y with a veda mantra wil it be fine?
Are there any restrictions on the kind=
 of dieties that one should not be performing during the night time ( i rem=
ember Narasimha cautioning earlier from performing chandi homam during the =
night). In general any pre-cautions are to be taken if we have to read/do j=
apa with veda mantra during the night time.

Can i read veda mantras while =
sleeping on bed? (not in a casual way by any means)

I some times put on th=
e some vedic chants during night and while listening to them sleep, the cha=
nts go on till the morning until i wakes up again. Is this is an acceptable=
 way? 

Kindly give me your thoughts on this.

Thanks
KK
