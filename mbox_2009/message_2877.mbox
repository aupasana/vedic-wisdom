Even the argument which says, =93Duality (dvaita) during practice (sadhana)=
 =96
which one undertakes (due to) not knowing (the truth that one is alway=
s
Brahman) =96 and nonduality (advaita) after attainment (that is, duality =
is
true during the time of practice and non-duality becomes true only after=
 the
attainment of Self-realization)=94, is not true. Who else is one excep=
t the
tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) a=
nd when
one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).

Sri Bhagavan says that ev=
en this is not true, because nonduality (advaita)
is always the truth and d=
uality (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one
non-dual Self alone exis=
ts and is real even when in the ignorant outlook of
the individual it seems=
 to appear as this unreal world of duality and
diversity.

In order to emph=
asis that duality is unreal even during the time of its
seeming existence, =
Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the =91lost=92 tenth man. Ten
foolish men=
 forded a river, and on reaching the other side they wished to
make sure th=
at all had crossed safely. So all of them began to count the
number of pers=
ons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count himself,
they all coun=
ted only nine. Believing that one of their companions must have
drowned, th=
ey all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who understood the
situation=
 asked each one to count himself, whereupon they realized that they
were al=
ways ten men, both during the time of their seeming loss and after
their =
=91finding=92 the missing man. Similarly, when we attain Self-knowledge we
=
will realize that non-duality (advaita) is always the sole truth,both durin=
g
the time of our seeming ignorance (when nonduality appears to be lost and=

duality appears to prevail) and after our =91attaining=92 Self, the non-du=
al
reality.

It is to be noted here that, though non-duality is the truth e=
ven during the
time of seeming ignorance, this does not mean that no spirit=
ual practice
(sadhana) is necessary,as some theoreticians/theorists have wr=
ongly
concluded.So long as the tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessar=
y for
each one of the ten to enquire and find out =91Who is lost?=92 , for =
then only
will the truth be realized that the so called =91lost=92 tenth ma=
n is only
oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as t=
he
experience of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to
=
enquire and find out =91Who am I, who have lost the experience of
non-duali=
ty?=92, for then only will the truth be realized that the seeming
individua=
l =91I=92 who does not experience non-duality is merely an unreal
appearanc=
e, and that the real =91I=92 has in fact never lost the experience of
non-d=
uality.
