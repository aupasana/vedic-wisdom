Namaste friends,
 
This weekend, Ravi shot video of a 20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being performed by me, based on the procedure in the manual. He uploaded it to Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Video is one file that is 20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is downloadable to your computer and you can play it using free software QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored as three parts and has a higher quality. You can play those three parts directly from YouTube.
 
If you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam page, you will see all related links right there.
 
To limit the video size, we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times each and Atharva seersham once. You can of course use higher counts and do it longer.
 
Thanks to Ravi for his effort!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
