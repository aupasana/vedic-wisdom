Namaste,
 
> Can we really judge a spiritual monument like Sri Ramakrishna astrologically?
 
If what happened is a result of a karma from the past lives, then it is reflected in the birth horoscope and astrology can be used to analyze.
 
Of course, when a deity or a rishi comes to earth, they need not carry any bad dridha karmas with them. But, depending on the exact mission, some suffering and negative results may be useful as they enable other things. So a deity or rishi may voluntarily take on some bad dridha karmas when coming to earth. Sometimes, it is also possible to take karmas from someone else after birth, like Ramakrishna did with Girish.
 
Once a dridha karma is upon one, either because one committed something earlier or because one took it from somebody, it will give its result.
 
A realized yogi has very little identification with body and bodily suffering is no big deal. Moreover, Ramakrishna's cancer was useful in getting most of his sishyas together at Dakshineshwar for an extended period, doing intense sadhanas together and building mutual bonds. It also demonstrated to them that it was possible to focus the mind on god and forget body despite severe physical affliction. It had a purpose.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

However, many karmas are not dridha and are flexible/optional. Their results can be avoided by the application of free will.

One goes with the flow, keeps on accumulating newer karmas and reaping the good and bad fruits. One remains a slave of bad habits and those habits get reinforced further and further with time.

Thus, one avoids payback for a lot of undesirable karmas that are not dridha. One also stops accumulating too many new undesirable karmas.

Destiny restrains one's free will and tries to compel free will to act in some patterns, but free will need not obey. One always has many options, though *tends to* select the option that is favored by destiny. But one *can* select another option. Strengthening judgment, wisdom and breaking from bad haits is what is needed. Spiritual practices do help in that process.
> >

If some yogis downplayed astrology and emphasized free will, it is not without reason. Swami Vivekananda once famously said astrology is for the weak-minded people and emphasized free will.

> > Buddhi makes decisions, controlled by ahamkaara and aided by chitta. Ahamkara, chitta and buddhi work closely. In computer technology terms, look at ahamkaara as a CPU, chitta as DRAM that stores all data and buddhi as an ALU or a logic co-processor that runs logical algrithms. Manas is an I/O controller. The five jnanendriyas are input channels, the five karmendriyas are output channels; and, the five praanas are the electricity flowing in the computer. When the electricity stops flowing, CPU works in a minimal mode based on an internal battery until electricity is turned on again and some important data in DRAM remains and some is lost by the time electricity is turned on again. Similarly, some experiences from past lives remain in chitta as subconscious memories that influence our thinking in future lives, but many specific memories are lost.

That ideal may be a sub-conscious memory influencing thinking now. If someone did terrible things to one in this life, that may be a conscious memory now. When one is in a position to take revenge, there may be a clash between the two memories.

If one may be under the influence of a spiritual teacher and living a simple life of contentment now. But the sub-conscious memory may be clashing now and then with the ideals taught by guru in this life.
> >  
> > Memories accumulated and retained in chitta over lives may be guiding one in conflicting directions. A subjective algorithm of weighted judgment runs in buddhi. The weights are constantly adjusted based on the history of how information is stored in or retrieved from chitta. Free will is essentially the subjective element of buddhi, that controls this algorithm of weighted judgment.
> >  
> > By engaging in spiritual practices, by reading scriptures and spiritual teachings of great masters and by contemplating, we store some new useful information in chitta, slowly affect how information is stored to or retrieved from chitta, and modify the relative weights of various information in chitta. When the free will is strong, it is possible to overcome latent tendencies by storing new information in chitta and marking it as high priority.
> >  
> > *        *        *
> >  
> > Everybody in the spiritual path knows what are good tendencies and what are not. Feeling lust or desire when one sees a beautiful person or object is bad. Feeling anger when someone says bad things about one is bad. Feeling proud about what one did or has is bad. Hanging on to emotions is bad. And so on. Everybody knows these things. But knowing is not enough and one needs to act on that knowledge! The problem is that these things are stored in chitta with a low weight and there are overriding memories stored chitta with much strong weights. So it is difficult or even impossible for the subjective portion of one's buddhi to make them win in the final decision-making process.
