Hari Om,
Shri Narasimhi ji

Next year I've read that ratha saptami falls on=
 the 22nd of January, so maybe different for U.S.? I may want to invite fri=
ends/family for a puja and teach the children or whoever wishes to learn Su=
rya Namaskar afterwards. My question is that since that is a Friday, would =
it be okay to do the puja on Sunday the 24th since it would be more conveni=
ent for people?

Thank you
Chetan
