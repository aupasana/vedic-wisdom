Dear Raju,

>As for bali... i normally use any fruit.. and after offering s=
ix >pieces, balance part of fruit is not consumed by me .. it is >thrown..b=
ut for example.. i purchase one killo grapes.. and each >day i use six grap=
es out of full bunch for balli.. and next day >another six grapes out of th=
at bunch.. will that be ok? 

Why are you asking such difficult questions?:=
?(.

Yesterday, i didn't have fruit for Bali. I took out some Kishmish in m=
y palm from a packet full of Kishmish. It was 8 in Nos. i used 6 for bali a=
nd 2 were put in to nirmaalya bag.

by the way if you are using fruit for B=
ali, then why you don't try to make 6 pieces out of the fruit? so that noth=
ing needs to be desposed off. just a suggetion.

***
>Can we do mahaganapat=
hi homam by sitting in different directions?.. >Like i have heard that each=
 direction  has its own importance.. 

I know why you have asked this quest=
ion. it is because vijay gave the following details some time back.
 
East:=
 Spiritual progress
West: Fame
South: Longevity/Health (Yama)
North: Money =
(Kubera)

Bhai Paisa no ke Prasidhhi no vichar chhe ke Shu?. this is a prob=
lem Raju. Vijay gave this details as an answer to clarify some query but se=
e it has created a kind of motives other than spiritual progress, in many o=
f us. now this thing will keep on lingering in our mind for long unless we =
mercilessly remove it. even Narasimha mentioned few days back that Mamara i=
s for Money, White til for Spiritual progress etc.. and that was also suffi=
cient for creating ripples.

Narsimha, in his mnual, has categorically ment=
ioned this (I don't know if he wish to revisit and change that)-

[
Similar=
ly, you have to be careful if you perform a homam for certain material goal=
s (such as
getting money, attracting someone, destroying someone etc). If y=
ou perform a homam just to
show your love to god, cleanse yourself spiritua=
lly and make yourself worthy of divine
communion, then there are no risks. =
The procedure taught in this document is based on the
teachings of rishis a=
nd it is safe for anybody to use. Small mistakes will not result in any
pun=
ishment.
In fact, it is expected that everybody who uses this document is i=
nterested in only the second
kind of goal, i.e. spiritual cleansing and upl=
iftment
]

BUT important thing is that, the knowledge provided by Narasimha=
 and vijay about Different materials for Aahuti and Direction respectively,=
 can be used for *other Jan Hitaay*. i mean don't use it for ourself but ca=
n be used for a person who is dire difficulty of Finance/Health etc... for =
example, if you know somebody who is in a trouble due to financial crisis, =
you can suggest him to do some japa facing North Direction. for health matt=
ers, south direction can be suggested and finally thinking 'Neki kar aur da=
riya me dal' or 'Krishnarpana' or 'Shivarpana':)

I asked the same question=
 to my guru initially. he told me that when i perform atleast 10 homa mysel=
f and become proficient in the ritual then i may think of performing it at =
other's home. You can ask your friends to join you and sit while you are pe=
rforming the homam at you house. if they are really intrested they will com=
e and then leave it to Mahaganapati. if he wishes, they will also start tak=
ing serious intrest.

lastly, Narasimha can answer you better for all the q=
uestions.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

you know before that it will be misused. It is ideal NOT TO feel that you a=
