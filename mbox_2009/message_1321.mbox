Dear Sir,
Should I try at Ujjain ? I may visit and check some locations. So=
me of my relativees is settled at Ujjain and he can help me if we have to s=
tart something at Ujjain. 
Ujjain is a Shakti Pith and Maa Harsidhhi Temple=
 is very famous there. Famous Maha Kaal and Bhairavji are also very famous =
there. 
Can you guide me exactly what we have to do there? My concept is no=
t that clear as is in your mind. Thanks
Dr. Rawal

No, we have not yet acted on that instruction.=
 I am pleased that some other people (e.g. Shree Maa and her sishya) have d=

But, establishing t=

Namaste =
friends,

Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets fr=
om an 
interview posted on her website. Please see below.

It is interestin=
g that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
is interestin=
g that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
show what i=
s truth" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
is similar=
 to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
him during=
 Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

She told him that many people are and will=
 be born who will perform a short 
fire ritual on a regular basis, establis=
h sanatana dharma and peace in the 
world and also make quick spiritual pro=
gress individually in that process. 
Shree Maa's statement about what Ramak=
rishna told her is along similar 
lines.

My guru was also told by Mother t=
hat a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
should be established around the=
 world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day. These places do not need=
 to be near any temples or famous places and 
can be anywhere. The ritual n=
eed not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
need to offer silk sarees e=
tc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
offerings is enough, but it =
needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
few such centres are establ=
ished, it will apparently lead to a chain of 
events that will help re-esta=
blish sanatana dharma.

Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a =
Chandi homam everyday for 
3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such=
 homas. That is fantastic! 
It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that c=
reates energy and brings 
deities to a place. While several ancient temples=
 are without any divine 
presence these days, new places of divine presence=
 may be created by pure 
souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing=
 dharma in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Ch=
andi homam during which 
Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru o=
n spreading homam was 
taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and the ti=
me of sankalpa was within 
a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha tim=
e of the birth anniversary. 
All of this was a coincidence and we were unaw=
are of this significance when 
we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to=
 know that Ramakrishna did 
mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebod=
y and that his words are 
similar to the words of Mother.

Best regards,
Na=
rasimha

<DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Shree Maa was referred =
to here. Someone sent me a few snippets from an <BR>interview posted on her=
 website. Please see below.<BR><BR>It is interesting that she considers Ram=
akrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It <BR>is interesting that Ramakrishna to=
ld her she had to "do fire ceremonies and <BR>show what is truth" and "at t=
hat time the whole world will be peace". This <BR>is similar to what my gur=
u was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to <BR>him during Shata Chand=
i homam at Chennai.<BR><BR>She told him that many people are and will be bo=
rn who will perform a short <BR>fire ritual on a regular basis, establish s=
anatana dharma and peace in the <BR>world and also make quick spiritual pro=
gress individually in that process. <BR>Shree Maa's statement about what Ra=
makrishna told her is along similar <BR>lines.<BR><BR>My guru was also told=
 by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam <BR>should be establi=
shed around the
 world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a <BR>day. These=
 places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and <BR>can be =
anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no <BR>ne=
ed to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum <BR>=
offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a =
<BR>few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of=
 <BR>events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.<BR><BR>Though not =
3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for <BR>3 yea=
rs in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! <BR>I=
t is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings <BR>=
deities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine <B=
R>presence these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure=
 <BR>souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the
 worl=
d.<BR><BR>As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam du=
ring which <BR>Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreadin=
g homam was <BR>taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and the time of s=
ankalpa was within <BR>a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of=
 the birth anniversary. <BR>All of this was a coincidence and we were unawa=
re of this significance when <BR>we decided the muhurta. It is interesting =
to know that Ramakrishna did <BR>mention fire ceremonies specifically to so=
mebody and that his words are <BR>similar to the words of Mother.<BR><BR>Be=
