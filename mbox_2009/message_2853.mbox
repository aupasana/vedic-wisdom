 I know well. There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to C=

It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine pr=
esence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, som=
e not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.

a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they f=

 only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someo=

 the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple =
in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There i=
