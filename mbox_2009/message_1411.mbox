Namaskaaram Miteshji,
To add to your point on Shata Chandi Homa, I think th=
ere is Sahasra Chandi(denotes1000) and Laksha Chandi Homa(denotes 100,000 o=
r One Lac as known in India).
It seems that many saintly persons have organ=
ized Laksha Chandi Homa in India;
of late,politicians have started patroniz=
ing (motive !?!) this.
Humble regards,
amit=A0

Namaste

Some tim=
e back I read in a news paper that some folks in Modasa, Gujarat have
organ=
ised on a grand scale Chandi Homams and the acitvity is going to go on for
=
some years atleast.

They have invited pandits and purohits from all parts =
of india and daily are
doing some homans. 

May be people close to the regi=
on can report more accurate news and the logic
behind conducting Candi Paat=
h Homams on this grand scale.

It is on a very grand scale.

A few years ag=
o I believe the Present Spiritual Head of Saacha Baba Ashram in
Hrishikesh =
or Hardware conducted for many months Candi Paath Homams. It was more
than =
Shaat Chandi, I donot know what is the next one level up.

Best Regards
Mit=
esh
