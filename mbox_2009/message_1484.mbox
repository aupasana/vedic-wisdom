h my busy office work schedule. 

Narasimha is asking us not to avoid exact=
ly this.
Let us say we are at place A. We need to travel to B (in spiritual=
 sadhana, the destination is realising with God).

Let us say you have to t=
ravel from place A to B by bus. There may be multiple buses in different ro=
utes (various sadhanas).

Depending on when you board the bus you may be ab=
le to see some scneries. These are similar to experiences.

How ever, if we=
 get too fascinated with the route keep going back to place A so that we ca=
n enjoy the scenary, we may never be able to reach B.

Do not get distracte=
d or carve out for experainces and great feeling.
This is easily said than =
done. How ever, I hope we can all do our sadhana one day with out any desir=
e for experiances or results if we keep telling our selves to do so!


Best=
 regards,
Vijay.
