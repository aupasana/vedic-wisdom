Dear Group members,

The following message received on the subject which i=
s very informative and usful while performing Homan

Quote

soma + ardha =
=3D somArdha ( half soma).  The half moon in the (fore)head.  Soma means mo=
on. 
 
Like that we can see at a number of places the word Soma is coming. =
 This soma is not accessible to sinful persons, to persons who do not have =
a pure mind. Means persons like Rishis have the access to it (with pure min=
d).  Only people with pure mind can locate, visualize, distinguish such pla=
nts which are having high medicinal properties and coolest in nature.  
 
 =

You may remember that In mahAbhArat, the Bhishma goes to kAshi king and fo=
rcefully brings the three brides, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika and gives to vi=
chitraveerya.  Vichitraveerya  is bedridden due to the disease TB. These th=
ree names are the names of three plants in vEdAs having highest medicinal v=
alues.  
 
 
These plants who are able to distinguish, could be the real an=
d purest medicine for treatment in TB. 
 
The mruthyunjaya mantra   thriamb=
akam yajAmyahe suganddhim pushtivarddhanam...etc    triambakam =3D means  t=
hree ambAs.  It is Amba, Ambika and AmbAlika.  Put them into the homaKunda =
and do the yajnA,  (it will give you suganddhi and pushti vardhak).
 
 
Tru=
st you must have got a small idea about Soma, the nectar availability to Ri=
sh etc
 
 
Best of luck
Vijayan
