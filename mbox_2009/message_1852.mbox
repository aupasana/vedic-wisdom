1) If the coconut pieces are not burn fully, I usually use them the next da=
y along with fresh coconut pieces to get a slightly bigger fire than my usu=
al. As far I know it is not a problem.

As Narasimha suggested, if you are =
doing homam for spiritual progress and not for material benefit, it is like=
 serving our parents - God will not mind if we do some mistake due to our i=
gnorance.

2) You can treat them as the remaining ash. If you eventually pu=
t this in a river, crushing the pieces may be better so that it gets dissol=
ved in waters.

Best regards,
Vijay
