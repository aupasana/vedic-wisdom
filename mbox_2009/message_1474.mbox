Namaste

I have also read him and he is correct too. He did have a initiati=
on to awaken his kundalini.

Awakening of Kundalini and following further i=
s also a path like many other paths to self realization.

In short Kundalin=
i Shakti is the same energy or life force which is present in all of us. Wh=
en it is not awakened the flow is outward, we are in the building and expan=
ding mode of karma i.e. accumulating more sanskars, when the Kundalini Shak=
ti is awakened, this flow of the energy is directed inwards towards cleansi=
ng our chitta and it starts eliminating the impressions or our sanskars, i.=
e. contraction.

Others paths also do similar things in that they also star=
t contraction or cleansing.
 
Kundalini Shakti can also arise automatically=
 by the sadhak's severe penance or if in the past lives it has happened bef=
ore than as soon has the correct time comes i.e. stars line up, that sadhak=
 shall see the  KS rising and taking him further.

Awakening of Kundalini S=
hakti does not mean self realization, there is still ways to go like in any=
 other path.

Best Regards
Mitesh
