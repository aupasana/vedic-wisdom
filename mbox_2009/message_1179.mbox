Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for this. I really like your analogy about the h=
eckler. I 
just need to proceed and give it my best.

By the way, thank you=
 to all the others who replied as well.

Kind Regards

   I also agree with this mail. I feel I have double minds. 
One is reading=
 Chandipath or doing Japam and other mind is thinking 
on various thoughts.=
 Is it possible that we have two minds at a time? 
Because when we think on=
 other issues while reading Chandipath, the 
first mind reading Path is not=
 at all stopped. Path is going on 
mentally.
