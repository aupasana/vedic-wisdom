|| OM TAT SAT ||
Namaskar,
   What inspired me for a long time was the Cosm=
ic-consciousness experience of my friend - a colleague in the company I use=
d to work. 
He told me, when he was a child, he used to catch various color=
ed birds at night (these were astral projections). Due to his past good kar=
ma, he had his consciousness expanded throughout the earth, and later on, t=
hroughout the Physical cosmos. He is 2 years elder to me, and proficient in=
 the Hatha Yoga (like Mahabheda, Mahamudra, YoniMudra etc).
   I have had m=
any-many spiritual experiences in past few years, which I don't share excep=
t 1-2 people around me including this guy.

Regards,
Nitish

tending upon this idea further, there are beings in the Astral cosmos who h=

 in the cycles of creation. While they will still have the idea of "Asmita"=
 in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vi=

 Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=
al body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=
ions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical=
 body (16 chemical elements).

now that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 el=
ements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also c=
ast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of d=
ifferent constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta be=
ing the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last=
 to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising a=
bove Chitta.

ince astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear,=

 When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intelle=
ctual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or c=
hitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retr=
ieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I=

lized consciousness.
