Namaste,

Whether it is meditation after homa=
m or normal meditation without homam, the 
purpose of meditation is to focu=
s the mind on a mantra and/or a deity and 
forget body and other pre-occupa=
tions of the mind. So many conscious, 
sub-conscious and super-conscious th=
oughts are always running in the mind 
and they stop the mind from becoming=
 absolutely still. When mind lets 
everything go and becomes still, then th=
e deity can fill the mind. That 
bliss is indescribable and far higher than=
 any normal happiness one may have 
experienced. That is what one is chasin=
g when one meditates.

When mind is getting withdrawn a little from body an=
d some of the conscious 
thoughts, it is possible that some sub-conscious t=
houghts lying beneath the 
surface come to the fore. It is not that you are=
 attracting anything. It is 
just a thought or impression or memory stored =
in the sub-conscious mind. As 
mind's awareness of body and other things it=
 is normally conscious of 
decreases, it may become more aware of some sub-=
conscious thoughts. If you 
negotiate those and learn to ignore those, then=
 mind's awareness of some 
super-conscious thoughts may increase. As you re=
fuse to be distracted by all 
these and try to focus the mind on the mantra=
 and mantra alone, eventually 
mind will reach a state of stillness. There =
is no thumbrule to success, 
except trying.

As meditation after homam is m=
ore effective, it is possible to make progress 
faster. However, one still =
needs to work hard and long to achieve perfection 
in focus. Even great sai=
nts and yogis took many years. Just keep trying.

Next time such a thing ha=
ppens, do not think much about it and be 
distracted. Keep the mind focused=
 on the mantra. Nothing is to be feared and 
nothing is to be despised. All=
 that is there is the deity you are praying 
to. The deity fills the entire=
 universe. If you see or hear or perceive 
something other than the deity (=
e.g. "my body", a ghost trailor), it is 
because of mind's faulty perceptio=
n. When mind perceives correctly, there 
should be nothing existing in the =
universe other than the deity. Fix this 
thought in your mind and keep tryi=
ng.

Best regards,
Narasimha
