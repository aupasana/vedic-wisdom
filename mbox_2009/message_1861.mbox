Namaste,
I too do havan in the evening,but before sunset.I do it around 6 p=
m.
It always feels great.
I also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the =
solar plexus....sort of ,what one feels at the heart when one sees an emoti=
onal movie.Why is this?
I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Ca=
n i meditate even after the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it does not la=
st very long after the aahutis are done.And i would like to stay 'There' mo=
re.

Regards,
Sunita.
