Namaste Narasimhaji, 

In the Ganapati homam manual at end of praana pratis=
htaapanaa with the mantra: "...t=E4vattvam pr=E9tibh=E4vena m=FCrtau agnau =
ca sannidhim kuru"

Grammatically, in this mantra does "ca" mean "and"?  
I=
f you want to use this in puja without homam can you remove "agnau ca" and =
just install in the murti - would it then be "murtau sannidhim kuru?Also if=
 one wants to install in Ganapati yantra,would the mantra be "...t=E4vattva=
m pr=E9tibh=E4vena yantram sannidhim kuru" ?? 

Hoping you can clarify and =
correct any mistakes.

Thanks,
