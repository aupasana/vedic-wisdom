Dear Hari,
=C2=
=A0
Never hesitate to ask or say anything that may seem impertinent.
=C2=A0=

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
When a mantra is spoken, sound is produced at 4 le=
vels. The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sound at the physical level=
. When you say something by moving the physical body parts (lips etc), thei=
r movement=C2=A0vibrates the air particles and those vibrations vibrate the=
 physical body parts in the ears of listeners and people around you can "li=
sten".
=C2=A0
At the same time, the subtle thoughts in the mind accompanyin=
g the chanting of the mantra result in movement in parts of your "subtle bo=
dy", which vibrate the subtle space around you and those cause some vibrati=
ons in the subtle bodies of people around you.
=C2=A0
In this way, sound (o=
r vibration) is produced at 4 levels. The subtler the level, the longer the=
 signal can carry without decaying.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
If one ha=
s some shakti accumulated with a specific mantra, one's chanting of that ma=
ntra is infused with that shakti.
=C2=A0
The energy infused when one chants=
 a mantra is carried mainly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy carr=
ied at the physical level (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to the=
 energy carried in the subtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound co=
ntains the key to the subtler levels for most people.
=C2=A0
I can explain =
this using an analogy. One may have a powerful concept or idea in mind that=
 one is thinking of. Most other people cannot read one's mind and cannot ac=
cess that concept or idea. However, if one expresses the idea in words, peo=
ple will be able to access that idea. Most of the power is in the idea and =
not in the exact words used. However, the written/spoken words that are tan=
gible to others act as a key to one's thoughts. World can now access the po=
wer of one's idea!
=C2=A0
Similarly, the exact letters or words of a mantra=
 are not really alive with energy. But, when one does sadhana with the mant=
ra, one's chanting of the mantra is infused with some power. Other people c=
annot access that power normally. But, once one says the mantra in an audib=
le form (just like expressing the idea in tangible words above), the power =
in one's chanting of the mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even th=
ough the power is not really in the audible sound produced, the audible sou=
nd acts as a key to the inaudible sound and world can now access the power =
of one's chanting (just as the written words act as a key to one's idea and=
 the world can now access the power of one's idea).
=C2=A0
When you chant a=
 mantra silently, you are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world=
. When you chant a mantra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the mantra=
 with the world. Some of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped by s=
omeone.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
If leaves, flowers and fruits are pluc=
ked from a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one's =
shakti with a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud now=
 and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining some =
yama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.
=C2=A0
If you d=
o not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too. That i=
s NOT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However, cer=
tain tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti with=
 a mantra. If one's guru wants one to do something in future and asks one t=
o accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.
=C2=A0
*=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
Manish's guru was a realized man. His name was Nakhate M=
aharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darshan of Bh=
adra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. He rema=
ined in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world to per=
form the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.
=C2=A0
Even a realized=
 man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, when he gave=
 a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite old-fashione=
d. He did not say the mantra in Manish's ear. Instead, he asked Manish to s=
it down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish's temples. He aske=
d Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra in Devanaga=
ri script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and did sadhan=
a with that mantra.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
These methods are used for=
 a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:
=C2=A0
(=
1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, because th=
ere is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately is un=
wise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.
(2) =
Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily, one =
can waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be bett=
er if you teach one how to work hard and make money.
=C2=A0
Sharing various=
 thoughts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana=C2=A0is o=
ne thing and sharing one's accumulated shakti with a mantra with people ano=
ther.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
As I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want=
 to mention a small story about him.
=C2=A0
When Nakhate Maharaj left this =
world, his sishyas had an interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditati=
ng at that time. He suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. He ope=
ned his eyes and saw that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him phys=
ically. He held his palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as=
 if saying good bye. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India later, h=
e found out that Nakhate Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. H=
e also found out that his other sishyas too had the same experience in diff=
erent parts of the world around the same time.

Dear Narasimha, namaste &=
 pranaams
=C2=A0
Please forgive me if I am seen to be impertinent in my que=
stion based on the lines in bold below.
=C2=A0
Why must the Guru upadesa be=
 kept secret and not shared with anyone who might benefit? More the so if i=
t is a prasiddha mantra? Think of Ramanujacharya, who after receiving the a=
stakshari from his Guru, shouted the mantra from the rooftop to all and thu=
s the world was benefited. The same way, have we not benefited when the ris=
his generously shared their knowledge of Brahman?
=C2=A0
I can understand i=
t if the mantra/prayer is customized for an individual according to the cap=
acity of the person.
=C2=A0
best regards
Hari

It is what you wrote, but with some minor correction. I can =
record other mantras in my voice and share with all, but instructed to not =
give Savitur Gayatri mantra in my voice to anyone. It is my spiritual food.=
 Most of my spiritual experiences came with this mantra and I need this man=
tra for more things in future. So I keep it to myself and do not share it w=
ith all.
=C2=A0
But many people in your city should be able to teach you th=
is mantra with correct pronunciation. By the way, I think you live in Chenn=
ai. If so, please try to meet Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Tham=
buchetty Street near Central station. He belongs to a rare class of priests=
 who are fast becoming extinct in this commercial age. If possible, meet hi=
m and take his blessings.
=C2=A0
My intuition tells me that you are a man m=
ade for karma yoga rather than meditation and veda mantras. Surrender to yo=
ur chosen deity, see that deity in all people and serve people around you. =
See god in all people. If possible, think of starting a small movement in t=
he slums of Chennai (or wherever you live). Go, serve people there, help th=
em to the best of your ability and teach them about god. After helping them=
 materially first, then teach them to chant god's name when they have a few=
 minutes of time. In my opinion, this is the right path for you.
=C2=A0
Act=
ions performed with ego, pride and attachment bind one. Actions without ego=
, pride and attachment liberate one. Please perform big acts of social serv=
ice and yet without any pride or attachment. Do not be upset with a few fai=
lures in the beginning (upset comes with attachment. A detached person is n=
ot upset if his sincere actions do not give the intended result) and keep t=
rying calmly. Sincere and detached action never fails in the long run. Star=
t slowly.
