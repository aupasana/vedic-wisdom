Namaste to all,

1) While doing homam can we go on adding coconut pieces as=
 we like(whenever i feel the material in the kund is less) or it has to be =
added only when we say SWAHA

2) Can i add ghee after i do purnahuti becaus=
e then i will be sure that it will get burned , otherwise some pieces remai=
n.

3) Does it matter how i keep that piece of coconut , which i kept in th=
e kund for PURNAHUTI, i mean ,the part6 thats cut upside or towards down. H=
ope this question is clear.

Regards
Jitender
