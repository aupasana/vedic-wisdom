Namaste, 

And thanks for the heads up regarding the Shani prayer. We shall=
 see if I get my wish. 

Let me begin by noting that when we speak of evolu=
tion, the entire conception is contingent upon the mind's ability to mainta=
in an idea, and hold it in contrast to some other idea. This very ability i=
s duality. Evolution, when considered in this context, has no meaning. The =
duality of preservation versus destruction is itself an illusion, but whenc=
e does this illusion arise? And does the very pageantry of images which we =
call phenomena come from the same source? If universal collective conscious=
ness (if such a thing even exists) is in the habit of flexing in order to g=
ain the stamina to hold a conception of its own evolution long enough to re=
cognize it as a desirable state, then some kind of universal harmony can be=
 seen as a result of awareness or self-knowledge, order out of chaos. Howev=
er, the concern that this state is in and of itself the ultimate problem, o=
r cause of suffering, is formidable. But here we would be in U.G. Krishnamu=
rti territory, seeing the pursuit of enlightenment itself as problem, enter=
taining the possibility that the mind is more than myth. But I don't want t=
o go down that road, at the moment. 

I am, rather, presently interested in=
 the mind's ability to establish non-syntactical positive conditioning, whi=
ch is less analagous to favorably programming computer to complete a task, =
than a streaming mass of assorted stimuli which somehow have positive or pl=
easurable effects.  Since syntax itself is the recognizablly built-in probl=
em of most models of consciousness, due to its linearity, and since most no=
n-linear theories of consciousness, such as synchronicity, magical thinking=
, etc, are not highly regarded in mainstream circles, merely gaining access=
 to the body of thought relative to this subject is no easy task, even with=
 the internet. Moreover, if the understanding of the dynamics of kundalini =
itself, for instance, were to emerge as "the
answer" to humanity's problems=
, such an understanding might even prove to be impossible to communicate sy=
ntactically, due to the experiential nature of kundalini. The problem is al=
most like that of 19th century German philosophy's simulataneous praise of =
Upanishadic pantheistic imagination along with the assessment of the naivet=
e of the authors. Because phenomenology must categorize, it will fail to re=
vel in the ecstasy of Upanishadic imagination. Phenomenology may inform the=
 Zeitgeist, and at ever-increasing speed, but it may always lag behind, in =
terms of immediacy of impact, the ecstatic experience itself, which often g=
limpses unclaimed/uncategorized territory. 

Both evolutionary theory and p=
henomenology both suffer from some degree of linearity, whereas a system su=
ch as Tarot does not. The latter may be seen as a system of space/time loca=
lization or assumption of identity, which hinges on the power of the imagin=
ation along with the ability of the body to hold certain types of energy in=
 order to execute the role which the mind has conceived. The ability to con=
ceive relations between various simulataneous roles or players in a state o=
f harmonious energy exchange is to move toward a theory of Atman, whereas t=
he inability or unwillingness to do so is Anatman. Both processes are drive=
n by desire, however. It is as if Anatman theory is panning for gold in the=
 stream while Atman theory takes what pieces are found and builds temples, =
which, of course, Anatman theory may or may not recognize. 

Thanks,

Jeff =
