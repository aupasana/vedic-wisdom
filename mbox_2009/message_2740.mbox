I am not=
 getting your point here. you agree in the above given first statement that=
 Ahamkaara is an Idea present in all three bodies and remains TILL the soul=
 is freed from all the three containers.

The second statement says somethi=
ng radical. Ahamkaara and I Ness is completely two different identity.

you=
r second statment is a departure from almost every Gnyaani has to say.

I p=
ray...you please clarify your understanding of Ahamkaara and I Ness.

looki=
ng forward to explanation of the above.

Thanks & Regards,

Utpal
