Dear Nitish,
Thank you for your clear writings this time. At least I unders=
tand it in a consistent framework now. Technically speaking, to unify both =
frameworks into a common ground, both frameworks seem to agree that the chi=
tta of sookshma-sarira is not the pure chitta of brahman. The chitta of soo=
kshma sarira has material impurity in it/has a material carrier. Your frame=
work calls this material carrier the 6th tattwa, whereas in the VC framewor=
k, it seems logical to infer that the material carrier is some combination =
of the 5 tattwas. Also, your framework (by your own words), seems to imply =
that the 6th tattwa is the source of all the other 5, which are formed out =
of it *in parallel*, so to say. To cut a long line of reasoning short and g=
et to the meat of the matter, I have one more question (so I can continue t=
o unify the frameworks): (a) Is there a level of realization in which the 5=
 tattwas are calm, and only the 6th is active (b) Does this state have Aham=
kara or not/does it correspond to any well known chakra?

Regards,

Sundeep=

 Whereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb, i.e. consciousness, then t=
his property is only possessed by Brahman because only it is Sat-chitta-ana=

So to put this is context, VC clearly implies that at the material level of=
 tattwas, we see the Linga Sarira. One of the constructs of Linga sarira is=
 antahakrana. One of its "modifications" is chitta. I take this to mean (si=
nce I take that only Brahman can have true chitta (verb))it is that propert=
y of the antahakarana that, when enlivened by Brahman, gives awareness/cons=
ciousness to the Linga sarira.

 How would the Soul become aware of the more material Aakash Tattwa (and th=
