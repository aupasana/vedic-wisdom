 A PHYSICIAN prescribed medicine for a patient and said to him, "Come
another day and I'll give you directions about diet," The physician had
several jars of molasses in his room that day.

The patient lived very far away. He visited the physician later and the
physician said to him, "Be careful about your food.

It is not good for you to eat molasses." After the patient left, another
person who was there said to the physician, "Why did you give him all the
trouble of coming here again? You could very well have given him the
instructions the first day."

The physician replied with a smile: "There is a reason. I had several jars
of molasses in my room that day. If I had asked the patient then to give up
molasses, he would not have had faith in my words.

He would have thought; 'He has so many jars of molasses in his room, he must
eat some of it. Then molasses can't be so bad.' Today I have hidden the
jars. Now he will have faith in my words."

Renunciation of the world is needful for those whom God wants to be teachers
of men. One who is an acharya should give up 'woman and gold';otherwise
people will not take his advice.

It is not enough for him to renounce only mentally; he should also renounce
outwardly. Only then will his teaching bear fruit. Otherwise people will
think,

"Though he asks us to give up 'woman and gold',he enjoys them himself in
secret."
