Namaste,
Intresting !

after reading you email, a thought cam to me along t=
he same line. Duality (Maya) is mainly Play of Light (Refer to Autobiograph=
y of yogi) so if one overcomes the speed of light, one crosses the duality.=
..vow Gnyaani se gnyaani mile hui Gnaan ki baat !!!

thanks for the idea an=
d warm regards,

Utpal
