Narasimha ji, 
Pranam!

on Akshyaya Triteya i performed the first homam usi=
ng the "bare essential" procedure. Today was the third day of homam and i t=
hought it went better than the first two days. i liked the sound of crackli=
ng fire while meditating on the mantra.

i want to ask a few questions. som=
ehow, i feel more comfortable meditating on Mahamrityunjaya mantra than pro=
nouncing the mantra aloud. is it ok do do so without producing sound (vaikh=
ri?)? 

today i felt that i should do the homam every day. is is ok if i do=
 this in the evening when i come back from work...say 7-7.30 p.m.?

For som=
e reason, real or imagined, i am drawn to fire but am also afraid of it. pe=
ople who have seen my horoscope have told me that i should be wary of fire =
probably because i have rahu and mars in 8th house in Saggi - aspected by S=
un (and also Jupiter and Merc). Seven months ago my mother-in-law got burnt=
 while doing Puja and passed away.This incident took place right in front o=
f me. 

i have not been a believer of rituals...or a personal deity. So one=
 of my problems was who should i meditate to while performing homam. Then o=
n this very forum there was a discussion on mahamrityunjaya mantra and i th=
ought this should be right for me. i also realise that Triyambake could be =
an ugra form of shiva.

sometime back i had visited Thiruvanamallai and did=
 girivalam...Am curious about the "fire" in / near Chennai that has been me=
ntioned in your introductory write-up on homam.

Thankyou!

best wishes and=
 regards
