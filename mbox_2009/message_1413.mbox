Namaskaram Sri Narasimha Garu,

I have once heard from one of your Astrolog=
y classes (mo3 files) that when you donate money to the beggars you might g=
et bad karma (becasue of the misuse of that money by them), i have stopped =
 giving money to all those road side beggars now.

But, in my mind i'm havi=
ng a bad feeling for not giving them money whenever i see them asking me fo=
r alms. Again the thought of accruing unnecessary karma..is stopping me. Ca=
n you plese clarify which is a big sin / karma of these two. (karma of not =
giving alms to those beggars vs getting karma of their misuse).

Thanks
Kri=
shna Kanth

P.S: I totally agree with your point of the bad karma becuase o=
f misuse of the money we donate, but this is putting in a fix with the thou=
ght that probably i'm not able to help the really needy guys (i typically o=
nly use to give money to very disabled and elderly people).
