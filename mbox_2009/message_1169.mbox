Japa is putting thought frames in front of you. Conscience is
classifying t=
he thought frames into good and bad. An elevated soul
might have ability to=
 classify thoughts in the correct manner without
any biases. For normal peo=
ple, it is better to ignore and continue
doing japa. I watch it like a movi=
e which shows good and bad deeds of
the characters and try not to judge the=
 movie after walking out of the
theater -- this is hard :).  

The objectiv=
e of japa is to find the ultimate Truth -- not to qualify
the thoughts. For=
 most of us, this thought qualification phase has to
be passed to realize o=
ur judgment is insignificant compared to Nature.
