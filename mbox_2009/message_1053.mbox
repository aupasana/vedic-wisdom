Namaste,
 
I heard it referred to as Bet Dwaraka by many people, but as Bri=
had Dwaraka by a learned old man. So I assumed that Bet is from Sanskrit wo=
rd Brihat. Thanks for correcting me.
 
Well, this is the land where Krishna=
 lived and ruled, not too long back (just a few millennia back). No wonder =
it is full of devotional energy. Another place filled with an unbelievable =
level of devotional energy is Mayapur in Bengal and Aalandi near Pune. Girn=
ar mountain at Junagadh in Gujarat and Arunachalam mountain at Tiruvannamal=
ai in Tamil Nadu are filled with an unbelievable level of mystical energy.
=
 
Actually, India is filled with many places that have a high level of spir=
itual energy and conducive to quick spiritual progress if one stays in one =
place and does intense sadhana over a period of time.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

        Sir,
        I=
 have spent 5 years at Dwarka. I have visited that temple too. The western =
part of Gujarat is called as Saurashtra and whole Saurashtra is full of dev=

          Dear Hari=
,

          Repeating any combination of syllables with a focussed mind wi=
ll eventually do the trick on the mind. So you may do either.

          Ho=
wever, some combinations tried by others successfully in the past are bette=
r and faster.

          Regarding the specific mantra below: The words "ra=
am" and "jay" (or "jai") have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be "raama=
" and "jaya" respectively. Arabic has words mostly ending in consonants (i.=
e. no vowel "a" at the end of the word). That Arabic influence made Indians=
 change Sanskrit words to remove "a" at the end of words. "Jaya Raama" beco=
mes "Jay Raam".

          If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sans=
krit, please restore "a" at the end of words. The correct version of the ma=
ntra is "Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama". You can add "Om" at the be=
ginning.

          *        *        *

          On our India trip in the=
 summer of 2008, I and my guru went to many temples. There was one remote t=
emple in BriahdDwaraka that had a nice level of spiritual vibrations. It is=
 a temple of Hanuman and Makaradhwaja (Hanuman's son) together. Apparently =
some yogi did intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the=
 mantra you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of t=
he temple.

          Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations cre=
ated by his sadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent =
some time there. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to BrihadDwaa=
rakaa and then go inside the village (a few km from the main Krishna temple=
 at BrihadDwaarakaa) . It is a very small temple without any crowd, but has=
 stronger spiritual energy than many famous temples. If any of you go to Dw=
araka or Gujarat in general, I recommend visiting that temple and spending =
a couple of hours there.

          The mantra you gave reminded me of that=
 temple.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

            Dear Fellow trav=
ellers, namaste


            All this talk about Mangal reminds me about o=
ne question I've had for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised=
 me to go to any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal =
in my natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha i=
n navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal tem=
ple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest about a mantra, he adv=
ised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the walls of the temple |sri ram j=
aya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. =
Energy from the 7th house to the 10th house with the mantra devata sitting =
in lagna as per mantra shastra teachings. I've been doing this every evenin=
g since.


            Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra.=
 My question is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mang=
al?


            Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mant=
ra? Is it


            |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 a=
ksharas


            or


            |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya ram=
a|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas


            Some say it should be 13 aksharas.=
...


            Sorry for astrological content in this mail.


          =
  best regards
            Hari

his

or quite 
            sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go=
 to any Hanuman 
            temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Man=
gal in my natal chart 
            which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in =
rasi and neecha in navamsa). 
            When I visited the Hanuman deity =
in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, 
            Thirumazhisai near Chennai =
and asked the priest about a mantra, he 
            advised me to chant th=
e mantra inscribed on the walls of the temple 
            |sri ram jaya ra=
