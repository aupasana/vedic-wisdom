Once some very learned Sanskrit scholars were sitting in the old hall
discu=
ssing portions of the Upanishads and other scriptural texts with
Bhagavan. =
Bhagavan was giving them proper explanations and it was a sight to
remember=
 and adore! At the same time, I felt genuinely in my heart, =91Oh, how
grea=
t these people are and how fortunate they are to be so learned and to
have =
such deep understanding and be able to discuss with our Bhagavan.
Compared =
with them, what am I, a zero in scriptural learning?=92 I felt
miserable. A=
fter the pundits had taken leave Bhagavan turned to me and said,
=93What?=
=94, looking into my eyes and studying my thoughts. Then, without even
givi=
ng me an opportunity to explain, he continued, =93This is only the husk! Al=
l
this book learning and capacity to repeat the scriptures by memory is
abs=
olutely no use. To know the Truth, you need not undergo all this torture
of=
 learning. Not by reading do you get the Truth. BE QUIET, that is Truth,
BE=
 STILL, that is God=94.

Then very graciously he turned to me again and the=
re was an immediate change
in his tone and attitude. He asked me, =93Do you=
 shave yourself?=94 Bewildered
by this sudden change, I answered, trembling=
, that I did.

=93Ah, for shaving you use a mirror, don=92t you? You look i=
nto the mirror and
then shave your face; you don=92t shave the image in the=
 mirror. Similarly all
the scriptures are meant only to show you the way to=
 realization. They are
meant for practise and attainment. Mere book learnin=
g and discussions are
comparable to a man shaving the image in the mirror=
=94. From that day onwards
the sense of inferiority that I had been feeling=
 vanished once and for all.
