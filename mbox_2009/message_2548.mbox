Namaste Narasimhaji, 

I was hoping you could help me understand the meanin=
g of the vedic shani mantra prescribed by Parashara. i.e. Om shanno devirab=
histaya aapo bhavantu peetaye, Shan yora bhistravantu naha

In my limited e=
xposure, I see this mantra come up often by pundits (eg. Arya Samaj etc) fo=
r saying when doing hasta prakshalana, and or achamana. I also see that the=
re is reference to devi in the mantra, and I am not understanding how it be=
comes a shani mantra. If possible, could you explain the mantra's meaning a=
nd how it serves as the vedic shani mantra of choice for Parashara to recom=
mend?

Many thanks, 
Puneet
