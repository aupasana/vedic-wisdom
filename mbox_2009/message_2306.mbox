The reason why the scriptures recommend cleanliness of the body [acharas] i=
s
only to make one completely give up the attachment to the body through th=
e
vairagya gained by knowing practically that, in spite of being repeatedly=

cleaned, the filthy and fleshly body again and again becomes filthy.

Thos=
e who happily take as =91I=92 their fleshy and filthy body, which converts
=
even pure food into rotten filth soon after it is taken, are worse than a
p=
ig, which feeds on filth.

Those who take as =91I=92 their body, which take=
s in pure food and converts it
into filth, are worse than a pig which takes=
 in filth and converts it into
filth.

Sadhu Om: Just as a man identifies h=
is body as =91I=92, so a pig identifies his
body as =91I=92. Though both ar=
e equally wrong in identifying a body as =91I=92, Sri
Bhagavan points out h=
ow the body of a pig is superior to that of a man! That
is, the body of a p=
ig eats only filth and excretes it again as filth,
whereas the body of huma=
n being eats good, pure food and excretes it as
filth. Therefore, Sri Bhaga=
van=92s verdict is that those who identify a human
body as =91I=92 are wors=
e than pigs!

that was thoroughly checked and revised by him during=
 his lifetime. As such
it has a unique place in the Ramana literature.
