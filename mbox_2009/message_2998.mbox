      Hi, 

I am by no means a scholar, rather a spiritual aspirant but as=
 this was a question I used to ask myself many a time while chanting the ho=
ly Vishnu Sahasranamam, I thought of writing my experience. In my case, oft=
entimes have I found that after the initial enthusiasm of a few days, my co=
ncentration on the chanting/or on the meaning of the names declines and the=
 mind wanders to a great extent. But when I chant the phalasruti BEFORE cha=
nting the actual Sahasranamam, my concentration registered an increase. The=
 reason behind this is not only the attraction of the fruits, the phala, me=
ntioned - it is the mere suggestion that certain fruits, whether material o=
r spiritual, are attached to the chanting of these verses. That suggestion =
has helped my mind by creating more interest and an urge to focus on such g=
reat names that could actually give such great results. In the case of the =
Vishnu Sahasranamam, a few verses mentioning the moksha-phala is anyway
 tr=
aditionally recited as Purva-Pithika. 

Best wishes,
Hari

      Namaste Punee=
t,



Although your questions are to Narasimha, i am writing few thoughts o=
f mine hoping it'll not be inapporopriate.



you've asked a very vital que=
stion which would have confused many in
the past and many are facing dilema=
 presently. I've faced this dilema
in the past but now over time, my unders=
tanding has become clearer
(atleast i feel that way).



Just take examples=
 of Ganapati Atharvashirsha and Sri Sukta. They both
are having quite a few=
 verses in the end which describes Phalshruti.
Like wise there are many spi=
ritual texts that are coupled with
Phalshruti. It is observed that most of =
the 'Propagated Fruits' are for
Material benefits.



It is very logical to=
 assume that when one reads such stotras or
spiritual knowledge sources suc=
h as Bhagvad Gita only for the sake of
spiritual progress, meaning improvin=
g upon the inner faculties such as
discrimination, detachment, humility etc=
., One does not need to recite
Phalshruti.



It is my well considered opin=
ion that Phalshruti can be skipped
entirely even if there present a verse w=
hich says that if one does not
read Phalshruti path then the whole effort w=
ill be fruitless !



It is very likely that these "Fruits verses' were add=
ed to the basic
text to attract people so that they are ultimately benefite=
d
spiritually. Like Nityaananda (Nitai) famously allure people to chant
Har=
i Naam. 



Narasimha Garu will surely enlighten us all.



Best Regards,
