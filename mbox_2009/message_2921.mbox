Namaste Mahalakshmiji,

Faith & Trust makes a person, body system or anythi=
ng for that matter makes us to move forward. It makes us receptive & optimi=
stic so that we as humans can benefit from it. Its more like a positive fee=
ling which gives us happiness. Its like pouring tea in an empty cup.

Where=
as Skepticism & Distrust are the ante to the above which puts you & your sy=
stem into a defensive mechanism, thereby leading to pessimism and disbelief=
. Its like pouring tea in a cup which is already filled with tea, the more =
you pour in the cup it spills over as there is no more space in the cup. Si=
nce our mind is already filled with skepticism & disbelief it is not allowi=
ng new matters to get into our mind. Hence you do things as someone told yo=
u to do and not that you wanted to do something out of your own interest.

=
I have great respect to the person Shri Ravishankarji, though I have not do=
ne the AOL. I was told that the system they teach really helps the person -=
 forget about that group of people which makes money out of such activities=
.. Lets concentrate on what we want to learn and leave the rest. 

It remin=
ds me of PVRji's (author of JHora software) message -=A0 "when people make =
money using his software brings bad karma to him as his software is absolut=
ely free to everyone who want to learn / use it ". 

So Lakshmiji, please d=
o the Hata yoga sincerely with an open mind and let the cup be empty so tha=
t all the info's you can grab it and use it for your benefit. Once you have=
 completed it why not share your experience with us.

Let GOD bless you and=
 each one of us with a wonderful body & mind.

Jai Maa Kaali,=A0

Devbrato =
Sarkar

"Wealth is not just about making the money BUT making the=A0MAN whi=
le he is making money".
