The=
 following article, which describes the life of a unique devotee of Bhagava=
n Ramana, was written by Darlene Delisi Karamanos, using Dr. G. Swaminathan=
's Biography of Guru Devi Sri Janaky Matha for source material. July 27=
th is Janaky Matha's one hundredth birth anniversary.<br>


<br>Sri Jan=
aky Matha was a wife, mother of seven children, community volunteer, devote=
e of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and an enlightened soul. Her amazing life of =
inner visions, spiritual yearning, surrender and bhakti inspires all to pur=
sue the spiritual ideal, delve into the Supreme Self and not waste even a m=
inute in the process.<br>


<br>Born on July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exh=
ibited unusual detachment. She accepted all things with a joyous heart. Jan=
aky was full of devotion to the local deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalaksh=
i, and as she grew in years, Janaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faith=
ful, pure and holy wife of Sri Ram.<br>


<br>In her thirteenth year her un=
cle discussed with Janaky her willingness to marry a doctor who was then th=
irty-two years of age. When told that the widower had two daughters, aged t=
wo and six, Sri Janaky replied, "What of that? That doesn't make m=
uch of a difference and, after all, I like children." Even though her =
parents were not too keen on this matrimonial arrangement because of the ex=
treme age difference, Janaky intuitively felt that the doctor would be help=
ful in the attainment of her goal of Liberation. So in 1919, Sri Janaky mar=
ried Dr. C. S. Ganapathy (known hereafter as 'Doctor'), in a quiet =
ceremony performed before Lord Venkataramana of Tirupathi. The Doctor was o=
ften heard to remark: "Wherever you (Janaky) go, I shall follow you.&q=
uot; And where else could she go, but to God? Living in Tirupathi, Sri Math=
a's devotion to Sri Venkataramana grew steadily.<br>


<br>In 1921, she=
 gave birth to a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the consort of Lo=
rd Venkataramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born, and several =
years later another daughter, Sarada.<br><br>There came a point in her life=
 when she realized: "To none but Him (God) should true love be directe=
d. To turn to the Divine is the only truth in life." From that day on =
she continued to take care of her family and responsibilities but shifted h=
er life's ideal to that of total devotion to God.<br>


<br><span style=
=3D"font-weight:bold">At the age of twenty her daily routine was as follows=
: She read the Gita and other Scriptures until about 1 a.m. every night. Ja=
naky would get up at 5 a.m., finish her ablutions and meditate until 7 a.m.=
 Then she would take a bath, recite hymns while attending to household work=
 for about three hours, and after sending the children to school and the Do=
ctor to work, she would engage herself heart and soul in worship until 1 p.=
m. From 1 to 4 p.m. she was busy looking after the needs of her husband and=
 children. At 4:30 p.m. she would go to the Ladies' Club (which did muc=
h volunteer community service), attend meetings, play tennis and return hom=
e at 7 p.m. Upon returning home she would meditate for an hour before takin=
g her supper of gruel and milk. Though she took very little food, she was h=
ealthy and always cheerful.</span><br>


<br>Although the Doctor was then e=
arning a good salary, owing to various reasons, there was a lack of funds. =
One day before going to bed she prayed to Sri Subrahmanya to keep her caref=
ree by taking on His shoulders the oppressive burden of the family's we=
lfare. The next day, a sannyasi (ascetic) came to her house. She was all al=
one when he said to her, "You were calling me yesterday. I have come f=
rom Palni. Leave to me all your family worries and worship me with a carefr=
ee heart. Whatever is needed for the family - be it money or other needs an=
d necessities of life - will be provided for." He asked her to give hi=
m the promise that she would never forget him. After she agreed, he disappe=
ared.<br>


<br>After this she had many wonderful spiritual experiences and=
 visions of deities, often lasting the whole night.<br><br>Sri Subrahmanya =
came twice more in the disguise of a sannyasi. When Janaky revealed this to=
 the Doctor, he replied with scepticism, "I will believe your words on=
ly if He comes here when I am in." Janaky responded, "If that be =
your desire, let it be so."<br>


<br>The Doctor had just returned for=
 lunch when they both felt a presence outside. Seeing a sannyasi, both Jana=
ky and the Doctor came out and offered him a chair. He took some food and s=
aid, "You wanted me to come when your husband is in, and here I am.&qu=
ot; To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He exhibited some psychic powe=
rs. He asked for another chair and requested Janaky to be seated. She felt =
reluctant to sit on the same level with Him, but he insisted and asked her =
what more she desired. Janaky requested Him to bless her with a Sadguru in =
human form.<br>


<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">What the sannyasi ne=
xt said to her shocked her very much. "I am none none other Subrahmany=
a. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and depth of devotion, I have a=
 longing to be born as a child to you. I will play with you for two years a=
nd then my power will get infused in your heart." Janaky exclaimed, &q=
uot;My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsara (worldlin=
ess) when my desire is to ferry across it." She argued that she would =
not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on fire with =
renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and punished him?=
 What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck and call; she =
would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psychic powers an=
d fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, "Let me b=
e blessed with a Guru."</span><br>


<br>With a smile of His face, Sub=
rahmanya said, "Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if such be your wish, ther=
e is a Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in Tiruvannamalai. You may go an=
d have His darshan." He showed Janaky a photo of Bhagavan Ramana that =
he was carrying. It was the first time that she had heard about Bhagavan Sr=
i Ramana. Saying that he would come again to discuss with her His desire to=
 be born as her child, He disappeared from sight.<br>


<br>Her heart then =
surged with an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She continued with her=
 meditations, worship, household chores and volunteer work. Day by day, Jan=
aky could feel a number of changes happening to her nervous system. Her vis=
ions continued. A severe pain developed in her spine and she became bedridd=
en. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often the heartbeat was fa=
int and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her mind remained peaceful. F=
riends wanted her to be seen by specialists, but the Doctor was sure it was=
 not a disease to be treated medically and that, by the grace of God, she w=
ould be all right. This state continued for forty days and then disappeared=
 as mysteriously as it came.<br>


<br>After a few days, a sadhu appeared b=
efore her and again asked about Subrahmanya being born to her. Again she pl=
eaded that she didn't need obstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu ass=
ured her that, "Begetting a son will in no way shackle you in bondage.=
 There will be no hindrances to your spiritual progress."<br>


<br>Ja=
naky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long ch=
erished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the =
meditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and gracious =
look of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the ne=
ctar flowing through Bhagavan's eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated. =
Her heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of B=
hagavan's Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan =
blessing her.<br>


<br>To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the forml=
ess Arunachaleswara. In the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky kn=
elt before Bhagavan and spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri S=
ubrahmanya's decision to incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her e=
xperience of the all-pervasive nature of the Paramatma and awaited instruct=
ions from Bhagavan as to what she should do next. He said, "Continue d=
oing it in just the same way."<br>


<br>With the infant Swaminathan, =
Janaky and the Doctor returned to Sri Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bha=
gavan in August 1936. For a long time Janaky had been praying for her husba=
nd's spiritual awareness to be aroused so that he might not, at any tim=
e, stand in the way of her spiritual progress. Bhagavan asked both the Doct=
or and Janaky to come before him and he read aloud "Upadesa Saram"=
; (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to follow it. Janaky's heart =
was overflowing with joy.<br>


<br>To quote from Janaky Matha's biogra=
phy:<br><br>".From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, H=
e was her all. She reasoned, 'There is only one thing in the world wort=
h achieving: the root cause of the whole universe, the 'One Without a S=
econd'. I must attain it, realize it and experience it with Bhagavan=
9;s Grace."<br>


<br>Physically and mentally drained by her spiritual=
 experiences, Janaky sought Bhagavan's help in October 1936. At an oppo=
rtune moment, she prostrated before Bhagavan and poured out her heart to hi=
m. She told of her spiritual experiences and begged for his protection and =
the removal of obstacles in her quest for Liberation. She also expressed he=
r fear of becoming deranged because she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan =
replied: "Who told you that you have no Guru? Don't get dishearten=
ed. I am here as your Guru; nothing will upset your mind." With that a=
ssurance, she transferred all her cares and worries to Bhagavan Ramana.<br>=



<br>About a year later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosion =
at the back of her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal cord. S=
he did not think her physical body could withstand it. She said to herself,=
 'Let things take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do what =
is right and good for me.' This state continued for twenty-six days aft=
er which she asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was reluc=
tant at first due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be persua=
ded. Sri Bhagavan's full glance of grace poured forth blessings and str=
ength on her. Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experiences, =
he spoke to her about a similar experience he had had in his early days: &q=
uot;Look here. Don't get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I=
 felt as if I had been bombed from inside at the back of my head."<br>=



<br>The young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said =
to Janaky in a sweet, childish voice, "Mother, see here! That Bhagavan=
 we saw there in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you=
 wherever you go." These words were a source of great consolation and =
joy as Janaky continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.<br>


<br=
>It was January of 1938 when Janaky's body became rigid from her toes u=
pward. She thought she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Rama=
na in the heart. She had many visions and experiences, but the one that cro=
wned all others was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti ascending =
and embracing the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to push upwards and=
 tried to break through the spot in the top of her head. Janaky cried out, =
"What are you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I are inseparable!=
 Against the downpour of the Guru's Grace, you can do me no harm."=
 With this, the force stopped its attempts and bodily feeling returned. She=
 told the Doctor that she had at last been set free from the rounds of birt=
h and death and had attained her long cherished goal. The purpose of her ea=
rthly life was fulfilled.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">By the grac=
e of Bhagavan Sri Ramana, Janaky became a Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at th=
irty-two years of age.</span><br>


<br>Janaky had travelled between Ramana=
sramam and her home whenever she felt the need to be near Bhagavan,=C2=A0<s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">but on January 18, 1938, while visiting Rama=
nasramam, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor was upset=
 and felt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger children were =
grief-stricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she was rev=
elling in a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she remembere=
d the promise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for five mor=
e years. She immediately said she would go back with them to Kakinada. Bhag=
avan gazed at her and said, "Did I ask you to become a sannyasini? Loo=
k at me. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre cloth. You hav=
e only one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all these devotees =
and their families." She knew then that renunciation must be in the he=
art.</span><br>


<br>Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many=
 visions and experiences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle=
 of birth and death. Bhagavan gently said, "Can one get this for the m=
ere asking? It seeks the heart where it wants to shine."<br>


<br>As =
the Doctor and Janaky were preparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor, &q=
uot;You doctors say that the heart is at the left side of the chest. But th=
e whole body is the heart for yogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within a=
nd without." He then gazed at Janaky and again assured her: "I am=
 always with you."<br>


<br>Bhagavan was her All. She desired only to=
 contemplate the Holy Feet of Bhagavan.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-style:ital=
ic">In the months and years that followed, devotees were drawn to Janaky as=
 bees to honey. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. She took a few of t=
hem to Sri Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, "All these people seek m=
e as their Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan,=
 in all humility, to kindly accept these devotees as Bhagavan's discipl=
es."<br>


<br>Bhagavan said, "When you are above likes and disli=
kes, desires and aversions, let things take their own shape. To the extent =
they believe in you, they will reap results. I will protect those who, with=
 full faith, trust in you."</span><br>


<br><span style=3D"font-weigh=
t:bold">Another incident that happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil=
 lamp went out and the hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When the lig=
ht came back, three-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, "The light failed =
and Bhagavan was not visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!&quo=
t; Bhagavan turned to the boy and said, "What you say is precisely cor=
rect. When there is ajnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn =
of jnana (wisdom), He is seen." As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha =
her light of wisdom, she decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashr=
am.</span><br>


<br>Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her =
domestic and social activities. She was elected President of the Child Welf=
are Centre and Vice President of the Ladies' Club. She performed all he=
r actions for God's sake in a supremely detached manner. With equanimit=
y of mind, she saw the Lord in all of the world.<br>


<br><span style=3D"f=
ont-weight:bold">To some people she would advise, "Lead a righteous li=
fe and discharge your duties to the family, conduct family worship, practis=
e charity, have an abundant life and learn to gradually still the waves of =
passion." To others who wanted to know more about Liberation, she taug=
ht, "Always nurture Divine thoughts, obliterate likes and passions and=
 surrender to the Guru."</span><br>


<br>There were times when Sri Ma=
tha was lost in samadhi, oblivious to her surroundings. Food had to be forc=
ed into her mouth for sustenance and she had to be bathed by others, as she=
 was oblivious of her body. At other times she attended to her routine work=
 and concealed her exalted state.<br>


<br><span style=3D"font-style:itali=
c">After the marriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Matha was making final a=
rrangements for a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam. After bowing before B=
hagavan, the ten-year-old Swaminathan poured out his sorrow, weeping bitter=
ly and rolling on the ground. He sobbed, "Pray give us back my mother =
and order her to come with us to Thanjavur."<br>


<br>Bhagavan, with =
a voice choked with emotion said to Sri Matha, "What can I do?" T=
hen turning to Swaminathan said affectionately, "Take your mother and =
go back to Thanjavur." Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan's request a=
nd returned with the Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandra=
n.</span><br>


<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">At Sri Matha's req=
uest the southern portion of the family house remain as an ashram and spiri=
tual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main objective of the cen=
tre is to spread the teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.</span><br>


<br>Moments=
 before her passing away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives chanted Bha=
gavan's hymn Aksharamanamalai, with the refrain of "Arunachala Shi=
va, Arunachala Shiva."<br><br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Sri Ma=
tha's life stands as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal of =
Liberation and devotion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devotees=
 were having a lengthy discussion of Bhagavan's 'Who am I?' enq=
uiry, she halted them saying, "Enough of this discussion! My head begi=
ns to swim with such dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing=
 - to show devotion to Sri Bhagavan."</span>=C2=A0It was through such =
steadfast devotion that Sri Matha achieved Liberation.<br>


<br><span styl=
e=3D"font-weight:bold">"A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware o=
f the fact that he is not the body. But there is one thing more. Unless one=
 looks upon death as a thing that is very near and might happen at any mome=

st vanish, along with the inherent vasanas."=C2=A0</span>- Letters fro=
