Dear Narasimhaji,

Thank you for your reply.

I "think" I can intellectuall=
y understand what you have written but somehow I do not get that feeling or=
 in other words I cannot experience that state.. I can although feel some o=
f the symptoms that you have mentioned. 

And as per your writings I unders=
tand that this has to be permanent state.

Can we have self identification =
with a deity for some time say some minutes or fraction of seconds since Vi=
malananda in his book Aghora mentions that when you do this(some action)=A0=
 then self identify with Shiva.

Also I can understand that everything is B=
rahman but still "I" like to think of various deities like Shiva, Ganesha ,=
 Devi ma , Vishu ji etc while eating or before sleeping. Is this ok ? If no=
t Ok then how can I get rid of such thinking ? 


Thank you,
Manish

            Dear Manish,



> What does self identification =
with a deity means?



Who are *you*? Are you really this body?



One norm=
ally identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes 

with=
 that body. This identification is very very strong.



You are actually Br=
ahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being 

essence of the univer=
se. The same essence manifests as various beings, 

including various deiti=
es and various people, including your own body. And 

*you* really are that=
 essence and not the body. Still you identify only with 

the body.



It i=
s possible to destroy this self identification with the body and 

identify=
 with another object such as a deity. When you identify with a 

deity, you=
r consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, 

though=
ts and actions are those of the deity.



*        *        *

ebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to 

> do ?

First I can tell you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself=
 

that you will now identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you wa=
nt 

to be great. In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact=
, 

until ego completely goes, it is not even possible.



Before you can s=
elf-identify with any deity, first your false 

self-identification with bo=
dy has to cease. You should absolutely not think 

of your body as "I".



=
Your will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva.



Will Shiva thi=
nk of a specific physical body as "I"? No. If a specific 

physical body ha=
s good or bad things happening to it, will Shiva feel 

pleasure or pain? N=
o. If people are praising a specific person, will Shiva 

feel proud? No. I=
f people are attacking and criticizing a specific person, 

will Shiva feel=
 angry? No.



The first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name e=
tc. Reach a 

state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain t=
o the body and 

praise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other=
 people. Reach a 

state where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all =
circumstances.



WHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiv=
a while thinking of 

Shiva.



*        *        *



Ramakrishna Paramaha=
msa could self-identify with not only deities, but 

pretty much any object=
 of the universe. Once he went into deep meditation 

while admiring the be=
auty of grass in the lawn with dew on it. As he was 

absorbed in deep medi=
tation, a bird came and walked on the grass. His 

sishyas observed that so=
me bruises appeared on his body suddenly then!



Best regards,

Narasimha
