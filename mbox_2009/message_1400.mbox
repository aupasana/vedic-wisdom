Namaste Narsimhaji,

This is a great idea about starting these centres.

Na=
rsimhaji,my father is a businessman.He has his factory in Vasai near 
Mumba=
i.In the same premises, but at a little distance he has built a 
LakshmiNar=
ayan temple.The pranpratishtha was a big event some five 
years ago.Regular=
 puja is offered at this temple by a purohit.There is 
a room for the puroh=
it.
There is also a big, permanent open havan kund --like the one you have =

written.We have done a 7-day long MahaVishnu yagya,Bhagvat katha and 
prva=
chan over there.
  What i mean to say is that the infrastructure already ex=
ist.If you 
think this is fine,then please let me know what is to be done f=
urther.

My Father--Kumar Bihari Pandey,is a very spritual person.He has ha=
d 
schooling only till 6 std.He has not read many scriptures,but he 
consid=
ers Narayani as his mother.He has written two books-Hari Anant 
Hari Katha =
Ananta & Narayani.Like you, he too says that he has only 
written what the =
mother spoke to him.He is a real bhakt and 
Karmyogi,and he will be very ha=
ppy to help in any which way.

So Please let me know what you think of this=
.
Regards,
Sunita
