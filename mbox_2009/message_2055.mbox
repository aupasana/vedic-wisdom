Namaste,

In 4th chapter of Chandipath, it is "deevaaH UchuH". When you do sandhi, 
"aaH + U" becomes "aaU", i.e. visarga after "aa" disappeares. So it becomes 
"deevaaUchuH". The visarga at the end (after Uchu) cannot be skipped.

When one pronounces visarga as ha, hi, hu etc (e.g. raamaha, harihi, guruhu, 
devaaha, devyaha, devaihi etc), it may add a letter and break the flow and 
rhythm. If you pronounce visarga correctly, it should not break the flow.

Best regards,
Narasimha
