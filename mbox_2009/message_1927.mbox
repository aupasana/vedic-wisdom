Rama could have perhaps killed Vali in a direct dual. How ever, Vali's styl=
e of fighting is hand-to-hand. So, the fight would not have been an equal o=
ne any way.

Vali was a vanara king but behaved like an animal with out any=
 vichakshana and deserved to be treated like an animal. Rama treated him li=
ke an animal. Rama was not afraid of what others will say about him. He was=
 convinced Vali was equivalent to an animal and he treated him like one.

M=
oral: No matter how reputed and great the person is, the person should be j=
udged by his nature and behaviour.

Best regards,
Vijay

er i still think that Lord Rama was capable of manipulating realm of Maya (=
