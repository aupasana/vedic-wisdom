Namaste,

If you actually understood what I was trying to get at, my point was not 
that this parampara is teaching wrong mantras. My point was that this
parampara was wrong in teaching that there are complex formulas and 
standardization and their knowledge alone is correct and others will get 
results slowly.

Change the mantra to "Om namah shivaaya namah Omkaareshwaraaya". Namah does 
not become namo in this context. What you wrote is grammatically incorrect.

Best regards,
Narasimha
