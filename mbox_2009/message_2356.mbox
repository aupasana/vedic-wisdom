After all, that is what Vivekananda himself did in his formative years! Do 
not accept something unless you understand and *digest* it. Accumulating a 
lot of undigested knowledge causes problems later, just as accumulating a 
lot of undigested food in one's stomach does.

At the same time, be mindful of the fact that a spiritual giant's view may 
be unpalatable to you because of your own limitations, i.e. you may be 
missing something. Give the benefit of doubt and try to understand 
respectfully.

Of course, when it comes to factual inaccuracies, it is a different matter. 
If you know for sure that something a spiritual giant said was a factual 
inaccuracy, you can of course dismiss and ignore it.

An active man like Vivekananda, who accomplished so much in a life of 39 
years, may sometimes use wrong facts at his disposal based on the 
understanding at his time, to advocate what he wanted to advocate. But, 
blessed jnaanis and karma yogis like Vivekananda or Aurobindo would often 
end up advocating correct views even if they use wrong facts occasionally to 
support their views.

If I am not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built around 1000 AD 
or so. I am not sure of what existed in that specific place before.

Best regards,
Narasimha
