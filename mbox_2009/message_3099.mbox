Dear Rajarshi,

Thanks for the information on Wajid Ali Shah.

***
>Islam c=
onsiders Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If >that perfecte=
d man could not have a directed communion with Allah >ever, and needed a Gi=
bril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in >intermediary,

Islaam in nutshell=
 is The life of Prophet Muhammad and writings in Koran. That is the 'Pattha=
r Ki Lakir' for all or most of them. so it may not be difficult to *mugup* =
what is written in one book. so i dont deny that Dr. Naik knows Koran well.=

***
I was told that Allah created beings- first Angel, then Shaytan (FIRE)=
 and finally Man (from Earth element-taken as a best of creation). And then=
 he asked Angel and Shaytan to Salute the Man which was obeyed by Angel but=
 not by Shaytan. Shayatn then on started corrupting minds of Men by influen=
cing them to pray to the statues (images - idolatary) and like wise getting=
 them away from Allah.

I may be little wrong in the above understanding.

I was just joking when i said that we=
 do fire rituals. it was a teasing remark. Fear ki to aisi ki taisi...

You see my=
 reply to Krishnendu about Fanatics and Blind *Faith*. when one keep faith =
in any one book/Man/idea, without understanding or thinking, the earth will=
 have blood shed and reconciliation will only be a day dreaming.

Thank God=
 that Sanatana dharma is not the doctrain of a Single person or book or ide=
a but a collective ocean where many rivers meet and merge. 
 
Best Regards,=


Utpal

 Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for differ=

inns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something like spirits=

impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seperate from th=

ttempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb.

The person who changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C2=A0 =
Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was=
 so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up wi=

n the name of Allah, wake up!". But nothing happened. He tried a few times =
and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, "In my name, wake up!" and the d=
ead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally y=
ou cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and e=
xecuted him.
