Namaste

Following are some lines from Sri Aurobindo's book India's rebirth=
.


"India, the ancient Mother, is indeed striving to be reborn, striving w=
ith agony and tears, but she strives in vain. What ails her, she who is aft=
er all so vast and might be so strong? There is surely some enormous defect=
, something vital is wanting in us, nor is it difficult to lay our finger o=
n the spot. We have all things else, but we are empty of strength, void of =
energy. We have abandoned Shakti and are therefore abandoned by Shakti. The=
 Mother is not in our hearts, in our brains, in our arms.

Is it love, enth=
usiasm, Bhakti that is wanting? These are ingrained in the Indian nature, b=
ut in the absence of Shakti we cannot concentrate, we cannot direct, we can=
not even preserve it. Bhakti is the leaping flame, Shakti is the fuel. If t=
he fuel is scanty how long can the fire endure?...

The deeper we look, the=
 more we shall be convinced that the one thing wanting, which we must striv=
e to acquire before all others, is strength?strength physical, strength men=
tal, strength moral, but above all strength spiritual which is the one inex=
haustible and imperishable source of all the others. If we have strength ev=
erything else will be added to us easily and naturally. In the absence of s=
trength we are like men in a dream who have hands but cannot seize or strik=
e, who have feet but cannot run....

What is our mother-country? It is not =
a piece of earth, nor a figure of speech, nor a fiction of the mind. It is =
a mighty Shakti, composed of the Shaktis of all the millions of units that =
make up the nation, just as Bhawani Mahisha Mardini sprang into being from =
the Shakti of all the millions of gods assembled in one mass of force and w=
elded into unity. The Shakti we call India, Bhawani Bharati, is the living =
unity of the Shaktis of three hundred million people,[3] but she is inactiv=
e, imprisoned in the magic circle of Tamas, the self-indulgent inertia and =
ignorance of her sons....

We have to create strength where it did not exis=
t before; we have to change our natures, and become new men with new hearts=
, to be born again.... We need a nucleus of men in whom the Shakti is devel=
oped to its uttermost extent, in whom it fills every corner of the personal=
ity and overflows to fertilise the earth. These, having the fire of Bhawani=
 in their hearts and brains, will go forth and carry the flame to every noo=
k and cranny of our land."


Beautiful.

-Regards
 Rajarshi
