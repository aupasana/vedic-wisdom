Hello, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I did this course some years back in Lo=
ndon. It was a good experience learning a new type of breathing exercise ca=
lled Sudarshan Kriya. Other things they talked was of no value to me. If yo=
u are a young person and never have done any healing workshops then it will=
 be useful to you.
One of my friend in Delhi has done it. The only thing is=
 when we come back home I could not do the kriya breathing exercise on a re=
gular basis.If you can do it then it can take you deep in meditation very e=
asily.
If you do it let us know how was it.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan
