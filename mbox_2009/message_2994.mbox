Namaste Narasimhaji,

Very often the phatal sruthi of various stotras exten=
d the stotra by quite a bit. I understand the importance of chanting the Ri=
shi, meter bijam, shakti, kilakam, and purpose at the beginning; but is it =
needed to continue on and also recite the phala sruthi in the end? Sometime=
s it is as long as the actual benediction itself. It basically tells of all=
 of the fruits that one would gain by reciting the stotra, auspicious times=
 to do it etc.. Does one lose out if they stop before this part of the stot=
ra?

Regards,
Puneet
