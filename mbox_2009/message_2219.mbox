I live in Kolkata and there is a place 35 kms from here nam=

chinsurah.There is a lady living there who is a devotee of Krishna
in t=

ve also.Just a work of sheer intuition.She studied no books knows no ritual=
s but method of every ritual just comes to her mind.Very few peole know thi=
s trait of her.She detests popularity.I hd seen her working against black m=
agic.She says these thngs must never be done to harm or destroy anything if=
 so the load of Karma is too heavy to bear.for instance a married lady want=
ed to leave her husband and daughter for her lover and she came to this lad=

go to waste.this is not fair and on other hand i cant reject a needy person=
 too so she did some kind of vsikaran to bind the lady to her family inform=
ng hertht this will speed up her leaving process.She told me that that afte=
r this kriya the lady is unable to leave her daughter and husband and go aw=
ay to her lover.A POSITIVE EFFECT OF VASHIKARAN.
