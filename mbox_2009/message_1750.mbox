Namaste,

My wife has brought a murti of Shirdi Sai Baba with her, and I wa=
s hoping on getting some guidance on how to do proper pran pratishta for it=
 when I place it in my small mandir at home. I am following the homam proce=
dures and learning enthusiastically.

Please advise at your convenience. Al=
so, currently, I don't have such a great panchang this year in Toronto, and=
 was wondering if anyone could advise when the guru-pushya-amtrit yog would=
 be occuring in the Northeastern USA or Southern Ontario- Toronto. 

Thanks=
,

Puneet
