To the attention of US based friends, who stay in rented apartments

Namast=
e,

Thanks to Ms. Padmaja and Mr. Ravi for advising where to purchase havan=
 kund.

I stay in a rented apartment. All floors are carpeted. So far, I ha=
d stayed in 3 states and in all the states, the apartments' floors were car=
peted. Fire alarm gets activated if there is a heavy frying in kitchen :( 
=

Can you please advise me how any one (who stays in similar situation like =
mine) performs daily homam? I am very very eager to perform homam and at th=
e same time, I am anxious not to disturb others or create nuisance to other=
s which in turn would cause nuisance to me. 

I look forward for your advic=
es.

Thank you,
Shankar
Detroit, MI 48335 USA
