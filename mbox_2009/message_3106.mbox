Ramakrishna, whom i lovingly address as 'Thakur' is simply Rama=
 and Krishna and no less......

And Kathamruta is THE book which has given =
answers and confirmations to my queries and understandings which haunted me=
 from childhood. When i first tine got the book in my hand and started read=
ing in 2004, I strangely felt that the book seems to be familiar to me.

Wa=

Utpal

 this is a question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that=

Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every s=
tep of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get ne=
cessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in pe=
rson and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an=
 inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the vario=
us AOL courses, Sri Sri's elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Kn=
owledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious =
inner communion with Guru can be established.
