Dear Utpal bhai, namaskarams

In the Ujjayani or Ujjain temple, the bhasma =
arati nowadays is performed
with ash from cowdung cakes and not as the popu=
lar legend goes.
Nevertheless, it is a very thrilling experience and one is=
 almost mesmerized
as the priest sprinkles the ash in a very fluid and ener=
getic manner. I saw
some avadhutas coming to worship the lingam at that tim=
e.

I live about 270 km from Ujjain.

best regards
Hari
