a) Once, a boy was seated in front of Sri Bhagavan. Flies were troubling hi=
m
and he was killing them.

Seeing this Bhagavan told him: =93Don=92t kill =
them; it is wrong.=94 After some
time the boy looked at Bhagavan intensely =
and remarked: =93You say killing is
wrong. I was only killing little flies =
which were giving me trouble, but you
have killed a big tiger and you are s=
itting on its skin. How can it be?=94
Bhagavan laughed and said: =93Yes, wh=
at he says is quite right!=94

b) The same boy had the habit of wasting foo=
d served on his leaf-plate while
seated with others. Once Bhagavan told him=
 that he should not leave anything
on the plate when he finished eating. Th=
at day too the boy could not eat
everything, but stuffed something into his=
 mouth and took out the empty
leaf.

Bhagavan saw him take out the empty le=
af. However, the boy after throwing
away the leaf also spat out the food th=
at he had stuffed in his mouth. It
was reported to Bhagavan. He enjoyed the=
 trick of the boy and gave a hearty
laugh.

c) Another boy who used to go r=
ound the Hill with Sri Bhagavan and other
devotees was always silent, thoug=
h others used to sing hymns and prayers and
chants. (Bhagavan sometimes eve=
n used to hold this boy=92s shoulder while
walking round the Hill.)

One da=
y Bhagavan, after everyone of the party had sung some song or other,
asked =
this boy why he alone did not sing.The boy=92s spontaneous reply made
Sri B=
hagavan laugh to his heart=92s content. It was: =93Do jivanmuktas ever
sing=
?=94

d) The author of Sat Darshana Bhashya, Sri Kapali Sastriar,was very c=
lose to
Sri Bhagavan from his early youth, so much so he was one of the ver=
y few
whom Bhagavan addressed intimately without prefixing or suffixing res=
pectful
terms (Bhagavan was very particular in addressing all, even childre=
n, only
with respect). His parents were very keen to get him married and he=
 himself
was stoutly opposing it. They even approached Bhagavan to persuade=
 him to
marry.

One day, Sri Kapali Sastriar went near Bhagavan and said: =
=93Bhagavan,
tomorrow I intend taking up asrama1 (stage in life).=94 Bhagav=
an, who knew his
aversion to marriage and the anxiety of his parents, was s=
urprised and said
=93Kapali, what are you saying? Have you taken the permis=
sion of your
parents?=94

Meekly he replied: =93Yes, Bhagavan! I am going t=
o enter into the second
asrama1 (meaning, marriage)!=94 Bhagavan laughed he=
artily and enjoyed the
joke.

e) A young girl, named Rukmini, aged ten, the=
 daughter of Vilacheri Ranga
Iyer, used to meditate in front of Sri Bhagava=
n,seated like a statue. Some
older boys or girls sitting next to her used t=
o tickle her to disturb her.

Bhagavan used to watch all these in amusement=
. One day, after having had her
bath,Rukmini, as usual, sat for meditation =
in right earnest (like a yogi). A
boy nearby (who had not had his bath yet)=
 teased her,saying: =93I am going to
touch you.=94 Rukmini firmly replied:
=

=93No one can touch me!=94 Bhagavan was looking at them. She turned to Bha=
gavan
and then asked, =93Yes, none can touch me,they can touch only my body=
. How can
any one touch ME?=94

Bhagavan gave an expression of wonder and a=
ppreciation at the depth of her
statement!

f) Mudaliar Patti, who used to =
feed Sri Bhagavan daily, always tried to
serve more cooked rice to him, by =
making a ball of rice by pressing it hard
into a certain shape.

One day, S=
ri Bhagavan,noticing her trick, commented, =93She is clever.

She feels she=
 could serve me more food through making it appear less. I know
her trick!=
=94 Bhagavan made gestures of her pressing the rice with her hands.
Taking =
the cue, straight came Mudaliar Patti=92s reply: =93Bhagavan! What is
more =
and what is less? There is nothing that is either big or small.

Everything=
 is only our bhavana (thinking).=94 She made similar gestures as
made by Bh=
agavan. Bhagavan enjoyed the joke and remarked, =93See, see! How
well she i=
s giving back to me my own teaching.=94
