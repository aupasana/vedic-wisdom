Dear Shri Acharya ji,

To introduce myself I am another human addition to t=
his spiritual 
network/group of your esteemed selves. 

I am indeed thankfu=
l to Shri Narasimha ji whose message to Smt. 
Rohini Ranjan was a boon to m=
e.

In fact, I read a number of the experiences I read today since 
morning=
 and was moved by some of these.

My own self has been pondering over these=
 issues in the past and 
somehow I reached a conclusion as follows:

God ex=
ists in both form and formless states and even being formless 
in a form an=
d form in a formless state - this was somehow the result 
of such thought p=
rovoking ponderings that I had been able to grow 
spiritually over a period=
 of time since last few years.  Somehow, I 
had to be away from an active a=
strologer's role over last couple of 
years or so due to the karmic bondage=
s and now with god's grace am 
part of this esteemed group of your honoured=
 selves.

Myself is a strong believer of the mantra shakti that energises t=
he 
cosmic environment around ourselves and also strengthens the 
particula=
r part of the body or the overall spiritual evolution of 
the individual or=
 the group and cleanses their karma.

To my understanding, the mantras in S=
anskrit are written in such a 
way that each syllable of a particular mantr=
a and the complete 
mantra thereof energises the visible and non-visible at=
oms in our 
body or the environment around us for us to evolve spiritually.=
  
Tantra is the personification of the mantra in the doable form while 
ya=
ntra is the mechanical form of the same.  May be, there are other 
scholars=
 to comment on the above lines.

Look forward to interact with your kind se=
lves.

With kind regards,
Prakash Kandpal
