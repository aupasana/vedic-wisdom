kBEING ENERGETIC IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS
WORLD'S FIRST MANAGEMENT GURU - CHAN=
AKYA AND HIS TEACHINGS From KAUTILYA'S
ARTHASHASTRA (WRITTEN IN 3RD CENTURY=
 BC) WHICH CAN BE PRACTICALLY APPLIED BY
EACH PERSON EVEN IN MODERN DAY SCE=
NARIO.

-          *Radhakrishnan **=91Chanakya=92 Pillai*

*
*

The first =
requirement for any work in life is being optimistic with a
positive mindse=
t. And if you mix this with the right amount of dynamism, aka
energy, you=
=92re set for success.



Why else do you think all the =91motivational spe=
akers=92 are so well-received
globally? It=92s their workshops that make a =
person who is feeling low in life
all charged up again.



Chanakya brings =
out similar qualities in the Arthashastra as well:

* *

*=93Bravery, resen=
tment, quickness and dexterity =96 these are the qualities of
energy.=94 (6=
.1.5)*

* *

In one line, Chanakya tells us how, in addition to enthusiasm,=
 energy is
important too. He has gone into great detail to make us understa=
nd what
energy means in the above verse.



These points are also leadershi=
p qualities that should be developed by any
person who aspires to be succes=
sful not only in the corporate world but also
in life in totality:



*BRAV=
ERY*

* *

Literally speaking, bravery is =91facing something frightening o=
r unpleasant
in a courageous way=92. A brave person is ready to face life=
=92s unpleasant
events with a strong heart and a tremendous willpower to ca=
rry on.



He is ready to fight and win challenges enroute towards his goal=
. This is
also the most important quality of a Kshatriya =96 the warrior de=
scribed by
all Indian scriptures as well as the Arthashastra too.



*RESEN=
TMENT*

* *

Resentment means anger, hatred and, yes, even bitterness. Now =
this may sound
negative. However, understand that being a little bit unsati=
sfied with our
current status can prod us into achieving the bigger things =
in life.



So be angry with yourself for thinking small. Hate the low ment=
al and vulgar
values that we entertain. Be bitter about the comfort zone we=
 get into.



Push yourself to the next level. This =91positive=92 negativi=
ty adds spice to
life.



*QUICKNESS*

* *

Time is an important commodity =
for success. A person who aspires to be
successful needs to be quick and fa=
st in taking decisions.



When a leader was once asked how to develop the =
quality of quick
decision-making, he answered, =93Be around persons who are=
 not afraid of
making mistakes.=94 So move on in life as fast as you can.

=


*DEXTERITY*

* *

Here, it means the ability to adapt and go on. It=92s b=
est defined by the
famous saying: When the going gets tough =96 the tough g=
ets going. We all
start on a journey, but only a few adapt to and overcome =
problems.



Swami Chinmayananda said, =93There are three kinds of people: =
First, those who
do not start work because of the fear of obstacles. Second=
, those who start
but stop when they face obstacles. And, third, those who =
work inspite of
obstacles and overcome it!=94

* *
Now you decide which cla=
ss you want to belong to.
