Dear Narayan,

That is correct.  That service combines 16 upchaara to both =
idol and fire and I mistakenly assumed that it was only to Ganapati in the =
fire.  The family priest that we had always performed the 16 upchaara puja =
on the idol first and then to Ganapati in the fire so I suggested the link =
but you don't really need it.  Narasimhaji has taken care of everything.
