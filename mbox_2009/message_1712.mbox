Respected Narasimhaji

I have one theoritical doubt about how karma work=
s. From a logical point of view I could not understand one part. Consider t=
he example that you have given. Say A gets cheated by B in one life time, s=
o by the law of Karma, A gets to cheat B in a later lifetime.=A0 If A chose=
s not to cheat B, inspite of all provocations, does it break the cycle of a=
ction/reactions between A and B?
=A0
I mean one person breaking away is eno=
ugh to end the mutual karmas in this regard?
=A0
If two people hate each ot=
her, and one of them decides to end his hate for the other person, but the =
other person does not reciprocate the same feelings, then will the cycle en=
d?
=A0
The more I think about Karma the more I understand it is impossible =
to understand how deep its links flow. No human mind can run that deep.

Happy Akshaya Tritiya to one and all!

Namaste,

If someone is cheating you or hurting you now, there are two thin=
gs 
happening simultaneously:

(1) You cheated or hurt that person in a pre=
vious life. Nature has created a 
situation where it can be paid back. In o=
ther words, Nature has placed that 
person in a position to cheat or hurt y=
ou and tempted him to do so.

(2) That person has succumbed to the temptati=
on, i.e. he has used the 
opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurt=
s you. As he engages in the 
action while identifying with the action ("I a=
m doing it"), he now gets a 
new karma. He will be paid back later.

Both a=
re correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification 
and h=
e is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid 
back=
 for what you did before.

* * *

In order to break out of this cycle, acce=
pt it when somebody does something 
to you. Do not hate the person or pity =
yourself. Don't think "why does it 
have to happen to me". Think only about=
 your current action ("what is the 
best thing for me to do NOW?") and do N=
OT think about what happened, why it 
happened, who did it and how things h=
appening to you are unfair.

The tricky thing is when Nature places you in =
a position to pay back 
somebody else's bad karma and creates a strong temp=
tation for you to do so. 
You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a ba=
d thing to someone! But 
remember one thing. Any thought or action with a s=
ense of doership ("I am 
doing") will create a new karma, even if the other=
 person brought it on 
himself with a previous action.

If you can engage i=
n an action without a sense of doership and surrendering 
the action to the=
 Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is 
very very difficul=
t - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also 
postpone the payba=
ck through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the 
temptation and not=
 do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we live 
in a body, some =
karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion, 
self-control and str=
ong will power will enable one to postpone the most 
troublesome karmas to =
a later time.

When the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and=
 through who is 
not in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others d=
ecide that. So you 
can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you D=
O NOW is to a large 
extent under your control. Use your will power to do t=
he right things.

Best regards,
Narasimha

ed by a friend <BR>>> etc etc are examples of reactions to previous a=
ctions. As long as one's <BR>>> sense of I-ness is bound to a body, N=
ature will continue to deliver <BR>>> reactions to previous actions. =
If one gets an Oscar award as a result of <BR>>> previous good karma,=
 it is not necessary that one should be happy or <BR>>> excited or el=
ated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one's good <BR>>> k=
arma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels <BR=
>>> NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that on=
e should <BR>>> feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from =
Nature to one's bad <BR>>> karma is meaningful only if that reaction =
disappoints him. You cheated <BR>>> someone. Nature will arrange such=
 that that person cheats you now. How
 <BR>>> you feel about it now i=
s not relevant as far as the old action-reaction <BR>>> equation is c=
oncerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does <BR>>> n=
ot stop Nature from doing its job.<BR>>><BR>>> In fact, it is b=
etter that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, <BR>>> one =
is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous <BR>&g=
t;> life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His =
<BR>>> cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if h=
e does it <BR>>> with self-identification with the action, it becomes=
 a new karma for that <BR>>> person. But, that is irrelevant to you).=
 If you just face it calmly and <BR>>> without doing anything, you fi=
nish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose <BR>>> you fight and try =
to stop the person from cheating you. Then your current <BR>>> action=
s would become a NEW karma and
 you will have to face its reaction <BR>>=
> later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, yo=
u <BR>>> have to behave like the person you described below. Accept w=
hatever comes <BR>>> your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but=
 with a calm and relaxed <BR>>> mind. On top of it, keep doing what s=
eems like the right thing to do at <BR>>> the moment, with as little =
self-identification (sense of "I am doing <BR>>> this") as possible. =
As you become better at this, your instincts and <BR>>> judgment will=
 guide you better and show you the right action.<BR>>><BR>>> Be=
