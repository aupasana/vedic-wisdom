Namaste,

Some tips which you may find useful

1) Purchase a Homam Kunda wi=
th a base if available in the Indian Store near your area - there is a vari=
ety of Kunda available which has a square base at the bottom which is prote=
cted from the Kunda which has the agni.  Sometimes the Indian Store will ca=
rry a specialized base of granite or other stone to act as Homam Kunda base=


2) If the above is not available, try putting a regular Homam Kunda in be=
tween two bricks or tiles or you can even put a copper plate underneath the=
 homam.  

3) Under the Homam Kunda and the base or copper plate for added =
protection keep silver foil to catch material which drops out by mistake an=
d to protect carpet

4) Dry coconut alone produces least smoke.  Hawan Sama=
gri and Hawan Wood are good but they will create smoke so if you plan to us=
e the latter make sure you have adequate ventilation.  If you live in a col=
d place and the rooms are closed then dry coconut may be best

5) With dry =
coconut, smoke only comes in the end when the coconut is fully burned by th=
e Homam Agni.  By experience you will know when that is about to happen and=
 just before then you can take the Homam Kunda and place it in a place outs=
ide.  I live in a place which gets lots of snow around the year so I take t=
he Homam Kunda to the outside patio just before it extinguishes and gives o=
ut maximum smoke

Regards

Veenu
