Namaste!

Dhanyawaad!

The path can be difficult. However, it just appears =
joyless. The idea of Sadhana is to make is joyful beyond anything that we h=
ave ever enjoyed. That is what makes it difficult.

That is my personal exp=
erience too. Many a times, I start Sadhana for any reason that comes out of=
 my grief, sorrow, fear, anger etc. Initially I find it helping and cosolin=
g till I am out of this negative emotions. Slowly then I see that my emotio=
ns move towards feeling overproud about doing Sadhana and then losing inter=
est and hence feeling bored or forced by my pride to do it. But that is not=
 what Sadhana is. Many Sant have said that, the mahima of Mantra or Naam is=
 such that, one feels doing it again and again. That is where I see my fail=
ure as Sadhak. I have never experienced it this way. They say that you need=
 Gurukripa for that.

Doing it without joy is like Hath Yoga. It will still=
 give the result gradually but definitely.

Namaskar,

Jagmohan

ry, I always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right for a non =
Indian language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to explain =
it to an Indian language speaking person. For example - In "Shivaay Nama:" =
and "Nama: Shivaay", there is a subtle difference in the pronounciation of =
"Nama:". In the first one "ha" of the visarga ":" is to be pronounced compl=
etely while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar ":" (no "h=
a"). Now you can understand why I say that it is difficult to explain.
