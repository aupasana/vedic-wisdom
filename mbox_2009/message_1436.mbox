Dear Utpal,

I would not deny this fact that i asked the question of perfor=
ming homam from everyside keeping in mind the statement made by vijayji..I =
am a normal humanbeing..and desires are thre in me.. 

Honestly i do homam =
everyday .. and=A0 each day i find different experience... i have been doin=
g this homam since past few months.. and since past few days i am doing eve=
ryday.. i keep it a point .. to not to miss a single day... and see the mag=
ic.. inspite of my busy schedules i can devote atleast 40 to 45 minutes eac=
h day for this homam and that had made difference to my life.. sometimes af=
ter doing homam my feelings are so great.. sometimes average.. sometimes it=
 is not good also.. why? i think it all depends on your state of mind at th=
e time of homam.. right? whatever may be the case, i do it everyday and i w=
ill do it in future also..

But,=A0 worldly pleasures=A0 like fame, power, =
materialistic welfare attracts me still.. and i tend to think that way.. it=
 seems that still i have not reached to that stage where nothing would attt=
ract me.. but i am sure most of us would be having similar kind of feelings=
..sometimes i am worried.. if i am doing homam, then this kind of desires s=
hould not come to my mind.. but it comes.. then i feel that i am not giving=
 my 100% to it.. or i am lacking sadhna.. i am lacking dedication...What co=
uld be the reason? what should i do to come out of this?

Regards,

Rajesh

Why are you asking such difficult questions?:? (.



Yesterday, i didn't=
 have fruit for Bali. I took out some Kishmish in my palm from a packet ful=
l of Kishmish. It was 8 in Nos. i used 6 for bali and 2 were put in to nirm=
aalya bag.



by the way if you are using fruit for Bali, then why you don'=
t try to make 6 pieces out of the fruit? so that nothing needs to be despos=
ed off. just a suggetion.



***

>Can we do mahaganapathi homam by sitting=
 in different directions?. . >Like i have heard that each direction  has it=
s own importance.. 



I know why you have asked this question. it is becau=
se vijay gave the following details some time back.

 

East: Spiritual pro=
gress

West: Fame

South: Longevity/Health (Yama)

North: Money (Kubera)


=

Bhai Paisa no ke Prasidhhi no vichar chhe ke Shu?. this is a problem Raju.=
 Vijay gave this details as an answer to clarify some query but see it has =
created a kind of motives other than spiritual progress, in many of us. now=
 this thing will keep on lingering in our mind for long unless we merciless=
ly remove it. even Narasimha mentioned few days back that Mamara is for Mon=
ey, White til for Spiritual progress etc.. and that was also sufficient for=
 creating ripples.



Narsimha, in his mnual, has categorically mentioned t=
his (I don't know if he wish to revisit and change that)-



[

Similarly, =
you have to be careful if you perform a homam for certain material goals (s=
uch as

getting money, attracting someone, destroying someone etc). If you =
perform a homam just to

show your love to god, cleanse yourself spirituall=
y and make yourself worthy of divine

communion, then there are no risks. T=
he procedure taught in this document is based on the

teachings of rishis a=
nd it is safe for anybody to use. Small mistakes will not result in any

pu=
nishment.

In fact, it is expected that everybody who uses this document is=
 interested in only the second

kind of goal, i.e. spiritual cleansing and =
upliftment

]



BUT important thing is that, the knowledge provided by Nar=
asimha and vijay about Different materials for Aahuti and Direction respect=
ively, can be used for *other Jan Hitaay*. i mean don't use it for ourself =
but can be used for a person who is dire difficulty of Finance/Health etc..=
. for example, if you know somebody who is in a trouble due to financial cr=
isis, you can suggest him to do some japa facing North Direction. for healt=
h matters, south direction can be suggested and finally thinking 'Neki kar =
aur dariya me dal' or 'Krishnarpana' or 'Shivarpana' :)



I asked the same=
 question to my guru initially. he told me that when i perform atleast 10 h=
oma myself and become proficient in the ritual then i may think of performi=
ng it at other's home. You can ask your friends to join you and sit while y=
ou are performing the homam at you house. if they are really intrested they=
 will come and then leave it to Mahaganapati. if he wishes, they will also =
start taking serious intrest.



lastly, Narasimha can answer you better fo=
r all the questions.



Warm Regards,



Utpal
