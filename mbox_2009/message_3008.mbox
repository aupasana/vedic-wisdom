 A devotee: Revered Sir, what happens after death?

Ramakrishna: Keshab Sen asked me the same question.So long as a man remains
in ignorance, in other words,so long as he has not realized God, he will be
subject to rebirth; but after Divine realization one does not come back to
this earth, nor is he born in any other world.

Potters after making earthen pots dry them in the sun. Have you not seen
that there are pots which are baked in fire and others that are unbaked?
When a pot of unbaked clay is broken, the potter uses the same clay to make
a new pot; but if a baked pot is broken, the pieces are of no further use
and he throws them away.

Similarly, when the ego is not baked in the fire of wisdom, after death it
will appear in another form and be born again and again. If a fried grain is
planted .it will not germinate; in the same manner, he whose inner nature is
fried in the fire of wisdom is no longer subject to evolution, but attains
to absolute freedom from rebirth. [p. 278]
