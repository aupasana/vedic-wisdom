Jay Shri Krashana Amit Bhai,

you did not provide wrong information. Niti S=
hataka was also from 
*Bharathri* - (No spelling mistake here- My Grandma u=
se to 
pronounciate like that).

***
Few beings are considered Chiranjivis =
in our sanaatan Dharma. as you 
mentioned - Parshuraam, Aswatthama. i'll ad=
d Hanumaan ji to it.

I don't remember exactly but my grand father mentione=
d to me in my 
childhood, Bhartuhari's name also in the same batch of chira=
njivis. 
but not sure.
i didn't mention his name as one of the chiranjivis =
because you said 
that he gives darshan some times to some saadhaka. i just=
 mentioned 
it becuase, his name was discussed and i had some information o=
r mis 
information. I know:) that one need not be a chiranjivi (as per our =

classical text) to grant darshana to some modern aspirants. by the 
way no=
 body has visited me with sookshma sharira yet so i've no 
experience of th=
at.

warm regards,

utpal

 A small clarification-I have not meant to say Raaja Bhartruhari is 
the Ch=
ranjiva like Bhagwan Parashuraama or Sri Sri Ashwathaamaa- I 
have mentione=
d that many believe that R.B.still roams in India and
