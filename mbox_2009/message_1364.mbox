Dear Rajarshiji,
Though resp.Narsimhaaji and other scholars on this forum a=
re better off commenting on this - a quick line from an unqualified one lik=
e me :
Sadaashiva is not the destroyer form of the TRIDEVA . 
Sadaashiva is=
 the divine entity mentioned in Vedas and is the Omniscient,Omnipresent and=
 Omnipotent formless being -Tejomaya swarup who can take forms as He wishes=
. 
I do not know but IMHO- Believers think that Sadaashiva is greater than =
the greatest and is impervious(virakta-udaasin) to the presence of attendan=
t Devatas-like if they are there fine .... Of course the attendant Devatas =
will always be there but may be keeping a respectful distance.

I think Bha=
irava is one of the forms of Shiva and He is akin to Mahaakaala-the Supreme=
 Yogi and renouncee in timeless form.Bhairavaji surely has many attendants-=
maybe those divine forces who want to absolve the last traces of their Taam=
asika bhava in the divine precsence of Bharavaji.
There maybe errors in my =
understanding and the Learned scholars may speak on this fascinating subjec=
t of Sadaashiva and Bhairava.

Humble regards,
amit=A0 =A0

Namaste Rajarshi ji,

Yes, I supp=

aahuti to Parivaar de=
