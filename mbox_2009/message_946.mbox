Dear Sir,
Certain words I can not understand properly as these words are ne=
w for me. In your reply you have written that ....
"If we invoke a specific=
e deity in fire and worship him and then offer Ahutis...."
Here what is the=
 meaning of Invoking? If the meaning is inviting then I am not doing that. =
Directly I am starting homam with Adhaar Ahutis of Surya, Prajapati, Indra,=
 Agni and soma. Then directly giving 12 ahutis of Maha Ganapati Mantra, the=
n immediately 24 Gayatri Mantra for=C2=A0Gayatri and like one by one in con=
tinuance. Specially I am not inviting any deity in fire. Some confusion cre=
ated in my mind so this clarification is needed Sir.

Dr.Ashwin Rawal

There is no need to say that. Jus=

=C2=A0
Saying "t=

Dear Sir,
One more question for Homam.
Suppose I am giving 12 Ahuti=
s daily to Maha Ganpati with (Aum, Shrim, Hrim Klim.....Vashamanay a Swaha)=
 Maha Ganapati Mantra, is it necessary that I have to speak - Idam Maha Gan=
apataye, Idam Na Mama -=C2=A0after each Ahuti?=C2=A0=C2=A0
Or=C2=A0 It is O=
K if=C2=A0 I give 12 Ahutis first with the Mantras only and I will speak -I=
dam Maha Ganpataye,Idam Na Mama - only once at the last after 12th Ahuti is=
 completed?

t; Namaste Dheeraj,<BR>> You can use as much quantity of offerings as yo=
u want, as <BR>long<BR>> as the offerings are properly consumed in the f=
ire. It <BR>all boils down to<BR>> the amount of fire that is present in=
 the homa kunda. If <BR>there is good<BR>> amount of fire, even if you d=
o not offer ghee, offering <BR>marmara , havan<BR>> samagri etc will be =
easily consumed. But if the fire is <BR>small, then you<BR>> do need to =
offer ghee drops to keep the fire alive.<BR>> There were days when I use=
d about 8-10 coconut halves for <BR>1<BR>> chandi homam, ie started with=
 2 pieces of 1 coconut half, <BR>adding half<BR>> piece of coconut half =
for each chapter and finally a <BR>piece for<BR>>
 purnahuti. Now, I am =
able to manage 1 chandi homa with <BR>about 2-3 coconut<BR>> halves. Oth=
ers out there might be able to do with much <BR>less. It also<BR>> depen=
ds on the coconut pieces itself, some pieces burn <BR>slow and some<BR>>=
 fast, so the quantity you may need may vary.<BR>> Most importantly I su=
ggest you follow an important advice <BR>of<BR>> Narasimhaji. Pouring gh=
ee drops around the corners of the <BR>coconut piece,<BR>> making sure t=
he piece catches fire from all the corners. <BR>Doing this way,<BR>> at =
the end of the homa, all the coconut pieces are <BR>completely burnt,<BR>&g=
t; almost like powder.<BR>> So, my suggestion to you is to have plenty o=
f offerings <BR>at your<BR>> disposal, try to keep the fire going ( big =
or small does <BR>not matter). <BR>> Make sure the offerings that you pu=
t with each swaha <BR>(sloka) catch fire.<BR>> Hold your offerings ie ha=
van samagri, marmara, poha etc <BR>joining
 your<BR>> ring finger, middl=
e finger and thumb. This way, you will <BR>be offering<BR>> decent amoun=
t with each swaha.<BR>> Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan s=
amagri, <BR>black and<BR>> white sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a con=
tainer and <BR>used the<BR>> combination as offering.<BR>> I am sure =
within first few days of your homa, you will <BR>have very<BR>> good ide=
a of how much ghee and other offerings you need <BR>to make.<BR>> <BR>&g=
