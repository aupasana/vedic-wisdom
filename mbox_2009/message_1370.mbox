Namaste Ashwin Saab,
        Around the same time, you sent out this email, I was also thinking about the group members, but in a slightly different way.  I have created an account to upload pictures of the members. Interested members, please email your picture with full name and current location (City,State,Country) to my email address separately.  I will upload the pictures.

Here are a couple of pictures at this location:

Dear Forum Members,
If you consider my humble request, please give your introduction with your present location so that we can recognise each and every writer where he is writing from. e.g. Narsimhaji is from Boston USA and Utpalji from Dubai. But I don't know anything about other active members who are taking part in discussions. This will give a clear idea while reading the mail that who is he and where he is writing from.  This is like a family Forum and we need to know each other. if you agree to my view. 
I am Dr. Ashwin Rawal (age 61) from Ahmedabad, a retired Govt. Officer and a Columnist in Newspapers doing practice on Astrology and Homoeopathy (freely now.)

Jay Shri Krashana Amit Bhai,

you did not provide wrong information. Niti Shataka was also from 
*Bharathri* - (No spelling mistake here- My Grandma use to 
pronounciate like that).

***
Few beings are considered Chiranjivis in our sanaatan Dharma. as you 
mentioned - Parshuraam, Aswatthama. i'll add Hanumaan ji to it.

I don't remember exactly but my grand father mentioned to me in my 
childhood, Bhartuhari's name also in the same batch of chiranjivis. 
but not sure.
i didn't mention his name as one of the chiranjivis because you said 
that he gives darshan some times to some saadhaka. i just mentioned 
it becuase, his name was discussed and i had some information or mis 
information. I know:) that one need not be a chiranjivi (as per our 
classical text) to grant darshana to some modern aspirants. by the 
way no body has visited me with sookshma sharira yet so i've no 
experience of that.

warm regards,

utpal
