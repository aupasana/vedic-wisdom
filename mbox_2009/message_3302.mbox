I don't know what happened. After sending the message, I get blank message =
ad lost all the matter that I typed. So, I am re-typing. 

Sri Narasimha's =
explanation on this thread is brilliant, as it is always. I began beleiving=
 that he is a great Sadhaka as well, since his words inspire me a lot. I al=
so started fearing as to how much bad karma I am accumulating by consuming =
this commercial milk from SamsClub / Walmart and so on grocery stores withi=
n the US. Although the organic milk is available in the US, it is so much m=
ore expensive and unaffordable to me, to buy on a regular basis. And my fat=
e is such that I even do the abhishekam to my Lord, SadaShiva, using the sa=
me milk, every monday. What is the way out? Is there a way we can get rid o=
f this bad karma that we keep accumulating every day, knowlingly some/unkno=
wingly some? Is there a way we can measure the amount of bad karma we alrea=
dy have and do appropriate remedies? I know constantly doing Sandhyavandana=
m, regularly doing Homam, Mantra japam etc. is one way, but how to measure =
how much you need to do to get rid of the bad karma and how to avoid accumu=
lation of new bad karma?

Also, is consumption of alcohol (social drinking =
or otherwise) also a bad karma and if so, is it as bad as or worse than con=
suming non veg food? I know most puranas strongly advise against any consum=
ption of alcohol, but there are no strict dos and donts on anything in our =
Vedantic Tradition, in my opinion. I could be wrong and ready to be correct=
ed.

Various deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were experimented by man=
y great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. If you want to tie=
 a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope was tested before=
, it may be good to use that rope.

self-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, one can exp=

nds. Sanskrit captures that well.

 How can milk be considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely bein=
g and is worshiped as `Kamadenu'. But in actual sense we are extracting mil=
k and preventing the calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin=
 to stop a young calf from having milk from its mother?

> >

2. How can silk cloth be considered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by=
 killing thousand's of cocoon. Using a product which is obtained by killing=
 so many living beings and we being a cause for such an action...Are we not=
 doing sin?
