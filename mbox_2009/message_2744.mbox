  Well, you are 2 years young=
er to me.
  You misunderstand the path of knowledge. What you think is deep=
 knowledge was acquired, when I thought of writing an answer to Narasimhas'=
 mail on "Gyan Marg". It is not even a week old!

> What is your aim throug=
h this long discussion.Is it that you are

   Do you think that the knowledge of "my intention for discussion", w=
ill help you reach God faster ? Are you sure, this is what you really want =
to know ?

> For as far as I can understand  these knowledge will not take =
you

  But, then you don't know everything. Right.

> Whats the=

> we will know everyt=
hing.

  Probably, You have not seen another person suffer because you didn=
't know something.

> Friend is not we taking the opposite way- Patanjali,Y=
ogananda and

 we are discussing these things before realising God.

  How to find out wh=
at is opposite way ? How do you know that all these Patanjali etc. didn't d=
iscuss these things before and after they attained God-realization ?

> If =
you had my friend realised God even if you said wrong in this

 because of HIS blessings.

  How many times has Gods' blessings done this =
kind of a thing for you that you are so sure of it being a criteria for ass=
essing another persons' level of God-realization ?

> Dont take whatever I =
said in some other way .Just was thinking

> Pardon me if I hurt anyones feelings.

 =
 And what have you said anyways ? 
  Long discussions are circular, they do=
n't go anywhere :).
  You are Pardoned!

  Addendum -
1.  God-Realization m=
eans different things to different people.
2.  For some, it is the be-all a=
nd end-all of all their lifes' pursuits, for others it is the beginning.
3.=
  If God gives me a better work, I might't be writing mails.

Regards,
Niti=
