>Vali had a boon
If I remember correct, Indra gifts him a mala which when h=
e wears, will give him victory in a dual.

Vali does not fight with Ravana =
- Vali takes bath in the 7 seas  and does prayers. Ravana goes and challeng=
es him. Vali feels disturbed but does not want to fight at that time as he =
is praying mood. So, he grabs Ravana puts him under his arm and continues h=
is routine. Ravana tries hard to get out of the grip but fails. Realising t=
he strength of Vali, he requests to be accepted as his friend.

However, I =
agree with all other points.

Best regards,
Vijay

when Narasimha says that Rama realised his true nature later (During Vasish=

during some course of events and acted against dharma or Maryaada. Bali's e=
pisode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama's Maryaada and conduct is qu=
estioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event, Sita's Agniparik=

ere will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and events a=
re just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions. howe=
ver people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above events f=
or which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali's killing, i may=
 say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way he was=
 killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against Dharma=
 towards his brother. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on him=
self in the later life during Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use of a=
