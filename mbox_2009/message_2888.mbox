1] Rahu homam manual will be created in time. Homam with the veda man=
tra <br>
"kayaanschitra" was suggested by Maharshi Parasara for r=

with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaasa's poura=
anika mantra "ardha kaayam". I <br>
will try to create Rahu and K=
etu homam manuals soon.<br>
<br>
2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of=
 Rahu mantra, one can pray to <br>
Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as=
 "Devi Maahaatmyam" (glory of the <br>
goddess) or "Durga sa=
ptashati" (Durga's 700) or "Chandipath" (chanting of <br=

Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not fluent in Sanskrit and not willing t=
o <br>
try at all can try Durga/Chandi saptashloki, which is a collection o=
f 7 <br>
representative verses out of those 700.<br>
<br>
It is possible to=
 do a simple homam by using the Chandi homam manual on the <br>
website bel=
ow and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) for pradhaana homam. <br>
Just in=
voke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaaras, offer one aahuti to her <br>
=
parivaara devatas and then keep offering these 7 verses over and over, as <=
br>
many times as you can.<br>
<br>
One can also pray to Lord Venkaeswara o=
r Balaji for relief from Rahu <br>
problems.<br>
<br>
