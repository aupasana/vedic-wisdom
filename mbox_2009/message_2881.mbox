VARIETIES OF JAPA

Repeat the Mantra verbally for sometime, in a whisper fo=
r sometime, and mentally for sometime. The minds wants variety. It gets dis=
gusted with any monotonous practice. The mental repetition is very powerful=
. It is termed Manasika Japa. The verbal or loud repetition is called Vaikh=
ari Japa. The loud Japa shuts out all worldly sounds. There is no break of =
Japa here. Repetition in a whisper or humming is termed Upamshu Japa. Even =
mechanical repetition of Japa without any Bhava has a great purifying effec=
t on the heart or the mind. The feeling will come later on when the process=
 of mental purification goes on.

Write down daily in a notebook your Ishta=
 Mantra or Guru Mantra for half an hour. When you write the Mantra, observe=
 Mouna. Write the Mantra clearly in ink. On Sundays and holidays, write thi=
s for one hour. This is Likhita Japa You can develop a wonderful power of c=
oncentration.

The benefits of Mantra-writing or Likhita Japa cannot be ade=
quately described. Besides bringing about purity of heart and concentration=
 of mind, mantra-writing gives you control of Asana, control of Indriyas, p=
articularly the sight and the tongue, and fills you with the power of endur=
ance. You attain peace of mind quickly. By prolonged and constant practice =
the inherent power of the Mantra (Mantra-Sakti) will be awakened, which wil=
l fill your very existence with the Divinity of the Mantra.

In Mantra writ=
ing, there is no restriction about any particular script. It may be written=
 in any language.
