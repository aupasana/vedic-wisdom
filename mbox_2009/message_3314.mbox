 One day, one of the devotees came to Bhagavan and said in an excited
whisp=
er, "Look, Bhagavan! Just look at that man!"

Everyone turned to look. We s=
aw a gentleman who was asleep, swaying back and
forth. The gentleman who ha=
d approached Bhagavan complained, "I have been
watching him for the past fe=
w days. He always sleeps in Bhagavan's
presence."

Bhagavan looked at the d=
evotee and said, "That man is doing what he came
here to do. But what about=
 you? Did you come here just to check on people,
and see who is awake and w=
ho is asleep? Why don't you mind your own
business?"

Seeing the overzealou=
s devotee rebuked like this, all the others burst out
laughing.

Bhagavan d=
id not like it at all when people complained about others. He used
to say t=
hat as long as a person concentrated on the work he was engaged in,
he woul=
d not even notice what others were doing. One can find the time to
criticiz=
e others only when one's attention wandered from the work at hand.
