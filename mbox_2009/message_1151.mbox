Namaste Sir......=
.....

I too have the same type of confusion as you regarding malas, etc
an=
d as I have some familiarity with jyotish I have extendend my 
madness to p=
icking the absolutely perfect muhurta for performing my 
irregularly schedu=
led homa.  You see I want spiritual growth and I 
want to 'get something' o=
ut of it as well, and subsequently the homas 
where I was very attached to =
getting something were tinged with my 
desire and the quality of my concent=
ration suffered. The same with 
the malas, I think that some 'thing' is goi=
ng to ensure my success in 
a sadhana when actually my willingness to drop =
the attachment and the 
confusion that always seems to attend my selfish de=
sires, and focus 
on the sadhana itself is the key.

I know you had asked N=
arasimha, but I felt a certain kinship with 
your dilema.

Best Regards....=
