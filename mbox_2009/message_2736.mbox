Proof by Contradiction

Wrong example.

A p=

ara is needed. Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in beyond the death for a no=
rmal human being. Therewfore, Ahamkara is present in the astral/casual plan=
e as well.


Corollary #1:
A Devata as an Astral-being has I-ness due to hi=

|| OM TAT SAT ||
Dear=
 Narasimha and Sundeep,

Thanks for your feedback. I thought, I had written=
 a quite clear and explicit mail, but your reply has proved that it needs t=
o be put down in at least 10-fold simpler words.

You read my mail, but pic=
ked up notions in an incorrect, incoherent manner, and are reading beyond w=
hat is written in my mail.

To prove my point, I would ask Sundeep to read =
my previous mail on "Gyan Marg" followed by your reply and see if he also p=
icks up the notions in the same manner as you did ?

The only addition requ=
ired is an example:

Your hypothesis
Ahamkara is the only I-ness there is f=
or all the beings in all the 3 cosmoses i.e. all the Physical, Astral and C=
ausal-bodied beings.

Proof by Contradiction
A person who lives as a farmer=
, should, after death, remain a farmer in the astral cosmos, and after subs=
equent astral death, should be reborn as the same farmer with the same name=
 and same identity as in his previous earthly incarnation.
This is not the =
case, people don't even remember what they were in previous birth, and star=
t their life afresh in a new earthly body
=3D> Contradiction 
=3D> the orig=
inal hypothesis is wrong 
=3D> Ahamkara is not the only sense of I-ness app=
licable to all beings in all the 3 cosmoses.

Inference #1:
=3D> Ahamkara i=
s dominant sense of I-ness in Physical Cosmos.
=3D> Manas is dominant sense=
 of I-ness in Astral Cosmos.
=3D> Chitta is dominant sense of I-ness in Cau=
sal Cosmos.

Corollary #1:
A Devata as an Astral-being has I-ness due to hi=
s Manas, and doesn't have Ahamkara for the work done by him in all the vari=
ous physical bodies.

Inference #1 and Corollary #1 is what I had written i=
n my previous mail on this topic.

There are many other ways to prove the c=
ontradiction on this hypothesis (e.g. Powers of beings in physical cosmos <=
 those in astral cosmos < those in causal cosmos).

Your made two additiona=
l points that are also invalid. My comments on that is:

1. I-ness derived =
from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other ide=
a of the 35 Causal-ideas.
Reason:
Soul is the only Truth and controller, ev=
erything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas c=
o-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. 

2. A new-born chi=
ld or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness c=
oherently due to the astral-bodys' sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that=
 coordinates the senses.
He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to inte=
ract with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have p=
roposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness=
, not due to Buddhi.

I hope this clarifies.

Regards,
Nitish

Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, d=

independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - oth=

the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related=

of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not "control=

 of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because "What =

 Essentially, the 35 ideas of c=
ausal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect =
to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of=
 I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ide=
as, their functioning as well as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived=
" in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those wi=
th sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, becau=

; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/cau=
sal cosmoses, it doesn't apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Caus=
al-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human a=
ctivities. Thus, what is "the very
