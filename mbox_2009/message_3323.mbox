 Letter 109

10th April, 1947

This morning, an Andhra youth handed over a =
letter to Bhagavan in which it
was written: =E2=80=9CSwamiji! They say that=
 one can obtain everything if one takes
refuge in God wholly and solely, an=
d without thought of any other. Does it
mean sitting still at one place, an=
d contemplating God entirely at all
times, discarding all thoughts, includi=
ng even about food which is essential
for the sustenance of the body? Does =
it mean that when one gets ill, one
should not think of medicine and treatm=
ent, but entrust one=E2=80=99s health or
sickness exclusively to Providence=
? From the definition of sthitha prajna
given in Gita, (II:71):

The man wh=
o sheds all longing and moves without concern, free from the sense
of =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, he attains peace.

=E2=80=9CIt=
 means the discarding of all desires. Therefore should we devote
ourselves =
exclusively to the contemplation of God, and accept food, water,
etc. only =
if they are available by God=E2=80=99s grace, without asking for them? Or
d=
oes it mean that we should make a little effort? Bhagavan! Please explain
t=
he secret of this saranagathi.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan saw that letter leisurely=
 and told the people near him: =E2=80=9CLook! =E2=80=98Ananya
saranagathi=
=E2=80=99 means to be without any attachment of thoughts, no doubt, but
doe=
s it mean to discard thoughts even of food and water, etc., which are
essen=
tial for the sustenance of the physical body? He asks, =E2=80=98should I ea=
t
only if I get anything by God=E2=80=99s direction, and without my asking =
for it? Or
should I make a little effort?=E2=80=99 All right! Let us take i=
t that what we have
to eat comes of its own accord. But even then, who is t=
o eat? Suppose
somebody puts it in our mouth, should we not swallow it, at =
least? Is that
not an effort? He asked, =E2=80=98If I become sick, should I=
 take medicine or should
I keep quiet leaving my health and sickness in the=
 hands of God?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Kshudvyadeh aaharam=E2=80=99, it is said.=
 There are two meanings to this. One is,
since kshuth, i.e. hunger, is also=
 like sickness, so for the sickness called
hunger, the medicine called food=
 must be given; the other is: like medicine
for vyadhi (sickness), food for=
 kshuth (hunger) must be given.

In the book Sadhana Panchaka written by Sa=
nkara, it is stated,
kshudvyadhischa chikitsyatam pratidinam bhikshoushadha=
m bhudyatam=E2=80=99. It
means, for treatment of the disease called hunger,=
 eat food received as
alms. But then, one must at least go out for bhiksha.=
 If all people close
their eyes and sit still saying if the food comes, we =
eat, how is the world
to get on? Hence one must take things as they come in=
 accordance with one=E2=80=99s
traditions and must be free from the feeling=
 that one is doing them oneself.
The feeling that I am doing it is bondage.=
 It is therefore necessary to
consider and find out the method whereby such=
 a feeling can be overcome,
instead of doubting as to whether medicine shou=
ld be administered if one is
sick or whether food should be taken if one is=
 hungry; such doubts will
continue to come up and will never end. Even such=
 doubts as, =E2=80=98May I groan if
there is pain? May I inhale air after e=
xhaling?=E2=80=99 also occur.

Call it Ishwara or call it karma =E2=80=94 s=
ome Karta will carry on everything in
this world according to the developme=
nt of the mind of each individual. If
the responsibility is thrown on him (=
the Karta), things will go on of their
own accord.

=E2=80=9CWe walk on thi=
s ground. While doing so, do we consider at every step
whether we should ra=
ise one leg after the other or stop at some stage? Isn=E2=80=99t
the walkin=
g done automatically? The same is the case with inhaling and
exhaling; no s=
pecial effort is made to inhale or exhale. The same is the
case with this l=
ife also. Can we give up anything if we want to or do
anything as we please=
? Quite a number of things are done automatically
without our being conscio=
us of it.Complete surrender to God means giving up
all thoughts and concent=
rating the mind on Him. If we can concentrate on
Him, other thoughts disapp=
ear. If mano-vak-kaya karmas, i.e., the actions of
the mind, speech and bod=
y are merged with God, all the burdens of our life
will be on Him. Lord Kri=
shna told Arjuna in the Gita: (IX:22)

To those men who worship Me alone, t=
hinking of no other, to those ever
harmonious, I bring full security and at=
tend to their needs.

=E2=80=9CArjuna had to do the fighting. So Krishna sa=
id, =E2=80=98Place all the burden on
Me, do your duty; you are merely an in=
strument. I will see to everything.
Nothing will bother you.=E2=80=99 But t=
hen, before one surrenders to God, one should
know who it is that surrender=
s. Unless all thoughts are given up there can=E2=80=99t
be surrender. When =
there are no thoughts at all, what remains is only the
Self. So surrender w=
ill only be to one=E2=80=99s Self. If surrender is in terms of
bhakti, the =
burden should be thrown on God, and if it is in terms of karma,
karma shoul=
d be performed until one knows one=E2=80=99s own Self. The result is the
sa=
me in either case.

Surrender means to enquire and know about one=E2=80=99s=
 own Self and then remain in
the Self. What is there apart from the Self?=
=E2=80=9D

That young man said, =E2=80=9CWhat is the path by which it can b=
e known?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan replied: =E2=80=9CIn the Gita several paths are=
 indicated. You are asked to
do dhyana. If you are not able to do it, then =
bhakti or yoga or nishkama
karma. Many more have been indicated. And one of=
 the paths must be
followed. One=E2=80=99s own self is always there. Things=
 happen automatically in
accordance with the samskaras (the fruits of the a=
ctions of previous
births).

=E2=80=9CThe feeling that the doer is =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 is itself bondage. If the feeling is got
rid of by vichara, t=
hese questions do not arise.

Saranagathi is not the mere act of sitting wi=
th closed eyes. If all sit like
that, how are they to get on in this world?=
=E2=80=9D While Bhagavan was speaking the
bell of the dining hall rang.

=
=E2=80=9CThere goes the bell; should we not go?=E2=80=9D So saying with a s=
mile, Bhagavan
got up.
