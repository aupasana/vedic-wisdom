Dear Shri PVR:

The Ganapati Homam procedure includes a Tarpanam to Lord G=
anapati
prior to the suddhanabali. The same step is missing in the 
other h=
omam manuals such as the one for MahaLakshmi.

Is there a reason for the in=
clusion (or exclusion) of the step?
Shouldn't we offer tarpanam to any diet=
y? [perhaps by prefixing it 
with a mantra, exactly as we do in the Pancha =
or Shodasha upachara
pooja]

Regards.

p.s. We need to actively monitor the=
 group and remove spammers and their messages!
