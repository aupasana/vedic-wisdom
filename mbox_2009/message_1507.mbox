Namaste

I have been doing regular homas for the last six months. Now recen=
tly, I have started having incessant problems of not being able to digest f=
ood properly, specially what I eat at night. Incessant states of stomach up=
set and stomach ailments have been afflicting me since the last one and hal=
f months. Daily. 

I was wonder what kind of food is most suitable while co=
ntinuing homas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Should it be =
an entirely fructivorous diet? Specially at night?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
