Ramana Maharshi says,I am a poor man.For my status, even what I now have is=

too much. This sofa, these mattresses, these pillows =97 why all these? Yo=
u
people do not agree, but how happy would it be if I could spread out this=

towel and sit on the floor!=94 said Bhagavan. =93You say even that towel s=
hould
be no bigger than the present one!=94 said Mudaliar. =93Why a bigger =
one? It is
half-a-yard broad and three-quarters of a yard long. It is suffi=
cient for
drying the body after bath, for spreading over the head if you wa=
lk in the
sun, for tying round the neck if it is cold and for spreading on =
the floor
to sit on. What more could we do with a bigger one?=94 said Bhaga=
van.

Some rich people bring silver tumblers and plates and request Bhagava=
n to
use them. Bhagavan would not even touch them, but would send them back=
 to
the office if received through them, or give them back to the people if=
 they
are brought direct to him.Knowing that such articles would not be acc=
epted,
Janaki Ammal, the wife of Dr. Ganapati Iyer, sent through a devotee =
for
Bhagavan=92s use wooden sandals with silver fittings. Bhagavan touched =
them
and seeing the silver fittings remarked, =93They are rich people. Sand=
als with
silver fittings are therefore suitable for them but not for us. So=
, send
them back to those people. Tell them, =91Swami has touched them and =
that is
enough=92. We have feet given to us by God. Why these ornaments? Gi=
ve back to
them their articles.=94 So saying he sent them back.

Let alone =
the question of wearing sandals with silver fittings. He does not
wear even=
 ordinary wooden sandals. Even in the height of summer, when the
feet get s=
corched by heat, he walks barefooted and refuses to use anything
to protect=
 the feet. Sometime back, when the path leading to the Gosala from
the offi=
ce was cemented and Bhagavan was walking on it in the hot sun, some
devotee=
s, who could not see him suffering thus, poured water along the path,
but B=
hagavan stopped them saying, =93Why are you wasting so much water for my
sa=
ke by pouring it over the ground? If you open a shed for supplying
drinking=
 water to travellers, how much more useful it will be! Why do two or
three =
people waste their time and water for my sake? Please don=92t do it.=94 It
=
was therefore stopped but, instead, the whole passage was covered with a
pa=
ndal. Bhagavan used to say the same thing even if khuskhus thatties
(screen=
s) were hung and water sprinkled on them.

For a great Thyagi and Mahapurus=
ha like this, will there be any desire for
silver sandals, satin-cloth matt=
resses, silkcovered pillows and other
ornamental things? Why these luxuries=
 which curtail freedom? Vairagya is his
ornament, Sivavibhuti his glory.
