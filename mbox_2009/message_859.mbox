Namaste,
 
It looks fine. I do not know what "khadir powder" is. Others are=
 all fine.
 
Juwar dhani (available in Indian stores) is a good material to=
 add to your nice mix. When you are doing a homam for the Mother, anar dana=
 (dried pomegranate seeds - available in Indian stores) is a good item to a=
dd.
 
White sesame seeds are good for spiritual progress. Black sesame seed=
s are good for physical and health issues. If you care about that, they can=
 be added.
 
Marmara/mamra (popped rice) is good to add if you want financi=
al prosperity.
 
It is possible to do with just ghee and nothing also.
 
Th=
ose who do homam in fire and smoke conscious western contries with a small =
fire should put very limited amounts of offerings and rely on ghee mostly. =
Those who do homam with a big fire can put pretty much anything and it will=
 burn. Try to ensure that whatever you put burns.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=

 Re: some queries on homam


        Dear Narsimhaji,
        I have prepar=
ed one mixture of Havan Samagri for offerings in Homam. This contains follo=

        Karpur                   10 pi=

        Cow Ghee mixed to this powder as required.
                 I =
use this mixture in daily routin Homam. 4 or 8 Ahutis to each deities. Is t=

        Please answer sir so that knowingly or unknowingly I may=
 not do any mistake (Dosha) as was the discussion on  Homa Kunda.

          Namaste Dhe=
eraj,
          You can use as much quantity of offerings as you want, as l=
ong
          as the offerings are properly consumed in the fire. It all bo=
ils down to
          the amount of fire that is present in the homa kunda.=
 If there is good
          amount of fire, even if you do not offer ghee, =
offering marmara , havan
          samagri etc will be easily consumed. But=
 if the fire is small, then you
          do need to offer ghee drops to ke=
ep the fire alive.
          There were days when I used about 8-10 coconut=
 halves for 1
          chandi homam, ie started with 2 pieces of 1 coconut=
 half, adding half
          piece of coconut half for each chapter and fin=
ally a piece for
          purnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chandi hom=
a with about 2-3 coconut
          halves. Others out there might be able t=
o do with much less. It also
          depends on the coconut pieces itself=
, some pieces burn slow and some
          fast, so the quantity you may ne=
ed may vary.
          Most importantly I suggest you follow an important a=
dvice of
          Narasimhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the corners of th=
e coconut piece,
          making sure the piece catches fire from all the =
corners. Doing this way,
          at the end of the homa, all the coconut =
pieces are completely burnt,
          almost like powder.
          So, my=
 suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings at your
          disposa=
l, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does not matter). 
          M=
ake sure the offerings that you put with each swaha (sloka) catch fire.
   =
       Hold your offerings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc joining your=

          ring finger, middle finger and thumb. This way, you will be offe=
ring
          decent amount with each swaha.
          Like Narasimhaji, I=
 prepare a mixture of havan samagri, black and
          white sesame seeds=
, marmara,poha etc in a container and used the
          combination as off=
ering.
          I am sure within first few days of your homa, you will hav=
e very
          good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you need to=
 make.

          All the Best.

IV>Namaste Dheeraj,<BR>You can use as much quantity of offerings as 
      =
    you want, as long<BR>as the offerings are properly consumed in the 
   =
       fire. It all boils down to<BR>the amount of fire that is present in =

          the homa kunda. If there is good<BR>amount of fire, even if you =
do not 
          offer ghee, offering marmara , havan<BR>samagri etc will =
be easily 
          consumed. But if the fire is small, then you<BR>do nee=
d to offer ghee 
          drops to keep the fire alive.<BR>There were days=
 when I used about 
          8-10 coconut halves for 1<BR>chandi homam, ie=
 started with 2 pieces of 
          1 coconut half, adding half<BR>piece o=
f coconut half for each chapter 
          and finally a piece for<BR>purna=
huti. Now, I am able to manage 1 
          chandi homa with about 2-3 coco=
nut<BR>halves. Others out there might 
          be able to do with much le=
ss. It also<BR>depends on the coconut pieces 
          itself, some pieces=
 burn slow and some<BR>fast, so the quantity you 
          may need may va=
ry.<BR>Most importantly I suggest you follow an 
          important advice=
 of<BR>Narasimhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the 
          corners of the=
 coconut piece,<BR>making sure the piece catches fire 
          from all t=
he corners. Doing this way,<BR>at the end of the homa, all 
          the c=
oconut pieces are completely burnt,<BR>almost like powder.<BR>So, 
        =
  my suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings at 
          your<BR=
>disposal, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does not 
          ma=
tter). <BR>Make sure the offerings that you put with each swaha 
          =
(sloka) catch fire.<BR>Hold your offerings ie havan samagri, marmara, 
    =
      poha etc joining your<BR>ring finger, middle finger and thumb. This 
=
          way, you will be offering<BR>decent amount with each swaha.<BR>Li=
ke 
          Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, black and<=
BR>white 
          sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and used =

          the<BR>combination as offering.<BR>I am sure within first few da=
ys of 
          your homa, you will have very<BR>good idea of how much ghe=
e and other 
          offerings you need to make.<BR><BR>All the
