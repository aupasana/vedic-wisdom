they were vegeterian and eating frugally
then indians were we=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs. Non-Veg (From a non-vegetarian's point=
 of view)

   
Dear Rajarshi,
Do not think that I'll be offended or misunde=
rstand you to be a cruel hearted etc...
In this message, i am giving only w=
hat i feel right as per me and how i think about the whole issue myself.  s=
o pl. take that in consideration.
But to say that it is  immoral or that on=
e does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetarian food, is illogical, inc=
orrect and pure bunkum.
In my previous message, i've clarified some points.=
  i put it again below:
Please do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with=
 perspective of
Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My onl=
y point in
Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (N=
on Violence)
against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).
***
Anyway, my =
point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vegetarian food when =
you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or else it conflicts w=
ith your system badly.
In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something=
 is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if No=
t right then for me it'll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a dif=
ferent matter, if in future i succumb to challanging conditions and start e=
ating meat but even then it'll not justify and make it proper thing.
***
De=
ar Rajarshi, Now i hope you don't get offended by my message. i apologise i=
n advance for my bluntness.
 your second Para and some writings in your ear=
lier message gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karam=
a, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. 
In my opinon, i=
f one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under=
 the Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab,=
 Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have st=
arted eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong a=
s per the 'their' thinking.
To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc.=
.., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of 'Direct killing' and=
 'eating meat of already dead' does not go well with me. it is just a philo=
sophy to cover up.
Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian bec=
uase they hate killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and t=
here are few more i know. howvever they are very very very rare.
***
The ab=
ove arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people who provide =
such arguements,  but these arguments are nonsensical and childish. Almost =
Zakir Naik style of arguments.
 I agree completely. it is childish, Laughab=
le and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such people talk such non=
sense.
***
Lastly, i'll add a philospohical thought. If so much of killing =
every hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the=
 world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have a pe=
acefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cau=
se & effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.

 we wonder why don't others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature =

 A person who is a

for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a universal logic applicabl=
e to all.
> =C3=82 
> A far better angle of tackling this is the idea of ka=
rma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing an anim=
al, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fis=
h/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a no=
n-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some=
 cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it =
is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82 It is similar to th=
e one you would get for buying some simple daal which has come to the marke=
t through the hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God know=
s what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. =
It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch i=
nto eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they never grow into an ani=
mal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming tha=
t? God knows.
> =C3=82

be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percen=

on-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues at a yo=

      <p></p><p>Dear Rajarshi,</p>
<p>Do not think that =
I'll be offended or misunderstand you to be a cruel hearted etc...</p>
<p>I=
n this message, i am giving only what i feel right as per me and =
how i think about the whole issue myself.  so pl. take that in conside=
ration.</p>
<p><strong>But to say that it is  immoral or that one does=
 not reach God if one consumes non-vegetarian food, is illogical, incorrect=
 and pure bunkum.</strong><br>In my previous message, i've clarified some p=
oints.  i put it again below:</p>
<p>Please do not consider my po=
int for Veg/Nonveg with perspective of<br>Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saa=
twik/Taamsik etc... My only point in<br>Vegterianism is related to Compessi=
on against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)<br>against Adharama (Killing Inno=
cent creatures).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, my point is, I understan=
d that it is good to eat totally vegetarian food when you engage in sa=
dhana, specially things like havans, or else it conflicts with your sy=
stem badly.</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if some=
thing is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is =
if Not right then for me it'll remain *Not right in all conditions*. i=
t is a different matter, if in future i succumb to challanging conditions a=
nd start eating meat but even then it'll not justify and make it proper thi=
ng.</p>
<p>***<br>Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don't get offended by =
my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.</p>
<p> your seco=
nd Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me impression that =
you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me=
. to be very honest. </p>
<p>In my opinon, if one can justify eating&n=
bsp;popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is=
 eatable.  with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snake=
s, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have started =
eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per =
the 'their' thinking.</p>
<p>To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture&nbs=
p;etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of 'Dir=
ect killing' and 'eating meat of already dead' does not go well with me.&nb=
sp;it is just a philosophy to cover up.</p>
<p>Poeple born in Those cu=
ltures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an=
 example of one such person and there are few more i know. howvever they ar=
e very very very rare.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>The above arguments are in=
correct. I know some non-vegetarian people who provide such arguements,&nbs=
p; but these arguments are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik=
 style of arguments.</strong></p>
<p> I agree completely. it is childi=
sh, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such people ta=
lk such nonsense.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lastly, i'll add a philospohical t=
hought. If so much of killing every hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpo=
se of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the prime mover is Human society,=
 then how we hope to have a peacefull world without blood shed and massacar=
e. unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect) will find many ways&nbs=
p;to give it back to (in)Human societies.</p>

 a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice=
 of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing =
site. Panting for water (i don't have proper English word to describe the c=
ondition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.<=
br>> =C3=82 <br>> =C3=82 <br>> I understand and apprecia=
te you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted.=
 <br>> =C3=82 <br>> When the question of sensitivity comes in, t=
here is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning=
. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rul=
e cannot be used to
 judge everyone.=C3=82  <br>> =C3=82 <br>&=
gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where=
 they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends=
 seemed disgusted. I asked them, "Why?". If you can eat a chicken or a fish=
, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an insect. Just because one is b=
orn in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one g=
ets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I tol=
d them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they wo=
uld gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. W=
e humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinion=
 is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are the=
 only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don't=
 others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the worl=
d diverse, and so it is.
 Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a<=
br>> vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family=
 in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non-vegetarian food, he would no=
t even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=82 people who f=
aint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operation=
s daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for=
 an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a universal logic ap=
plicable to all.<br>> =C3=82 <br>> A far better angle of tacklin=
g this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not =
directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but r=
ather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. F=
urther, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to deal in t=
he raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of kar=
ma that you would get for it is quite
 acceptble IMO. It can be easily hand=
led.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simp=
le daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who =
has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussio=
ns in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs -=
 broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten =
because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What k=
arma does one get for consuming that? God knows.<br>> =C3=82 <br>&g=
t; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually =
an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc=
 and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good co=
mbination. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their st=
