Respected Narasimhaji,
                     Namaste. Thers a slight confusi=
on in my mind regarding chanting mantras...

1.A mantra has a specific way =
of pronounciation.and i have seen there are several kinds of pronounciation=
...like here in bengal thers one way....in benaras another...and in souther=
n india another way.

Wich one is to be adopted ??

2.I have understood the=
 bank balance analogy.I want to ask if chanting mantras of forms of shakti =
like Dakshina Kali wud be ok or not ??

A reason for this confusion is that=
 i have read the way the energy of a mantra is directed from one house in h=
oroscope to another.Being only a novice in the vast field of astrology i am=
 unable to decide my mantra.

Also,at some point of time,i have read in thi=
s forum that horoscope represents the maya.So if i just want to show my lov=
e to the mother divine by chanting the mantra whenevr i get to do it ,be it=
 in any state of mind and body,will my love take preference over the maya o=
r the formula for energy direction will still apply ????


3.Now,that i hav=
e selected a mantra.During chanting or japa of it,contradictory thoughts do=
 come in mind.Even sometimes i ask for material pleasures out of lack of fo=
cus during tha japa. So i am confused whether to continue the japa or not.
