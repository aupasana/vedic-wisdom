Namaste

Good information,

May I add one more place, that is located in Ra=
jkot Gujarat,
Ranchod Vadi, the Ranchoddasji Maharaj's ashram.

They are al=
so doing 24 by 7 uninterrupted ram dhun for many many years. I do not remem=
ber the exact years but I may not be surprised if it is also 25 plus years.=


When visit India, I visit this place and do raamdhun for few minutes.
Peo=
ple in staying in rajkot are lucy, they can swing by the place all the time=
 at their convinience.

Best Regards
Mitesh
