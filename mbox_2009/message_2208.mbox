Namaste Rajarshi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When I started out my Chandi ho=
mas (elaborate procedure), it used to take about 3 to 3 1/2 hrs and I could=
 easily manage the fire with coconut pieces (Each piece is a qurater of the=
 whole coconut). Place 2 pieces side by side and the third one touching the=
 sides of these 2, giving it a triangular shape if you look from top (white=
 side facing up).
During homam make sure you turn the pieces side-ways so t=
hat all the sides of a single piece catch fire. When white side is burnt en=
ough, turn it over to bring the dark side up.
At the beginning of each chap=
ter, add a new piece, pushing the thoroughly burnt piece to the top side. S=
o, at any time you should have 2 pieces burning so that one supports the ot=
her in case of an emergency.=A0=A0=A0=A0 
=A0 =A0 =A0 It is very helpful if=
 you can have the Chandipath script in front of you while listening to the =
audio. Familiarize yourself with all the difficult words, underline the wor=
ds that need extra care of pronunciation. Then read aloud while listening t=
o the audio and when you feel comfortable, set a rule for yourself on 21 da=
ys or 40 days and start reading daily. Very soon, the total time will drast=
ically reduce and you can start the homa. Try to bring down the total durat=
ion at an affordable level and at the same time to a comfortable level. 
=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When you do homa, use your left thumb to track the verse yo=
u are on. It will help initially. Also, if you are constrained by time, you=
 can just follow what Narasimha does=A0 as mentioned in an earlier post to =
Utpal. In addition to what Narasimha does, I read Ganapathi Atharvaseersham=
, Kavacha and Devi Suktam an addition of about 10 minutes.
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
All the best.

Regards
Ravi

This i=

 you do homa with wood or coconut? If you are doing it with wood, then init=

=A0
Did you play the CD and keep practicing the Chandi with it=

Namaste Rajarshi ji & Friends,

Thats nic=

One more thing, I don't know to read tamil/malayalam (mot=
her tongue) script, and very shaky with Devanagari script and hence it's a =
chore for me. I am sure most members are well versed with their mother tong=
