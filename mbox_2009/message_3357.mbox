Dear Narasimhaji,

I think you have misunderstood what I said. Your tone se=
ems to imply that I somehow put down Eastern philosophy? I simply made a po=
int about which path of inquiry to *start* from. Please read my inlined rep=
lies.

Very loose=
ly speaking - just in order to convey my point - Western philosophy is bett=
er at painstakingly enumerating and explaining things in the sensory domain=
, Eastern is better in the non-sensory domain. The "reconcile" I am talking=
 about is a wrong choice of word, I apologize. It seems to imply that they =
both have explanations for the same thing and that they need to be reconcil=
ed. What I really meant is more like unify and bridge in order to build a c=
omplete and unambiguous view, that smoothly takes one from the sensory to t=
he non-sensory. The reason to "unify and bridge" is to clear misunderstandi=
ngs. Jumping straight to the non-sensory creates a lot of misconceptions du=
e to subjectivity. Doesnt mean that Eastern non-sensory observations are wr=
ong, simply that they are easily misinterpreted.

The only baggage that com=
es with Western philosophy, in my humble experience, is a tendency to dismi=
ss the non-sensory. Not all Western philosophers do that - although the ove=
rall trend in modern times (e.g. existentialism) is to do so. I let go of t=
hat baggage in 2002, personally speaking. So I do not have that specific bi=
as anymore. Is there anything else that you have in mind?

> Ahamkara is not the hole in the doughnut. Ahamkara is the "space" th=
at fills the entire doughnut, including the hole in the center and the outs=
ide. Manas (sensory mind), its organs of perception and organs of action, b=
uddhi (logical mind) and part of chitta (memory) that is akin to a cache in=
 computer memory is part of the outside of doughnut. Part of chitta (memory=
) that is uncached (stored from *forgotten* existences) is in the hole in t=
he middle.

Thank you for the specific answer. Now I have 2 specific questi=
ons, and these are really the questions for which I did all the context bui=
ldup, and are as yet unanswered:
1) If you say that Ahamkara pervades the e=
ntire edible part of the doughnut, then, since the edible part of the dough=
nut represents *what one is conscious of*, then you are saying that one is =
fully conscious of Ahamkara, right? This to me is not accurate. Let's not t=
alk theoretical concepts and terms here, but experience, and then try to co=
rrelate it to known concepts. Please specifically correct me where you thin=
k I'm wrong. When I close my eyes in a peaceful undisturbed environment, an=
d the thought of any object comes up, then in my mind there is the object a=
nd there is me observing it. The object is clearly in the edible part of th=
e doughnut, but the "me" isnt. It is the subject, the observer, and is unob=
servable by itself - although it is always present as the observer. Since i=
t is not observable, it is not in the edible part of the doughnut. I say th=
is for the average everyday human being like myself. It seems to me that th=
e term Ahamkara refers to something in this unobservable observer. The obse=
rver is conscious of its own existence, but cant actually turn it's attenti=
on to itself. Simply because everything in the edible part of the doughnut =
is observed by this observer (which is the fact you use to conclude that th=
at Ahamkara pervades the entire doughnut), doesnt mean the observer can be =
the object of it's own attention. For this reason, I take the Ahamkara to b=
e in center of the doughnut, along with what you have said are the forgotte=
n memories of past lives. Is that entire unobservable thing the Ahamkara, o=
r is only the centering "force" in that the Ahamkara? Clearly Ahamkara and =
ego are two different things - Ahamkara is that unobservable quantity that =
gives this indivisible feeling of I. Ego is the field of consciousness of t=
he average human being (the doughnut as described earlier).

b) Now, and th=
is is the main East vs West thing I would like to highlight, I find no term=
 in Eastern thinking that is the equivalent of the ego as defined above (fi=
eld of consciousness of the average human being - current sense experience =
+ current "cache" if you will). Manas, sensory organs are simply the instru=
ments that construct this field of consciousness, they are not the contents=
 of the field of consciousness. You will say - why define this unimportant =
term, how is it important? It is important because this is the only thing (=
i.e. the ego doughnut is the only thing) an average person knows and experi=
ences their entire life. When you are asking them to be spiritual by, for e=
xample, meditating on the sense of I, what exactly are you saying? You are =
asking that Ahamkara-containing unobservable observer to ditch the ego (i.e=
. not focus on the senses + current cache) and turn it's attention (what ex=
actly is the term for "attention of the Ahamkara-containing unobservable ob=
server") onto itself. See how I'm stumbling around creating terms and names=
 as I go? This is because I dont find exact descriptions of an approach sta=
rting from the ego-doughnut, which is the only thing that I, an average hum=
an being, knows.  I could go on - going further - the chitta - memory-store=
 - is clearly compartmentalized, right? Since the sookshma sarira is eterna=
l, how come people dont have continuous memory? What happens to the ego dou=
ghnut upon death - bewilderment of the unobservable observer? But the memor=
y must be getting compartmentalized at this point because on rebirth, those=
 sections of memory clearly have a barrier put up in front of them (since n=
o average person has any pre-birth memories). Also, what is Kundalini awake=
ning in this terminology - the doughnut suddenly expanding inward? 

It is =
these things that I seek to understand starting from the consistent common =
place that I, as an average human being, knows. That consistent common plac=
e is the ego doughnut.

I will stop here, awaiting your reply..
