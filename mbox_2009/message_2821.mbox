Namaste Rajarshi,

Your question reminds me of something the Mother (Sri Aurobindo) said on
this subject during one of her talks with aspirants - I cannot remember
where exactly but will try to find it later.

Mother said that many temples today are filled with the negative energy
of asuric beings from the lower planes, many of which are capable of
causing harm to people.

The reason, she said, is that many people today visit temples seeking
fulfilment of short-term, material desires (wealth, health, marriage,
children etc). They perform rituals and make offerings while harbouring
such desires. Such tamasic and rajasic sentiments attract
ill-intentioned beings from the vital plane to the place of worship.

Therefore she said that one should be cautious about which temples one
visits, especially if one is weak and susceptible to negative energies.
And when one does visit, one should try one's hardest to do so with the
spirit of complete surrender to *whatever* Divine presence is there (and
without seeking to fulfil petty desires).

So it may be that there is a risk.

Best regards,

Samir
