Hi,

What is the suggested place for doing homam? Inside the house or outsi=
de the house? I mean, if the house has a back yard can the homam be done th=
ere? What are the dos and dont's while selecting the place to do homam? Any=
 considerations about the directions, sitting etc?

regards,

Jagmohan
