Dear Members

I was hearing of a famous sentence attributed to Swami Ramdas=
 who had 
told Shivaji "hindavi swarajya whave...hi shrrenchi ichcha"..

Wh=
ich means, to have a Hindu Rastra is God's desire. Is it really 
God's desi=
re? Will such a thing ever happen?

Inspite of having so many spiritual sup=
er giants born in this land, 
hinduism and Sanatan Dharma has suffered such=
 terribly at the hands of 
foreigners.  I wonder why.

Kindly provide your =
learned views on the same. I am curious to know 
what others think.
