 16th December, 1949

Some time in 1942-43, Sri Jagadeeswara Sastri=92s son=
 who was studying in the
Vedapatasala in Madurai, came here during the holi=
days. Being young, he had
tresses of hair hanging down to the shoulders. Ma=
y be he wanted to appear
fashionable. As soon as he came into the hall and =
got up after prostrating,
Bhagavan said, =93Oh, is that you? When I saw you=
r hair style, I thought it
was somebody else. Oh! My! How you look! Who wou=
ld believe that you are the
son of Jagadeeswara Sastri?=94 The boy was so a=
shamed, that he came to the
hall next day with only a small tuft of hair be=
hind.Noticing it, Bhagavan
said, =93Yes. That is right. Will not people cri=
ticise adversely if
Jagadeeswara Sastri=92s son, a bachelor living in a Gur=
ukula (the house of a
Guru), has an unbecoming hair style?=94

In 1943, Gur=
ram Subbaramayya Garu came here with his daughter of five or six
years of a=
ge. As you know, she had no mother. Noticing that she had a plait
of hair o=
n either side of her head, Bhagavan remarked, =93What child! Only two
plait=
s? Why not have two more in front and two in the centre of the head?=94
So =
saying Bhagavan laughed.Bhagavan had passed similar remarks before
whenever=
 he saw other children dressed up like this. Now this child felt
ashamed, c=
ame to me,got her hair done into a single plait and went to
Bhagavan.Smilin=
g at it and saying it was good, Bhagavan told her father,
=93Look, European=
 ladies who come here, wear sarees, tie their hair in a plait
and put some =
flowers in it and thus try to appear like our ladies, while our
people try =
to adopt their style. What to do?=94

Sometime in 1943-44, a European by na=
me Mr. McIver used to live here; on a
Dipavali day, he wore a Salem silkbor=
dered dhoti in the orthodox style,
covered the upper
portion of his body wi=
th a similar cloth, prostrated before Bhagavan, put on
his forehead holy as=
hes and kumkum, went out of the hall and sat there with
closed eyes in padm=
asana style. Bhagavan began smiling to himself, looking
at him through the =
window. Meanwhile Rajagopala Iyer came into the hall,
whereupon Bhagavan, l=
aughing loudly, exclaimed, =93Look at that. McIver Sastri
has come here. Th=
ere he is,sitting over there. Really, if anyone were to see
him now,could t=
hey say he was not a Sastri? While all of you put on suits
and boots, inste=
ad of wearing dhoties, he dressed himself up like a Sastri.
The only thing =
that is wanting now is the sacred thread. As our people are
discarding even=
 that, there is no difficulty even on that score now. Look at
him!=94

When=
ever Bhagavan speaks to native Indians, he normally talks to them in
their =
own language, namely Tamil,Telugu or Malayalam, but never in English.
Even =
though they know this, some of our young men put their questions to
Bhagava=
n in English. Sometimes, there will be nobody to translate or the
translati=
on will be found difficult. If on such occasions, we enquire why
those peop=
le could not put their questions in their own language, Bhagavan
would say,=
 =93You want to know why they ask me in English? That is because
they want =
to test Bhagavan. They have gained some knowledge of the English
language. =
Should not all people know about it? Not only that, they sincerely
believe =
that their language is no good for such an important matter. The
infatuatio=
n for that language makes them feel like that. Poor people!What
can they do=
?=94
