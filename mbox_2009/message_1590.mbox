Namaste
=A0
I read Svoboda's article and I had a few question. Theoritcal b=
ut relevant.
=A0
He has given the idea of of terrorists. When a terrorist i=
s doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dharma. That is what he m=
aybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what his "gurus" may have ask=
ed him to do, and that is what his ideals/principles/books maybe asked of h=
im to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, how can he be blamed? Theref=
ore, the statement taht "Dharmo rakshati rakshitah..", does not make sense.=
 How is his dharma protecting him? What is he getting in return, other than=
 a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a later date, when he may not e=
ven be aware why he has this karmas.
=A0
Can there is conflicting Dharmas f=
or one person? Or more important vs=A0less important dharma? Swadharma shou=
ld be situational. Sant Tulsidas's=A0 broader dharma may have been realizin=
g Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have been to keep his wife happ=
y. So ideally, I don't think we can ever full perform every dharma that is =
expected of us. 
=A0
I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent =
in ancient times, was mostly because nature has created various kinds of pe=
ople, each with varying tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxi=
amtion, or the best way to tell men that we are all different and yet we ar=
e not incorrect in anyway. This is much better than the new ages philosophi=
es which outright deny reality and claim everything and everyone is born eq=
ual. It is not so.
=A0
The word religion is a 13 century invention and, ety=
mologically, and inherently competitive in nature. Unlike Dharma.
=A0
Also,=
 as Narasimhaji's mail shows correctly, following Dharma is no gaurantee of=
 anything, least of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. But what is th=
e big deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way continue which ever p=
ath one choses, dharma or adharma. 
=A0
A much better way of conduction lif=
e, I feel, is maknig a mental note of Karma. To know teh simple truth that =
that which goes out will come back to you and that, if you had not been bad=
 at some point, nothing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinar=
y person, following a life based on and being on the right side of=A0karma,=
 is much easier and profitable=A0 than trying to find that elusive dharma w=
hich anyway won't help one in the long run.
=A0
Just my feeling on the subj=
ect.

 from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, <BR>=
> which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions =
you <BR>> did in the past while identifying with the action, who you aff=
ected in the <BR>> past (and how) with the actions that you identified w=
ith, what debts you <BR>> created in the process, and what mental tenden=
cies you accumulated until <BR>> now.<BR>> <BR>> If, based on one'=
s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person <BR>> to kil=
l
 evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental <BR>&=
gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the messag=
e of <BR>> uniformity of all religions, that becomes one's dharma. If, b=
ased on one's <BR>> mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a p=
erson to spread the <BR>> ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one=
's dharma. If, based on one's <BR>> mental tendencies and karmic debts, =
nature wants a person to make a lot of <BR>> money and construct a templ=
e, that becomes one's dharma.<BR>> <BR>> *    &nb=

gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.<BR>> <BR>=
> At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gur=
us, <BR>> elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was to=
o much weight <BR>> on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved
 of =
some weight. Tremendous <BR>> destruction was to take place and civiliza=
tion destroyed to a great extent, <BR>> to welcome Kali yuga and set the=
 tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, <BR>> it was his dharma to f=
acilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and <BR>> respected were on =
the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.<BR>> <BR>> When th=
e same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of <BR>> Ramakri=
shna Paramahamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a <BR>> =
previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this=
 <BR>> new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite=
 his <BR>> aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk an=
d inspire <BR>> generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachmen=
t and service to <BR>> others. When he is born again (which he has to, a=
s per what Ramakrishna <BR>> said), his dharma based on the
 time and pl=
ace may be something else.<BR>> <BR>> *     =
   *        *<BR>> <BR>>=
 The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?<BR>> =
<BR>> Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your o=
wn dharma <BR>> and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. =
Though the concept <BR>> of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for=
 a long time, the concept of <BR>> caste mobility was very much there. V=
almiki was a shudra who lived by <BR>> killing birds. He became a brahma=
na and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a <BR>> kshatrita and a powerfu=
l king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi <BR>> later. Basically v=
arna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna <BR>> of father=
, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one <BR>> deve=
lops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one
 does.<BR>> <BR=
>> Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to kno=
w your <BR>> dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not ju=
st 4 dharmas in <BR>> the world. Each person has individual dharma.<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If o=
ne is pure <BR>> enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of u=
s have a part of our <BR>> mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it=
 is surrounded by a lot of <BR>> noise from other parts of our minds whi=
ch tell other things. Thus, we get <BR>> confused.<BR>> <BR>> We s=
hould make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and <BR=
>> decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but do=
ing <BR>> the best we can is all that we can do!<BR>> <BR>> More t=
han following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in <BR>>=
 actions without identification. *That* alone
 ensures that we are not <BR>=
> accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not b=
uild <BR>> too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in=
 the best <BR>> possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our=
 dharma in the given <BR>> situation is), with as little attachment and =
self-identification with the <BR>> action as possible. When the action i=
s finished, we should leave the result <BR>> to god. We should not think=
 "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it <BR>> work" etc. Such adhe=
rence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through <BR>> unattached action=
) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. <BR>> As we=
 become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. <BR>=
> There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see o=
ur <BR>> dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This=
 is not easy, <BR>> but not as
 difficult as people think.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sen=
se of <BR>> "this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in=
 action with <BR>> little attachment.<BR>> <BR>> *  &nbs=
p;     *        *<BR=
>> <BR>> In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are =
the inputs. <BR>> Another external input is the words of scriptures and =
learned men. One can <BR>> derive one's dharma from them. A special plac=
e is given to one's spiritual <BR>> master. If one surrenders to a spiri=
tual master, one can take the words of <BR>> the master to determine one=
's dharma and follow it sincerely.<BR>> <BR>> When Arjuna was confuse=
d about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus <BR>> and relative=
s was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his <BR>> dharm=
a. When Narendranath (Swami
 Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma <BR=
>> and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sad=
hana, <BR>> Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay=
 in the material <BR>> world and do the work of Mother for him.<BR>> =
<BR>> One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, w=
hat one's <BR>> debts are and what nature expects from one can err in th=
e judgment of what <BR>> one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated s=
oul with a clear insight into <BR>> one's inner core, such a guru can gi=
ve perfect guidance.<BR>> <BR>> *      =
  *        *<BR>> <BR>> Botto=
mline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and <BR>>=
; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, fro=
m <BR>> time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbru=
les to find <BR>>
 out what one's dharma is. But, one can refine one's u=
nderstanding of one's <BR>> dharma by increasing internal purity. By doi=
ng various kinds of spiritual <BR>> sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and =
engaging in actions without much <BR>> attachment, one can slowly purify=
 oneself and refine one's understanding of <BR>> one's individual dharma=
