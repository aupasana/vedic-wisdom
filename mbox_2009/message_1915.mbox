Dear Narasmihaji
=A0
Thank you for the reference to the Yoga Vashistam. Plu=
s the Vishnu Puran also mentiones Lord Rama as an avatar. 
=A0
Though I cou=
ld not convince the person I was discussing with, one=A0 thing sturck me as=
 interesting.
=A0
Lord Rama is the Surya Vamshi. Surya related to the right=
 channel, the path of logic and discrimination and structure.=A0This you ha=
d explanied in your mail on Dakshina Kali.
=A0
Where as Lord Krishna was a =
Chandra Vamshi, of the lunar channel of intution/emotion etc. 
As a corolla=
ry, can the path shown by Lord Rama be equated to the path of Dakshina Kali=
 and that of Krishna as Vama Kali.
=A0
-Regards

Namaste,

In th=
e episodes before Rama's birth, Valmiki clearly portrays him as an 
avatara=
 of Vishnu.

In "Yoga Vaasishtham" , also written by Valmiki, Rama becomes =
depressed. 
Vasishtha, in the presence of Vishwamitra and other rishis and =
gods, teaches 
self-knowledge to Rama. Vasishtha reveals the true nature of=
 Rama then and 
Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has to finally enter the=
 Sushumna nadi of 
Rama to disturb his samadhi and bring him back to senses=
. After that, Rama 
knows who he is.

Rama and Krishna were both avataras o=
f Vishnu. Krishna knew it from the 
beginning. In the case of Rama, sages l=
ike Vasishtha, Vishwamitra knew it 
even before Rama's birth, but Rama hims=
elf did not know it in the beginning. 
But he too knew it later.

However, =
Krishna had complete mastery over the duality, while Rama did not. 
Rama ha=
d to wade the dual world like normal people. Krishna could do any 
manipula=
tion of the dual world that he wanted.

Best regards,
Narasimha
