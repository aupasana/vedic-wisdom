Namaste Rajarshi,

We share the same Birthday (Saal ko goli maro;). happy b=
'day in advance!

I thought that you might have misunderstood Swaboda w.r.t=
. his comments regarding Terrorists hence i gave my earlier reply

***

My =
take on the whole issue of Swa-Dharma is as under:

1) Swaboda in his Artic=
le, as you pointed out, does not proivde any insight in to SwaDharma. but a=
tleast he would have been successfull in triggering some important chain of=
 thoughts in atleast some of the serious readers.

2) Narasimha has express=
ed it accurately in his message when he says that it is *very vey very* dif=
ficult to find out individual Dharma. his whole message is quite insightful=
 and dispeller of many a doubts. 

3) Few months back, i was confused and w=
orried about my swa-dharma and such stuff. now there is a good amount of cl=
arity and clutterlessness. it was because of the below message of Narasimha=
 which i read few months ago AND my own contemplation on the matter AND Tha=
kur Ramkrishna's disicive quote which i am reproducing below:

[[[[[
This i=
s the message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world. Care not for doctrine=
s or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count for but little =
compared with that essence of existence which is in each one, and 
called '=
spirituality'.  The more this develops in a man, the more powerful is he fo=
r good.  He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow man. First, t=
hen, acquire that.  Only those who have seen it will understand this; but s=
uch spirituality can be given to others, even though they be unconscious of=
 the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are amongst the great=
 teachers of mankind.  They are the powers of light. Then be you this!  The=
 more of such men any country produces, the higher  that country is raised.=
  That land where no such men exist is doomed. Nothing can save it. Therefo=
re, my Master's message to the world is, `Be ye all spiritual! Get ye first=
 realization!'  And to the young and strong of every country he would cry t=
hat the time is come for renunciation.  'Renounce for the sake of humanity!=
 You have talked of the love of man till the thing is in danger of becoming=
 words alone. The time is come to act.  The call is now.  Do! Leap into the=
 breach and save the world! 
]]]]


4) in my opinion, what matters for us i=
s Sadhana, Sadhana and More Sadhana. Purification and direct perception of =
supreme truth. everything else such as Swa-Dharma etc.. will fall in place =
after that or during the path.


By the way, the word 'Sadhna' reminded me =
of 'Hanumaan Jayanti' on coming Thursday (Chaitri Paournima). intrested mem=
bers may think of taking leave from their daily job and recite 'Hanumaan Ch=
alisa' from morning to Evening-108 times if possible.

any takers?

Warm Re=
gards,

Utpal
