Namaste Rajarshi,
 
The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the original source o=
f everything. But the world of duality is a lot more tricky.
 
Please see t=
he "many faced diamond" analogy for god at the end of http://groups.yahoo.c=
om/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1 to get clarity on why different people give=
 different hierarchies and consider different beings as supreme. As per Nar=
ayana sooktam, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came f=
rom Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma=
, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Ganapathi Atharva s=
eersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ga=
napathi. As per Suryopanishat, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, I=
ndra etc) came from Surya. And so on.
 
The duality is so vast and yet non-=
duality is the underlying supreme reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy w=
ithin hierarchy will have to start at the connection with non-duality and i=
t is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with respect=
 to one perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, be=
cause that cannot be done really. If you haven't before, do read the analog=
y in the last part of the mail mentioned above. It is an analogy worth gett=
ing into your thinking system.

ishi who is acting our the Mother's instructions

ting the environment for the Rishi's wish

rst?
 
There is no causal relationship between the two. Actions of rishis a=
nd the will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. They just happen toget=
her. Neither causes the other.
 
Rishis are the most perfected beings witho=
ut a trace of ego and yet performing actions of great consequence, with zer=
o attachment. They operate right on the border of duality and non-duality.

herefore not as supreme as is made out to be?
 
Our ego does not leave us e=
ven in sadhana. Sometimes, one's belief that one's guru is the best guru or=
 the god one prays to is the supreme one is rooted in one'e ego and one's n=
eed to be the best and be associated with the best. Just contemplate if tha=
t is the case and if it is, try to root out such thinking.
 
Having said th=
at, do look at the god you pray to as the supreme and try to reach the supr=
eme through him/her by surrendering to him/her. If you take a low level man=
ifestation of that deity, then rishis may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimal=
ananda said. But, if you take the highest manifestation of the deity, as th=
e supreme cosmic being, then rishis are his playmates and neither above nor=
 below.
 
*        *        *
 
If you take a company, there may be a chair=
man who may be the highest authority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and =
some may consider CEO to be higher while some may consider the chairman to =
be higher. Why bother about who is higher? In a company does well, they bot=
h work with understanding.
 
The hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is a cl=
erk at the company. Just follow the order of your boss (guru) instead of wo=
ndering whether chairman calls the shots or CEO.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness


        Namaste Narasmihaji=


        I have a question. Though it will probably sound stupid to a lear=
ned man like you, but I just could not get a convincing answer to it, so th=
ought of putting this question in this forum.

        You mentioned that a=
 senior Maharishi is doing this. In the books of Vimalananda he says Naths,=
 Munis and Rishis are higher beings, even higher than deities.

        Wha=
t confuses me is that, what can be higher than a deity? For example Goddes =
Durga is the supreme mother of all worlds, then how can a Rishi or any bein=
g be higher than Her? Or lord Shiva or Narayana?

        I mean is it the =
Rishi who is acting our the Mother's instructions or is it She who is creat=
ing the environment for the Rishi's wish to come true? Which one came first=
?

        It gets confusing-:(. 

        As a devotee it is natural and s=
imple to believe that the God I pray to is the Ultimate Supreme authority, =
but when I hear that Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt creeps in, is =
the deity therefore not as supreme as is made out to be?

        Sorry if =
these questions seem childish, but I really get confused thinking about thi=
s.

        -Regards
         Rajarshi

nsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

          =EF=BB=BF 
          Na=
maste,

          Aurobindo need not be talking about a single "savior" the=
 way people may imagine. Also, he need not be talking about somebody "conne=
cted to" his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are c=
onnections between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of S=
ister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her wel=
l when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Sw=
ami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aur=
obindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and le=
arnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel =
of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expa=
nd his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And=
 so on.

          Coming back to the main point, the supermind established=
 in the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a ma=
harshi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in th=
e divine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge c=
hanges on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play=
 to make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the pl=
ay, he may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and =
direct a few important souls to do some key work. Some important souls (dei=
ties, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be bo=
rn on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.

          You may =
then see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and rea=
lized beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritu=
al knowledge. Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance fro=
m the divine, based on what their part in the play is.

          *        =
*        *

          The "Asura of Falsehood" that Aurobindo alluded to is=
 all around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty =
much everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong =
propaganda etc.

          One should not tolerate this Asura (demon) and f=
ight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or those afflicted by hi=
m. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand for truth but not hate=
 the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs to be hated in this=
 world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by Nature without at=
traction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with unconditional love (i=
.e. no expectations of a return) to all.

          > This was a very inter=
esting read and matches what Narasimhaji
          > says about changes com=
ing in the world.

          I know very little. But I was told that an age=
 that is somewhat like the bygone ages will be established on earth for a f=
ew hundred years in the coming decades. The reason the Divine Mother appear=
ed before Manish and asked him to spread simple homam procedures in the wor=
ld was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also told me that all this i=
s the play of a senior maharshi.

          Best regards,

amaste

                          I found an interesting article based on S=
ri Aurobindo's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.

      =
                    Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian=
 freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth whi=
ch had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw=
 that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw=
 that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for =
this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descendin=
g to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resi=
stance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=
=BD
                          =EF=BF=BD
                          Sri Aurob=
indo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, w=
ho later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of=
 intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal un=
certainties we face today.
                          =EF=BF=BD
            =
              Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter,=
 and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of=
 the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pr=
ocess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evol=
ution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these=
 two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fore=
saw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=
=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely chan=
ge everything on Earth.
                          =EF=BF=BD
               =
           Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo=
, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, =
even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows h=
im, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed pers=
onality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of th=
e outer senses seems to contradict it.

                          Sri Aurob=
indo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A s=
tage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides o=
n the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinc=
tion as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1=
973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be terme=
d the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, =
and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular conscio=
usness.

                          Evolution took a great leap forward with=
 the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at t=
he threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare fo=
r the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of=
 human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently=
 upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current speci=
es, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstruc=
ted from contacting and merging with it.
                          =EF=BF=
=BD
                          Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a =
species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an e=
ver-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and =
live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. 

            =
              Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inha=
bit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, =
which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular co=
nsciousness. 

                          Finally, our ultimate goal as a sp=
ecies is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully=
 within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could c=
all =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matt=
er and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

                        =
  The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramenta=
l consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. S=
ince this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consc=
iousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of =
the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifesta=
tion in collective matter.
                          Whenever there is a =
=EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo =
and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=
=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is=
 the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and=
 the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, a=
nd which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them =
the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently=
, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter=
 two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the=
 Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during Worl=
d War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence=
. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing o=
ther world leaders in the current political sphere.

                      =
    With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsole=
te human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized t=
hat although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily cat=
astrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world=
 for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintain=
ed, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance b=
y means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventual=
ly be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and T=
ruth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the worl=
d today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of=
 harmonization!

                          When does all this happen? Sri A=
urobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quan=
tum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that t=
he supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come a=
bout with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still=
 considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning poin=
t.

                          This was a very interesting read and matches =
what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.

<DIV><FONT=
 face=3DArial size=3D2>The duality is so vast and yet non-duality is the 
u=
nderlying supreme reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy within hierarchy =
will 
have to start at the connection with non-duality and it is not one. I=
n other 
words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to one perspe=
ctive. I will 
not be too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, because that ca=
nnot be done really.

       permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore 
               =

                    According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a
