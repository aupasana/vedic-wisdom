Dear Forum Members,
If you consider my humble request, please give your int=
roduction with your present location so that we can recognise each and ever=
y writer where he is writing from. e.g. Narsimhaji is from Boston USA and U=
tpalji from Dubai. But I don't know anything about other active members who=
 are taking part in discussions. This will give a clear idea while reading =
the mail that who is he and where he is writing from.=A0 This is like a fam=
ily Forum and we need to know each other. if you agree to my view. 
I am Dr=
. Ashwin Rawal (age 61) from Ahmedabad, a retired Govt. Officer and a Colum=
nist in Newspapers doing practice on Astrology and Homoeopathy (freely now.=
)

Jay Shri Krashana Amit Bhai,

you did not provide wrong in=
formation. Niti Shataka was also from 
*Bharathri* - (No spelling mistake h=
ere- My Grandma use to 
pronounciate like that).

***
Few beings are consid=
ered Chiranjivis in our sanaatan Dharma. as you 
mentioned - Parshuraam, As=
watthama. i'll add Hanumaan ji to it.

I don't remember exactly but my gran=
d father mentioned to me in my 
childhood, Bhartuhari's name also in the sa=
me batch of chiranjivis. 
but not sure.
i didn't mention his name as one of=
 the chiranjivis because you said 
that he gives darshan some times to some=
 saadhaka. i just mentioned 
it becuase, his name was discussed and i had s=
ome information or mis 
information. I know:) that one need not be a chiran=
jivi (as per our 
classical text) to grant darshana to some modern aspirant=
s. by the 
way no body has visited me with sookshma sharira yet so i've no =

experience of that.

warm regards,

utpal
