I was recently reading some of the Interviews done by Manish ji on Krishna =
and existence of god in India . I remembered these articles about the disco=
very of Dwarka Underwater by Prof S R Rao who is an world renowned member o=
f the ASI .Both articles are from the Hindu. 

As usual the Main stream Pre=
ss does not give much weightage to correct version of history and does not =
bother to support evidence of existence of sanatana dharma because that wou=
ld spoil their pet timeline theories.The red pottery discovered at this loc=
ations puts the age of the cities to more than 3500 yrs ago...

Interested =
people can browse.

Unfortunately due to lack of funds and mismanagement by govt the u=
nderwater structures are getting eroded .
