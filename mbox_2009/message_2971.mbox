 "As worldly people are endowed with sattva, rajas, and tamas,so also is
bakti characterized by the three gunas.

"Do you know what a worldly person endowed with sattva is like? Perhaps his
house is in a dilapidated condition here and there. He doesn't care to
repair it. The worship hall may be strewn with pigeon droppings and the
courtyard covered with moss, but he pays no attention to these things.

The furniture of the house may be old; he doesn't think of polishing it and
making it look neat. He doesn't care for dress at all; anything is good
enough for him. But the man himself is very gentle,quiet, kind, and humble;
he doesn't injure anyone.

"Again, among the worldly there are people with the traits of rajas. Such a
man has a watch and chain, and two or three rings on his fingers. The
furniture of his house is all spick and span.

On the walls hang portraits of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and other
prominent people; the building is whitewashed and spotlessly clean.His
wardrobe is filled with a large assortment of clothes; even the servants
have their livery, and all that.

"The traits of a worldly man endowed with tamas are sleep, lust, anger,
egotism,and the like.
