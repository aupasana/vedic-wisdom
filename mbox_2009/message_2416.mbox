Hi,
=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 Your are a very LUCKY person who have such a Deity in your family. You =
should never ever think of giving it away or any other such wrong thing. Do=
 we throw away or immerse in water our Good Fortune???

=A0Do not worry for=
 a single second if you are not able to do Puja now. Ask HIM TO Guide you a=
nd other members of your family for puja or worship etc.

I have written fr=
om my personal experience. I usually do not write but I opened my PC and sa=
w your post and could not believe it and others response to it.

Take care.=

OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya

Dear All,

Th=
is ia my first posting in this forum.

Am writing in as am in need of advic=
e regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during puja in our home. Thi=
s idol has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house sinc=
e the last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Gane=
sha with its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it dai=
ly in a dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these y=
ears. It was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my fath=
er who has been seeing it since then. 

I feel that it is better to donate =
it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there for so lo=
ng in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremel=
y grateful if I could have advice as to what would be the correct thing to =
do and how to go about doing the same.

Kindly pardon me if this is not the=
 appropriate forum for such a query.

Thanks,
Ramesh M
Bangalore
