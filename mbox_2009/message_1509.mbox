 mentioned.

I think this is happeninign because of the homas. Some the =
fire of digestion of food gets affected by homas. Actually after this stoma=
ch problem started, and it has been every day for more than a month and hal=
f now, I reduced my food intake at night. I nowadays take about one chapati=
 or maximum two. But I am thinkinh, should I include more fruits kind of di=
et? Will that help?

Namaste Rajarshi ji,

I know you must have t=
aken medical advise.

what i suggest is lesser intake then normally what yo=
urintake at night.

If you are eating 5 chapatis, try to make it 3 or so. t=
he point is that stumach shood not be full at night. that might help.

one =
more suggetion if it is acceptable to you.
I chant following mantra while s=
tarting dinner (or whenever start eating) and also pray :'Mother please rem=
ove any impurties from the food and digest it in such a way that it doesnot=
 result in to any bad thoughts but help in purifying the negativity'.

"Ann=
apurne Sadaapurne Shankar Praan Vallabhe,
Gnyaan vairaagya sidhyartham, Bhi=
kshaaNdehich paarvati"

just my 0.5 sents,

warm regards,

utpal
