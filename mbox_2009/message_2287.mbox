A devotee asked Bhagavan, =93Swamiji! One has to meditate in order to enqui=
re
about his self. When I sit for meditation, I go to sleep. What can I do?=
 Is
there any way out?=94 Bhagavan replied, =93First learn to be awake when=
 you are
in the wakeful state. Then we can think of the sleeping state. We =
dream of
many things even when we are awake. We must learn to guard ourselv=
es against
them in our waking state. All that we see about us is a dream. W=
e should
wake up from this dream world.=94

The questioner said, =93Sadhana=
 is required to acquire that carefulness.
Whenever I decide upon some metho=
d and try to do sadhana, I get sleepy. Will
Bhagavan kindly tell me how to =
overcome this sleepiness?=94

Bhagavan replied: =93Of the avarana-vikshepas=
 (obstructions and disturbances),
the first avarana is sleep. We must try a=
s far as possible not to succumb to
it. We must enquire why we get sleep an=
d regulate our food, movements, etc.
and see that we do not feel sleepy, bu=
t it is no use trying to stop it when
once we are sleepy. Don=92t we get sl=
eep if we eat heartily? Then the head
begins to nod as we sit for meditatio=
n. It seems some tie their hair to a
nail in the wall to keep them awake. E=
xcept that they wake up when their
head nods, what use is it for dhyana? My=
 boyhood experience of sleep is well
known. While the school lessons were b=
eing taught, lest I should fall
asleep, I used to tie a thread to the nail =
on the wall, and tie my hair to
it. When the head nods, the thread is pulle=
d tight and that used to wake me
up. Otherwise, the teacher used to twist m=
y ears and wake me up.=94 So saying,
Bhagavan began to laugh.

=93Is it pos=
sible Bhagavan is concocting all these stories and telling us?=94
asked Mur=
uganar.

=93No, no! It is true! I used to do all that because I was afraid =
the teacher
would punish me for not listening to his lessons. That was the =
state in
those days.In the early days after my coming here, when I closed m=
y eyes,
deeply absorbed in meditation I hardly knew whether it was day or n=
ight. If
at any time I opened my eyes I used to wonder whether it was night=
 or day. I
had no food and no sleep. When there is movement of the body, yo=
u need food.
If you have food, you need sleep. If there is no movement, you=
 do not need
sleep. Very little food is enough to sustain life. That used t=
o be my
experience. Somebody or other used to offer me a tumblerful of some=
 liquid
diet whenever I opened my eyes. That was all. But one thing: except=
 when one
is in absorbed motionless concentration of mind, it is not possib=
le to give
up sleep or food altogether. When the body and mind are engaged =
in the
ordinary pursuits of life, the body reels if you give up food and
sl=
eep.Therefore
it must be said that limitation of food and movement is very =
necessary for
the elevation of the soul.Great people restrict their sleep t=
o the barest
minimum so that they may not waste their time but use it for t=
he performance
of selfless good deeds. Some say that it is healthy to go to=
 bed at 10 p.m.
and wake up at 2 a.m. That means that four hours=92 sleep i=
s enough. Some say
that four hours=92 sleep is not enough, but that it shou=
ld be six hours. It
amounts to this, that sleep and food should not be take=
n in excess. If you
want to cut off either of them completely, your mind wi=
ll always be directed
towards it. Therefore the sadhaka should do everythin=
g in moderation,=94 said
Bhagavan.

This is what is stated in the Bhagavad =
Gita:

Yoga is not for him who eats too much, nor who abstains to excess, n=
or who
is too much addicted to sleep nor even to wakefulness. Yoga kills ou=
t all
pain for him who is regulated in eating and amusement, regulated in
p=
erforming actions, and regulated in sleeping and waking.
