is living (organisms). Death is part and parcel of natural law. One cannot =
avoid it however much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are heavy on non-v=
eg food. The areas where they grew, arid, desert land, you need to have (at=
 least during those days) animal flesh to survive specially considreing irr=
igation options were so scanty.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 If you live in the Art=
ic region, you need to have fish oil to survive the cold. The=C3=83=E2=80=
=9A=C3=82 point is, death is a part of life. One does not survive without d=
eath. That is how the world has been designed by the grand designer.
