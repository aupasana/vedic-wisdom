to normalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense=
 of bliss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.

 He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became worried and to=
ok him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found no=
thing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one month. They put hi=
m on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doc=
tors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understa=

says he understands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He do=

know how to get it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material =
life will not get him what he wants.

get it permanently now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also to=
ok him to many so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice=
 given anyone. He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and like=

great spiritual potential.
