Respected Narasihma ji,

When I read Shri Ram ji's mail and some responses =
from fellow members, I
wished to write him saying please don't immerse Lord=
 Ganesha's idol. If at
all you decide to give away then, please give me you=
r address so that I can
come and take Lord Ganesha to my home in Dubai.

Be=
cause, my belief is God can never do anything wrong to us. Even we commit
s=
ome blunders he would not even think of punishing us. In my purview, god
tr=
eat us like new born babies. Can a mother think of punishing her child
when=
 it does something wrong? In fact I think in this way, when we do
something=
 wrong, like mother god starts thinking of how to protect us from
those pos=
sible results (evil effects) of our misconduct.

So I firmly believe that, =
God will never think of punishing. Yes it is quite
appropriate to believe t=
hat when we grow and keep on repeating mistakes then
yes we are bound to ge=
t punishments. But those punishment will surely be for
betterment only. Thi=
s is how I take it.

When I scroll down I found your message and it is so m=
uch enlightening to
all of us. We are really so lucky to a person like you =
as spiritual guide.
In fact I think God has sent you to enlighten us.

Plea=
se continue enlightening all of us.

With thanks,
*Omprakash*

re than 120 years 
ago, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Kaali t=

Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shri=

idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there so=

another priest was carrying the idol duri=

quandary and conferred to decide what to do=

OM Namo Bhagva=
te Venkateshaya<br>> <br>> Dear All,<br>> <br>> This 
ia my fir=
st posting in this forum.<br>> <br>> Am writing in as am in need 
of =
advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during puja in our home=
. 
This idol has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our hous=
e since 
the last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Sh=
ri Ganesha 
with its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worshi=
p it daily in a 
dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this al=
l these years. It was 
infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as p=
er my father who has been 
seeing it since then. <br>> <br>> I feel t=
hat it is better to donate it to 
a temple which would worship it daily. As=
 it has been there for so long in the 
house we are feeling hesitant about =
doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I 
could have advice as to what =
would be the correct thing to do and how to go 
about doing the same.<br>&g=
t; <br>> Kindly pardon me if this is not the 
appropriate forum for such=
 a query.<br>> <br>> Thanks,<br>> Ramesh 
M<br>> Bangalore <br>=
