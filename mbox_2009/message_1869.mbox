Namaste,

I googled and noted that Purusha Suktam verses are available in a=
ll the four vedas. 

When I searched about Sri Suktam, I could not get that=
 kind of information. Is Sri Suktam available only in Rig Veda?

Can any on=
e advise me what would be the benefits of chanting each of the suktams? For=
 example, I understand that those who desire material benefits will chant S=
ri Suktam. What about Purusha Suktam, Vishnu Suktam, Narayana Suktam, Rudra=
m, Chamakam, etc etc?

Thanks and Regards,
Shankar
