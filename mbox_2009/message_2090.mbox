Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams

While on this thread, I wish to share a recent interesting experience. I had
booked a Ganesha homam and abhishekam in the Aswatha Vinayaka temple,
T.Nagar, Madras. This temple was for many years run by an old priest and I
remember as a small child partaking of the extremely delicious panchamrita
that the old priest made with his bare hands. Now the baton has passed to
his sons and one son was conducting the homam in the temple.

After the sankalpam, invocation etc., the priest got ready to make the
offerings for each mantra recited. He used what appeared to be the dried
garlands of flowers from the idol. I was thinking why is he using such items
instead of havan samagri or someother items. To my surprise, when the priest
added the dried garlands, the fire blazed up suddenly and my wife, sitting
by the side of me, involuntarily stepped back a few inches! This taught me a
good lesson that I should leave it to the fire to judge what it likes and
what it doesnt like! I guess the vibrations from the garlands that
previously adorned the idol were so powerful that the fire accepted it
gleefully!

Another interesting thing was that the fire continued to blaze vigorously
and burnt for a long time after the poornahuti offering was completed.

best regards
Hari
