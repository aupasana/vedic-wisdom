Namaste

Some time back I read in a news paper that some folks in Modasa, G=
ujarat have organised on a grand scale Chandi Homams and the acitvity is go=
ing to go on for some years atleast.

They have invited pandits and purohit=
s from all parts of india and daily are doing some homans. 

May be people =
close to the region can report more accurate news and the logic behind cond=
ucting Candi Paath Homams on this grand scale.

It is on a very grand scale=
.

A few years ago I believe the Present Spiritual Head of Saacha Baba Ashr=
am in Hrishikesh or Hardware conducted for many months Candi Paath Homams. =
It was more than Shaat Chandi, I donot know what is the next one level up.
=

Best Regards
Mitesh
