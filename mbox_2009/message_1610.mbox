If casts are determined by the nature, why did Parasurama deny Karna to tea=
ch. More over, Parasurama identifies him as a kshatriya. Karna did not show=
 any hunger for power. He showed the qualities of a sudra/sevaka. The only =
kshatriya quality demonstrated by him is the liking for wars!

Gauthama rej=
ects to teach a boy a he is not a brahmin.
Rama killed a sudra (not sure if=
 this was reliable) for doing tapam. How do we justify all of these?

Also,=
 Ravana is a brahmin (Rama gets Brahmahatya patakam after killing Ravana) e=
ven as all he showed is the huger for power and ego. He has learn vedas but=
, mere learning does not make him a brahmana. Going by that, Karna acted li=
ke a brahmin and learnt quite a few things from Parasurama. But, Parasurama=
 calls him a kshatriya and banishes him.

Drona was a brahmin, but he showe=
d hatred and anger not suitable for a brahmin (towards Drupada).

Best rega=
rds,
Vijay.
