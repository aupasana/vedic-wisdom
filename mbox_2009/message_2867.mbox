 27th June, 1947

=93That was when I was still in Virupaksha Cave and about=
 four or five years
after I came to Tiruvannamalai. It is a funny story.

O=
ne day when Palaniswamy and myself went round the hill and came near the
te=
mple it was 8 p.m. As we were tired, I lay down in Subrahmanya temple.
Pala=
ni went out to fetch food from the choultry.

He (the head of the mutt) was=
 going into the temple. As usual there were a
number of disciples around hi=
m. One of them saw me and told them about it.
That was enough.

While retur=
ning, he came with ten of his disciples and stood around me. He
began sayin=
g, =91Get up, Swami. We shall go.=92 I was in mouna then, so I showed
by si=
gns that I wouldn=92t accompany them. Was he the man to listen to me?

=91L=
ift him up bodily, lift,=92 he said to his disciples. As there was no
alter=
native, I got up. When I came out, there was a bandy ready. =91Get in,
Swam=
i,=92 he said. I declined and showed them by signs that I would prefer to
w=
alk and suggested that he should get into the bandy. He took no notice of
m=
y protestations.

Instead, he told his disciples, =91What are you looking a=
t? Lift Swami and put
him in the cart.=92 There were ten of them and I was =
alone. What could I do?
They lifted
me bodily and put me into the cart. Wit=
hout saying anything more, I went to
the mutt.

He had a big leaf spread ou=
t for me, filled it with food of all kinds,
showed great respect and began =
saying =91Please stay here always.=92 Palaniswami
went to the temple, enqui=
red about me and then came to the mutt.

After he came, I somehow managed t=
o escape from there.That was the only
occasion on which I got into a cart a=
fter coming to Tiruvannamalai.
Subsequently
whenever new people arrived the=
y sent a cart, asking me to go over to their
place.

If once I yielded, I w=
as afraid there would be no end to that sort of
invitation and so I sent ba=
ck the cart, refusing to go. Eventually they
stopped sending carts. But tha=
t was not the only trouble with them.
