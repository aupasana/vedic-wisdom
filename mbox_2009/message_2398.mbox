THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION (Delivered at Alameda, California, on April 18,
19=
00)
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses

Charity is great, but the moment you=
 say it is all, you run the risk of
running into materialism. It is not rel=
igion. It is no better than atheism -
a little less. ... You Christians, ha=
ve you found nothing else in the Bible
than working for fellow creatures, b=
uilding . . . hospitals ? . . . Here
stands a shopkeeper and says how Jesus=
 would have kept the shop! Jesus would
neither have kept a saloon, nor a sh=
op, nor have edited a newspaper.

What is the goal of it all? Can senses ev=
er be the goal? Can enjoyment of
pleasure ever be the goal? Can this life e=
ver be the goal of the soul? If it
is, better die this moment; do not want =
this life! If that is the fate of
man, that he is going to be only the perf=
ected machine, it would just mean
that we go back to being trees and stones=
 and things like that. Did you ever
hear a cow tell a lie or see a tree ste=
al? They are perfect machines. They
do not make mistakes. They live in a wo=
rld where everything is finished. ...

Where God is, there is no other. Whe=
re the world is, there is no God. These
two will never unite. [Like] light =
and darkness. That is what I have
understood from Christianity and the life=
 of the Teacher. Is not that
Buddhism? Is not that Hinduism? Is not that Mo=
hammedanism? Is not that the
teaching of all the great sages and teachers? =
What is the world that is to
be given up? It is here.

Great men have died.=
 Weak men have died. Gods have died. Death =97 death
everywhere. This world=
 is a graveyard of the infinite past, yet we cling to
this [body]: "I am ne=
ver going to die". Knowing for sure [that the body must
die] and yet clingi=
ng to it. There is meaning in that too [because in a
sense we do not die]. =
The mistake is that we cling to the body when it is
the spirit that is real=
ly immortal.

Practical religion is identifying myself with my Self. Stop t=
his wrong
identification! How far are you advanced in that? You may have bu=
ilt two
thousand hospitals, built fifty thousand roads, and yet what of tha=
t, if
you, have not realised that you are the spirit? You die a dog's; deat=
h, with
the same feelings that the dog does. The dog howls and weeps becaus=
e he
knows that he is only matter and he is going to be dissolved.

There i=
s death, you know, inevitable death, in water, in air, in the palace,
in th=
e prison - death everywhere. What makes you fearless? When you have
realise=
d what you are =97 that infinite spirit, deathless, birthless. Him no
fire =
can burn, no instrument kill, no poison hurt.

Not theory, mind you. Not re=
ading books. . . . [Not parroting.] My old
Master used to say, "It is all v=
ery good to teach the parrot to say, 'Lord,
Lord, Lord' all the time; but l=
et the cat come and take hold of its neck, it
forgets all about it" [You ma=
y] pray all the time, read all the scriptures
in the world, and worship all=
 the gods there are, [but] unless you realise
the soul there is no freedom.=
 Not talking, theorising, argumentation, but
realisation. That I call pract=
ical religion.

You must see God. The spirit must be realised, and that is =
practical
religion. It is not what Christ preached that you call practical =
religion:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heav=
en." Was it
a joke? What is the practical religion you are thinking, of? Lo=
rd help us!
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." That m=
eans
street-cleaning, hospital-building, and all that? Good works, when you=
 do
them with a pure mind.

The Kingdom of Heaven is within us. He is there=
. He is the soul of all
souls. See Him in your own soul. That is practical =
religion. That is
freedom. Let us ask each other how much we are advanced i=
n that: how much we
are worshippers of the body, or real believers in God, =
the spirit; how much
we believe ourselves to be spirit. That is selfless. T=
hat is freedom.

Excepting the infinite spirit, everything else is changing=
. There is the
whirl of change. Permanence is nowhere except in yourself. T=
here is the
infinite joy, unchanging. Meditation is the gate that opens tha=
t to us.
Prayers, ceremonials, and all the other forms of worship are simpl=
y
kindergartens of meditation. You pray, you offer something. A certain the=
ory
existed that everything raised one's spiritual power. The use of certai=
n
words, flowers, images, temples, ceremonials like the waving of lights
br=
ings the mind to that attitude, but that attitude is always in the human
so=
ul, nowhere else. [People] are all doing it; but what they do without
knowi=
ng it, do knowingly.

That is the power of meditation. All knowledge you ha=
ve =97 how did it come?
>From the power of meditation. The soul churned the =
knowledge out of its own
depths. What knowledge was there ever outside of i=
t? In the long run this
power of meditation separates ourselves from the bo=
dy, and then the soul
knows itself as it is =97 the unborn, the deathless, =
and birthless being. No
more is there any misery, no more births upon this =
earth, no more evolution.
[The soul knows itself as having] ever been perfe=
ct and free.
