Namaste,
 
Body is of course important in spiritual progress. Body is like a rented car used in a long journey. If one plans to finish a long journey using a rented car, one should put fuel in the car frequently and do basic maintenance. That is needed and there is nothing wrong in it. After all, if the car breaks down, one cannot reach the destination.
 
But my point is that one should not be so attached to the car that one stops every few miles, wipes the dust on the car, washes it and pulls over on every minor suspicious sound from the engine and so on. Such a person will never finish the journey. Moreover, such a person will be so attached to the car that he may be unable to return it even after reaching the destination.
 
One should take care of the body, but not be overly attached to it or concerned about it.
 
*        *        *
 
Yes, god IS in the body. But then god is in EVERYTHING. God is in a temple, a church, a mosque, a river like Ganges, a gutter next to a dirty lane, a garbage can and what not. God is in the entire universe - he lives in every atom and every sub-atomic particle. Why then special attachment to one specific body in which also god happens to be, among many other things?
 
Let me give a simple analogy to explain the thrust of my main point.
 
Milk may be present inside khoa, cheese, yogurt, baasundi, cake, a curry, kaju katli, sooji halwa, mutter paneer, motichoor laddoo, dum aloo and so many other things. If a person particularly likes kaju katli and does not like other things as much, it is probably not the underlying milk that he likes but the kaju katli itself. He cannot say "I like kaju katli because it contains milk".
 
Similarly, one attached to one's body is probably not devoted to the underlying god within that body, but devoted to the body itself.
 
In fact, finding the milk inside kaju katli may first require one to reduce eating kaju katli and eat something that has more milk in it than kaju katli (e.g. khoa) regularly and get used to the milk taste. Then, one will taste milk even when eating kaju katli, even though kaju (cashew) is the main ingredient in it and not milk, because of one's familiarity with and attachment to the milk taste.
 
Similarly, finding god inside one's body may first require one to reduce attention to one's body and focus the mind on a specific form of divinity (e.g. a deity such as Vishnu or Shiva or Ganesha or Durga). After one's mind tastes divinity in that form and get used to it, one will taste divinity in one's own self as well as everything one sees, because of one's familiarity with and attachment to the taste of that form.
 
*        *        *
 
Most embodied beings identify with body, name and other attributes (e.g. "a great actor", "a path-breaking engineer", "a good scholar" etc) quite strongly. When that identity is destroyed by Nature at the end of life, some disappointment or regret may be left. IF such a thing happens, Nature will make one to be born again.
 
One will be born again and again, as khoa, as kaju katli, as dum aloo, as sooji halwa etc, until one realizes the underlying milk in all those things.
 
One will be born again and again until one goes through life with zero attachment with body, name and other attributes (e.g. "a great actor", "a path-breaking engineer", "a good scholar" etc) and has no disappointment or regret when they are destroyed at the end.

On the contrary, he strongly discouraged his students like Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda from practicing Hatha yoga because of its emphasis and reliance on the physical body and told them to forget about the body and think of god instead.
 
Ramakrishna had a throat cancer and several of his sishyas suffered tremendously towards the ends of their lives, but they succeeded in focusing the mind on god through the ordeals and passing the test. They did not do any "praanic healing" or something, but learnt to focus the mind on god despite obstacles thrown up by a really suffering body.
 
When Ramakrishna was suffering from cancer, some people told him a pure soul like him could cure himself by focussing his mind on such a thought. He said it made no sense to take the mind off the divine Mother even for a moment to ponder his physical condition.
 
Though not everyone can be like him, one can take inspiration.
 
*        *        *
 
Rajarshi, irrespective of whether one worships an ugra devata (fierce deity) or a soumya devata (gentle deity), one has to overcome the attachment to name, body and other attributes (e.g. "a great actor", "a path-breaking engineer", "a good scholar" etc). Without it, one is stuck in the cycle of life and death.
 
Ugra devatas may force the lesson on one fast and soumya devatas may take time. But a spiritual aspirant has to overcome this inherent weakness no matter which deity one worships.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

I try to lessen its pain and suffering using sattvic means so that it remains strong. I am respectful towards it and do not show mental disregard towards it. After all It is my vehicle towards salvation.
