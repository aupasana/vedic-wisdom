Dear Vinita,

Step 5 is where you are invoking God in the fire.

I do not r=
ecall the instructions for super short homam.
How ever, this is the flow:
1=
. You seek permission to do homam
2. Do pranayamam to calm yourself and foc=
us
3. You announce your intention of doing homam
4. You start the fire and =
purify it (by saying Om Bhu: swahA 8 times while dropping ghee)
5. pick any=
 deity and any mantra - This is where you are invoking god. If you do not k=
now the sanskrit slokas for invoking god, just say Oh <selected deity> plea=
se come and stay in the fire. Then you can recite the mantra with a om swah=
a in the end and drop a drop of ghee in the fire.
6. Put some thing for nai=
vedyam and conclude by om bhu swaha etc.
7. Put some raisins/plain cooked r=
ice for the ganas of the deity you selected around the homakundam and put t=
he dry coconut into the fire
(this is symbolisism for giving up your ego)
8=
. Do any kind of japam/dhyanam in front of the fire.
9. Invite the deity ba=
ck into you and pray the god to complete any thing you did incomplete and g=
ive away the doership of the homam to the god him self (i.e. try to convinc=
e yourself that God made you do the homam and you just carried on His will.=


Best regards,
Vijay

Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpa=
na, you are calling pitris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are appli=
cable to all people irrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong=
 or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.

e in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris c=
ome in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were=
 karmically inherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an =
ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the d=
eceased ancestor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from =
such thoughts due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas bec=
ause of the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on g=
iving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness is attach=
ed to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not =
affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a =
strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad=
 karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.
> >  
> >=
 Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identification =
is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your indiv=
idual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms=
 of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identific=
ation is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note t=
hat Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of =
astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respectively.
