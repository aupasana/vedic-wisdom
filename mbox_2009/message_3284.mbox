Namaste,
=C2=A0
Further to my mail below:
=C2=A0
The line in Ramcharit Mana=
s goes :
=C2=A0
|| Dhol Ganwaar Shudra Pashu Naari, Yah sab Taadan ke adhik=
ari ||
=C2=A0
Dhol =3D Drum
=C2=A0
Ganwaar =3D Illiterate
=C2=A0
Shudra =3D=
 Shudra
=C2=A0
Pashu =3D Animal
=C2=A0
Naari =3D Women
=C2=A0
Taadan =3D Be=
ating
=C2=A0
Therefore exact translation would be:
=C2=A0
Drum illiterate s=
hudra animal women, are fit to be beaten.
=C2=A0
One line of thinking, as s=
uggested by Utpal,=C2=A0is that it should be read "pashu-nari" (animalistic=
 women) and not just "animal, women". That is, pashu is an adjective for th=
e noun naari. 
=C2=A0
I don't agree. Nothing in the text suggests so.
=C2=
=A0
Secondly, we have not yet come to discussing the wisdom of advising a "=
tadan" for these above diverse=C2=A0group which includes a "gawaar" as well=
! Then by that logic, more than half of India should get a "taadan" because=
 more than half of India is illiterate.

Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
Some poi=
nts came to my mind. Thought of mailing them to you. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0Jumping =
on conclusion without properly studying/thinking about Thakur's life, just =
on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.
=C2=A0
You a=
re right. But since this is a debate and just a debate, =C2=A0let me put fo=
rth some logical points.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
1) Two wrongs never make a right. Th=
is is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When =
we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who=
 lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a different=
 debate. 
=C2=A0
2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He only=C2=A0wo=
ke up=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necessary and gave general talks =
on spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the biogra=
phers mistake. M or Saradananda=C2=A0could very well have been mistaken in =
what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a com=
position. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in think=
ing, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for the =
simple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out=C2=A0over =
huge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and that too talking to friends, o=
r close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence o=
ne speaks. 
=C2=A0
To understand this better,=C2=A0=C2=A0we have to think -=
 scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels. Aroun=
d 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent through =
body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or sub conscious communica=
tion. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person can use t=
his 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of people=
. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you listen t=
o the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But if =
you were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel an =
energy and get swayed.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Then comes body language which is so i=
mportant.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office in India, you m=
ay find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with th=
eir spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. =
That is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a=C2=A0snail's pace=
.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C2=A0is sitting cro=
ss legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the person =
may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure that ther=
e is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing out the w=
ords through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, once you=
 leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won't bother about what you said.
=C2=
=A0
And last is spoken word. When two people speak with each other, both wo=
rds and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious communicat=
ion too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exchanged/commun=
ica tion not through words but through other means. 
=C2=A0
When you write =
down something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be ext=
ra cautious while writing something in order to convey the correct sense. T=
hat is why there are so many more rules to be followed=C2=A0for writing any=
thing.
=C2=A0
So therefore, if Ramakrishna is "talking" to someone he is pr=
obably communicating using all means possible. But if he were to write a bo=
ok and mention "Kamini and Kanchan" without further explanation of what he =
intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. But he never wrote =
any books, and the authors who did, made sure they explained the sense. 
=
=C2=A0
Contrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, without any qualif=
ications, that implies "women", "sudra", "pashu" are worthy of "tadan".=C2=
=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C2=A0to that line.=C2=A0 
=C2=
=A0
3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious literature, I keep the K=
oran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judging a book of religio=
us nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement that I use when I judg=
e the Koran as a book.
=C2=A0
The Koran contains a verse, translated correc=
tly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, which recommend husbands to=
 beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. 
=C2=A0

"Men are the maint=
ainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and bec=
ause they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedien=
t, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose par=
t you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping=
 places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against the=
m; surely Allah is High, Great. (Shakir's version of the Koran, Quran, 4:34=
) 
=C2=A0
A lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the above=C2=A0giving v=
arious reasons one of which is 'misunderstanding context'. I find it inexcu=
sable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing "nari", "pashu", "sud=
ra" together, I find=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. That is the sense that=
 comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not commenting on the w=
hole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.

=C2=
=A0
Interesting doha. Maybe you are right, maybe you are not. But that line=
 (pashu/naari etc)=C2=A0definitely conveys a simple meaning. If=C2=A0Tulasi=
dasji ment what you are saying, he should have used some appropiate punctua=
tion marks. Since he did not, I have to reject your explanation. Or I can s=
ay, Tulasidasji respects women a lot, but that line is simply a bad composi=
tion. One way or the other, I cannot absolve the composer of that specific =
line.
=C2=A0
BTW,=C2=A0 were you refering to the Gita verse 1.41 where Arju=
na talks about women of the family getting corrupted?
=C2=A0
You and I've n=
otably common Astrological factors in our chart. Astrologer in me found out=
 just few days back but I'll not give it hear for the obvious reason lest o=

I am sure we will make ve=

=C2=A0
Once, long back when I was furiously d=

e me some invaluable advices which I stick by even today. Thought of sharin=

=C2=A0
"=C2=A0I find it=C2=A0is always best to =
debate online if one is keen on finding the correct resolution. Face to fac=

Dear(est) Rajarshi,
back engineering job to bail out
Vow! R=
efreshing phrase.=C2=A0 Too good. It seems a season of debating. Branches o=
f threads are coming out.
'Kamini and `Kanchan' was the exact words which=
=C2=A0Ramakrishna used freely during his life time. Now Kamini means a woma=
n and its possible that several sections would have taken reservation at th=
is. That seems very obvious otherwise why Swami Sardananda required to defe=
nd Thakur in his book called Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. It seemed to me that=
 Paramahansa Yogananda also have referred to this issue without mentioning =
Thakur's name directly (I may be wrong but i strongly felt like that when i=
 read the 'Autobiography of a yogi' some 4/5 years back). Sardanada in a se=
nse did 'Back engineering job to bail out :)'=C2=A0. If we go by 'Kamini' w=
ord=C2=A0literaly, then Thakur=C2=A0could be portrayed as Women basher.=C2=
=A0 but we all know that Thakur refffered to Lust and=C2=A0Desire of=C2=A0w=
orldly objects whenever he spoke those two words. Jumping on conclusion wit=
hout properly studying/thinking about Thakur's life, just on literal meanin=
g of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.
Same way, I also thought abou=
t Sant Tulasi das ji. I=C2=A0was telling=C2=A0myself that can a saint of hi=
s devotion and poetic skills and add to that steadfastly devoted to Lord Ra=
ma (Who never shown slightest dis-resepct to =C2=A0women) , utter such word=
s and saggrigate 'Nari' for nothing. I was not convinced.=C2=A0 One of the =
'Dohas' of Tulasi Das goes like this -
[Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C2=

Inase agar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||
=
(I have given=C2=A0this doha =C2=A0out of memory and its quite possible tha=
t first two=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C2=A0
If a poet is asking to=
 look at a woman as a Mother, how could he mean 'Nari' to be 'Tadan Adhikar=
i'? As you pointed out,=C2=A0 on a look at surface (at the levelof text), i=
t means which many belives but you and me need to look at little deeper. A =
person who did the world of Good to Indias ordinary masses by rewriting the=
 whole Ramayana in a language which people (from north) could easily unders=
tand, The man who gave immortal 'Hanumaan Chalisa' can not be lebeled so ca=
sually as 'Nari basher' or 'Shudra Hater' (As Mayaavati brand poticians wou=
ld capitalise).
Regarding your questions of why Pashu are only Nari and not=
 Nara ....
I think he was reffering=C2=A0to=C2=A0 Men with the words Ganvaa=
r and Shudra=C2=A0and Pashu Nari must be a joint statement. Again as you al=
ready know, Shudra was not B.C., OBC, KBC, HSBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man=
, a mean thinking man. I have to agree if you say that Ganvaar and Shudra c=
an also be said about Woaman=C2=A0however looking at the Doha and general=
=C2=A0prevailing conditions of society, it seems that he used those words f=
or Men.=C2=A0
Grammar...Hmmmm. i don't know if he has really used proper gr=
ammer in such Dohas.
There are=C2=A0verse in Bhagvad Gita which=C2=A0can be=
 criticised by people from other faiths if they are taken literaly and with=
out understanding personality of Krishna .
***
Regarding Ramachandra, Thank=
 you for making clear, your notable friend's view and your detailed explana=
tion by giving examples. =C2=A0But again i don't think that to consider Ram=
a as God will actually be blockage in leading life like him and that too wh=
en almost everybody in Sanatan Dharma knows him as God. Tthat is not revers=
ible in any case. And above all, Incarnation of Lord Vishnu - He is a GOD

said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed R=

a's abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard way of des=

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Some points came to my mind.=
 Thought of mailing them to you. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DGeorgia><EM> Jumping on conclusion without properly studying/thinki=
ng about Thakur's life, just on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a=
 sure blasphemy.</EM></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><EM><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT></E=
M> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>You are right. But since this is a=
 debate and just a debate,  let me put forth some logical points. =
; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DGeorgia>1) Two wrongs never make a right. This is one mistake we India=
ns do when we try to debate over something. When we are discussing Tulasida=
sji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who lived in a different cent=
ury - was right or now. That would be a different debate. </FONT></DIV>
<DI=
V><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>2) Ram=
akrishna did not write anything -:). He only woke up people to wh=
at ever degree was necessary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, on=
e can always contend that a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Sar=
adananda could very well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving =
a freewheeling talk is different from creating a composition. When one writ=
es, one has more time and energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up po=
ssibilities of different shades of meanings for the simple reason that the =
audience is large, unknown and spread out over huge spans of time.&nbs=
p;When one talks, and that too talking to friends, or close people, one doe=
s not need to be careful of every word or sentence one speaks. </FONT></DIV=
>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>T=
o understand this better,  we have to think - scientifically spea=
king - how communication happens in three levels. Around 33 percent of the =
communication is through the words, 64 percent through body language and a =
solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or sub conscious communication. This last thre=
e percent is the most powerful. When a person can use this 3 percent of sub=
 conscious communication - he can move masses of people. All great leaders =
do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an a=
verage rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But if you were to be prese=
nt in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel an energy and get swaye=
d.  </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><=
FONT face=3DGeorgia>Then comes body language which is so important. Fo=
r example, if you enter a Govt office in India, you may find that the =
babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with their spine reclini=
ng. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. That is why the f=
iles in Govt. of India offices move at a snail's pace. If you fin=
d that someone whom you are talking to is sitting cross legged on a ch=
air, with left leg crossing the right, even if the person may hang on eager=
ly to every word you speak, know it for the sure that there is a strong cha=
nge he is listening through one ear and throwing out the words through the =
other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, once you leave his presen=
ce he probably won't bother about what you said.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FO=
NT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>And last is=
 spoken word. When two people speak with each other, both words and body la=
nguage come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious communication too can hap=
pen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exchanged/communica tion not th=
rough words but through other means. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgi=
a></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>When you write down somethi=
ng, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious =
while writing something in order to convey the correct sense. That is why t=
here are so many more rules to be followed for writing anything.</FONT=
></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeo=
rgia>So therefore, if Ramakrishna is "talking" to someone he is probably co=
mmunicating using all means possible. But if he were to write a book and me=
ntion "Kamini and Kanchan" without further explanation of what he intends t=
o mean, then he too can be called to question. But he never wrote any books=
, and the authors who did, made sure they explained the sense. </FONT></DIV=
