Namaste friends,
 
One gentleman asked me a question privately. He does hom=
am everyday. Originally, he was doing inside the house with a small fire (a=
 few dry coconut pieces). In the summer and autumn, he was doing in his gar=
age with a big fire (wood logs). At that time, he observed that a particula=
r thing was happening within himself during homam. In the winter, he moved =
back inside the house and switched to small fire. The homam was still nice,=
 but that particular thing stopped happening. Recently, he did with a big f=
ire again and the same thing occurred again.
 
So he concluded that homam w=
ith a big fire is more effective than homam with a small fire. If doing hom=
am with a big fire increases your fire, he wondered if doing homam with a s=
mall fire lowers your fire. He asked me to shed some light.
 
*        *   =

Look at it like this. If you spend time in the company of a saint =
who is more advanced than you, some of the saintly qualities in him may rub=
 on you. Similarly, spending some time with a big fire increases the bhoota=
agni inside you and burn bloockages. If one is pure enough already, it can =
even give some experiences.
 
If you spend time in the company of a spiritu=
al person who is not of the same stature, it is still a good thing. It is b=
etter than wasting time in the company of worldly people. You may not get t=
he same benefit as you do when you meet a great saint, but atleast your min=
d is thinking about spiritual things.
 
Thus, homam with a big fire is simi=
lar to spending time in the company of a great saint and homam with a small=
 fire is similar to spending time in the company of a normal spiritual pers=
on. Both are good, but the former is better.
 
*        *        *
 
Howeve=
r, those who cannot do homam with a big fire because of the conditions they=
 live in can still do homam with a small fire and benefit from it.
 
Best r=
egards,
Narasimha
