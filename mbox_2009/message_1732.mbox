Dear Sir,

The Karma and its various aspect as explained are clarly underst=
andable. From the following quote few question arises

"Karma is not just g=
ood and bad things we do to people. It is also the thoughts entertained by =
the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think "how I wish I had such a car=
". Any action or thought that has some force behind it becomes a karma and =
gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance is sufficient in a fut=
ure life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or not you want it in th=
at life! You may not know why you got it, but you got it because you asked =
for it earlier.

Nature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list =
and your debt list. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to p=
ay back your debts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account t=
o pay for things on your wish list."

When we are small child we have vario=
us wish.... say unlimited some of which we remeber and some we may not.

In=
 the current life itself we find some wish fulfilled and some remain unfulf=
illed and some have been forgetten by the end of this cycle of life.

Now, =
all those desire and thoughts which have force of our little childhood brai=
n remain as our Karma to be carried by us? How to mitgate those? How the ba=
lance in the bank of the Nature for our wish list be withdrawn and debts be=
 reduced in the present life cycle?

Kindly enlighten 
Sincerely yours
Gane=
sh Gulati
