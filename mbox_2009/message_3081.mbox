Dear Sri Narasimhagaru, 

Thank your for your response on Spiritual advice =
directing me to do Ganapathi Homam. I am going to follow the advice. Anyway=
, I have some other questions now. I have learnt how to perform Ganapathi H=
omam and Gayatri Homam from our local priest (we used to call him Sharmaji.=
 He is no longer here and moved to Texas) here in Michigan. He taught me a =
procedure called "Chatushpatra Prayogam" that I use for these Homams. I hav=
e also reviewed your pdf files, the audio mp3s and videos for many homams t=
hat have been described in your site and noticed that your documents do inc=
lude what Our priest taught and more. So, I am thinking of following your p=
rocedure. Also, Our Sharmaji used to perform the homam in our Wood Burning =
Fire Place. From your video, I understand that you are doing it in open, in=
 a room. How do you control Smoke so that it won't darken the ceiling and t=
he walls? Is it ok to do it in Wood Burning fire place? The only problem I =
see in doing it in fireplace is that I cannot do pradakshinam to the fire (=
in case that is needed), and it is not convenient to reach back of the homa=
 kundam to put the darbhas and other puja materials. Also more than one Rit=
vik cannot do the homam in case I am involving other people. How much do th=
ese matter? One other procedure our Sharmaji instructed is that it is prefe=
rable that Ganapathi homam be performed on Shukla Chaturthi and before the =
sunrise and he said that we should put modakas in the fire. What do you say=
 about those aspects. I know purity of mind and sincerety in performing thi=
s ritual is of paramount importance than the ritualistic details, but I wan=
t to follow the prescribed procedures to the extent possible.
