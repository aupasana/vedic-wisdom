My Brahma Muhurt Pranaams,

I should also thank you because the whole y'day=
 i was thinking about Tulasi das and how should i write about him.

Even in=
 my morning Japa, i was thinkng about him and Rama. its a feel good sign th=
at it was a Hanumaan Jayanti which i later came to know of(As per south ind=
ian they celebrate it with the start of Dhanur Maasa). Your Guru (you need =
to update the data base of this list wherein you are still waiting....in th=
e column of Guru) also said Jai sri Ram. these are all seems to be not with=
out reasons. Bhagavan Rama may have already given a message!

By the way yo=
u can ask me to recite Hanumaan Chalisa getting me out of sleep and i'll re=
cite it like a parrot :)

few more before i end.....
