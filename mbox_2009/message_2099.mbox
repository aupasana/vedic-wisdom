Dear PVR,
An interesting story. Though this is not an astrological forum (a=
s u rightly emphasised), but for sake of sprituality, what are general indi=
cations in one's chart which indicates sprituality?
Regards,
sanjeev sharma=

ichael Jackson. Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into pr=
escription medicines and how that ruins some people's lives. That somehow r=

s brilliant from the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale com=
binations. I declared, "this is not the chart of a materialistic person, bu=
t that of a sannyasi (ascetic/monk)." She broke down into tears and gave me=
 some background. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life a=
nd his mother does not want him to.

 contented and an introvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage da=
ys, he had an interesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His fath=
er was teaching math to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those =
voices. Suddenly, he stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anyth=
ing for a while. His mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mi=
nd returned to normalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a trem=
endous sense of bliss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he f=
elt then.
>  
> He realized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing=
 in front of what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do anyth=
ing anymore. He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became wo=
rried and took him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain =
and found nothing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one month.=
 They put him on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept tel=
ling the doctors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they would =
not understand what he experienced. After a month, those doctors concluded =
he was normal and had no problem. The powerful drugs he received during the=
 month wreaked havoc on him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or =
doctors. He says he understands his parents love him and hence they did all=
 this. He does not want to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants b=
ut does not know how to get it. But he knows that regular studies and regul=
ar material life will not get him what he wants.
>  
> When I chatted with =
him alone, I realized that he is a brilliant young man with clear thinking.=
 He is certainly not a mad person. He just needs someone to show him a spir=
itual path to make something permanent, which temporarily came to him and l=
eft him! To get it permanently now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His par=
ents also took him to many so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied wit=
h the advice given anyone. He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few oth=
ers and liked some of them. But he is still without a clear direction.

> Interestingly, just when I was about to chat with this person after makin=
g his parents leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked me what was going o=
n. I mentioned that I was about to talk to a teenager who had a nice chart.=
 He asked for the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed my feeling that t=
his boy had great spiritual potential.
>  
> Unfortunately, the system we h=
ave in place looked at him with suspicion and gave powerful drugs to mess u=
p his mind for one full month! He is lucky and survived the ordeal. This is=
 a sign of the times we live in that someone who realizes, albeit momentari=
ly, the essence of scriptures, is labeled as a mentally disturbed person an=
d powerful drugs are given to him, instead of clear spiritual direction to =
make that realization more permanent.
