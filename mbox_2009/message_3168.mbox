NAMASKAR

Dear Narasimha Ji,

I really enjoyed my Tirupati-Tirumala visit l=
ast week, I remembered your advice...may lord VENKATESH grant my prayer...I=
 seek lights on my correct paths...

Could you please suggest a simple "Lak=
shmi-Narasimha Mantra" for me for chanting everyday? I have found some "Sto=
tra" or "mala mantra" but I need a simple one to be easily remembered for c=
hanting everytime...

Please Suggest...

best regards,
Biswajit

NB: I foun=
d a mantra but don't know which one is correct version...I want to rely on =
the teachings on our great Maharshis...

1. OM HRIM KSHYOUM SHRIM SRILAKSHM=
INRISIMHAYA NAMO
2. OM HRIM KSHYOUM SHRIM LAKSHMINRISIMKAYA NAMO

If I cons=
truct a mantra like "OM NAMO BHAGABATE SRILAKSHMINRISIMHAYA NAMO", is it wo=
rk like 5-akshari 16-syllable mantra? I know construction of mantra are not=
 a such simple one, that's why I want to rely on that "mystic hymens" taugh=
t by our vedic rishis and proved one...
