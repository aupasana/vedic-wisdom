Namaste

Good informa=
tion,

May I add one more place, that is located in Rajkot Gujarat,
Ranchod=
 Vadi, the Ranchoddasji Maharaj's ashram.

They are also doing 24 by 7 unin=
terrupted ram dhun for many many years. I do not remember the exact years b=
ut I may not be surprised if it is also 25 plus years.

When visit India, I=
 visit this place and do raamdhun for few minutes.
People in staying in raj=
kot are lucy, they can swing by the place all the time at their convinience=
.

Best Regards
Mitesh
