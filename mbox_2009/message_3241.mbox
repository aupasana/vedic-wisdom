My previous mail went off incomplete.
=C2=A0
Gandhiji's stat=
ement=C2=A0"The=C2=A0path of Truth is through Ahimsa (Non-Violence) ....".=
=C2=A0 is probably the loose english translation of the famous saying "Ahim=
sa Paramo Dharma."
=C2=A0
This reminded me of two things. One, I do not agr=
ee=C2=A0with Gandhiji.=C2=A0 Two, there is another part of this statement "=
Dharma himsa tathaiva cha".
=C2=A0
Taken together it becomes... "Ahimsa Par=
amo Dharma, Dharma himsa tathaiva cha".
(Non-violence is the ultimate dharm=
a. So too is violence in service of Dharma.)
=C2=A0
This I find very accept=
able. Now if the question arises what is Dharma, I would request going back=
 to the mails of Narasmiha on Dharma, because no one has explained swa-dhar=
ma as beautifully as he has done in his mails in this forum.
=C2=A0
Interes=
tingly, a thought came to me. The heading of this mail says (Mother gave th=
e confirmation!). So true. For Utpal it was one sort of confirmation, for m=
e another sort. Through the same sentence the Universe can teach different =
things to different people.

Namaste All,
I again give link to my I=
nitial message which wasn't responded to.
http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=
edic- wisdom/message/ 411
I repost some later part of the message below:
Bu=
t am I wrong in thinking this way? Am I wrong in my efforts to make
them un=
derstand my view point? Though I never pressurize or irritate
anybody on th=
e issue.
Some times I feel that if most of the humans on earth eat meat, fi=
sh
and eggs then is there any fundamental misconception about it? can
there=
 be so many people wrong in their food habits. But in any case,
for me I=C2=
=A1=C2=A6ll stick to veg food simply.....
***
I got the Final conclusive Co=
nfirmation to my=C2=A0view point=C2=A0yesterday in quite an interesting way=
. Yesterday evening i went to a mall along with some family friends. Occasi=
on being my marriage anniversary.=C2=A0=C2=A0One senior friend, whom i resp=
ect very much, who is also=C2=A0a vegetarian, suddenly started arguments wi=
th me on the=C2=A0same topic. He was=C2=A0arguing from the Nonveg point of =
view. In short, he was saying=C2=A0by giving examples that People who meat =
are also very gentle, polite and good natured.=C2=A0 They are not Tamasik a=
nd such arguments. =C2=A0I again reiterated my view. I told him that=C2=A0i=
 do not say that the people who eat meat are *Bad* people. I do not also cl=
aim that Pure veggies are all and always *Good* people.=C2=A0 Infact, i hav=
e a couple of very good friends who are meat eater and they are really good=
 human beings. =C2=A0I only say that the people who eat meat are not doing =
the right Karma because the act results in to cold blooded killing/ butcher=
ing / massacre
 of innocent Creatures. I only say that for eating (actually=
 satisfying cravings of palate), one has no right to harm the other life.
W=
e both kept quite for a while and then i suddenly saw a advertisement poste=
r of Mont blank pen on which Mahatma Gandhi's picture was shown=C2=A0with=
=C2=A0one of his thought and signature. I had earlier seen this poster but =
never felt like going near and reading it. but yesterday i went near that=
=C2=A0to read the thought of Mahatma in his own handwritings and Lo! It was=
 written:
"The=C2=A0path of Truth is through Ahimsa (Non-Violence) ....". I=
 called my friend near and showed him that. he also starred for a while to =
that thought.=C2=A0The discussion ended. =C2=A0He got the answer probably a=
nd I got my confirmation!
***
I always recite a=C2=A0 prayer at conclusion =
of my daily Homam (I prefer this prayer over "Sarve Janaha Sukhino Bhabantu=
...) which goes like this:
Sarve Bhavantu SukhinaH, Sarve Santu NiraamayaaH=

Sarve Bhadraani Pashyantu, MaaKaschidDukhaBhag bhavet !!!

casion being my marriage anniversary.  One senior friend, whom i =
respect very much, who is also a vegetarian, suddenly started argument=
s with me on the same topic. He was arguing from the Nonveg point=
 of view. In short, he was saying by giving examples that People who m=
eat are also very gentle, polite and good natured.  They are not Tamas=
ik and such arguments. <SPAN> </SPAN>I again reiterated my view. I tol=
d him that i do not say that the people who eat meat are *Bad* people.=
 I do not also claim that Pure veggies are all and always *Good* people.&nb=
sp; Infact, i have a couple of very good friends who are meat eater and the=
y are really good human beings. <SPAN> </SPAN>I only say
 that the peo=
ple who eat meat are not doing the right Karma because the act results in t=
