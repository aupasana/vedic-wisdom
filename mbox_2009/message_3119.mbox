Bama, who practiced a form of kundalini yoga, was interviewed by Promode
Ch=
atterji. The author tells some of Bama's ideas in his book of
interviews wi=
th saints: Tantrabhilasir Sadhu-sangha:
Ma (the Mother goddess) is asleep i=
n the muladhara chakra and should be
awakened- if she is not awake, who is =
there to give one liberation? Only
she can do this.... The first sign of th=
e awakening of Kundalini is that
the person does not feel satisfied with th=
e ordinary state of life- one
gets a great urge within to get over this con=
finement. The awakening of
Kundalini gives men great pleasure, a kind of pl=
easure that ordinary men
never attain ... as you pass through and move from=
 one chakra to
another, you feel the manifestations of the varied bhavas of=
 Kundalini
Sakti. But what is important, as a result of kundalini Shakti's
=
functions in every chakra, is the kind of bhava it creates, a different
bha=
va in each place, and the feeling of these bhavas brings such a state
of bl=
iss that it cannot be described.
He felt that the soul departs the body thr=
ough the spinal channel at
death, through an aperture in the skull, and it =
enters a state of
emptiness and peace, nirvikalpa samadhi. This is the home=
 of Tara Ma,
which is beyond the material world, the heaven worlds, and the=
 home of
Kali. Tara's grace is necessary to reach this state.
Some incident=
s in the masters life
The Widow's Marriage

One day a young, beautiful girl=
 and her father came to see Bama Kshepa.
The
young girl bowed down to the M=
aster and offered him some Indian sweets
which
she herself had prepared. Ba=
ma was extremely pleased with her and said,
"I
am blessing you. You will be=
 blessed in the future with a beautiful
son."

The girl cried out, "Father,=
 Father, look what this sadhu is saying! How
can I have a child when I have=
 lost my husband? I am a widow."

Bama said, "You are a widow. So what! You=
 will be remarried. My words
will
prove true."

In three months' time a ver=
y rich young man fell in love with her.
Although in those days it was not a=
t all appreciated if a widow
remarried,
this girl did get married in a spec=
ial Hindu Vaishnava manner. Needless
to
say, in a year's time after she got=
 married, she was blessed with a
beautiful
son.
The Dying Man

A young man =
suffering from a serious case of tuberculosis was brought by
his relatives =
to Bama. The young man's days were numbered. Bama said to
them,
"Why did yo=
u bring him to me? Am I a doctor? You rascals, you will never
give me peace=
 of mind."

Then the Master stood up and started strangling the patient. Ev=
erybody
was
stunned. The man was already so week. The disciples started cry=
ing
because
if the young man died, the Master and all of them would be in s=
erious
trouble.

But Bama continued to strangle and abuse the man like anyt=
hing, saying,
"When
you do bad things, unbearable things, don't you know yo=
u will pay the
penalty?"
Then he said, "All right, I have forgiven you," an=
d he threw the man
down
on the ground. Everybody thought he was dead.

But =
in a few minutes, to everyone's astonishment, the young man stood up
and sa=
id, "I am so hungry. Please give me something to eat. I have never
felt thi=
s kind of hunger in my life." The dying man was now totally
cured.
The rela=
tives left the Master's house offering utmost gratitude to Bama,
whom they =
affectionately called the "insane spiritual Master."

The Suicide Attempt

=
Once in the thick of the night a middle-aged man named Nimai was tying a
ro=
pe to the branch of a tree and was about to hang himself. He could not
supp=
ort his family, and for this reason the members of his family had
tremendou=
s
disrespect for him. Therefore he wanted to commit suicide.

At that momen=
t Bama appeared in his subtle body and said, "What are you
doing?
You rasca=
l, don't you know that committing suicide is the worst possible
sin? Don't =
you believe it?"

Nimai said, "All right, I will not commit suicide, but I =
will never go
home
again."

Bama said, "You don't have to go home. Come and=
 stay with me, in your
real
home. God will take care of your family, I assu=
re you."

Bama's words proved true. Very soon, two of Nimai's older sons go=
t jobs
and
were in a position to support the rest of the members of the fam=
ily.
  The Leper
Bama had a dear attendant named Nanda, who had developed l=
eprosy. Even
then, Bama used to take food from him regularly and not from o=
ther
disciples. Gradually, Nanda's case became extremely serious. His hands=

and arms were totally covered with infected wounds and it was a very
ugly =
sight. So he stopped coming to
his Master's place.

One day, Bama's attenda=
nts said to their Master, "Master, you have the
capacity to cure your dear =
disciple, Nanda. Why don't you cure him?"

Bama said to them, "All right, b=
ring him today."

When Nanda came, Bama started striking him, saying, "Can =
you count on
your fingertips how many times you have done unthinkable thing=
s? I say
you can't, you rascal. I have forgiven you and I am curing you, bu=
t in
the future never, never do anything immoral or undivine."

In a month'=
s time Nanda was totally cured. Then he once again started
preparing meals =
for Bama and serving him with utmost love and devoted
surrender.
  Calcutta=
 Kalighat temple
At the Calcutta Kalighat temple, while in a state of bhava=
, he tried to
lift the statue of the Mother and take her on his lap. When s=
topped by
the priests, he shouted, "I do not want your black Kali! She look=
s like
a demoness coming to devour [someone]. My Tara Ma is beautiful, with=

small feet. I do not want your black Kali- my Akasa Tara is good enough
fo=
r me." People would call on him, asking him to pray to their household
imag=
es, to enliven them with his bhava. He would fall into trance when
he visit=
ed their statues, and often he performed neither worship nor
chanting of ma=
ntras. He would loudly call into the air for the Mother,
and many observers=
 saw the statue appear to take the form of a human
being.
His Holiness's wo=
rship of Maa Tara
He took a handful of flowers marked with sandal paste and=
 stood before
the goddess. He cursed her and threw the flowers at the statu=
e. He wet
the flowers with his tears. Although the flowers were thrown with=
 an
attitude of abuse instead of reverence using mantras, they arranged
the=
mselves into a neat and beautiful garland around the goddess' neck,
and the=
 observers were amazed at the mantraless form of worship of the
madman. He =
then went into trance which continued all day, and he emerged
from it on th=
e following day. He was not a priest who followed
schedules- often the time=
 for worship would have passed and no one could
find Bama anywhere. He woul=
d later be seen in trance under a Hibiscus
tree, on in the jungle, having a=
rguments with the goddess.
Bama,Maa Tara's dearest son
He would eat food to=
 be offered to the goddess before the worship
ceremony was finished thus ma=
king it impure and unsanctified. The
caretakers of the temple were angry at=
 this and beat him severely. He
insisted that the goddess Tara asked him to=
 take food in this way. After
this, the temple owner, the Rani of Natore, h=
ad a dream:

She dreamt that the stone image of Mother Tara was leaving the=
 temple at
Tarapith and going to Kailasa. Tara Ma looked very sad, and tear=
s were
flowing down her face, and she wore no mark on her forehead. She was=

bewildered and emaciated. Her back was bleeding and full of cuts, and
vult=
ures and jackals followed behind her, lapping the blood from her
wounds.
In=
 fear, the Rani asked, "O Ma, why do you show me these terrible
things, and=
 why are you leaving us?"

The goddess answered, "My child, I have been in =
this sacred place
(mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have beaten my dea=
r mad son, and
as a mother, I have taken these blows upon myself. See how m=
y back is
bleeding, I am in great pain ... For four days I have been starvi=
ng,
because they have not allowed my mad son to eat my ritual food. So for
=
four days I have refused to take their offerings of food ... My child,
how =
can a mother take food before feeding her child? You must arrange
for food =
to be offered to my son, before it is offered to me, at the
temple. If not,=
 I will leave there permanently." Bama got his priest job
back, and people =
began to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to
see him.
Shortly befo=
re his Mahasamadhi in 1911, he became withdrawn and spent
most of his time =
in trance and meditation. He ceased to talk with his
disciples, speaking on=
ly rarely about death and Tara Ma. His love-hate
relationship with her cont=
inued until his death in 1911.
