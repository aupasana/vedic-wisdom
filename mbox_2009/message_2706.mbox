|| OM TAT SAT ||
Namaskar Rajarshi,

   I have not read the diaries of Lahi=
ri Mahashaya, so lets drop all that "technicalities" out of the discussion.=
 The specific diagram is in "God talks with Arjuna, Self-Realization Fellow=
ship, Jaico Publishing House, 2002" - Part -2 of that book.

  Anyways, the=
 book is "Kundalini Tantra" by Swami Satyananda Saraswati of Bihar Yoga Vid=
yala. Google Search string is "awakening of mooladhara and ajna" and the li=
nk that will take you there is a google Cache link (copy and paste in your =
browser).

http://74.125.153.132/search?q=3Dcache:RxkKeFQ64NAJ:www.eng.veda=
nta.ru/library/kundalini_tantra/3_practices_for_ajna_chakra.php+awakening+o=
f+mooladhara+and+ajna&cd=3D5&hl=3Den&ct=3Dclnk&gl=3Din&client=3Dfirefox-a

=
  Here is the relevant Text:

  "....Ajna and mooladhara chakras are closel=
y related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the other. Ideally, ajn=
a should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in order to allow an=
 unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and the low=
er chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to further awake=
n ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is through t=
he practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific for moola=
dhara...."

   Regarding the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it alre=
ady exists, Yogananda writes in his commentary the following:

"...Beyond t=
he subtlest physical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda expla=
ined, is the superether," a finer manifestation and therefore not classifie=
d as one of the physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are o=
nly five-earth, water, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this ta=
ttwa as mind, or 'non-matter', as opposed to matter or gross vibration...."=



> The tattwas are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scriptures, both > A=
gamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.

   Which scriptures ? Quotes ? 

   I=
t is through Sankhya, that you can understand why Chitta is related to it. =
Anyways, if you are interested you may search for those yoga treatises your=
self, even as I have already given enough explanation, though more can be g=
iven.

  As Narasimha knows Jyotish shastra also, he could probably figure =
out the rashi to which the 6th tattwa is attributed since I have already gi=
ven the table out, so it is as real as it rises daily.

Regards,
Nitish

an you please elaborate on what you mean by the terms "awakening" and "affe=

 Tattwa has a very specific technical meaning. When you say that Gunas by "=
inherent duality" in nature give rise to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a=
 simple multiplication of 3 x 2 and arriving at six. My question, then why =
not a simple 3 raised to the power 2 resulting in 9 tattwas?

 this is not really a case of basic maths I presume. The scriptures are cle=

t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows =
a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state =
of existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular thing (e.g.=
 a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of =
earth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a h=

Because the only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality invo=

 idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I c=
an understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least t=
he Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian m=
ysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..

 The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical ph=
ysics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality=
? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reali=
ty. It need not be exactly as reality is.
