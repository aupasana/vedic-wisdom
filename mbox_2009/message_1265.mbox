Dear friends,

As per our tradition, the mere mention of gods name is capab=
le of 
removing all sins. I remember reading some stories in Karthika Puran=
am 
of a cruel and sinful person calling his son when he is about to die. 
=
His son is named after Siva. Merely by calling the gods name before 
dying,=
 the person attains punya loka! In another story, a hunter does 
not get fo=
od on a Karthika Monday and goes to a temple hoping some 
left overs and as=
 it is dark, lights a lamp, and he gets the punya of 
upavasa and lighting =
the lamp. Neither of the above did this 
intentionally. But, perhaps, both =
of them carried favorable karma from 
their respective past lives!

Remembe=
r the story of Kausikopakhyanam? (Kaushika once looks angrily 
at a crane a=
ngrily and it burns to ashes. That day Kushika goes 
begging and looks at a=
 house wife angrily. The lady tells him that she 
is not the crane and surp=
rised kaushika asks for secret of her 
strength and she directs him to her =
teacher who sells meat! The 
teacher explains Kaushika the importance of un=
attached karma. Easy it 
sounds, but, not easy to practice.

So, it is usel=
ess to argue as to what is superior and what is 
inferior. All the differen=
t paths are equally important and perhaps 
equally efficient provided we tr=
averse that path efficently!

Chittasudhi is important to what ever sadhana=
 we do for which 
controlling out wandering mind and focusing on the ultima=
te goal is 
the single most challenge.

Each of us may find different ways =
to help us focus.

For example, I find doing the following 4 to be useful:
=
1. Doing Japam while facing Sun
2. Doing Japam in front of a big portait of=
 Ramakrishna/temple
3. Doing Japam while shower is running on me
4. Doing J=
apam in front of Homam

Now, do I need to find out which of the above is mo=
re beneficial? I do 
not think so. If I can control my mind 100%, then the =
means does not 
matter. I can do what ever I feel comfortable at the time. =
For now, I 
am doing homam.

Each of you can try it out and you feel it is =
helping you more stick 
to it. The bottom line is control different thought=
s that come to us.

Best regards,
Vijay
