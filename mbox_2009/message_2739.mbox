Namaste,
 
> "Ahamkara isn't the dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies"
 
What a strange statement!! After all,
 
aham = I
kaara = ness
ahamkaara = I-ness.
 
Thus, ahamkaara *IS* the I-ness of an individualized consciousness. You are talking of ahamkaara being the "cause of" I-ness. But ahamkaara IS the I-ness!
 
*        *        *
 
Whether you talk about physical body or subtle body or causal body, I-ness in various layers is still ahamkaara. When ahamkaara binds more to one layer, one looks at oneself primarily from the perspective of that layer. When ahamkaara does not bind to anything at all, one is in nirvikalpa samadhi, i.e. established in Brahman. Ahamkaara or I-ness is a fundamental property of an individualized consciousness and remains as long as there is some individualization.

>     THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS,

So you are accepting that there as "I-ness of manas" and "I-ness of chitta". I-ness=aham-kaara. If we replace I-ness in these terms, we get "ahamkaara of manas" and "ahamkaara of chitta". When scriptures defined the 19 proerties of individualized consciousness, they only defined one ahamkaara apart from manas, chitta etc and did not define "ahamkaara of manas" and "ahamkaara of chitta" etc.
 
For what I termed as ahamkaara (I-ness) working through manas and ahamkaara (I-ness) working through chitta, you are coining new terms like "I-ness of manas" and "I-ness of chitta" because you have this strange notion that ahamkaara is tied to physical body.

Of course, ahamkaara (I-ness) associating mainly with a physical body is bad. We have no disagreement there.
 
The astral sphere may be beautiful to some. But, to a true jnaani, it is a source of problems too, though the problems are lighter than the problems of the physical domain.
 
Celestials without physical bodies and having only ethereal bodies have desires too and they are bonded too.
 
*        *        *
 
I still think this is a case of a Pascal language programmer unfamiliar with C language misunderstanding some software written in C language and passing comments. But unfortunately that programmer seems to be hasty in using labels like "flawed", "incorrect", "incoherent" etc about other programmers whose language he is unable to understand.

Narasimha

The conditions of the birth and inbetween period depends both on his inherent samaskaras as well the karmic repurcussion. It not, never, entirely once choice. It a mix and match between what one wants and what one deserves. IN all cases, to be able to retain the samskara Ahamakara is needed. Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in beyond the death for a normal human being. Therewfore, Ahamkara is present in the astral/casual plane as well.

If someone says "so and so person is a terrible person", one may feel offended or if someone says "so and so person is a great person", one may feel elated. One's ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one's consciousness may still think "I am being called" and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one's I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.

In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even "see" onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to "me". So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of "I am this" (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.

For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.

The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.

> > > >

Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn't account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.
> > > >

Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived" in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't work upon that particular idea.

Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn't apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is "the very basis" of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.

Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones' physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.

One pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very difficult to follow in this age.
