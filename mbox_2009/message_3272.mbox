Namaste Kishore,
=C2=A0
Is Rama a god? As Utpal said, Maharshi Vasishtha ex=
plicitly told Rama in Dasaratha's court in the presence of many rishis that=
 he was the supreme god reincarnated as a human being. See Yoga Vaasishtham=
.

=C2=A0
I can understand where that gentleman is coming from. Let me start =
off with a simple analogy.
=C2=A0
A golden necklace, a golden bangle, a gol=
den ring, a golden arrow and a golden plate may all be made of gold. But, o=
ne who spent time with the necklace and is amazed and dazzled by the elabor=
ate work in it may consider it *the best*. If you ask "what about the *root=
* of this, i.e. the original gold used to make the necklace", he may not be=
 impressed.
=C2=A0
In fact, he may even tell you that one can melt the neck=
lace and create the "root" gold from it and create other golden objects (ba=
ngle, arrow etc) from it. So, from his perspective, the golden necklace is =
the best golden object and every golden object can be created from it.
=C2=
=A0
Of course, one who is equally amazed by the golden arrow may say the sa=
me thing about the arrow!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
For Lord Hanuman, =
Rama was everything. All gods (including Vishnu) were present in Rama and H=
anuman saw all gods as emanating from Rama. Lord Rama was the supreme god a=
nd source of all, in Hanuman's eyes.
=C2=A0
Annamayya had exactly the same =
attitude regarding Lord Venkateswara (Balaji). He was the source of all in =
his eyes.
=C2=A0
Many saints and yogis had the same attitude regarding Lord=
 Krishna.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
As long as you are talking about th=
e field of duality, every "truth" has a reference frame. Though we are used=
 to linear logic, linear hierarchies etc, that is because of the reference =
frame our mind stands on. The field of duality has scope for really complic=
ated versions of reality. As I said, it is a matter of reference frame. Com=
pared to the reference frame experienced by the minds of normal persons stu=
ck deeply in maayaa, reference frames of great yogis and saints who overcam=
e most layers of maayaa give a better and larger view of the field of duali=
ty. But, remember, they too are in the grip of maayaa at some level or the =
other and nothing is absolute. There are many possible reference frames and=
 many possible experiences of "the ultimate truth" of the field of duality.=

=C2=A0
There is nothing really to debate, in the assertion of the gentlema=
n quoted by Rajarshi. It is his experience.
=C2=A0
The goal is to find ONE =
deity like that - one deity you can completely surrender to and can see eve=
rything as coming from.

Dear Kishore and Utpal,
=C2=
=A0
I am troubled by one thing just like you are. It is understandable if h=
e says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a great person cl=
aims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of G=
od which differentiates Rama from Krishna?


Some months back I had a very =
lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Rama is =
God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological debates - noth=
ing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I=
 was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. 

=C2=A0
W=
henever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he=
 can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spirituali=
ty with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using exact qu=
otations etc, (theology)=C2=A0but not about mysticism or sadhana or anythin=
g which=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why most people know him only a=
s a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=C2=A0 human be=
ing.=C2=A0=C2=A0They have no clue about his meditations or anything. He nev=
er projects himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God in pub=
lic.

=C2=A0
Therefore our discussion was also on those aspects which can b=
e proved or disproved theologically=C2=A0 - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki=
 Ramayana=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C2=A0.. 3) The=
 merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.

=C2=A0
1) To the first ques=
tion, he believes the answer is "no". 
=C2=A0
2) To the second question he =
says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=C2=
=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the way of l=
ife shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had ma=
stery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole a=
rmy in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C2=A0located wh=
en he first heard the news of Sita's abduction, but Rama did not do so and =
instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per =
my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama's ideas than to worship Ram=
a.

=C2=A0
3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a ho=
dgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An autho=
r's paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a criti=
cs nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with anima=
ls or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text becaus=
e Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up =
composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Ra=
ma is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri=
 Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshi=
pped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can =
be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.

=C2=A0
The above=
 are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Dear Utpal,=

=C2=A0
One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food habi=
ts, it'll be great.
=C2=A0
I have been out of touch with him since August, =
been busy myself. But will ask him. However I don't know whether he will re=
spond. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything f=
rom a purely spiritual angle. 

=C2=A0
It was only by chance that I found o=
ut one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed them when asked.=

=C2=A0
I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific poi=
nt of view - about why there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat=
 (not red meat). 
=C2=A0
But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should n=
ot be taken as an ideal regarding food=C2=A0 habits. Sachin can bat and sco=
re century even with a sore back, we will not be able to do it. His strengt=
h is his control of mind and his dedication to truth.

=C2=A0
Before I te=
ll you anything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I know, let me=
 say=C2=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him ab=
out two years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him was his im=
peccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=A0honest=
ly.=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a=
 simple, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it=
. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2=
=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in=
 his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer tha=
n English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is =
more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confuse=
d. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one Englis=
h, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one
 hour reading the Eng=
lish dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from readin=
g=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked him wh=
y, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at both th=
e languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the=
 truth about=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has a=
n uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anyt=
hing. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different =
fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long i=
n most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu=
, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes =
poetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered hi=
mself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered fo=
r religion as blank. When the clerk who was
 supposed to take the forms saw=
 that blank space, he asked my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cle=
rk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk a=
nd tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wr=
iting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. 

=C2=A0
So this gives a bas=
ic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, ca=
lls him Rama of Kaliyuga.
=C2=A0
One day, long back, he was going to office=
 for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As =
he was passing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to g=
o into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the te=
mple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees h=
is watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time=
 went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temp=
le sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any moveme=
nt. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no ide=
a why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.

=
=C2=A0
Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he go=
t visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most peo=
ple who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi =
for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place =
and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0 Only his wife and close re=
latives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for =
meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how=
 he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe org=
inates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals=
, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the at=
om and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He co=
nsiders Sri Krishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That i=
s why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it
 elevated =
Sri=C2=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki =
Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The differenc=
e he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary=
 man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emula=
ted by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to lea=
d his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely sta=
ting his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and ad=
vises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not=
 an atheist any more.

=C2=A0
Later he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew the =
relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mothe=
r he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot =
of time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2=
=A0with those in=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and ev=
erything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc e=
tc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the f=

=C2=A0

<div> </div>
<div><i>I am troubled b=
y one thing just like you are. It is understandable if he says Rama is an i=
deal man but hard to believe that such a great person claims Rama is not Go=
d. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of God which differenti=
ates Rama from Krishna?<br>
</i></div>
</div><div>Some months back I had a =
very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Ram=
a is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological debates -=
 nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate beca=
use I was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. </div=
>

<div> </div>
<div>Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he wil=
l only mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never gen=
erally discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debat=
e scriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology) but not about myst=
icism or sadhana or anything which needs a belief system. That is why =
most people know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and u=
ncorruptable  human being.  They have no clue about his medi=
tations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally w=
ould not discuss God in public.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Therefore our=
 discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved theo=
logically  - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana  2) Is it w=
rong if people consider him as God .. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit M=
anas of Tulasidasji.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>1) To the first question=
, he believes the answer is "no". </div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) To the s=
econd question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is=
 right or wrong - but his personal opinion is that one should try to f=
ollow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He sai=
d, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Rava=
na and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he w=
as located when he first heard the news of Sita's abduction, but Rama =
did not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the hum=
an way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama's ideas t=
han to worship Rama.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>3) He considers the Ramc=
harit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ra=
nging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author's paradise (since many rules of c=
omposition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line=
 in there which equates women with animals or something similar. He believe=
s that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlli=
ng his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to =
women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the p=
urpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way=
 of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ab=
ility of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on thi=
s plane, so he thinks.</div>

is opinions, feel free to disagree. </div>

<div> </div>

<div><i></i> </div>
<div><i></i> </div>
<div>Yes h=
e is a friend of mine.  I can only tell you very little about his spir=
itual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is married, li=
ves in Delhi and has a son as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before I t=
ell you anything more about his spiritual life that I know, let m=
e say line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him a=
bout two years back. What first attracted me to  towards him was his i=
mpeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac when it comes to hones=
tly. If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say =
a simple, harmless lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say i=
t. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever&nbs=
p;spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in =
his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than=
 English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is m=
ore comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused=
. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English=
, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one
 hour reading the Engl=
ish dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=
 up volumes of Hindi and English literature. When I asked him why=
, he just said it is because he wanted to be equally adept at both the=
 languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the =
truth about which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an=
 uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anyth=
ing. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different f=
ields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in=
 most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu,=
 Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes p=
oetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered him=
self an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for=
 religion as blank. When the clerk who was
 supposed to take the forms saw =
that blank space, he asked my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cler=
k wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk an=
d tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wri=
ting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. </div>

<div> </div>
<di=
v>So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, =
whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.</div>
<div> </div>
<div=
>One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His wa=
y to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in his sc=
ooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he st=
ill does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 =
o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the eveni=
ng! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest,=
 the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as h=
e was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scar=
ed to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remember=
ed nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Then =
he started meditating at home, and it was there that he got visions et=
c of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know=
 him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours=
, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same pos=
ition for 3 days continuously.  Only his wife and close relatives know=
 about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation h=
e often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt dur=
ing samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from =
me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women=
, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigge=
r than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed. He considers Sri =
Krishna to be God and Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he doe=
s not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it
 elevated Sri Ram=
a to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was=
 to show Sri Rama as an ideal <i>man, </i>not a God.The difference he =
says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man =
can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated b=
y ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one can try to lead his=
 life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating =
his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises=
 people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an a=
theist any more.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Later he had once menti=
oned he knew the relation he had with all the people around him in his past=
 lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays=
 he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interacting with peop=
le, specially with those in the age group of 18 to 30, discussing=
 anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history,=
 religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people w=
ho will be the future of this country.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>He is =
am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.</div>
