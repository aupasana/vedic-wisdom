 Talk 273.

D.: Buddha, when asked if there is the ego, was silent; when asked if there
is no ego, he was silent; asked if there is God, he was silent; asked if
there is no God, he was silent. Silence was his answer for all these.
Mahayana and Hinayana schools have both misinterpreted his silence because
they say that he was an atheist. If he was an atheist, why should he have
spoken of nirvana, of births and deaths, of karma, reincarnations and
dharma? His interpreters are wrong. Is it not so?

M.: You are right.
