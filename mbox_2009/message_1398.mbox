Namaste Narsimhaji,
There are people who know for sure,that *this* is the =
road-the right 
road-for them.They walk on that road, with full confidence =
and reach 
their destination sooner or later.
But then there are others,who=
 just keep standing and wondering which 
road to take.And then,someone come=
s from behind,holds your hand and 
says--come along,i'll lead the way--Seei=
ng the confidence of that 
person all your confusion dissolves.
This messag=
e from you and Manishji,is Godsend.I would like to follow 
what Manishji ha=
s suggested.
There are however some small queries.Kindly resolve them-

1)1=
00 days -3 times means---10 malas thrice a day right? ie.3240 
mantras a da=
y.

2)In between there will be break for menses--is it 5/6 or 7 days

3)If =
one has to go out during this 100 days period,what then?The rules 
mentione=
d about same place,same materaials get broken.

4)The men are to grow beard=
.I am a lady,still i have some hair on my 
chin, for which i get threading =
done.Is this to be suspended too?But 
then it really looks weird.

5)My hus=
band would also like to join in this anushthan,but his job 
will not allow =
him to do jaap thrice a day,so could he do 10 malas 
once a day?

6)What ab=
out dhyan viniyog nyas etc?I do not know much about these.Are 
these to be =
done before the jaap?
    Also if you could please choose an auspicious day=
,for us to begin 
this anushthan,i'll be grateful.
Thank you very much,
Sun=
ita.
