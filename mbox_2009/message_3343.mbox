Namaste Narasimha garu,

Can you please clarify my following doubts. 

1. =
I remember you saying that you use logs for your daily homam. I think its b=
etter to use either dried coconuts or cow dung cakes than logs. Somehow, I =
feel that its also a sin cutting a big tree and using its body parts for a =
spiritual work. I know its difficult to get cow dung cakes but if we can af=
ford dried coconuts that is even better. Can you please clarify if my way o=
f thinking is wrong. I know a Devi bhakta who does homam only with dried st=
icks fallen on the ground if he does not have any other materials. 

2. Als=
o, using honey in religious works is in my opinion wrong. I am not exactly =
sure how they extract honey from bee hives, but I know there are larvae sti=
ll present when honey is taken from hives.

Satyam Bruyat Priyam Bruyat.
