Thanks for starting this wonderful thread.

1. I wonder if the karmin debts=
 payback between exact two souls. If A does some thing to B, does B has to =
do the same thing to A in future?

Does not the karma be passed on to the h=
eirs (I do not mean heirs in strict sense)?

2. Do not the karma aggregate =
in any way? Let us say, A steals X amount from B, and C steals Y amount fro=
m A.

In future B if B steals X-Y from A and Y from C, the karmic debts are=
 paid back in totality. Is this a possibility?

3. If A is trying to cheat =
me, it can be:
   I cheated him in my past births and hence he is trying to=
 payback.
   This could be a brand new cycle.

In any case, if I know he co=
uld cheat me, and I have a way to avoid getting cheated, what should I do?
=

Cheating has not significant if I do not feel sad. After all what is the d=
efinition of cheating? It may be much easier to cheat with out sense of doe=
rship as compared to getting cheated. One just have to strongly believe, it=
 is God giving him the opportunity to cheat others. I wonder if doing wrong=
 thing even with out sense of doership is acceptible?

4. Even the God coul=
d not escape the karma. Rama killed Vali from hiding, and he got the karma =
phalam from Angada who is reborn as hunter when Rama is reborn as Krishna. =
So, the karmic transactions may not be resticted betwween the same parties.=


Vishnu had to take the karma phala as Rama and be away from his wife.
So,=
 the not having the sense of ownership may not be the only factor.
5.  Vive=
kananda talks about unattached karma and niskama karma. A terrorist may be =
doing unattached karma as he believes God wants him and makes him do what h=
e does. He/she may be unattached the consequences of what they do. How ever=
, they have a strong desire to go to heaver as they believe strongly that G=
od will grant them heaven.

6. With all the explanation, I am not clear how=
 Sadhana can burn the karma faster and how we can take others karma phala.
=

Best regards,
Vijay
