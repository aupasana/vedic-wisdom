While I was doing homam, my son (7 years) joined me for doing puja to his S=
iva lingam (he puts water with a spoon while chanting mrityunjaya mantram. =
He had taken a small bowl and put the siva lingam in it.

I invited Sadasiv=
a into Fire and the siva linga. So far so good.

Very soon the bowl was ful=
l and my son was loosing focus and I thought since pouring water is helping=
 him stay focussed on the puja, I shall help him before he gets distracted =
and goes away.

I had taken the water he used already (and which filled the=
 small bowl having the siva lingam) and poured that water into original con=
tainer. Then the small bowl was empty again and he continued.

How ever my =
son asked me if it okay to use the water that is already used. I told him, =
it is alright, as long as you are feeling you are doing the abhishekam to r=
eal God, water does not matter. It is your feeling that matters.

Easily sa=
id. But, after wards the question was lingering:
1. While doing this, I hav=
e invariably moved the siva lingam in to which I have invited Siva. Is this=
 a sin (this is like asking some one to sit in a sofa and then dragging the=
 sofa around while the person is sitting in it)

2. I used the water used f=
or abhishekam again for abhishekam. Is this okay?

Best regards,
Vijay
