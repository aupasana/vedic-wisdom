Namaste Rajarshi,

Ooops! sorry for the misleading information. i went thro=
' the manual 
again. 

In the manual Narasimha has suggested following: 

[=
After kavacham, argala and keelakam, read "Ratri sooktam" without 
offering=
 anything in the fire. Do not even add "swaahaa" at the
end of each verse.]=


[
Then "Devi sooktam" may be read without offering anything in the 
fire.=
 Do not even add "swaahaa" at the end of each verse
]

The Reason for above=
 is mentioned in the following foot note.

[
Adding "swaahaa" in veda mantr=
as may require changing the swaram 
(intonation) of the last few syllables =
of the mantra. Most
people are unfamiliar with the relevant rules. Even som=
e good 
priests end up reading the verse with the original swaram and simpl=
y
add "swaahaa". This is not correct. It is instead better to not 
add "swa=
ahaa" and to read it as is and not make an offering.
]

Warm Regards,
utpal=
