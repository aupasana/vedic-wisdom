A few words in my humble opinion. 
Sri=C2=A0Aurobindo and The Moth=
er=C2=A0have said that each individual is capable of transforming the physi=
cal body into a vessel of Godhead by=C2=A0transforming each cell in the bod=
y to be able to/ be pure enough to accept the=C2=A0Supramental Energy. This=
 could be akin to burning away/purifying/cleansing the body for eg through =
Homam, surrendering to=C2=A0The Divine Will, Truth... Her Grace is munifice=
nt and is there for everyone for the asking. She bestows Her Grace even wit=
hout asking if only you are willing to accept it, open up . All She asks is=
 unshakeable=C2=A0faith=C2=A0and love for the Divine in oneself and others.=

Nothing could be away from the *Truth* that the principles/ mails/messages=
 of=C2=A0Narasimha garu=C2=A0reiterate (for me atleast) exactly that.

Namaste

I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writi=
ng. I am posting it here for anyone interested.

Near the beginning of the =
20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo,=
 began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high =
states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the=
 evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on=
 Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now.=
 He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakd=
own due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards t=
his =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondic=
herry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as =
the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular trans=
formation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today=
.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, a=
nd that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of t=
he divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The proc=
ess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolut=
ion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these t=
wo events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresa=
w that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDs=
upramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change e=
verything on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is,=
 says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is som=
ewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal s=
pirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of h=
is constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if=
 the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.

Sri Aurobindo re=
cognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage ha=
s been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the o=
ne hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as=
 a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a =
consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the S=
upermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is =
active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.=


Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later w=
ith the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forw=
ard, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind.=
 Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will s=
oon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=
=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing =
an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging =
with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species tha=
t is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expandi=
ng supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from s=
oul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. 

Thirdly is the =EF=BF=
=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=
 be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =
that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 

Finally, our ultimat=
e goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity in=
carnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of w=
hat we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the=
 unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

The great =
work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousn=
ess down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is=
 a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was=
 simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, a=
waiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in coll=
ective matter.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corre=
sponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience=
 with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at=
 work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suff=
ering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces=
 that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current=
 global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone=
 through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned=
 to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth=
. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=
=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive in=
ner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how =
this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current polit=
ical sphere.

With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our =
old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo em=
phasized that although the changes will be enormous they would not be neces=
sarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and=
 our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, h=
e maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this re=
sistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras wil=
l eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Bea=
uty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence i=
n the world today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for thi=
s power of harmonization!

When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the=
 Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and=
 that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental t=
ransformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a mini=
mum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=
=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says abou=
t changes coming in the world.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


The upsurge (of c=
onsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra
