Dear ALL,

   The fine sensors of our ears, eyes, nose, tongue and other sense organs
have direct linkage with the brain. Their functions are regulated by, and
also contribute to the qualities of the brain and the mind. If one of these
sensors stops or reduces using the power of the brain then its share of
power is given to the other faculties. For example, born-blinds are often
found to possess tremendous memory or gifted voice and expertise in
music.... etc. One can, by determined efforts, direct the power of the mind
so that it could be used by any one of the normal sense organs for the
desired development of the specific faculties associated with it. The
example of Kalidasa fits well in this context. His internal desire awakened
the willpower and the sincere efforts thereby turned a 'dumb fellow' into a
great litterateur and poet of historical eminence. Many examples are also
available in the field of physique and sports where extremely weak or
physically sick persons transformed themselves into stout wrestlers simply
by regularity and dedicated exercises of the mind and the body - proving
thereby, the truth behind the quote 'practice makes a man perfect'.

During the practice of Nada Yoga, one first tries training the ear(s) - to
expand its hearing capacities - by fully concentrating the power of mind on
this organ. By regular practice, the otherwise unused (sub) conscious power
of the brain also awakens during this process and stimulates the subtle
functional centers for extraordinary potentials of hearing. The ears can be
trained to 'hear' the ultra, infra and even subtler and cosmic levels of
sound during the advanced stages of these sadhanas. The karna pishacini
sadhana  of the Tantra Science enables the masters of this sadhana to
perceive the sounds from any desired place in this universe. Clairaudience
is also a natural manifestation of spiritual sadhanas of Nada Yoga.

The methods of awakening the subtle power of supernormal hearing are based
on the above principle of fine perception of pure sound. This practice
gradually leads to the perception and recognition of subtler levels of
sound. Through the immense power of their mental concentration such sadhakas
can easily access the energy centers in the cosmos and 'sense' the signals
of Nada emanating from there.


*Simple Training for Nada** Yoga*

The perceptions of sound (shabda), vision (rupa), taste (rasa), smell
(gandha) and touch (sparsha) are manifested in the five sense organs via the
five basic elements of Nature. Thus, every entity perceived by the sense
organs basically arises from a subliminal, non-physical form (existing in
cetan). In the Nada Yoga, one gradually perceives the physical,
non-physical, sublime, supernatural forms of sound.

All the sadhanas aimed at gaining control over different tanmatras (powers
of perception) progress well in the sadhakas who possess strong will power,
sound mental concentration and emotional depth and stability. For instance,
in the sadhanas of gandha, the sadhaka first practices to smell the odors
that inspire sacred emotions. He does so by physically smelling (through the
nose) the substances like camphor, sandalwood or some flowers... etc for a
few seconds and then closes the nose and tries to feel the same odor through
mental concentration. Similar experiments are done on tasting with and
without tongue during the rasa sadhanas.

Our ears hear the sound of the syllables pronounced by our tongue. One may
concentrate upon only the sound without attempting to recognize the syllable
(or the word) and practice to differentiate between all variations in the
type and tuning of such 'spoken' sounds to analyze the association of their
patterns with the meaning conveyed by the corresponding 'speech'. After
continuing this practice with increasing focus and efficacy, he could
develop the power to sense the finest level of variations in all kinds of
'sounds' and to grasp the 'message' (meaning) contained therein. The Yogis
can understand any language and even the voices of the animals and the birds
through such sadhanas of 'hearing' the sonic vibrations.
