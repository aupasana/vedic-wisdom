Dear Sir,
My one mail regarding Tarpan is still unanswered. I had asked tha=
t If I am not doing Tarpanam as per manual and simply if I pour some water =
with a spoon in the pot before me and say -Mama so and so Pitrum Tarpayami =
swadha-and like with devotion, will it be ok ? Will it work?

Namast=
e,

Some people hold the view that one with a living father cannot do it an=
d 
one's father must do it instead. The other view is that anybody can do i=
t.

I subscribe to the later view.

If one's grandfather had some unfilfill=
ed desires and one's father is alive, 
of course, one's father can offer ta=
rpana. However, grandson can also do it.. 
Depending on the karmic debts, t=
he unfilled desires may have more effect on 
the grandson than son and henc=
e tarpana offered by grandson may work better 
than tarpana offered by son.=
 Thus, the idea that father has the exclusive 
"right" to tarpana and his s=
on will get that right only after he passes away 
is illogical.

If a fathe=
r is a rich man with a lot of money, son may not need to work. 
However, if=
 father is not that rich, son should better work. Especially if 
father is =
not capable of getting a good job and son is capable of getting a 
good job=
, son should definitely find a job and work. Saying that only father 
shoul=
d work as long as he is alive and son should stay home is wrong. Same 
with=
 tarpana.

Best regards,
Narasimha
