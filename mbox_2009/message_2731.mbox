   Since Tattva is a "universal =
conception for creation to happen", it doesn't matter whether we use Sankhy=
a, Jyotish or Vedanta - we will find its description and usage in all the s=
hastras ?

   Now, You say that Vasistha doesn't consider Cosmic space as a=
 Tattva. What is the basis of your statement within the scope of Jyotish sh=
astra ? Does it deny or approve the existence of the 6th tattwa viz SuperEt=
her ? Can you bring forth a relevant dictum from BPHS or elsewhere to prove=
 your point or you are just giving out an opinion on behalf of Vasistha, wh=
ich may or may not be true ?
    What is the tattva associated with each of=
 the 12 sun-signs ?
Regards,
Nitish
