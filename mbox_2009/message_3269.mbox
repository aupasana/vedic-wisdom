Nam=
aste,

Aayushya homam is performed with the Aayushya sooktam. You can find =
Aayushya sooktam in the following PDF file that I just uploaded:

http://ve=
dicastrolo ger.org/mantras/ aayushya_ sooktam.pdf

People perform homam wit=
h it by simply invoking fire, doing poorvaangam and then directly offering =
this sooktam in fire, and then uttaraangam. In other words, praana pratisht=
haa of the deity, panchopachaara pooja to the deity ets are not done. You c=
an follow such a procedure.

For it to be more effective, finish the 9 vers=
es with 9 aahutis and then repeat the nine again. Repeat as many times as y=
ou can.

Normally, only ghee is used for this homam.

All the best.

Best r=
egards,
Narasimha
