Sri Narasimha Garu,
=A0
Namaskaram.
=A0
If one has to do both Homam and Tar=
panam daily, what would be your suggestion in terms of which would be the o=
rder one has to perform both.. is it that first do homam and then Tarpanam =
or vice versa or it does=A0 not matter?
=A0
I have downloaded the all tarpa=
na manuals from the website and thinking to start off with super short proc=
ess from the coming poornima day. As i already do the regular Homam=A0which=
 consumes 45 mins in the morning, just wanted to keep it simple for tarpana=
, please=A0me you guidance what should be the order.
=A0
Thanks
KK
