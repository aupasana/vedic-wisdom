Namaste,

(1) Yes, tongs can be used. Copper tongs are ideal. In their absense, use 
any tongs.

(2) Cleaning is ok, but not needed.

(3) The mantra is not "Om Gam Ganapati Namah". It should be "Om Gam 
Ganapataye Namah". If you ask me, that mantra is sufficient. You may also 
want to try "Om Sreem Hreem Kleem..." mantra given in the manual.

Best regards,
Narasimha
