Dear AshwinBhai,

My mobile no is +971 506528981.

Hu to Garib Manas chhu! =
I am sending Mp3 file of 'Devi Sukta' 
recited by our world famous garu to =
your personal email. There are 
eight verses and after end of every verse, =
one needs to add swaha. 
Just listen to his intonations which will be much =
more correct then 
mine.

i hope this will be delightful for you.

Humble r=
egards,

utpal
