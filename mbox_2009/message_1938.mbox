Dear Narayan,
 
Thanks for the verse from Munda Maalaa Tantra. Out of all p=
lanet-mahavidya mappings I have seen, this is the most philosophically soun=
d mapping.
 
Sun - Taaraa - Raama
Moon - Kaali - Krishna
Mars - Bhairavi - =
Nrisimha
Mercury - Maatangi - Buddha
Jupiter - Dhumaavati - Vaamana
Venus -=
 Chhinnamastaa - Bhaargava Rama
Saturn - Bagalamukhi - Koorma
Rahu - Bhuvan=
eswari - Varaaha
Ketu - Kamala - Matsya
 
*        *        *
 
Vidya is kn=
owledge. Mahavidya is supreme knowledge. Dasa mahavidyas are the ten highes=
t forms of knowledge that take us to moksha or liberation, approaching from=
 different angles. Other kinds of knowledge (e.g. mathematics, physics, ast=
ronomy, astrology, grammar etc) do not liberate us. But these ten kinds of =
knowledge liberate us. The deities (names and forms described in books for =
ten mahavidyas) are personifications of those ten types of supreme knowledg=
e that liberate us.
 
*        *        *
 
Please note one thing here. Mok=
sha means overcoming the maayaa of the duality around us. Seeing some thing=
s as desirable, some as undesirable, some as pleasurable, some as painful, =
some as beautiful, some as ugly etc is what binds us. Overcoming the dualit=
y and seeing all as Brahman is liberation or moksha.
 
Different planets re=
present different aspects of our selves. The duality around us and the way =
to overcome it seem different from different angles. From the point of view=
 of individual soul (Sun), this maayaa is something that needs to be overco=
me by crossing and reaching the other end (supreme cosmic soul). From the p=
oint of view of mind (Moon), this duality is something that clouds the visi=
on and needs to be destroyed so that it cannot tempt again. From the point =
of view of the intellect/discrimination/dhee (Jupiter), it issomething that=
 is non-existent anyway ("so what was the problem in the first place?"), li=
ke shapes made of smoke. From the point of view of initiative and energy wi=
thin us (Mars), it is something that needs to be fought hard and fearlessly=
. From the point of view of the learning ability within us (Mercury), it is=
 something that needs to be learnt and understood fully so that we can over=
come it. From the point of view of enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is s=
omething that needs to be accepted and enjoyed and not something to fear or=
 avoid ("after all, all is Brahman. Then why stay away from enjoyments?"). =
And so on.
 
But remember one important thing. Whichever approach is taken =
to overcoming duality, the end result is the same. One first masters the ap=
proach. It becomes part of one's common sense and thinking. One eventually =
overcomes duality. One becomes self-realized and becomes liberated. That en=
d result is the same irrespective of the approach chosen.
 
*        *     =
   *
 
Sun is the soul within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from=
 delving deep into this aspect is what makes one wade (tar=3Dswim/wade/cros=
s) the ocean of delusion and get to the source. If you master the knowledge=
 that helps one view the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed to reac=
h the supreme, other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. =
Taaraa personifies this knowledge.
 
Moon is the mind within us. The highes=
t form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is an underst=
anding of attachments and desires, their impermanence and how to kill them.=
 If you master the knowledge that kills all attachments and desires and giv=
es perfect control on the mind, other things will follow and you eventually=
 get liberation. Kaali personifies this knowledge.
 
Mars is the energy and=
 initiative within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from delving de=
ep into this aspect is what gives one fearlessness of anything in the unive=
rse. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless and you do=
 not fear anything (including death or pain!) other things will follow and =
you eventually get liberation. Bhairavi personifies this knowledge.
 
Mercu=
ry is knowledge and learning ability within us. The highest form of knowled=
ge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one learning of =
various topics. If you master the knowledge that give you mastery of all ki=
nds of learning through logical and rational thinking, other things will fo=
llow and you eventually get liberation. Maatangi personifies this knowledge=
. In fact, some people associate Maatangi with Saraswati. Saraswati is also=
 known as "Maatanga Kanya".
 
Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and discrimi=
nation (dhee shakti) within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from d=
elving deep into this aspect is that all is delusion. The individual soul a=
nd individual mind and everything they perceive is just an illusion. All th=
at is there is Brahman. Any other perceptions, of various good or bad thing=
s, are just a delusion, like figures made of smoke. If you master the knowl=
edge that makes your intellect shine, you will realize that the entire worl=
d is a delusion and not deluded by anything anymore. Then other things will=
 follow and you eventually get liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this know=
ledge.
 
Venus is the spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of kn=
owledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes one egoless=
 and blissful. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless =
and you do not fear anything, including death or pain, other things will fo=
llow and you eventually get liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies this knowl=
edge. She is depicted as a deity holding her own severed head, standing nea=
r a naked couple in copulation and surrounded by associates who are drinkin=
g wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away from any pleasures,=
 but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, pleasure obtained=
 with an ego ("*I* am enjoying this act or object") binds. The headless sta=
te symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome I-ness, pleasures are not bi=
nding. One not thinking in terms of "*I* am enjoying" but having no sense o=
f "I" can live life without running away from any pleasures or undertaking =
any austerities and yet become liberated.
 
Saturn is the spirit of hard wo=
rk within us. He also represents our weaknesses and sins. The highest form =
of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes us rea=
lize our internal enemies and destroy them. If you master the knowledge tha=
t makes you overcome weaknesses such as laziness and internal enemies such =
as lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc, other things will follow and you eventu=
ally get liberation. Bagalamukhi personifies this knowledge. Most of her ma=
ntras ask to destroy enemies and so people foolishly think that she is the =
one who gives success in litigation and worship her for court cases. This i=
s like going to a king to ask for two spoons of sugar for your milk. You go=
 to the king for bigger things and a neighbor is enough for giving you two =
spoons of sugar. The enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are internal enemies =
and your own laziness. Remember, she is a mahavidya, i.e. a type of supreme=
 knowledge that liberates you!
 
Rahu is the spirit of material well-being =
within us. Rahu is the one who binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn show=
ing sins and Rahu showing rebirth are important in the death chart). The hi=
ghest form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what g=
ives us worldly success in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowledge that=
 makes you materially successful in a dharmik way, you become successful an=
d fulfil all your duties and debts in the world and eventually get liberati=
on. Bhuvaneswari personifies this knowledge.
 
Ketu is the spirit of of det=
achment and Vedic knowledge within us. The highest form of knowledge coming=
 from delving deep into this aspect is the essense of Veda. If you master t=
he knowledge that enables you to be in oneness with the supreme cosmic bein=
g, you eventually get liberation. Kamala (Mahaalakshmi) personifies this kn=
owledge. According to saptashati rahasya also, Mahaalakshmi is the Aadyaa (=
the first One). She is the energy of supreme cosmic being. She divides Hers=
elf into 3 parts - Mahaakaali, Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they cre=
ate Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts. Kamala represents the knowled=
ge of the supreme cosmic energy of the supreme cosmic being.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
One of the above is not superior to the other. Depending on your =
vasanas (mental conditioning), attitudes, likes and dislikes, depending on =
which aspect of your personality dominates over other aspects (the sinfulne=
ss and weaknesses? or the interest in learning things? or the spirit of fig=
hting? or the sense of enjoyment? etc), one Mahavidya may be more suitable =
than others, as that knowledge uses your strong aspect and moulds that aspe=
ct to take you towards liberation. Do not compare them. Take the one that i=
s most suitable, but do master that aspect.
 
*        *        *
 
There a=
re some who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one Mahavidya's mantra for o=
ne month, then switch to another and so on. They think that by doing each m=
ahavidya mantra for a certain count, they "finish" the mahavidya sadhana. T=
his is wrong and serves no useful purpose. Instead, one should pick any ONE=
 mahavidya and succeed in that sadhana. The definition of success is that t=
he knowledge represented by that deity becomes part of your common sense - =
you understand that knowledge and ooze that knowledge in your thoughts and =
actions. Whether you experience the deity as an external human-like form (w=
ho may impart some knowledge to you) or as an internal human-like form or a=
s light or as sound is secondary, but the end result should be that the kno=
wledge represented by Her should become common sense and second nature to y=
ou. One claiming visions or siddhi of a mahavidya but not showing the corre=
sponding knowledge is bluffing.
 
There are many people who do mahavidya sa=
dhana and yet many others who claim to have siddhi in one or more mahavidya=
s, but very few who actually possess any of the ten mahavidyas. The area of=
 mahavidya sadhana is one of the most ill-understood in today's age of igno=
rance and half-baked knowledge. It is easier to possess lower vidyas or low=
er shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond the capability of understanding for m=
ost people.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Kamala (Mahaal=
