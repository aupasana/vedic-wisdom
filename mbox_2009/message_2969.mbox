 4th June, 1949

Yesterday evening, by the time Bhagavan went out and came =
back, some of the
modern civilised devotees switched on all the fans in the=
 new hall and sat
there comfortably, awaiting Bhagavan=92s return.

As soon=
 as he came, he looked up and while sitting on the couch, asked the
attenda=
nts as to who had switched on all the fans. Pointing to the people
sitting =
there,they said, =93They wanted us to do so and we have done it.=94 =93I
se=
e.

What a great thing you have done! If they were feeling so very sultry i=
t
would have been sufficient if only those fans where they are sitting had
=
been switched on. Why all this?=94 asked Bhagavan.

=93They said that it wo=
uld be very pleasant if all the fans were switched on,=94
said the attendan=
ts. =93Is that so? What an amount of electric power will be
consumed by the=
se fans! What a costly bill! Why this expense on our account?
Enough, enoug=
h. Stop that,=94 said Bhagavan.

=93They are asking that they may be kept o=
n until at least the Veda Parayana
is over,=94 said Krishnaswami. =93Oh! Is=
 that so? They are rich people and so in
their houses they can sit down wit=
h fans whose use may cost ten times more
than this. Why should we have this=
?

Why this show? The hand fan is there and the hands are there. Stop them
=
all,=94 said Bhagavan. At that, the attendants switched off all the fans
ex=
cept the one above those people.

During the early days of my stay here, i.=
e. in 1941-42,someone brought an
electric fan and requested that it be used=
 by Bhagavan.

=93Why this fan? The ordinary fan is there. We have hands. I=
 will fan myself
with it whenever necessary. Why do I require all these thi=
ngs?=94 said
Bhagavan.

=93Is it not some trouble? If the electric fan is u=
sed there is no trouble
whatsoever,=94 said that devotee. =93What is the tr=
ouble? If the ordinary fan is
used we get just as much breeze as we want.

=
The electric fan blows too much breeze and with a whizzing noise. Moreover,=

some electric current is consumed. For that,there will be a bill. Why shou=
ld
we make the office bear that expense on our account?=94 said Bhagavan.

=
=93We have got it here, Swami, with the permission of the office,=94 said t=
he
devotee. =93Oh, is that so? Then let them have the fan for themselves.

=
They are people who work and it is necessary for them. Why should I need
it=
?=94 said Bhagavan. The devotee did not say anything further but went away,=

leaving the fan
there.

As it was a table fan, it was kept near Bhagavan=
=92s sofa and it used to be
switched on by someone nearby whenever it was s=
ultry.

Bhagavan would immediately say, =93It is only because of such thing=
s I had
said you should not keep it here at all. If you want a fan you can =
keep it
near yourselves.=94

And if nobody stopped it he used to stop it hi=
mself with the aid of a small
stick.
