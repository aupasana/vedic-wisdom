>From your answers seams that "yei" or "ye" has not to do with kundalini sha=
kti...

Please tell me if it's right or not..
One more thing.
Could you ple=
ase suggest me a sure reference, accessible for someone who speaks only eng=
lish (don't understand sanskrit..)  to learn more about this Sacred knowled=
ge of Mantras (books or maybe a teacher to get in touch), according to the =
vedic tradition.
In the West certain knowledge is given from people claimin=
g they have been the pupil of a certain guru or they studied in India for s=
everal years and so on. I don't know who is reliable.

Thank you for you an=
swers and your precious time

ead an explanation saying that the end "yei" was to arise the kundalini sha=
kti, so I thought that this is the best way of chanting mantra. Am I wrong?=
