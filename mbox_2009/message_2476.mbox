 =93How to avoid misery?=94 The Master answers: =93Has misery a shape? Mise=
ry is
only an unwanted thought. The mind is not strong enough to resist it.=
 It can
be strengthened by worship of God.=94 -- Talks 241

=93I have no pe=
ace of mind. Something prevents it =97 probably my destiny.=94
Bhagavan ans=
wers: =93What is destiny? There is no destiny. Surrender and all
will be we=
ll. Throw all the responsibility on God. Do not bear the burden
yourself. W=
hat can destiny do to you then?=94 -- Talks 244

=93Siva made over all His =
possessions to Vishnu and went roaming about in
forests, wildernesses and g=
raveyards, living on begged food. He found
non-possession to be higher in t=
he scale of happiness than possessions. The
higher happiness is freedom fro=
m anxiety =97 anxiety over how to protect the
possessions and how to utilis=
e them, etc.=94 -- Talks 225

=93If happiness is due to one=92s possessions=
, then it should increase and
decrease proportionately to their increase an=
d decrease, and becomes nil if
one has nothing to possess. But is this true=
? Does experience bear this out?
=93In deep sleep one is devoid of possessi=
ons, including one=92s own body; yet
one then is supremely happy. Everyone =
desires sound sleep. The conclusion is
that happiness is inherent in one=92=
s own self and is not due to external
causes. One must realise his Self in =
order to open for oneself the store of
unalloyed happiness.=94 -- Talks 3

=
=93What is happiness? Is it inherent in the Self or in the object, or in th=
e
contact between the subject and the object?=94 Bhagavan: =93When there is=

contact with a desirable object or memory thereof, and when there is freed=
om
from undesirable contacts, or memory thereof, we say there is happiness.=

Such happiness is relative and is better called pleasure. But we want
abso=
lute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in objects but in the
Ab=
solute. It is peace free from pain and pleasure =97 it is a neutral state.=
=94
-- Talks 28

=93There is a state beyond our efforts and effortlessness.=
 Until it is
realised, effort is necessary. (This is the state of samadhi, =
which is
blissful). After tasting such bliss even once, one will repeatedly=
 try to
regain it. Having once experienced the bliss of peace, no one would=
 like to
be out of it, or engage himself otherwise. It is as difficult for =
the Jnani
to engage in thought as it is for an ajnani to be free from thoug=
ht. Any
kind of activity does not affect a jnani; his mind remains ever in =
eternal
peace.=94 -- Talks 141

=93The universe exists on account of the =
=91I=92-thought. If that ends there is an
end of misery also. The person wh=
o is in sleep is also now awake. There is
happiness in sleep but misery in =
wakefulness. In sleep there was no
=91I=92-thought, but it is now while awa=
ke. The state of happiness in sleep is
effortless. We should therefore aim =
to bring about that state even now. That
requires effort.=94 -- Talks 222

=
=93Your nature is happiness. You say that this is not apparent. See what
ob=
structs you from your true being. It is pointed out to you that the
obstruc=
tion is the wrong identity. Eliminate the error. The patient himself
must t=
ake the medicine to cure his illness. If, as you say, the patient is
too we=
ak to help himself, then he must remain quiet, giving a free hand to
the do=
ctor. That is effortlessness.=94 -- Talks 295

=93The desire for happiness =
is a proof of the ever-existent happiness of the
Self. Otherwise how can de=
sire for it arise? If headache were natural to
human beings, no one would t=
ry to get rid of it. One desires only that which
is natural to him.Happines=
s, being natural, it is not acquired. Primal bliss
is obscured by the not-S=
elf, which is non-bliss, or misery. Loss of
unhappiness amounts to gaining =
of happiness. When misery is eliminated the
bliss which is ever-present is =
said to be gained. Happiness mixed with
misery is only misery.=94 -- Talks =
619

=93Why should there be suffering now?=94 Bhagavan: =93If there were no=
 suffering,
how could the desire to be happy arise? If that desire did not =
arise,how
would the quest of the Self be successful? What is happiness? Is =
it a
healthy and handsome body, or timely meals and the like? Even an Emper=
or has
endless troubles, though he may be healthy. All suffering is due to =
the
false notion =91I-am-the-body=92. Getting rid of it is jnanam.=94 -- Ta=
lks 633

News of someone=92s death was brought to the Master. He remarked: =
=93Good. The
dead are indeed happy. They have got rid of the troublesome ov=
ergrowth =97 the
body.The dead man does not grieve. The survivors grieve fo=
r him. Do men fear
sleep? On the contrary they court it and on waking up th=
ey remark that they
have had a happy sleep. Yet sleep is nothing but tempor=
ary death. Death is a
long sleep.=94 -- Talks 64

=93See how a tree, whose =
branches are cut grows again. So long as the
life-source is not affected it=
 will grow. Similarly the samskaras sink into
the heart in death: they do n=
ot perish. They are reborn. Just as a big
banyan tree sprouts from a tiny s=
eed, so the wide universe with names and
forms sprouts forth from the Heart=
.=94 -- Talks 108

=93If a person we love dies, grief results. Shall we avo=
id grief by loving all
alike, or by not loving at all?=94 Bhagavan: =93Both=
 amount to the same thing.
When all have become the one Self, who remains t=
o be loved or hated? The ego
that grieves must die. That is the only way.=
=94 -- Talks 252

=93As long as you feel yourself the doer of action so lon=
g you are bound to
enjoy its fruits. But if you find out whose karma it is,=
 you will see that
you are not the doer. Then you will be free. This requir=
es the Grace of God,
for which you should pray to Him and meditate on Him.=
=94 -- Talks 115

=93Action without motive does not bind. Even a Jnani acts=
 and there can be no
action without effort and without sankalpas =97 motive=
s. Therefore there are
sankalpas for everyone. But these are of two kinds, =
the binding
(bandha-hetu) and the liberating (mukti-hetu). The former must =
be given up
and the latter cultivated.=94 -- Talks 115

=93It is not enough=
 that one thinks of God while doing karma (service, or
worship), but one mu=
st continually and unceasingly think of Him. Only then
will the mind become=
 pure.=94 Bhagavan=92s attendant then remarked: =93Is it then
not enough th=
at I serve Bhagavan physically, but must also remember him
constantly?=94 T=
o which Bhagavan remarked: =93=91I-am-the-body=92 idea must vanish
through =
vichara.=94 -- Talks 337

=93Your idea of will-power is success insured, wh=
ereas willpower should be
understood as the strength of mind which meets su=
ccess and failure with
equanimity. It is not synonymous with certain succes=
s.Why should one=92s
attempts be always attended with success? Success deve=
lops arrogance and
one=92s spiritual progress is thereby arrested. Failures=
 on the other hand are
beneficial, inasmuch as they open one=92s eyes to on=
e=92s limitations and
prepare him to surrender himself. Therefore one shoul=
d try to gain equipoise
of mind under all circumstances. That is will-power=
. Again success and
failure are the results of prarabdha and not of will-po=
wer. One man may be
doing only good and yet prove a failure. Another may do=
 otherwise and yet be
uniformly successful. This does not mean that the wil=
l-power is absent in
one and present in the other.=94 -- Talks 423

=93Leav=
e off false notions and perceive intuitively the Real.That alone
matters. I=
f you melt a gold ornament what matters how it is melted, whole or
in parts=
, or of what shape the ornament had been? You are only interested in
the go=
ld. Realise the Self.=94 -- Talks 31

=93Celibacy is certainly an aid to re=
alisation among so many other aids.=94 --
Talks 17

=93Is not then celibacy=
 indispensable? Can a married man realise the Self?=94
Bhagavan: =93Certain=
ly, it (Realisation) is a matter of fitness of mind.
Married or unmarried o=
ne can realise the Self, because the Self is here and
now.=94 -- Talks 17

=
=93How does a grihasta fare in the scheme of Moksha?=94 Bhagavan: =93Why do=
 you
think yourself to be a grihasta? If you go out as a sannyasi, the thou=
ght
that you are a sannyasi will haunt you. You will be only substituting o=
ne
thought by another. The mental obstacles are always there. They even
inc=
rease in new surroundings. There is no help in the change of environment.
T=
he mind is the obstacle. Therefore why change the environment?=94 -- Talks =
54

=93Is the world perceived after Self-realisation?=94 Bhagavan: =93What =
does it
matter if the world is perceived or not? The ajnani sees the Jnani =
active
and is confounded. The world is perceived by both; but their outlook=
s
differ. Take the cinema, for instance. Pictures move on the screen. Let t=
he
pictures disappear. What remains? The screen alone. So also here. Even w=
hen
the world appears find out to whom it appears. Hold the substratum of t=
he
=91I=92. When the substratum is held what does it matter if the world ap=
pears or
disappears?=94 -- Talks 65

=93How to turn the mind away from the =
world, you say? Is there a world apart
from the Self? Does the world say th=
at it exists. It is you who say that
there is a world.Find out the Self who=
 says it.=94 -- Talks 81

=93You say that the world is materialistic. Wheth=
er it is materialistic or
spiritual, it is according to your outlook. Make =
your outlook right. The
Creator knows how to take care of His creation.=94 =
-- Talks 240

=93Does Bhagavan believe in evolution?=94 Bhagavan: =93Evolut=
ion must be from one
state to another When differences are not admitted, ho=
w can evolution arise?
You say that when Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that afte=
r several births the
seeker gains knowledge and thus knows =93Me=94, denote=
s evolution. But you must
not forget that the Gita begins with =93Neither I=
 was, nor you, nor these
chiefs, etc.=94; =93neither it is born, nor does i=
t die, etc.=94 So there is no
birth, no death, no present as you look at it=
. Reality was, is, and will
always be. It is changeless.=94 -- Talks 264

=
=93What should we do to ameliorate the condition of the world?=94 Bhagavan:=
 =93If
you are free from pain, there will be no pain anywhere. The trouble =
is due
to your seeing the world externally and also thinking that it has pa=
in. But
both the pain and the world are within you. If you look within ther=
e will be
no pain.=94 -- Talks 272

=93A phenomenon cannot be a reality sim=
ply because it serves a purpose. Dreams
also serve dream purposes; for exam=
ple, the dream water quenches dream
thirst. The dream creation is however c=
ontradicted in the waking state. What
is not continuous cannot be real. The=
 real is ever real, and not real once
and unreal at other times. The same i=
s with magic, which appears real yet it
is illusory. Similarly the world is=
 not real apart from the reality which
underlies it.=94 -- Talks 315

=93Th=
ere is fire on the screen in a cinema show: does it burn the screen?
There =
is a cascade of water: does it wet the screen? There are tools: do
they dam=
age the screen? Fire and water are only phenomena on the screen of
Brahman =
and do not affect it.=94 -- Talks 316

A Spanish lady writes in a letter: =
=93If the individual self merges in the
universal Self, how can we pray to =
God for the uplift of humanity?=94 Bhagavan
comments: =93They pray to God a=
nd finish with, =91Thy will be done.=92 If His will
be done why do they pra=
y at all? It is true that the Divine will prevails at
all times and under a=
ll circumstances. The individuals cannot act of their
own accord. Recognise=
 the force of the Divine will and keep quiet. Each one
is looked after by G=
od. He has created all. You are among 2,000 millions.
When He looks after s=
o many will He omit you? =93Again there is no need to let
Him know your nee=
ds. He knows them Himself and will look after them.=94 --
Talks 594

=93Sti=
ll more, why do you pray? Does not your Creator and Protector know that
you=
 are weak? You say God helps those who help themselves. Certainly, help
you=
rself and that is itself according to God=92s will. Every action is
prompte=
d by Him only. As for prayers for others it looks so unselfish on the
surfa=
ce of it. But analyse the feeling and you will detect selfishness there
als=
o. You desire others=92 happiness so that you may be happy. Or you want the=

credit for having interceded on others=92 behalf.God does not require
inte=
rmediaries. Mind your business and all will be well.=94 -- Talks 594

=93Do=
es not God work His will through some chosen person?=94 Bhagavan: =93God is=

in all and works through all. But His presence is better recognised in
pur=
ified minds. The pure one reflects God=92s actions more clearly than the
im=
pure mind. Therefore people say that they are the chosen ones. But the
chos=
en man does not himself say so. If he thinks that he is the
intermediary, t=
hen it is clear that he retains his individuality and that
there is no comp=
lete surrender.=94 -- Talks 594

=93Are not the Brahmins considered to be t=
he priests or intermediaries between
God and others?=94 Bhagavan: =93Yes, b=
ut who is a Brahmin? A Brahmin is one who
has realised Brahman. Such an one=
 has no sense of individuality in him. He
cannot think that he acts as an i=
ntermediary.=94 -- Talks 594

=93The mind is like akasa (ether of space). J=
ust as there are objects in
space, so there are thoughts in the mind.... On=
e cannot hope to measure the
universe and study the phenomena. It is imposs=
ible. For the objects are
mental creation; it is like trying to stamp with =
one=92s foot on the head of
one=92s shadow; the farther one moves the farth=
er goes the shadow=92s head.=94 --
Talks 485


=93Look how every person bel=
ieves in his own existence. Does he look in the
mirror to see his being? Hi=
s awareness of his existence gives him the
assurance of it. But he compares=
 it with the body, etc. Why should he do
that? Is he aware of his body in s=
leep? He is not, yet he does not cease to
exist while in sleep. He has ther=
efore only to be aware of his being and
this will be evident to him.=94 -- =
Talks 363

=93You speak of the vision of Siva. Vision is always of an objec=
t, which
implies the existence of the subject.Whatever appears must also di=
sappear. A
vision can never be eternal. But Siva is eternal. He is the cons=
ciousness.
He is the Self.=93TO BE is to realise =97 hence I AM THAT I AM. =
I AM is Siva.
Nothing can be without Him. Therefore enquire =91Who am I?=92=
 Sink deep and
abide as the Self. That is Siva as BEing.Do not expect to ha=
ve visions of
Him.=94 -- Talks 450

=93There is no being who is not conscio=
us and therefore who is not Siva. Not
only he is Siva but also all else. Ye=
t he thinks in sheer ignorance that he
sees the universe in diverse forms. =
But if he sees the Self he will not be
aware of his separateness from the u=
niverse. Siva is then seen as the
universe. But (unfortunately) the seer do=
es not see the background. Think of
the man who sees only the cloth and not=
 the cotton of which it is made, or
the pictures and not the screen; or the=
 letters which he reads and not the
paper on which they are written. Siva i=
s both the Being assuming the forms
in the universe as well as the consciou=
sness that sees them. That is to say
Siva is the background underlying both=
 the subject and the object =97 Siva in
repose and Siva in action. Whatever=
 it is said to be, it is only
Consciousness, whether in repose or in action=
.=94 -- Talks 450

=93The Cosmic Mind, being not limited by the ego, has no=
thing separate from
itself and is therefore only aware. This is what the Bi=
ble means by =91I am
that I Am=92.=94 -- Talks 187

=93There is the peacefu=
l mind which is the supreme. When the same becomes
restless, it is afflicte=
d by thoughts. Mind is only the dynamic power
(shakti) of the Self. There i=
s no difference between matter and spirit.
Modern science admits that all m=
atter is energy. Energy is power or force
(shakti). Therefore all are resol=
ved in Siva and Shakti, i.e., the Self and
the Mind.=94 -- Talks 268

=93Sh=
ould I meditate on the right chest in order to meditate on the Heart?=94
Bh=
agavan: =93The Heart is not physical. Meditation should not be on the right=

or the left. It should be on the Self. Everyone knows =93I am=94. It is ne=
ither
within nor without, neither on the right nor the left: =91I am=92 =97=
 that is
all.=94 -- Talks 273

=93The silence of solitude is forced. Restra=
ined speech in society amounts to
silence. For the man then controls his sp=
eech. If the speaker is engaged
otherwise speech becomes restrained. Introv=
erted mind is otherwise active
and is not anxious to speak.=94 -- Talks 60
=

Bhagavan says that going to places of solitude for the purpose of
cultivat=
ing the habit of silence is not of much value; for it is a forced
state for=
 lack of company; whereas control of the tongue in society is true
silence,=
 and thus true self-control.

=93Mouna as a disciplinary measure is meant f=
or limiting the mental activities
due to speech. If the mind is otherwise c=
ontrolled disciplinary mouna is
unnecessary. For mouna becomes natural.=94 =
-- Talks 60

Note: Why do sadhakas cultivate silence? In order to silence t=
he mind. But
this is holding the stick by the wrong end; for it is not spee=
ch that causes
thinking, but thinking that causes speaking. Conversation, n=
o doubt,
provokes thinking and therefore talking, but if the mind has not b=
een
brought under control, even if there is no one to talk to, the mind wil=
l
talk to itself; memory in particular will surge up and will fill the mind=

with thoughts of the dead past. The mind in solitude will then be in a far=

worse condition than in society. Memory is a more dangerous companion than=

the society of sattvic friends, who may sometimes talk on irrelevant
matte=
rs, but this may prove a help to the sadhaka,in that it serves to break
his=
 brooding over a chain of unhappy events which are dead and gone, and
whose=
 resuscitation may depress the mind, which he endeavours to keep
cheerful f=
or the sake of a successful sadhana.

=93When Sita was asked by the wives o=
f the Rishis who was her husband among
the then assembled Rishis in the for=
est, she denied each one as he by turn
was pointed to her, but simply speec=
hlessly hung down her head when Rama
himself was pointed out. Her silence w=
as eloquent. The Vedas are similarly
eloquent in =91Neti=92, =91Neti=92 (=
=91not this=92, =91not this=92) and then remain silent.
Their silence is th=
e Real state. This is the meaning of teaching through
silence.When the sour=
ce of the =91I=92-thought is reached, it vanishes and what
remains over is =
the Self.=94 -- Talks 130

=93Mouna is not closing the mouth. It is the sta=
te which transcends speech and
thought. Hold some concept firmly and trace =
it back. By such concentration
silence results. When practice becomes natur=
al it will end in silence.
Meditation without mental activity is silence.=
=94 -- Talks 231

=93Does distance have any effect on Grace?=94 asks the Am=
erican visitor, and Sri
Bhagavan answers: =93Time and space are within you.=
 You are always the Self
you are seeking. How do time and space affect it?=
=94 -- Talks 127

=93How to transcend the mind?=94 The Master answers: =93M=
ind is by nature
restless. Begin liberating it from its restlessness: give =
it peace; make it
free from distractions; train it to look inward; make thi=
s a habit. This is
done by ignoring the external world and removal of the o=
bstacles to the
peace of mind.=94 -- Talks 26

=93External contacts =97 con=
tacts with objects other than itself =97 make the mind
restless. Loss of in=
terests in the not-Self (vairagya) is the first step.
Then the habits of in=
trospection and concentration follow, ending in
samadhi.=94 -- Talks 26

=
=93An examination of the ephemeral nature of the external phenomena leads t=
o
vairagya. Hence enquiry is the first and foremost step to be taken, which=

will result in contempt for wealth, fame, ease, pleasure, etc. The =91I=92=
-
thought becomes clearer for inspection.=94 -- Talks 27

=93If, however, t=
he aspirant is not temperamentally suited to the vichara
marga, he must dev=
elop bhakti (devotion) to an Ideal =97 maybe God, Guru,
Humanity in general=
,ethical laws, or even the idea of Beauty. When one of
these has taken poss=
ession of the individual, other attachments grow weaker
and dispassion (vai=
ragya) develops. Thus ekagrata (concentration) grows
simultaneously and imp=
erceptibly.

=93In the absence of vichara and bhakti, control of breath (pr=
anayama) may be
tried. This is known as Yoga marga. If the breath is held t=
he mind cannot
jump at its pets =97 the objects. Thus there is rest for the=
 mind so long as
the breath is held. The mind improves by practice and beco=
mes finer, just as
the razor=92s edge is sharpened by stropping.=94 -- Talk=
s 27

=93If the origin is sat only, why is it not felt?=94 Bhagavan: =93The=
 salt in lump
is visible, but invisible in solution; still it is cognised b=
y its taste.
Similarly sat (or truth), though not perceived by the intellec=
t is still
realisable in other ways. How? Just as a man who has been robbed=
 and
blindfolded by robbers and thrown in a jungle enquires his way and ret=
urns
home, so also the ajnani who is blinded by ignorance enquires his way =
from
the Jnani and returns to his source.=94 -- Talks 108

=93Please help m=
e to realise the Self. It is no use reading books.=94 Bhagavan
answers, =93=
Quite so. If the Self be found in books, it would have been
realised long a=
go. Is it not a wonder that we should seek the Self in books?
Can it be fou=
nd there? Of course books have impelled the question.=94 -- Talks
117

=93H=
e who instructs an ardent seeker to do this or that (work) is not a true
ma=
ster. The seeker is already afflicted by his activities and wants peace
and=
 rest. He wants cessation of his activities. Instead he is told to do
somet=
hing in addition to, or in place of, his other activities.=94 -- Talks
601
=

=93Be what you are. There is nothing to come down or manifest itself. What=
 is
needed is losing the ego. That which is, is ever present. Even now you =
are
It, and not apart from It. The blank is seen by you. You are always the=
re.
What do you wait for? The expectation to see and the desire to get some=
thing
are all the working of the ego. You have fallen into the snare of the=
 ego,
which says all this. Be yourself and nothing more.=94 -- Talks 183

=
=93Grace is always there, but practice is necessary.=94 -- Talks 220

=93Th=
ere is no entity by the name mind. Because of the emergence of thoughts
we =
surmise a thing from which they start. That we term mind. When we probe
to =
see what it is, there is nothing like it. Buddhi or intellect is the
thinki=
ng or discriminating faculty. But these are mere names. Ego, mind and
intel=
lect are all the same. Whose mind? Whose intellect? The ego=92s. Is the
ego=
 real? No. We confound the ego and call it intellect or mind.=94 -- Talks
2=

=93To realise the Self effort is necessary. Just as water is got by bor=
ing
wells, so also you realise the Self by investigation.=94 -- Talks 240

=
=93Meditation is sticking to one thought. That single thought keeps away ot=
her
thoughts; distraction of mind is a sign of its weakness. By constant
me=

place=
 to the enduring background free from thoughts. This expanse devoid of
thou=
ghts is the Self. Mind in purity is the Self.=94 -- Talks 293

=93The Bible=
 says, =91Be still and know that I am God.=92 Stillness is the sole
requisi=
te for the realisation of the Self as God. The whole Vedanta is
contained i=
n the two Biblical statements: =91I AM THAT I AM=92, and =91BE STILL
AND KN=
OW THAT I AM GOD=92.=94 -- Talks 338

=93Deep sleep is nothing but the expe=
rience of pure being.=94 -- Talks 617

=93A child and a Jnani are similar i=
n a way. The interest of the child in
things ends with the things. These le=
ave no impressions in the child=92s mind.
The same is the case with the Jna=
ni.=94 -- Talks 9

Note: Desires are the cause of all our trouble. We look =
around this
magnificent world of diversity and desire the things which impr=
ess us most,
and so do our best to obtain them.We sacrifice a lot and suffe=
r any amount
of inconvenience for the sake of the desired object till we ge=
t it. Yet our
trouble does not end with this acquisition, for new aims and =
objects rise
before us and lure us into new desires and what we call new ne=
eds, for which
we have again to exert and again to suffer; and so on and on=
 endlessly. Thus
we remain bound hand and foot to the world without rest an=
d without
satisfaction. But the Jnani, having cultivated and achieved desir=
elessness,
has not the least interest in the world around him, so that his =
perceptions
do not leave any impression on his mind. Even if he evinces an =
interest in
an object it is only one of curiosity, much like that of a chil=
d in its
surroundings, which passes away the moment it turns its back on th=
em.

=93A Self-realised being cannot help benefiting the world His very exi=
stence
is the highest good.=94 -- Talks 210

Note: This should satisfy thos=
e who criticise the Jnani as a useless
ascetic, should they be fortunate en=
ough to read it.The wisdom that flows
from his lips and the purity of his l=
ife and conduct stand as shining ideals
for humanity to emulate, or aspire =
for, which no amount of preaching
Socialism,Communism and philanthropy can =
do. What has all this preaching
created except more antagonism, more divisi=
ons,more jealousy, and thus more
hatred in the world. If these preachers re=
ally mean well and are sincere,
they should turn into true ascetics and bec=
ome Saints themselves and see the
difference between their old preaching an=
d the good they can do with their
holiness and purity by their mere presenc=
e. If they cannot do that, they
should mind their own business, and try to =
bring peace and good to
themselves before they can stand before the world a=
nd boast of doing good to
others.

MANA MAHARSHI By S.S. COHEN

..... to think is not your real nature. (Talks=
 184).

Just on waking from sleep and before becoming aware of the world th=
ere is
that pure =91I=92=97=91I=92. Hold it without sleeping or without all=
owing thoughts to
possess you. If that is held firm it does not matter even=
 though the world
is seen. The seer remains unaffected by the phenomena. (T=
alks, 196).

Your duty is to be; and not to be this or that. =91I AM THAT I=
 AM=92 sums up the
whole truth. The method is, summed up in =91BE STILL=92.=
 What does stillness
mean? It means =91destroy yourself =92. Because any fo=
rm or shape is the cause
of trouble. Give up the notion =91I am so and so=
=92. (Talks, 363).

It is in the mind that birth and death, pleasure and pa=
in,in short, the
world and ego, exist. If the mind is destroyed all else ar=
e destroyed too.
Note that it should be annihilated, not just made latent. =
For the mind is
dormant in sleep. It does not know anything. Still, on waki=
ng up you are as
you were before.There is no end of grief. But if the mind =
be destroyed the
grief will have no background and will disappear along wit=
h the mind.
(Talks, 195).

=91Be still and know that I am God=92. To be sti=
ll is not to think. Know, and
not think, is the word! (Talks, 131).

Solitu=
de is in the mind of man. One might be in the thick of the world and
mainta=
in serenity of mind; such a one is in solitude. Another may stay in
the for=
est but still be unable to control his mind. He cannot be said to be
in sol=
itude. Solitude is a function of the mind. A man attached to desire
cannot =
get solitude wherever he many be; a detached man is always in
solitude. (Ta=
lks, 20).

Jnana-marga and bhakti-marga are one and the same. Selfsurrender=
 leads to
realisation just as enquiry does. Complete self-surrender means t=
hat you
have no further thought of =91I=92.Then all your vasanas are washed=
 off and you
are free. You should not continue as a separate entity at the =
end of either
course. (Talks, 31).

Dvaita and Advaita are relative terms. =
They are based on the sense of
duality. The Self is as It is. There is neit=
her dvaita nor advaita, I AM
THAT I AM. Simple Be-ing is the Self. (Talks, =
433).

The Self is known to everyone but not clearly. You always exist. The=
 Be-ing
is the Self. =91I am=92 is the name of God. Of all the definitions =
of God, none
is indeed so well put as the Biblical statement =91I am that I=
 am=92 in Exodus
3, Verse 14. None is so direct as the name JEHOVAH... I AM=
. The Absolute
Be-ing is what is... It is the Self. It is God. Knowing the =
Self, God is
known. In fact God is none other than the Self. (Talks, 106).
=

The Bible says =91Be still and know that I am God=92.Stillness is the sole=

requisite for the realisation of the Self as God. (Talks, 338).

But men w=
ant absolute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in
objects, but =
in the Absolute. It is Peace, free from pain and pleasure... it
is a neutra=
l state. (Talks, 28).

Nirvana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is=
 neither subject nor
object; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothi=
ng to know. Seeking
and knowing are the functions of the mind. In Nirvana t=
here is nothing but
the blissful pure consciousness =91I am=92. (Talks, 406=
).

 =93What does it matter if the world is perceived or not? The ajnani sees t=

<br>=93A phenomenon cannot be a reality simply because it serves a =

 do sadhakas cultivate silence? In order to silence the mind. But this is h=

king and therefore talking, but if the mind has not been brought under cont=
rol, even if there is no one to talk to, the mind will talk to itself; memo=
ry in particular will surge up and will fill the mind with thoughts of the =
dead past. The mind in solitude will then be in a far worse condition than =
in society. Memory is a more dangerous companion than the society of sattvi=
c friends, who may sometimes talk on irrelevant matters, but this may prove=
 a help to the sadhaka,in that it serves to break his brooding over a chain=

er, but simply speechlessly hung down her head when Rama himself was pointe=
d out. Her silence was eloquent. The Vedas are similarly eloquent in =91Net=
i=92, =91Neti=92 (=91not this=92, =91not this=92) and then remain silent. T=
heir silence is the Real state. This is the meaning of teaching through sil=
ence.When the source of the =91I=92-thought is reached, it vanishes and wha=
t remains over is the Self.=94 -- Talks 130</span><br>

<br>=93Mouna is not=
 closing the mouth. It is the state which transcends speech and thought. Ho=
ld some concept firmly and trace it back. By such concentration silence res=
ults. When practice becomes natural it will end in silence. Meditation with=
out mental activity is silence.=94 -- Talks 231<br>

<br>=93Does distance h=
ave any effect on Grace?=94 asks the American visitor, and Sri Bhagavan ans=
wers: =93Time and space are within you. You are always the Self you are see=
king. How do time and space affect it?=94 -- Talks 127<br>

<br>=93How to t=
ranscend the mind?=94 The Master answers: =93Mind is by nature restless. Be=
gin liberating it from its restlessness: give it peace; make it free from d=
istractions; train it to look inward; make this a habit. This is done by ig=
noring the external world and removal of the obstacles to the peace of mind=
.=94 -- Talks 26<br>

<br>=93External contacts =97 contacts with objects ot=
her than itself =97 make the mind restless. Loss of interests in the not-Se=
lf (vairagya) is the first step. Then the habits of introspection and conce=
ntration follow, ending in samadhi.=94 -- Talks 26<br>

<br>=93An examinati=
on of the ephemeral nature of the external phenomena leads to vairagya. Hen=
ce enquiry is the first and foremost step to be taken, which will result in=
 contempt for wealth, fame, ease, pleasure, etc. The =91I=92- thought becom=
es clearer for inspection.=94 -- Talks 27<br>

<br>=93If, however, the aspi=
rant is not temperamentally suited to the vichara marga, he must develop bh=
akti (devotion) to an Ideal =97 maybe God, Guru, Humanity in general,ethica=
l laws, or even the idea of Beauty. When one of these has taken possession =
of the individual, other attachments grow weaker and dispassion (vairagya) =
develops. Thus ekagrata (concentration) grows simultaneously and impercepti=
bly.<br>

<br>=93In the absence of vichara and bhakti, control of breath (p=
ranayama) may be tried. This is known as Yoga marga. If the breath is held =
the mind cannot jump at its pets =97 the objects. Thus there is rest for th=
e mind so long as the breath is held. The mind improves by practice and bec=
omes finer, just as the razor=92s edge is sharpened by stropping.=94 -- Tal=
ks 27<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=93If the origin is sat onl=
y, why is it not felt?=94 Bhagavan: =93The salt in lump is visible, but inv=
isible in solution; still it is cognised by its taste. Similarly sat (or tr=
uth), though not perceived by the intellect is still realisable in other wa=
ys. How? Just as a man who has been robbed and blindfolded by robbers and t=
hrown in a jungle enquires his way and returns home, so also the ajnani who=
 is blinded by ignorance enquires his way from the Jnani and returns to his=
 source.=94 -- Talks 108</span><br>

<br>=93Please help me to realise the S=
elf. It is no use reading books.=94 Bhagavan answers, =93Quite so. If the S=
elf be found in books, it would have been realised long ago. Is it not a wo=
nder that we should seek the Self in books? Can it be found there? Of cours=
e books have impelled the question.=94 -- Talks 117<br>

<br>=93He who inst=
ructs an ardent seeker to do this or that (work) is not a true master. The =
seeker is already afflicted by his activities and wants peace and rest. He =
wants cessation of his activities. Instead he is told to do something in ad=
dition to, or in place of, his other activities.=94 -- Talks 601<br>

<br>=
=93Be what you are. There is nothing to come down or manifest itself. What =
is needed is losing the ego. That which is, is ever present. Even now you a=
re It, and not apart from It. The blank is seen by you. You are always ther=
e. What do you wait for? The expectation to see and the desire to get somet=
hing are all the working of the ego. You have fallen into the snare of the =
ego, which says all this. Be yourself and nothing more.=94 -- Talks 183<br>=


<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=93Grace is always there, but practi=
ce is necessary.=94 -- Talks 220</span><br><br>=93There is no entity by the=
 name mind. Because of the emergence of thoughts we surmise a thing from wh=
ich they start. That we term mind. When we probe to see what it is, there i=
s nothing like it. Buddhi or intellect is the thinking or discriminating fa=
culty. But these are mere names. Ego, mind and intellect are all the same. =
Whose mind? Whose intellect? The ego=92s. Is the ego real? No. We confound =
the ego and call it intellect or mind.=94 -- Talks 237<br>

<br>=93To reali=
se the Self effort is necessary. Just as water is got by boring wells, so a=
lso you realise the Self by investigation.=94 -- Talks 240<br><br>=93Medita=
tion is sticking to one thought. That single thought keeps away other thoug=
hts; distraction of mind is a sign of its weakness. By constant meditation =
it gains strength, i.e., weakness of fugitive thoughts gives place to the e=
nduring background free from thoughts. This expanse devoid of thoughts is t=
he Self. Mind in purity is the Self.=94 -- Talks 293<br>

<br><span style=
=3D"font-weight:bold">=93The Bible says, =91Be still and know that I am God=
.=92 Stillness is the sole requisite for the realisation of the Self as God=
. The whole Vedanta is contained in the two Biblical statements: =91I AM TH=
AT I AM=92, and =91BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD=92.=94 -- Talks 338</spa=
n><br>

<br>=93Deep sleep is nothing but the experience of pure being.=94 -=
- Talks 617<br><br>=93A child and a Jnani are similar in a way. The interes=
t of the child in things ends with the things. These leave no impressions i=
n the child=92s mind. The same is the case with the Jnani.=94 -- Talks 9<br=
>

<br>Note: Desires are the cause of all our trouble. We look around this =
magnificent world of diversity and desire the things which impress us most,=
 and so do our best to obtain them.We sacrifice a lot and suffer any amount=
 of inconvenience for the sake of the desired object till we get it. Yet ou=
r trouble does not end with this acquisition, for new aims and objects rise=
 before us and lure us into new desires and what we call new needs, for whi=
ch we have again to exert and again to suffer; and so on and on endlessly. =
Thus we remain bound hand and foot to the world without rest and without sa=
tisfaction. But the Jnani, having cultivated and achieved desirelessness, h=
as not the least interest in the world around him, so that his perceptions =
do not leave any impression on his mind. Even if he evinces an interest in =
an object it is only one of curiosity, much like that of a child in its sur=
roundings, which passes away the moment it turns its back on them.<br>

se who criticise the Jnani as a useless ascetic, should they be fortunate e=

 for, which no amount of preaching Socialism,Communism and philanthropy can=

 (Talks, 196).<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Your duty is to be=
; and not to be this or that. =91I AM THAT I AM=92 sums up the whole truth.=
 The method is, summed up in =91BE STILL=92. What does stillness mean? It m=
eans =91destroy yourself =92. Because any form or shape is the cause of tro=
uble. Give up the notion =91I am so and so=92. (Talks, 363).</span><br>

<b=
r>It is in the mind that birth and death, pleasure and pain,in short, the w=
orld and ego, exist. If the mind is destroyed all else are destroyed too. N=
ote that it should be annihilated, not just made latent. For the mind is do=
rmant in sleep. It does not know anything. Still, on waking up you are as y=
ou were before.There is no end of grief. But if the mind be destroyed the g=
rief will have no background and will disappear along with the mind. (Talks=
, 195).<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=91Be still and know that=
 I am God=92. To be still is not to think. Know, and not think, is the word=
! (Talks, 131).</span><br><br>Solitude is in the mind of man. One might be =
in the thick of the world and maintain serenity of mind; such a one is in s=
olitude. Another may stay in the forest but still be unable to control his =
mind. He cannot be said to be in solitude. Solitude is a function of the mi=
nd. A man attached to desire cannot get solitude wherever he many be; a det=
ached man is always in solitude. (Talks, 20).<br>

<br>Jnana-marga and bhak=
ti-marga are one and the same. Selfsurrender leads to realisation just as e=
nquiry does. Complete self-surrender means that you have no further thought=
 of =91I=92.Then all your vasanas are washed off and you are free. You shou=
ld not continue as a separate entity at the end of either course. (Talks, 3=
1).<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Dvaita and Advaita are relat=
ive terms. They are based on the sense of duality. The Self is as It is. Th=
ere is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM THAT I AM. Simple Be-ing is the Sel=
f. (Talks, 433).</span><br>

<br>The Self is known to everyone but not clea=
rly. You always exist. The Be-ing is the Self. =91I am=92 is the name of Go=
d. Of all the definitions of God, none is indeed so well put as the Biblica=
l statement =91I am that I am=92 in Exodus 3, Verse 14. None is so direct a=
s the name JEHOVAH... I AM. The Absolute Be-ing is what is... It is the Sel=
f. It is God. Knowing the Self, God is known. In fact God is none other tha=
n the Self. (Talks, 106).<br>

<br>The Bible says =91Be still and know that=
 I am God=92.Stillness is the sole requisite for the realisation of the Sel=
f as God. (Talks, 338).<br><br>But men want absolute and permanent happines=
s. This does not reside in objects, but in the Absolute. It is Peace, free =
from pain and pleasure... it is a neutral state. (Talks, 28).<br>

<br>Nirv=
ana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is neither subject nor object=
; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothing to know. Seeking and kno=
