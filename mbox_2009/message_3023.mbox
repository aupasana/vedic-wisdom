Namaste Friends,
  By  Gods grace we had a great trip and have returned ho=
me full of beautiful memories and contentment.
  We visited Kamakhya Ma tem=
ple first.It was not very crowded so we had a nice darshan.Inside the mandi=
r,the pujariji asked us to drink some of the water from a little that was f=
lowing there.I had some and then my heart started beating very fast.I don't=
 know whether it was because i drank a nice palmful of water or because one=
 had to bend quite a bit to reach the water.
   Then we visited-kaziranga,s=
hillong.gangtok,darjeeling,kalimpong.All such beautiful places.
And finally=
 we reached kolkatta.First thing we did was to visit Ma at Kalighat.Some fr=
iends had prearranged a panda,so we did not have much problem.Again we had =
a beautiful darshan.The panda seemed to have some influence,he stopped the =
other people, and we had Ma to ourselves for 5 mins. or so.I was only tryin=
g to see and absorb the murat of Ma.She was so different from what i had al=
ways imagined.So beautiful....'Madhuram' was the only word that came to min=
d.
    Same was the case at Dakshineshwar.Ma looked so beautiful and loving=
.I kept going again and again--from the side,twice from front---i would go =
and join the queue again so i could have just one more look.
And due to all=
 this we could not visit Belur Math.But i dont mind.I'll go back,again and =
again.
   The best darshan we had was of Adya Ma. The  bhog aarti had just =
begun when we reached.We stayed there for the whole aarti.There were bhajan=
s and strotras from chandi path being sung.It was a great atmosphere.It fel=
t great.
   And finaly,we went to Gangasagar.It was shani pradosh  of karti=
k that day,though i dont know if it has any importance!.
    I felt nice.La=
st year, i had seen the udgam of Gangaji at Gaumukh ,and here i was, at the=
 final resting  point of Ganga.
            A cycle complete. 
I feel very =
nice and content.Whole and complete.even when writing  this.I wish to stay =
with this feeling for sometime,so i will stop here.
Thankyou once again for=
 your advice and wishes,

Sunita.
