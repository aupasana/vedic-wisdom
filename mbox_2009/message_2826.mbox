Dear Vemparlaramkishore
=C2=A0
Generally I agree with the spirit of your ma=
il, though my personal opinion about different religions is more drastic th=
an yours. 
=C2=A0
For exmaple you mentioned:
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is my humble =
opinion that the Avatars of Christ and Mohammed came to atleast steer the w=
estern continent towards a little dharma. The modern day versions of both t=
hese faiths have deviated much from the original messages.
=C2=A0
In my ana=
lysis Muhammed, was not an avatar by any stretch of imagination. I consider=
 him to a historical leader, like an Alexander or a Napoleon, and like all =
leaders he had the ability to go out there among the masses and get the job=
 done. This is where leaders differ from arm-chair philosophers. But I am q=
uite skeptical about Muhammed the "spiritual leader".=C2=A0=C2=A0In my anal=
ysis - and I have spend substantial time studying the Koran, aHadiths, vari=
ous Tafsirs as well as the history of Islam=C2=A0- I found more politics th=
an spirituality, right at the heart. However, this is not the right forum t=
o go into a detailed discussion on this topic, so I stop here.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
The Abrahamic faiths also do not beleive in Reincarnation
=C2=A0
=C2=A0=

I find the ten commandment of Moses -=C2=A0the crux of Abrahamic religions=
 - to be a supreme source of controversy and infact the very seed of fanati=
csm is sown right inside there. 
=C2=A0
I find studying the life of D=C4=81=
rayavahu=C5=A1 (Darius I of ancient Persia) to be of more value than the te=
n commandments. Not only as an emperor of one of the greatest empires=C2=A0=
in the world, but as a man of extreme sagacity and wisdom. Darius believed =
in Ahura Mazda. He said "Ahura Mazda is truth" and explained and understood=
 this sentence of mean that anything which is true is Ahura Mazda. Instead,=
 if he had made a statement that " Ahura Mazda is the ONLY truth" - he woul=
d have bred fanaticism. That is why he had no religio-philosophical=C2=A0co=
nflicts in helping the Jews to built their second temple as well as the Egy=
ptians to build a temple of Ra. His army contained=C2=A0Arabs, Hindus, Pers=
ians, Jews=C2=A0etc=C2=A0and all lived in perfect harmony - each with his o=
wn religious interpretations. That is why he is the only non-Jew who has be=
en accorded a special status among the prophets of Jews in the Old Testamen=
t.He infact made it compulsory that every individual=C2=A0in his
 kingdom w=
ould undergo a training for few years on three things=C2=A0before he would =
be free and productive=C2=A0in society - horse riding, shooting arrows and =
telling the truth! 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0As I see it, Darius did what Moses could n=
ot and he understood what Moses never could.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I apologize befo=
rehand if any feathers are ruffled.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
My suggestion would be, do=
n't worry abt ruffling feathers. For=C2=A0too long we have chosen artificia=
l ideas of political correctness and misconstrued secularism inplace of the=
 truth. Maybe it is time to follow the truth as we see it, whereever it may=
 lead us. 
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

The upsurge (of consci=
ousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

=C2=A0 



Raj=
arishi Ji

Please treat these as just my thoughts.I am very much junior in =
both wisdom and scripturual knowledge.

"To add to my query,=C3=82 a good n=
umber of=C3=82 religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlyin=
g truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? "

The Abrahamic faiths als=
o do not beleive in Reincarnation. In reality the underlying truth is there=
 is a lot of contradiction ...but then the face of christianity you know to=
day might not even be what it was originally.

1.The version of Christianit=
y you know today is the one obtained after Ceasar forcibly burnt all the gn=
ostic bibles and differing versions of truth ....

2.All upcomign historica=
l evidence points to the fact that Christ had a wife by name Mary Magdalene=
... .

Now Christianity condemns the very concept of sex as cardinal sin an=
d assumes every human being is born in Sin.

3.In Kashmir there is still a =
place where they worship the padukas of christ when he visited Kashmir...

=
History and Religion are written by the victors.

Same is the case with Isl=
am...If you open any authentic version of the holy book you will be surpris=
ed by some of the inconsistent verses which often smack of hate...of a worl=
d filled with Kafirs and Non beleivers and Explicit prohibition of Idol wor=
ship etc.

It is my humble opinion that the Avatars of Christ and Mohammed =
came to atleast steer the western continent towards a little dharma. The mo=
dern day versions of both these faiths have deviated much from the original=
 messages.

Hinduism also has deviated from the spirit of the vedas with co=
rruptions entering into the practise of caste etc...but still is much bette=
r in preservation of the original meaning.

Yogananda, Sivananda , Maharish=
i Mahesh Yogi and various saints including Srila Prabhupada when they enter=
ed the west in the early 1960's had the unenviable task of explaining some =
of the concepts in terms which the westerner could understand. The parallel=
 imagery is what comes from that...

If somebody could separate the chaff f=
rom the grain and read the books they will definetly reach salvation in tho=
se paths, if not it is much better to stick to Hinduism.

I apologize befor=
ehand if any feathers are ruffled.

Regards
VemparlaRamKishore

=C3=82 <BR>> There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was ta=
ken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nad=
u before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of=
 that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C3=
=82 form of the divine Mother=C3=82 present there was a Tamil lan=
guage name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now=
. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front=
 of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face=
 was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there=
. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, bu=
t it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof ov=
er the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each =
time
 and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.=
 Though we spent only 5 min and left<BR>> in a hurry, I was very pleased=
 with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the t=
emple and goddess.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Like this, I am sure there =

isailam and Mantralayam=C3=82 and Ujjain in central India.<BR>> =C3=
=82 <BR>> There are many other good places, but the above come to m=

 there is quite another.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> B=
