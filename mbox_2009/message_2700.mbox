Pranaams,

>In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consciousness (Brahma=
n or >Aatman),where there are no I-ness or any objectification. 

Does it m=
ean that when consciousness reaches Sahasraar Chakra, one merges in to Brah=
man and that is the same state which is named varyingly as Realisation/Jeev=
an Mukta/Nirvikalpa Samaadhi/Merging in to brahaman etc...?

Why i asked yo=
u this question is because, i am little confused here. if i remember correc=
tly, in "Auto Biography of a Yogi", it is mentioned that only the souls who=
 depart from Sahsraar are eligible to enter to Suvarnaa loka and then there=
 they have to still work out the bondage of their Karana Shareera...
Is it =
not true that Chetana reaching Sahsraar means *practically* end of journey.=
?

How to reconcile with the above to seemingly different informations?

Be=
st Regards,

Utpal

 All those concepts one has about who one is, form one's self-awareness and=
 Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadha=
ara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one's cumulative=
 idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishtha=
ana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one's=
 cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.
> > >

 Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are =
often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (=
which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini =
actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not=
 perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Simil=
arly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one's c=
umulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level o=
f existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one's notio=
n of self ("I"), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.
