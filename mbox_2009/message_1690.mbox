Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,

Rajarshi's question was in some aspect=
 similar to one question i was asked about a month ago. while traveling bac=
k to home from office, one person asked me that what is these stories of ou=
r Gods such as Ganapati and his story of being Shiva's son and cutting of h=
ead and replaced by elephant head etc...
Stories of Vishnu and like wise ma=
ny gods and goddesses. The person told me that people from other make fun a=
bout all these various gods and their *mythological* events which is record=
ed in our Shastras.

I wish to ask here a nagging question. what is the tru=
th. for instance, did Ganapati and shiva's episode actually happen? Stories=
 in Devi Mahatmay are true?. Episode of Daksh Yagya and Uma's self killing =
in yagya vedi out of anger and origin of Shakti pithas are true?

Stories o=
f Indra and other many gods and goddesses are true?

Do they really exist? =
(Even if at the different plane of existence) or the people who criticize a=
re right when they say that yours is a full of stories which are only mytho=
logical and you pray those imaginary Gods which are nothing but characters =
of Stories of some writer.

I could not answer the question as i was not su=
re.


Spiritually yours,

Utpal

tually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different in each case, depen=

 the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect shown is diff=

these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic emotions assoc=

rnal forms of deities who personify different aspects of divine energy runn=

on of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of condit=
ioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or thought about=
 or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, but may have a vision=
 of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated through many lives. A=
n example is the boy mentioned in the following message:

s.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761

> He had not read about some=
 of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could=
 describe them. This is because those forms represent a personification of =
a certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previo=
us life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it ca=
n come back anytime. So, though he did not know about that form, that form =
appeared before him.
>  
> Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphrased), "=
a human being imagines god as a super human being with many hands and heads=
. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffalo with man=
y horns". Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It may incor=
rectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a work of the m=
ind, that does not make them unimportant.
>  
> Until one learns how to fee=
l sorry and show that feeling, saying "I am sorry" as a ritual is an import=
ant habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot anyway understand t=
heir correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he does n=
ot understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, though =
the energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific external for=
m associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy only by i=
magining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one's mind tends to im=
agine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.
>

gh we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences are a creation of =
mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe is a=
 creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is real and not creat=
ed by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind over the time. If=
 we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imagination of the mi=
nd, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connected to its field =
of experience. Various minds in its field of experience are connected to it=
. For example, the experience described in the following message was indepe=
ndently "observed" by two people. Human mind can imagine things and halluci=
nate, but two minds observing the same thing is different from a typical ha=
llucination:

> When someone looks sad, one person may say =
"he is sad". Another person may say "woh dukhi hai". Another person may say=
 "vaadu baadha padutunnaadu". Similarly, when a divine energy is present in=
 a place, one may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perceive i=
t as a deity Y. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeling one=
 perceives is based on the language one knows, similarly the form mentioned=
 by one to describe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioning of =
one's mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.

person who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the=
 Divine Mother into his heart by showing the fire with his hands and motion=

t perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he =
was doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind hi=
m. His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he =
was baffled and opened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision o=
f a dark goddess who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumku=
m (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and =
opened his eyes. But the person who did homam perceived only some nice ener=
gy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by differen=
t people in a different form. One person may perceive only some energy and =
another may perceive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different =
form. The exact perception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But th=
e energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.
