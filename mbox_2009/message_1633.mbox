Dear Ajit,

I am really sorry, but I have to disagree with you in this issue.

With due respect to you and Sri S.N. Sastri, I must say that Rajarshi's view 
is far more accurate and truthful to the scripture. In fact, Swami 
Vivekananda also shared exactly the same view (i.e. Rajarshi's view) when 
commenting on this story from Chhaandogypanishad!

*        *        *

The specific line where mother Jabaalaa tells son Satyakaama about his gotra 
in Chandogyopanishad is:

"naahametadveda taata yadgotrastvamasi bahvaham charantii parichaariNii 
yauvane tvaamalabhe saahametanna veda yadgotrastvamasi" (chhaandogyopaniShad 
4.4.2)

Literal meaning word to word is: taata = son, aham = I, na veda = not know, 
etat = that, yat = which, gotras = gotra, tvam = you, asi = are, aham = I, 
charantii = moving, bahu = a lot, parichaariNii = servant maid, yauvane = in 
youth, tvaam = you, alabhe = got, saaham = thus I, na veda = not know, etat 
= that, yat = which, gotras = gotra, tvam = you, asi = are.

Literal translation without any interpretation (or spin) is:

"Son, I do not which gotra you are. I was a servant maid moving a lot in 
youth when I got you. Thus, I do not know which gotra you are."

*        *        *

Now, I cannot reconcile Sri S.N. Sastri's interpretation with the above at 
all. Even today, in this deep Kali yuga, Brahmins do find out the gotra 
before marriage and avoid marrying people from the same gotra at any cost. I 
find it strange that one would get married without finding gotra in old 
days. In any case, there is no reference to such a thing above. There is 
also no reference to early death of father. If she did not know the gotra 
because her husband died when child was young and she did not ask at the 
time of marriage, she would've explicitly said that and not say "I was a 
servant maid moving a lot in youth when I got you. Thus, I do not know which 
gotra you are." If the true reason is that her husband died young, what is 
the relevance of her being a servant maid and her moving a lot? Why would 
she mention those irrelevant points and not her husband dying young?

Thus, I cannot support Sri S.N. Sastri's view at all. It seems quite 
far-fetched and motivated to me.

*        *        *

If one's conditioned mind cannot accept the fact that a maharshi accepted 
the son of a woman who would be considered "fallen" by the moral standards 
one is used to, then one would probably try to imagine things, twist the 
words of a scripture and give an interpretation that fits with one's notions 
of right and wrong. But then, one would be missing out on the true morals of 
the scripture and an opportunity to question and refine one's pre-exiting 
notions of right and wrong...

*        *        *

Let us say an unmarried woman with good control over senses wanted a child. 
Let us say she slept with five men that she liked and respected, with mutual 
consent, on five different occasions, not for carnal pleasure, but with the 
sole intention of begetting a child with any of them and then raising the 
child alone.

Let us say another person (man or woman) slept with the same person that one 
is ritually married to, on five different occasions, not with the intention 
of begetting a child but just for carnal pleasure (i.e. using birth control 
methods).

Which is worse? Which has a higher purpose? Which more adharmik?

*        *        *

Prevalent rules of morality are there for general guidance. World will sink 
into an abyss of chaos and adharma without them and they are definitely 
needed. But they are not absolute.

The correct judgment of right and wrong does not always come from the 
application of a set of rigid rules. Correct judgment comes only from a 
refined and purified mind. Scriptures and actions of rishis and gods 
contained in them (and actions of other great souls of recent centuries who 
were most likely reincarnations of rishis and gods) are there to clarify and 
refine our understanding of what is right and what is wrong. As we 
understand more and purify ourselves more, our judgment will become more and 
more perfect.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Original Thread

1 Rajarshi:

The Chandogya Upanishad mentions this incident. The boy came to Gauthama 
Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked him for his gotra. The boy goes back 
to his mother and finds out that his mother is not aware of who the father 
was. The boy comes back and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says that 
he shall teach the boy as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and thus by 
default is a Brahmana.

"Thereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a student. 
'Of what family are you, my lad?' inquired the sage. Satyakama replied: 'I 
asked my mother what my family name was, and she answered: "I do not know. 
In my youth I was a servant and worked in many places. I do not know who was 
your father. I am Jabala, and you are Satyakama. Call yourself Satyakama 
Jabala!" I am therefore Satyakama Jabala, sir.' Then said the sage: 'None 
but a true Brahmin would have spoken thus. Go and fetch fuel, for I will 
teach you. You have not swerved from the truth.'" (Chandogya Upanishad 
4:4:3,4)

So that is one sure shot, explicit case, where a Rishi shows that the tag 
Brahmin is more by action than by birth.
-----------------------------------------------
2 Ajit:

This is a popular misconception. Satyakama asks his mother this
question upfront. The mother does not know her child's gotra. Why? In
olden days, women married young, and did not ask questions such as
"Who are you? What is your gotra?" to their husband. (In some areas,
this is still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated
during various samskara's, she would naturally remember it. The
conclusion here is that her husband, whom she served with devotion,
died young.

The seers were tri-kAla-darshi-s. Gautama knew of his boy's pedigree
before asking him the question. After hearing his answer, he says "A
non-brahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved from
the truth". "satyam" is explained as "brAhmaNa-jAti-dharma".

First, you have a jAti-brAhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on
his own, during childhood. He then answers the preceptor's question
truthfully, in his mother's own words, without embellishment. This is
a very rare set of events. Of course the acharyA sees the worthy
student in front of him.
-----------------------------------------------
3 Rajarshi:

I do not agree to this analysis of the incident.
-----------------------------------------------
4 Ajit:

You are certainly welcome to your opinions. However, the view I shared
is the traditional one, and it makes quite a bit of sense to me. I am
content with the traditional understanding, which shows this woman as
a pativrata. In the famed 3-volume set "Upanishad Bhashyam", the
editor, Sri S.N.Sastri has a very lengthly footnote on the subject.
Those who are interested can go through it.
