I am not an authoirty on this subject, but dwelling on to the topic neverth=
eless.

Puranas do talk about avataras of Shiva as well. How ever, they may=
 be less popular among vaishnavaites.

Hanuman is an avatara of Shiva. I al=
so heard about few other stories where Shivji took human birth to marry Par=
vathi who is born as a girl on earth (Kamakshi?).

How ever, I am not very =
familiar with Shiva's avataras (excluding Hanuman) that kills a rakshasa. S=
hiva killed many demons himself but mostly as Shiva himself and with out go=
ing through an avatara.

This perhaps is because Shiva being a maha yogi do=
es not need to obey and go through Maya to show his Leela. Vishnu on the ot=
herhand went through Maya and showedf his leela.

Best regards,
Vijay
