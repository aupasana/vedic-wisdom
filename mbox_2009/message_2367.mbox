I didn't mean that men need physiological cleansing--I was referring to the=

internal purification that goes on for a woman on the level of the sukshma=

sharira / subtle body automatically through the menstrual cycle and
(half-=
jokingly) pointing out that men have to attain this subtle body
purificatio=
n through external sadhana. As I understand it, during menses, a
woman's bo=
dy is cleansed of toxins, not just physical toxins but also
negative energy=
 and other spiritual/psychical impurities.
I think these things need to be =
studied more closely, especially as more and
more women are beginning to ta=
ke contraceptive pills that allow them to have
menses only 4 times a year o=
r that trigger artificial menstrual cycles. It
is not only a question of wh=
ether such pills are bad for a woman's physical
health but also whether it =
is deleterious to her spiritual vigour.

Warm regards,
Aditi
