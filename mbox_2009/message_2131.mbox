dear friends,
 
i was in pune for a day or so. since i had some spare time =
i asked somebody accompanying me about what is should do. she told me about=
 the variety of sarees that are available and how we could do some shopping=
. but then, on her own she mentioned about dagdusheth halwai ganapathi temp=
le. the name did not impress me and i asked her how old it was. was even mo=
re dissappointed at the reply...she said it must be 8-9 yrs old. so it was =
not any of the ancient temples, i thought.

the next day i met mr. bhatt wh=
o had a red tikka on his forehead. he had just come from a puja performed b=
y his family purohit. he had come specially from chennai to perform this pu=
ja. his family purohit was old and ailing but he condescended to do the puj=
a nevertheless. he told us that it was chaturthi...a special day for ganesh=
a worship. he gave us some prasad...modak which was absolutely delicious.

=
yes, we had to visit the temple. it is one of the newer temples. the Q was =
looooong but moving. soon we had darshan.

i noticed that ganapathi's tunda=
 was to the left and quite huge. it reminded me of the horn of conucopia. a=
fterall he is a giver of boons too.

just thought will share this too.

bes=
t wishes!
