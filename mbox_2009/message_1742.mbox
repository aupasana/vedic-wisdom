Namaste friends,
 
Intellectual prowess is helpful in some matters, but it =
cannot make one understand or experience god. On the contrary, it can even =
increase pride, which makes it more difficult to experience god.
 
Swami Vi=
vekananda had one of the sharpest intellects in the world in the last few c=
enturies. The following is a nice quote from him. Just something to ponder.=
.
 
---------------------------
>From http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info=
/vivekananda/volume_9/conversations_and_interviews.htm (search for "Edith A=
llan")
---------------------------
SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: I am the disciple of =
a man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his sho=
es. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the=
 Ganges!
 
STUDENT: But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.
 
SWAM=
I VIVEKANANDA: That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.
-=
--------------------------
 
The thing with Vivekananda is that he was not =
only a sharp thinker, but was a fearless and brutally honest speaker.
 
Tho=
ugh intelligence can help one understand some scriptural teachings better a=
nd help in the sadhana in the beginning, it is not so useful after a while.=
 The qualities of surrender and humility are far more valuable than logic a=
nd analytical thinking.
 
BTW, I noted that he said in the same series that=
 he has to come back once more with his Master Ramakrishna. Of course, Rama=
krishna also said that he would come back after 100 years along with everyb=
ody.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
