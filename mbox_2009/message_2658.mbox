Dear Narasimhaji and others,

In Taittiriya Upanishad (http://www.sacred-te=
xts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15034.htm), the following is the order of creation (Ma=
x Mueller interpretation):

"From that Self 2 (Brahman) sprang ether (=E2k=
=E2sa, that through which we hear); from ether air (that through which we h=
ear and feel); from air fire (that through which we hear, feel, and see); f=
rom fire water (that through which we hear, feel, see, and taste); from wat=
er earth (that through which we hear, feel, see, taste, and smell)"

This s=
ounds logical to me in that I expected Akasa to be first and earth to be la=
st. I have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji's Brha=
t Nakshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I cant confirm. D=
o you agree with the interpretation above, if not what is your belief, sour=
ce and justification?

Thank you,

Sundeep
