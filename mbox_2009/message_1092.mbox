Respected Shri Narsimha Garu,

Namaskaram,

Thanks and Pranaam to you and to Shri.Ravi Garu for the benevolent effort of
shooting the procedure for the betterment of mankind. Incidently, it is the
first time I have seen you (in video) and I am deeply impressed by the
"tejo" you have. Definitely you are younger than my previous imagination of
you. I am now just tempted to meet you in person and pray for that
yoga/incident to happend. May God Bless You in your devine endeavours. And
May God bless the lesser mortals like me in just having stronger faith in
"Sanatan Dharm" and follow Gnani like you.

Koti Koti Vandan and DhanyaVaad.

Jitu

 <br>
This weekend, Ravi shot video of a 20-minute Maha G=
anapathi homam being performed by me, based on the procedure in the manual.=
 He uploaded it to Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Video =
is one file that is 20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is downloada=
ble to your computer and you can play it using free software QuickTime. On =
YouTube, it is stored as three parts and has a higher quality. You can play=
 those three parts directly from YouTube.<br>

 <br>
If you go to the homam=
 homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam page, you will see all=
 related links right there.<br>
 <br>
To limit the video size, we made ever=
ything bare minimum. The veda mantra and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times e=
ach and Atharva seersham once. You can of course use higher counts and do i=
t longer.<br>
 <br>
Thanks to Ravi for his effort!<br>
 <br>
Best regards,<=
br>
Narasimha<br>
