Namaste

Jyotish Vidya gives an indication of past, present and
future,some=
times it is accurate and sometimes it is not accurate.
Jyotish Vidya is not=
 an issue, however the native's chart (It is the
sanchit sanskars + other t=
hings of the native), the astrologer(his
mind, his understanding of astrolo=
gy), and the time of consultation
contribute towards to the accuracy and in=
accuracy.

Also we are so anamoured that sometimes even if good thing happe=
ns to
us, we feel it is a bad thing, it is our frame of mind at the time.

=
You gave an example of a car accident for a native when he did
Vishnu sahas=
tranama, and considered it negative, however more worst
things could have a=
lso happened, it is that the chanting saved the
native to the extent possib=
le. Everything tends to have two sides,
depending on our state of mind one =
side resonates more than other.

Now with respect to ista devata, we can de=
viate little bit here. I
have seen two types of sadgurus, one type that alw=
ays give same mantra
to all their disciples as they have realized that mant=
ra and have full
confidence in it. There is also other type which give out =
mantras
based on the disciple, some examples are Ramakrishna paramhans and =
the
Guruji of famous astrologer Shri K N Rao. Both types of Sadgurus were
v=
ery capable to see the past. present and future of their respective
discipl=
es. So both these methodolgies are correct. How do we
explain/apply here th=
e concept of ista devata and bhadkesh in this case.

Further I have read in=
 a book about a disciple of Swami Ramananda( The
very realized saint who st=
arted ramanandi samparadaya). There used to
be one king in Rajasthan, he wa=
s a devi upashak, devi used to manifest
to him and so he was asked for a bo=
on by devi and he asked for
mooksha. The devi indicated to him that she can=
not grant it, but he
should go to Swami Ramananda and become his disciple a=
nd get
initiation from him, that will get him Mooksha. Also if you look at
=
disciples of Swami Ramanada, like Ravidas, Kabir, and many others they
all =
had very unique experiances and different types of devotion,
Mirabai was a =
krishna devotee.

So we can easily conclude that the ista devata has many f=
orms and it
is a concept that applies to many births rather than just one b=
irth.

Ista devata to clear up ones sanskars can in one life also take the
=
role of bhadkesh and also a different form.

The most important thing is on=
e should respect all forms and pursue a
form rigourously to which one is at=
tracted most, rest all will fan out
in time, there are no short cuts.

From=
 an astrology perspective, there is some confusion too,
Ista devata is comp=
uted from the 12th house from atmakaraka in D9
chart. However for atmakarak=
a some people include rahu and some donot.
There is 7 karaka scheme or 8 ka=
raka scheme and then there is also
karaka replacement. Based on this one ca=
n get potentially 3 different
atmakarakas and so 3 different ista devatas. =
So which ista devata to pick?

It appears to me that we are not that advanc=
ed to relate concepts of
astrology and spiritualism perfectly yet. There is=
 still lot of gray area.

Hope this helps you to stir some more thoughts in=
 your mind and see
things differently.

Best Regards
Mitesh
