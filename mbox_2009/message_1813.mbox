I seem to have 2 options as part of my choice:

1. Marry the girl as I made=
 a mistake in saying 'yes' - give her all the comfort as post marriage I wo=
uld have taken marriage vows - Even though I internally feel she is not suf=
ficiently good looking, live with that feeling for life - basically wear a =
"mask" for life

2. Cancel the marriage - even engagement is over - marriag=
e is there next week. Bring defamy to myself and the family and harm the gi=
rl's psyche.

Exceptional circumstances made me say 'yes' and I am regretti=
ng the decision. Do I have to live with a mask for ever?
What does Dharma s=
ay I should do?

PVRji and others, pls. tell me
