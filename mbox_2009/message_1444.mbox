Namaste,
 
If that can be experienced very easily, everyone in the world wo=
uld be liberated. Yes, it is made a little difficult by design.
 
Yes, it h=
as to be a permanent state.
 
However, if you can feel that way sometimes, =
it is a good start. Suddenly, you may fail in one situation and your equani=
mity may be broken. As you practice and improve self-control, the failure b=
ecomes less frequent. Eventually, you may reach a stage where you can maint=
ain such a state of equanimity for very long periods of times. Finally, it =
can be permanent.
 
Self-identification with a deity for even a second is n=
ot possible without the self-control over long periods of time. Only after =
one has been in a state of equanimity for a long time does one become worth=
y of being possessed by divine energy. As Vimalananda says, you can try to =
identify with Shiva. But, successful identification occurs only after ego h=
as been demolished fully.
 
Of course, it is ok. Thinking of divine manifes=
tations of Brahman such as Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Devi Ma etc is much much=
 better than thinking of yourself or about your pleasures and your needs. D=
on't worry about it. For most people in this age, path to realizing Self as=
 Brahman is thorugh a deity such as Vishnu and Shiva.
 
Best regards,
Naras=

        Dear Narasimhaji,

        Thank you=
 for your reply.

        I "think" I can intellectually understand what yo=
u have written but somehow I do not get that feeling or in other words I ca=
nnot experience that state. I can although feel some of the symptoms that y=
ou have mentioned. 

        And as per your writings I understand that thi=
s has to be permanent state.

        Can we have self identification with =
a deity for some time say some minutes or fraction of seconds since Vimalan=
anda in his book Aghora mentions that when you do this(some action)  then s=
elf identify with Shiva.

        Also I can understand that everything is =
Brahman but still "I" like to think of various deities like Shiva, Ganesha =
, Devi ma , Vishu ji etc while eating or before sleeping. Is this ok ? If n=
ot Ok then how can I get rid of such thinking ? 


        Thank you,
     =
   Manish

  Dear Manish,

          > What does self identification with a deity mean=
s?

          Who are *you*? Are you really this body?

          One norma=
lly identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes 
      =
    with that body. This identification is very very strong..

          Yo=
u are actually Brahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being 
     =
     essence of the universe. The same essence manifests as various beings,=
 
          including various deities and various people, including your ow=
n body. And 
          *you* really are that essence and not the body. Stil=
l you identify only with 
          the body.

          It is possible to =
destroy this self identification with the body and 
          identify with=
 another object such as a deity. When you identify with a 
          deity,=
 your consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, 
   =
       thoughts and actions are those of the deity.

          * * *

     =
     > When somebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I hav=
e to 
          > do ?

          First I can tell you what exactly you hav=
e to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself 
          that you will now identify with=
 Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want 
          to be great. In othe=
r words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, 
          until ego co=
mpletely goes, it is not even possible.

          Before you can self-iden=
tify with any deity, first your false 
          self-identification with b=
ody has to cease. You should absolutely not think 
          of your body a=
s "I"..

          Your will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva=
.

          Will Shiva think of a specific physical body as "I"? No. If a =
specific 
          physical body has good or bad things happening to it, w=
ill Shiva feel 
          pleasure or pain? No. If people are praising a sp=
ecific person, will Shiva 
          feel proud? No. If people are attackin=
g and criticizing a specific person, 
          will Shiva feel angry? No.
=

          The first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. =
Reach a 
          state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and p=
ain to the body and 
          praise and criticism of your thoughts and ac=
tions by other people. Reach a 
          state where equanimity of mind ca=
n be maintained in all circumstances.

          WHEN you reach that state,=
 meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking of 
          Shiva.

     =
     * * *

          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could self-identify with not =
only deities, but 
          pretty much any object of the universe. Once h=
e went into deep meditation 
          while admiring the beauty of grass i=
n the lawn with dew on it. As he was 
          absorbed in deep meditation=
, a bird came and walked on the grass. His 
          sishyas observed that=
 some bruises appeared on his body suddenly then!
