Dear Rajarshi,
 
(1) If Praana Pratishtha is done perfectly, a specific form of energy is firmly established in the idol. If the person doing praana pratishtha is able to focus the mind so perfectly on that form, fill the mind with that form and then direct that mind towards the idol, that will result in that form being established in the idol. That is the case with a perfect praana pratishtha.
 
But, there are hardly any people today who can do praana pratishtha well. There are hardly any people who can focus the mind on god perfectly. In that case, any focused thoughts of the worshipper now and then will slowly get lodged and create an identity for that idol slowly, over the time.
 
(2) Sanskrit is made of syllables that reverberate in various parts of the body when experiencing various deities. The mantras in Praana Pratishthaa try to aid in that process. However, even if one who does not know the praaana pratishthaa mantras ends up with one's mind absorbed in a specific deity somehow, one will experience the same thing.
 
Chanting praana pratishtha mantras in Sanskrit is neither necessary nor sufficient to invoke a deity, but it is helpful to form the visualization. It is a useful tool and not an end by itself.
 
*        *        *
 
More than technicalities, what is important is internal purity. How much does it bother one when others insult one? How much does it excite one when others praise one? How strong is the idea that one is doing things? How strong is the attachment to body, name and other material belongings? These are the key things. Somehow or the other, one needs to make progress and achieve a level of equanimity.
 
Then one can focus the mind on a deity and establish a corresponding energy in an object, such as an idol or kalasha or fire or even one's own being.
 
For example, please see the experience narrated in
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498
 
The person did not do specific mantras for doing praana pratishthaa, but what happened essentially was a praana pratishthaa.
 
*        *        *
 
In the old days, there were many braahmanas who were pure like fire. Nowadays, there are very very few. The need of the hour is creation of such a class of braahmanas. If that happens, so many things will automatically happen on earth.
 
*        *        *
 
I was a Sanskrit scholar from childhood. I passed two series of exams, both equivalent to BA degree in Sanskrit, by the age of 11, one of them with distinction. I used to compose metred poetry in Sanskrit like ancients, with a good level of fluency, when I was 10. When I studied for those Sanskrit exams, it used to feel like I knew all that stuff before and was just revising. Sanskrit came to me very naturally. My pronunciation was good and my understanding of various expressions and concepts of Sanskrit quite thorough.
 
Nevertheless that never gave me any spiritual experiences nor did it take me close to self-knowledge. As long as I had pride in my knowledge and abilities, I was stuck. I started real progress only after my senses were turned inward and my pride and other internal enemies were controlled somewhat. From my experience, I know what is more important and what is less important. So, while I definitely do not discourage people from learning Sanskrit or making their Sanskrit better, I emphasize internal transformation more.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: When you do praana pratishthaapana in an idol or fire as a part of a ritual, do the best you can, with respect to picking and pronouncing the mantras. Do believe sincerely that the deity is there. Have faith and be sincere, humble and respectful. At other times, work on your attitude and on the internal enemies. That is more important than the technicalities.
 
*        *        *

Yes, when there is a need to form an opinion on someone, perhaps because one wants to become a disciple or otherwise follow that holy man, one can do that.
 
My point is this: bear the karma of judging (and commenting on) someone only when there is a clear need based on your dharma. Moreover, when judging ancient personalities like some were doing when I made my comments, one can easily make mistakes.
 
Instead of judging others, one can judge oneself. There will be plenty of faults that can be corrected. After one focuses one's senses and critical faculties inward, removes tamas and rajas and makes spiritual progress, one will be clear about one's dharma. If such a person's dharma requires one to judge and criticize a holy man publicly, that is a different matter.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.

> The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets "established" in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people's strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.

Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.
>  
> However, please note that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That's all.
>  
> However, please note that most people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices without understanding what they are doing.

Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that created man in the first place. When that god fills one's mind, one is free from the cycle.

One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.

But, Nature will correct things and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.

There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he felt was a deep joy.

There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.

I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.
