Namaste,

   One more comment from my side:

   Anuvaka 11 ends actually a=
t the following sukta (11-11), this can be
verified when compared with Kris=
hna Yajurveda 4-5-27

           namo rudrebhyo ye pR^ithivyaaM ye.antarikS=
he ye divi
yeshhaamannaM vaato var{}shhamishhavastebhyo dasha
           pr=
aachiirdasha dakShiNaa dasha
pratiichiirdashodiichiirdashordhvaastebhyo nam=
aste no mR^iDayantu te yaM
           dvishhmo yashcha no dveshhTi taM vo j=
ambhe dadhaami .. 11-11..

     What ever is found after the above sukta ar=
e (like tryambaka=E1=B9=81
yaj=E2mahe sugandhi=E1=B9=81... to namo rudr=E2y=
a vi=E1=B9=A3=E1=B9=87ave
m=E1=B9=9Btyurme p=E2hi... etc..) contents taken =
from other parts of KYV,
and i am also looking for a reason/correct form of=
 the order of the
stanzas that occur after 11-11'th anuvaka.

Thank You,

s=
arma.
