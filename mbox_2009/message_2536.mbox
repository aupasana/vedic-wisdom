Dear Somanathan,

Chandi homam is very good to kill the bad qualities that =
are with-in us! Yes, now and then you will want seek some personal gain. A =
child asks mother to do favors. How ever, the mother normally does only tho=
se favors which are reasonable. Mother does not give too much of chocklates=
 just becuase the childs asks. Even when she showers her kindness, she know=
 how much to do with out spoiling the child.

If you are asking for persona=
l benefits, it perhaps does not harm, but, refrain from seeking what is bad=
 for others (like "that idiot has insulted me today, hence he should meet u=
p with an accident"). As long you can control what you desire the mother fo=
r, you are safe.

Coming to kundalini - There is no need to fear! In my chi=
ld I had perseption that if kundalini awakens, I will get extraordinary pow=
ers. Don't give in to them. Kundalini awaking is awakening of self awarenes=
s. When Kundalini araise, you experiance the God. There is no need to be wa=
ry of the same.

What are you afraid? Are you afraid, if you get self reali=
sation, you will renounce the world and attain mukthi and your family will =
be left behind in sadness? If you have so much affinity to the material wor=
ld, in all likelyhood kundalini will not raise. So, on your path, if kundal=
ini araise, by then your attachment to the material world will be far lesse=
r and you would not be afraid of the consequences any more!

Best regards,
=
Vijay

 Mother is stronger and I am prepared to disregard the superstitions.

 motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At some point or another won't=
