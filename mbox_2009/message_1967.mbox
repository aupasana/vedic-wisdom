Dear Narasimha ji,
  I have read the great article about the free-will/fate=
 and have some understanding of why/how current free-will may/may not count=
er-act result of 'past free-will'/'current-fate'.
  But, this has got me in=
to egg-chicken problem. Can you please kindly relate free-will/fate at gran=
deur level? If we go to the root cause of all the causes..When the current =
universe came into existance at the moment of big-bang (or maybe universe a=
lready existed, it just changed its form at that moment so that it became p=
erceptable to us mortal) , was it resulting from free-will of its own fate =
from possibly last grand resolution of the universe? 
 Whos free-will or fa=
te was it? Is it cumulative free-will(resolve) of all souls that came into =
existence then or the cumulative fate of all the soul from past universe? h=
ow did the first karma/action or first reaction was concieved by a soul wit=
hout an external stimulus?

Also, what is the extent of fate/free will in a=
nybody's life? Is taking each breath is a result of free will or fate? We d=
oing yagna/homam is it free-will excercised or was it fated?
How can somebo=
dy differentiate between any moment being parcel from fate or a new act? of=
 it has to be simultaneous all the time?

Thanks for all your sincere thoug=
hts!

Thanks
