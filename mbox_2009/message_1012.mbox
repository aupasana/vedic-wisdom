Recently I read Navagraha Stothram in Rig Veda, also mentioned as 
Navagrah=
a Suktam by few learned scholars.

The sloga starts with Aditya (Sun), then=
 Angaragan (Mars), Sukran 
(Venus), Soman (Moon), Budhan (Mercury), Brihasp=
ati (Jupiter), 
Shanaishwaran (Saturn), Rahu and Ketu.

The local temple pr=
iests while chanting sloka/mantra, changed the order 
to follow the week da=
ys starting Sun.

Is it correct to change the Veda mantras to suit modern d=
ay trend?

I am interested in listening to learned scholars' views.
