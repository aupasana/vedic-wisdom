Om Brihaspataye Namah

Dear Narasimhaji and members, 
Namaste and Hare Kris=
hna

Recently I was chatting to someone online that mentioned indrajal. I g=
athered from our chat that it was something to do with black magic. 

When =
I got home today, I asked my grandmother and she refused to tell me what it=
 was. I googled it and came across as it being a book of tantra dealing wit=
h the darker aspects- potential to damage others. 

On one of the books, th=
ere is a picture of Ma Kali. And one shop that sells it online mentions Das=
 MahaVidya.

So my question is, if all these mantras that exist that can ha=
rm other people, who empowers these mantras? I really find it hard to belie=
ve that Ma will give power to people to harm others. 

I do know from Vedic=
 stories about devas granting boons to demons, for example- Hiranyakashipu'=
s story. But, considering we are in Kali Yuga, does this still happen? Peop=
le are more likely to die from AIDS, cancer etc, so whats the big deal with=
 black magic? Is this just childish superstition or all part of a larger wo=
rk of karma?

Sorry for the questions, its just been annoying me at the bac=
k of my mind. 

Jaya Sita Raama
