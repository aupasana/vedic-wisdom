body must be healthy to realise god
tirumoolar says   in his ahama
********=
******
previously i thought body as dirty
but i found god living in the bod=
y
as god lives in the body
iam taking care of my body to the best extent
**=
*********
without good body health you can never realise god
bodily attachm=
ent is different from worldly attachment
i remember ramakrishna quoting tha=
t if there is a minor defect in the body that person can not realise god.
a=
fter realising god only ramakrishna neglected his health and did not take c=
are of his body
only as he was healthy before he could realise god
if he ha=

 birth

Hello,
     =
    I am absolutely not writing against the guidance given in the mail belo=
w. Only telling how I do things differently on two points in my own spiritu=
al sadhana everyday.

I am always alert towards my physical body. I do a lo=
t more than bare essentials to keep it going. I am always listening to its =
need. I try to lessen its pain and suffering using sattvic means so that it=
 remains strong. I am respectful towards it and do not show mental disregar=
d towards it. After all It is my vehicle towards salvation.

Having lived w=
ith sadhu/holy men for several years I am well aware that many of them are =
in lot of different physical pain and discomfort and they are still doing t=
heir spiritual sadhana.It is good as many people are strong and they can en=
dure pain and still do meditation.

 But I have noticed when my physical bo=
dy is in  pain and I am doing my everyday sadhana there is a deep subtle cu=
rrent of pain also flowing towards Divine Mother  which I find very upsetti=
ng. Few times I have said to DivineBeings that instead of love, today's off=
ering is full of pain.

I know from my direct personal experience people wh=
o have used bare essential to keep their body alive.And when it takes its r=
evenge, there are doctors and hospitals and hospitals and more pain and mis=
ery.Their spiritual sadhana gets broken and my own are deeply disturbed. Th=
en there is excuse that it is past life karma.

If I will not  properly car=
e for my physical body when there is time to do so and it falls ill what wi=
ll Divine Mother will think?

The second thing is that although I am not a =
yogi my prayers/puja/ meditations/ japa are not dress rehearsal. They are r=
eal things.I am not doing them for my last moments. I am doing them for Div=
ine Mother Who is EverPresent. She resides in Her Dham but She  lives in th=
is material world as well.It is her creation and for those who are in this =
world who constantly calling Her, She is present with them.

 What will She=
 think if after doing deep loving meditation/japa or ordinary puja, I offer=
 it to her and also add that it is only a dress rehearsal. She might think =
there seems to be loose screw, has he gone on ganja without me knowing it..=


I do not even think that only after leaving my body I will get libreation=
. Our devotion cannot bring Her, only Her Grace can make Her give us Her Bl=
iss. Many times I have said, Mother whole day have passed . When will you a=
ppear to me again? I am sure She will come.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan
