 In Vedanta Chintamani, that Maya has been described in five ways.The five
=
names of Maya are, Tamas,Maya, Moham, Avidya and Anitya. Tamas is that whic=
h
hides the knowledge of life. Maya is that which is responsible for making=

one who is the form of the world appear different from it.Moha is that whi=
ch
makes a different one look real: sukti rajata bhranthi =97 creating an
i=
llusion that mother-of-pearl is made of silver. Avidya is that which spoils=

Vidya (learning). Anitya is transient, that which is different from what i=
s
permanent and real.

On account of these five Mayas troubles appear in th=
e Atma like the cinema
pictures on the screen. Only to remove this Maya it =
is said that the whole
world is mithya (unreal).Atman is like the screen. J=
ust as you come to know
that the pictures that are shown are dependent on t=
he screen and do not
exist otherwise, so also, until one is able to know by=
 Selfenquiry that the
world that is visible is not different from Atma, it =
has to be said that
this is all mithya.

But once the reality is known, the=
 whole universe will appear as Atma only.
Hence
the very people who said th=
e world is unreal, have subsequently said that it
is only Atma swarupa. Aft=
er all, it is the outlook that is important.

If the outlook changes, the t=
roubles of the world will not worry us. Are the
waves different from the oc=
ean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked,
what reply can we give? The t=
roubles in the world also are like that. Waves
come and go. If it is found =
out that they are not different from Atma this
worry will not exist.=94
