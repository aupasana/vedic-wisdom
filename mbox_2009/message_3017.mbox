Dear Rajarshi,
   Very good question. In fact, this is a question that was =
raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if o=
ne looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri=
 Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an autho=
rity on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the=
 Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and wh=
o gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topi=
cs under the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are ab=
out his home turf?

The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never deb=
ates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show =
the way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interest=
ed in anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart o=
f the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it pass,=
 however big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in=
 that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentar=
ies & discourses year ago!

One may ask why then did he go to this meeting =
or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was something like "Concept of=
 God in Hinduism and Islam". IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by "BEI=
NG" an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discus=
sion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would have=
 benefited. 

************

The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be o=
f interest to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectually c=
urious about spirituality than practicing it. 

Sri Sri always practices "e=
xperience first and explanation and knowledge later" principle. Sometimes i=
n AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri wi=
ll only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but h=
is presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are recep=
tive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one =
mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Tr=
uth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words=
 are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words =
is to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, ther=
e is no point in talking! 

It is a great privilege and an immense blessing=
 to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone =
else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our =
mind. In Sri Ramakrishna's life, there are innumerable examples of very sim=
ple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectual=
s would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes w=
hen he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance a=
nd say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would hav=
e been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate an=
d ignoramus!

Without an accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse =
or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dan=
gerous as it will become yet another mental concept and will actually be a =
hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances f=
or a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak's empty concepts of s=
pirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspi=
cuously and are in that way less dangerous. 

Jai Gurudev!
   Siva.

 Now when Sri Sri choses to accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he doe=

, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the v=
