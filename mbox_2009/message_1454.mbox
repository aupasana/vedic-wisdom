||Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya||
Dear Narasimha,
Pranam.
Looking forward to=
 Shri Vishnu Sahasranama Homam document from you.
I can vouch for the posit=
ive effects of utmost benefic value, experienced by many persons in my cont=
act. Some of the results have been unbelievable but have to be acknowledged=
, being first hand witness!

Further, it is also realised that the greater =
the surrender and faith, the faster and more intense the results.

It has b=
een my personal observation that the morning recitations (while SUN is in t=
he sky) increase benefic results and the evening recitations (During or aft=
er Sandhya) reduce the malefic effects,  increase mental peace for even tho=
se who just listen the recitations. It is marvelous for spiritual growth.

=
I have never done or advised homam for Shri Vishnu Sahasranam but regularly=
 use (and advise too) a Deepak or incense sticks being kept lit during the =
recitation period.
thanks for the homam idea,
Best regards,
Himanshu Mohan
