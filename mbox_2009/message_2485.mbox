Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,

I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your imme=
diate family. Immediate family includes spouse, children and parents. Howev=
er, if you have a strong karmic connection with someone from previous lifet=
ime's then they can also participate. Of course, this may not be obvious. F=
or example, there was a gentleman whose last rites was performed not by his=
 kids, but by one of his foreign students. Needless to say, the last rites =
are considered very important ritual and is a privilege of the children, ho=
wever, in this case since there was a karmic connection, the foreign studen=
t (whom the gentleman also considered as one of his spiritual children) end=
ed up performing the ritual. 


Regards
Narayan

em and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing eve=
ryone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficie=
nt at best and disastrous at worst.
