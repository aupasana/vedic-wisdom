Irrespective of the mental conditioning and one's circumstan=

still choose between different actions. The actions taken by o=
ne are not
fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one person may abuse =
one
badly and one may feel great anger towards that person, all on account
=
of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one can either
succumb=
 to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move on.

 may get shorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach=
 earlier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten th=
e destiny, make things worse and reduce one's options.<br>>  <br>> It=
 may go around the tree a few times in another direction and the rope may g=
et longer. It may now be able to reach places it was unable to reach earlie=
r. Similarly, some good acts of free will in this life may improve the dest=
iny and make more things possible.<br>>  <br>> *        *        *<br=
>>  <br>> One's mind is conditioned based on one's destiny. One's sur=
roundings and life situations faced by one are influenced by one's destinty=
. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel attraction for ano=
ther person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw obstacles.=
 One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be adored by millio=
ns of people. And so on. One faces different life situations at different t=
imes and in different matters.<br>>  <br>> However, destiny only show=
s how one (and one's mind) is pulled in various directions and what life si=
tuations one finds oneself in. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and =
one's circumstances, one can still choose between different actions. The ac=
tions taken by one are not fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one p=
erson may abuse one badly and one may feel great anger towards that person,=
 all on account of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one ca=
n either succumb to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move o=
n.<br>>  <br>> Destiny places you in different situations. What you d=
o in those situations is based on how you use your free will. In some cases=
, free will has a lot of wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, i=
t has fewer options. But, usually, you do have several options that may or =
may not be obvious and the action you finally choose shapes your destiny in=
 a future birth.<br>>  <br>> *        *        *<br>>  <br>> Pl=
ease note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma and the Sanskrit word=
 for action is also karma. Basically, actions of today become destiny of to=
morrow. You will get reaction in future to your current actions and destiny=
 is the sum total of those actions that will come back to you.<br>>  <br=
>> Each action of yours that impacts other beings and objects of this un=
iverse will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here please note t=
hat both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions you feel towards s=
omeone else and do not necessary express outwardly will also impact that pe=
rson in a subtle manner and hence counts as an action.)<br>>  <br>> H=
oroscope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically or mentall=
y to other beings, until the current birth, which are to give their reactio=
ns in this life. This is also known as destiny.<br>>  <br>> It does n=
ot fix what you do in various situations in your current life. You have the=
 ability to make different choices at important crossroads. The choices you=
 make are your karma (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They=
 may either impact your current life itself, or become part of the destiny =
(as reflected in the horoscope) in the next life.<br>>  <br>> *      =
  *        *<br>>  <br>> Anybody who tells you that so and so houses =
show acts of free will does not understand what free will is. Horoscope is =
the frozen list of past karmas that form one's destiny for this life. It is=
 like the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are like how the goat nego=
tiates the rope and moves around within the possible area to do its stuff. =
That is in the hands of the goat.<br>>  <br>> The scope and options a=
vailable to free will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the exact ac=
ts of free will are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate things =
further, how exactly free will has been used until now in this life (which =
cannot be seen from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and options a=
vailable to free will at this time. The exertion of free will until now may=
 have modified the destiny.<br>>  <br>> *        *        *<br>>  =
<br>> I am not downplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranj=
eevi prediction, the prediction that he would come into politics in 2007-20=
09 and enjoy some kind of power was made using astrology. When someone is a=
lready a candidate, even a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/=
2 or 1/3 probability. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a predict=
ion on one's political entry in a specific timeframe has a very low probabi=
lity. Such a low probability prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology =
came true. Moreover, we have all seen many cases where astrology worked spe=
ctacularly. I am not saying astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we =
do not attempt to understand its shortcomings.<br>>  <br>> When someo=
ne's free will works in a predictable way, i.e. when one's free will has ve=
ry few options and/or one reacts to life situations thrown up by the destin=
y in predictable ways, job of an astrologer is easier. But, when free will =
has a wide range of options and/or one used the free will powerfully, the g=
ap between the destiny as reflected by horoscope and the actual destiny as =
a result of those actions may make an astrologer fail.<br>>  <br>> Be=
