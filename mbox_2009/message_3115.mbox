All,=A0=A0 =A0 I wanted to share a video that I saw on youtube on Agamas an=
d temples. The knowledge of the person on temples and temple rituals is pro=
bably the best I have ever seen so far. The first part is in the following =
link.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DS3afZv4SXbE=A0The speaker talks abou=
t several temples in south India and about how temples were originally cons=
tructed. He talks about reasons why temples were constructed, the agama pra=
ctice followed, different kinds of prathista like raja, rishi, devata prati=
shta and so on.. He also describes how a deity is invoked, what promises ma=
de to it during the time of construction of the temple, etc..It would be us=
eful to have feedback from members of the group (including Shri. Narasimhaj=
i) on some of the things he says about invoking deities...
