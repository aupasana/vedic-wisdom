Dear All

First of al=
l, wish every one of you a very very wonderful and 
fullfilling year ahead.=
 Last week I had been on a trip to Kasi. It 
turned out to be a terrific tr=
ip for me. That city has a strange 
spiritual atmosphere unlike any other p=
lace I have been to. Just in 
case someone is planning on a trip to Kasi an=
y time in the future, 
do not miss out of the following places/temples apar=
t from the 
regular temples. The following are lesser know but really power=
ful 
places of worship which I came across during my trip last week:

1) Ch=
ausat Yogini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temple has one 
idol for the 6=
4 Yoginis and an idol of Ma Kali. 

2) Temple of Lord Shiva as Kedareshwar =
in Kedar Ghat. An amazing 
temple. 

3) Sankata Temple near Schindhia Ghat.=
 

4) Bindu Madhav temple 

5) The temple of Gopal where Anandamayi Ma used=
 to worship. 

6) Kinnaram Baba's Ashram. There is a dhuni in the ashram wh=
ich was 
lit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a funeral pyre and has been 
bur=
ning continuously since then. The deity in Agni Rudra. Regularly 
wood from=
 the mahasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordinary people 
are not allowed=
 to give any ahutis in that fire but one can sit 
close to it and meditate.=
 I felt that ashram to be one of the most 
powerful places I had ever been =
to. 

Just thought of sharing the names of these places I came across 
duri=
ng my visit this time. 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
