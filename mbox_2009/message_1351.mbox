Dear Utpal,

Good thinking.

The purpose of memory, intelligence and knowledge is only to help one pay 
back karmik debts and fulfill one's dharma.

But good memory, good knowledge and good intelligence are highly binding and 
ego inflating. One needs to consciously try to overcome that and keep 
attachment and pride at bay.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaskaaram Amit Bhai,

Our own resourceful Mitesh has provided good information of Ujjain
and Shree Maa and other places where Yagyas are performed.

"Ujjainiya Mahaakaalm..." ! My Parents visited Mahaakaal last year.
it is also said that, the main attraction of Mahaakaal is to attend
their early mroning Bhasma Aarati. and people told me that it is a
custom to bring the ashes of last cremated body from the nearby
smashaan for the Bhasma Abhiskek. by the way it is well known that
Amitabh Bachhan has a turn around in his career after rirual
performed at Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing happened and came out from
debt etc..
Ujjain was once the capital of great king Vikramaaditya. Gujarati
calander year, which is Vikram Samvat is also named after him. so
gujaraatis have connection to Ujjain:)

I am not sure but is Raja Bhartuhari considered as one of the
Chiranjivis? and was under the impression that the name of his
treaty was Vairaagya Shataka.

but not much important. how much information we'll store in this
memory and what we will do with that.

warm regards,

utpal
