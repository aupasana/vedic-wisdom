Namaste all, 

I thought that there was no better place to ask this questio=
n since this is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the=
 Chandi Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji's words. My desire to praise the =
Divine Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we=
 are coming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to star=
t with the recitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing t=
he homam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)

I don't know if you=
 had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly s=
hare how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter o=
bjections from outside from fellow friends and family members who say that =
"the Chandi homam isn't part of the family tradition" hence the family devt=
a won't be pleased or "un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level=
 ritual" or even "un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a=
 regularly basis"! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I=
 am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  

What I find harder to disca=
rd though, are personal objections that I create for myself..I call it the =
"I-am-not-worthy-enough" syndrome. I am not confident of being able to stay=
 completely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is t=
hat I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (uns=
elfish) enough. At some point or another won't one end up automatically ask=
ing for one's personal gains? After all, isn't it human nature to confide e=
verything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please=
 give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma's curs=
e for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the B=
rahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to 'white-wash' one's selfish motives?
=

Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about regular=
 recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with 'Kundalini jagran', I=
 am a bit worried. Can sadhana and 'kundalini jagran' ever be mutually excl=
usive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they stil=
l have to undergo chakra awakening etc? 

Thank u.
Somanathan
