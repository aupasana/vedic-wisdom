Namaste Utpalji
=A0
I have taken that line into consideration. Now read Nar=
asimhajis mail, specially the last part. on finding what is Dharma and what=
 is not. The line written by Svoboda is vague at best. If I go by the param=
ters of 1) What one is inclined mentally to do
2) What his teachers say. 3)=
 What his scriptures say "(subject to interpretation).
=A0
So technically a=
 terrorist may have all the mental/internal/dharmic justification to act th=
e way he acts.
=A0
The root lies in, why do such situations arise where the=
 dharma of a person has to be that he should become a terrorist? The answer=
 is karma. So therefore, focusing on karma is far more profitable I feel.

I think you missed the following sentance in Swabo=
da's article

***
Terrorists surely believe themselves to be doing their du=
ty, but mere conviction is not dharma, for terrorism involves sacrificing t=
he lives of others, and dharma sometimes requires its followers to sacrific=
e themselves or their loved ones.
