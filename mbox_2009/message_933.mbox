Dear Sir,

I have read the literature of Swamy Vivekananda and so many tim=
es the
words - Vedas, Upanishadas, Shruti, Smruti, Dwaita, Adwaita, Vishish=
ta
Adwaita etc - are used in his lectures and letters. Some words like
Veda=
s etc. are known  but certain words are beyond my capacity to
understand fu=
lly. What is the difference between Shruti and Smriti? What
is vishistha Ad=
waita ? and like....

If you have time in future and you are at leisure, pl=
ease write
something in details on these words one by one

  Ashwin Rawal
