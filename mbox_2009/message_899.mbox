Namaste Sir,
 
1. The vibrations produced by the subtle body are far more i=
mportant than the vibrations produced by the gross body. Thus, mantra is mo=
re of a subtle body activity than a gross body activity. Thus, purity and c=
leanliness of the subtle body is more important than that of gross body. Ho=
wever, people cannot perceive the subtle body and its purity. Maintaining t=
he purity of subtle body and mind is far more difficult than taking bath, w=
earing clean clothes and being in pleasant surroundings. Thus, people shoot=
 for the easier external thing (which is a symbol), in the hope that it eve=
ntually brings the desired internal end result. If one takes bath, wears cl=
ean clothes, keeps one's surroundings clean and pleasant, it will make the =
mind feel clean. It eventually can bring purity to the mind. Thus, even whi=
le maintaining external purity, remember that what matters is the internal =
purity and that external purity is being maintained only to promote interna=
l purity in the long run.
 
Let me now answer your specific question. Pleas=
e remember that the goal of the external practices is to bring forth the de=
sired internal transformation. If there is any amount of guilt or fear or f=
eeling of impurity in the mind when chanting something without taking bath,=
 it is disruptive. These feelings slow down internal transformation. Then i=
t is a good idea to take bath or do whatever is needed to remove those disr=
uptive feelings. On the other hand, if one feels peaceful, clean and calm i=
nternally even in unclean external circumstances, the external conditions d=
o not matter. One can then read without taking bath also.
 
So it all depen=
ds on your state of mind, for which you are the best judge. If you are unsu=
re and have any concern at all, then be conservative, i.e. take bath and we=
ar clean clothes.
 
2. I personally give priority to my ritual and not rece=
ive anyone in the middle of my rituals, i.e. I make them wait. If you must =
interrupt your pooja, then I see nothing wrong in continuing where you left=
 off.
 
3. That is a good offering, but the fire has to be sufficient. Ladd=
us may be a fine sweet, but we cannot feed them to a two month old baby. Si=
milarly, you cannot offer much kshir to a small fire.
 
I do my daily Chand=
i homam with a log of wood and there is a big fire. I can pretty much burn =
anything. I can offer kshir, I can offer laddus or any other sweets. If you=
 also have a big enough fire, you can offer anything without troubling fire=
. When your fire is small, you have to exert discretion.
 
BTW, ancient gre=
co-Roman civilizations had a fire ritual where entire bodies of killed anim=
als were offered to gods in firepit and reduced to ashes by next morning.
 =

If the fire is big, any amount of materials can be offered.
 
4. I am surp=
rised that stainless steel lamps are used. In Andhra Pradesh (where I am fr=
om), we mostly use silver or copper lamps. Even in US (where I live), we us=
e silver lamps mostly. I have actually never seen steel lamps. For my daily=
 homam, I prefer a clay lamp to a silver lamp and use it.
 
If you are at a=
 stage where external things are just used as symbols based on the momentum=
 of previous karmas and do not mean much to you, then all this is irrelaven=
t. Otherwise, I suggest using silver, brass, bronze, copper, clay etc inste=
ad of steel.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Path

        Dear Sir,
     =
   It is said that Chandi Path can be done only after bathing. In this rega=
rd I have some questions Sir.
        1.Can I recite Chandi path at evening=
 or at night after just washing my hands and feet? Or Bath is necessary?
  =
      2.If somebody is coming at home and I have to attend him for half an =
hour, can I continue the Chandi path from that completed chapter Or should =
I start from the first chapter again?
        3.I am doing Chandi Homam wit=
h Kshir ( Boiled milk with Rice) in Navratri but sometimes after offering K=
shir, the fire is going off. After reading your articles, now I will not of=
fer kshir as this is not good if fire goes off due to milk. Sir, Kshir offe=
ring is necessary for mother? I had read somewhere so I was doing this. 
  =
      4.Generally now a days the Deepak is enlighted in Stainless Steel. Is=
 it Ok or we should use copper or Brass for Deepak? 
        Once we read s=
omething, our mind is questioning for what we are doing. This is why I have=
 written this mail. 
        With regards
         Dr.Ashwin Rawal
