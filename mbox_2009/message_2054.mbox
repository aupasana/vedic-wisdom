Dear Murahari,
 
Ancestors are not necessarily stuck if certain rituals are=
 not done. But, in case somebody is stuck, some rituals can help. Rituals a=
re just rituals in the beginning and do not mean much. As one does a ritual=
 with some mental focus and desire, slowly the desired result occurs.
 
If =
one's ancestor who is stuck gets freedom of rebirth after rituals by one, o=
ne is not necessarily playing god. One is only playing a part.
 
We affect =
the lives of many low level organisms like bacteria, viruses etc with many =
little things we do. It is not necessarily playing god. Due to debts betwee=
n various beings, god creates situations where one being can have a major i=
mpact on the life of another being. It is not playing god, but a privilege =
given based on the play of debts.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

i Tarpana Question
        Namaste Narasimha, 

        We do not have cont=
rol over our birth and death. 

        In that case, what does this statem=
ent mean?

        " You can free yourself from the rina by working on givi=
ng a rebirth to that ancestor."

        I have heard from elders and learn=
ed members in my family and people that until tarpana or shraddha is provid=
ed, the spirits would be roaming around and if we perform this ritual, the =
spirit would take the body to fulfil it's remaining desires. Isn't this con=
tradicting "control over birth and death" statement? Are we not playing God=
 here by helping the ancestor in providing him with the rebirth? 

        =
Your inputs will help me in understanding the essence of tarpana and rebirt=
h more clearly. 

        Thanks & Regards,
        --Murahari

 Shraaddham is an offering of balls of solid food for deceased ancestors on=
 special occasions.

                    Pitri tarpana is an offering of wa=
ter for pitris (deceased ancestors who are stuck with some desires) to sati=
sfy them. Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri ta=
rpana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.

  =
                  *        *        *

                    The thoughts of =
the minds around us do have a subtle impact on our mind. When too many depr=
essed, sad or frustrated people are around you, it will have a negative eff=
ect on you. Similarly, when some peaceful and blissful people or elevated s=
ouls are around you, it will have a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts =
in the minds around you does have an impact on you.

                    Th=
is is particularly true with respect to the minds of people who have geneti=
c/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people are in great dist=
ress or great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.

                 =
   If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong d=
esires and unable to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts a=
nd desires will have an impact on your mind.

                    Thus, we =
invest our mental energy praying for their relief. While offering balls of =
solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray that the ancestor may get=
 an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water=
 in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor's desires may be satisfied and th=
e ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancest=
or, you are indirectly helping yourself, by removing a powerful negative in=
fluence on your mind and getting rid of some weaknesses.

                 =
   Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of fa=
shion today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they do i=
t atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he will pick=
 pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.

               =
     *        *        *

                    Not long ago, every orthodox =
Braahmana used to perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyd=
ay. Rituals use external symbols to induce internal changes. These two ritu=
als are really important and useful rituals.

                    A small c=
omparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup a=
rchives:

                    ------------ --------- -----
                =
    One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the=
 medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium is water=
. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whether watery=
 signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.
      =
               
                    In homam, devatas come in fire and burn=
 your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and f=
ree you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inheri=
ted from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was l=
ustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor i=
s still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due =
to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weakne=
sses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to=
 that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness is attached to a new body, =
the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consci=
ousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of b=
ad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are =
very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.
                     
     =
               Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-i=
dentification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work=
 on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are=
 grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their =
self-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. =
You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the =
hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them resp=
ectively.
                     
                    Devas and pitris have d=
ifferent ways of working and influencing us and helping our spiritual progr=
ess. But both are relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our spir=
itual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire and satisfying pitris in water a=
re very important.

 (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically
