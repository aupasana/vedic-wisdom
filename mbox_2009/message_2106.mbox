Yes it is nearly same but with a very crucial d=

Fir=
st time i thought about Vigneshwara in line with what you mentioned. if we =
split the word which are joined then it is Vigna + Ishwara =3D God of Obsta=
cle. it can very well mean that the God who controls obstacles. now if we d=
erive meaning that Ganapati (Vigneshwara) is the controller of Obstacles th=
en what you mentioned seems quite correct because the one who controls obst=
acle has the power to put forth the obstacle as well as remove it.=A0
> Fur=
thermore, is there some significance of the trunk turned to the right as op=
posed to the left >or the middle?
=A0
I do not know WHY but It is a popular=
 opinion in Maharashtra and Gujarat (may be in the other places as well) th=
at=A0Murti or picture of Ganapati having Right Sided trunk are very active =
(Live) and hence they should be handled with extreme care. i mean, the idol=
 or picture should never remain without Pujan etc... Generally people are a=
fraid of keeping such a idol in their homes because they feel that if they =
are no able=A0to properly worship the idol then some kind of misfortune wil=
l befall on them. Other thing is that, there is=A0also belief that if the i=
dol is properly propitiated then=A0it can give great fortune.
it is not out=
 of place to mention here that about a year back somebody gave me a Ganapat=
i idol having Right side trunk. i kept it in my small puja place. i think i=
 hardly ever worship the idol but when i started Homam i used to keep the i=
dol in the homam. although i knew the above belief, i was never afraid of m=
isfortune. afterwards i came to Mumbai for vacation and i bought another id=
ol of metal. now i had (still have) 2 idols and i used to keep only metal i=
dol (with left side trunk) but i had some kind of guilt feeling that i am n=
ot able to keep the earlier one idol so i decided to give the metal idol to=
 one of my colleagues who was going to shift to a new house. i gave them th=
e idol but they were little hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Guru abou=
t it and he asked to keep both the idols in the Homam and i started doing t=
hat. now during my Homam,=A0there are both Ganapati present, one with Right=
=A0side trunk and one with left side. one who is ready to
 punish and the o=
ne who just let go like visarga :).
but truly speaking, my fear=A0for such =
things have almost gone. No trepidation by whatever beliefs. Whether it is =
Ganapati of Right sided trunk or mistakes in rituals or wrong pronunciation=
 of veda mantra or such other things.
=A0
***
I have no answers for the res=
t of the things you asked.
sorry if i've deviated.
best regards,
Utpal
