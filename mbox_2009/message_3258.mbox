Namaste Rajarshi and Kishore,

>such a great person claims Rama is not God=
.<

Rishi Vasishtha in "Yoga Vaasishtha" without ambiguity declares Rama as=

an incarnation of God in front of the complete Royal assembly, sages and
c=
itizens while Rama was absorbed in Nirvikalpa Samadhi.  "Ideal Man" tag
doe=
s not seem  proper for the Lord Rama however  He is a God who
portrayed him=
self as an Ideal Man.

Just wanted to pointout this because Yoga Vaasishtha=
m is a part of
Valmiki Ramayana. The book which is an absolute Gem of Advai=
ta
philosophy.

***

> But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should not=
 be taken as an
ideal regarding food=C2  habits

On a second thought, i agr=
ee with you and i need not ask him because
answer is already provided by 'T=
he Mother of the Universe' a couple of
days back.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

I am troubled by one thing just like you are. It is understanda=

I met him about two years back. What first attracted me to=C2 
towards him =
was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2 when
it comes to=C2 =
honestly.=C2 If someone were to put a gun to his head
and ask him to just s=
ay a simple, harmless=C2 lie, like sun rises in
the west, he would not say =
it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too!
He has actually never ever=C2=
 spoken even a single lie in his whole
life, big or small. When he was in h=
is school, once his teacher told him
that Indian languages are richer than =
English, he believed his teacher.
Later someone else told him English is mo=
re comprehensive language and
the world cannot do with it. He got confused.=
 Since that day, he bought
himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English,=
 one Hindi and for ten
years every day he spend one hour reading the Englis=
h dictionary and
> one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=
=C2 up
volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2 When I asked him why, he=

just said it is because he wanted to be=C2 equally adept at both the
langu=
ages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge
the truth =
about=C2 which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he
has an uncompr=
omising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth
about anything. By =
education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked
in different fields, f=
rom banking to education to journalism. He did not
last for long in most pl=
aces. He speaks and writes fluently, English,
Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskri=
t, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is
learning Tamil. He composes poetry in=
 all the above languages. When he
was in college, he considered himself an =
atheist. While applying for a
job he had kept the place makered for religio=
n as blank. When the clerk
who was supposed to take the forms saw that blan=
k space, he asked
> my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote=
 "Hindu".
Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore =
it up
right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hi=
ndu
in the form would have been a lie.
> =C2
> So this gives a basic idea o=
f the man I am speaking of. All his
friends, whoever knows him, calls him R=
ama of Kaliyuga.
> =C2
> One day, long back, he was going to office for som=
e urgent meeting.
His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was p=
assing by
in=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the=

temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple,
but =
he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his
watch i=
t is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time
went. Whe=
n he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the
temple sat dow=
n and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any
movement. The pr=
iest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend
had no idea why this=
 happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in
deep sleep.
> =C2
> Then =
he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2 that he got
visions etc =
of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most
people who know h=
im also do not know these things. But once he was in
samadhi for 72 hours, =
not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact
same place and same posit=
ion for 3 days continuously.=C2  Only his wife
and close relatives know abo=
ut this incident. I believe nowadays when
ever he sits for meditation he of=
ten enters the state of Samadhi. When
someone asked him how he felt during =
samadhi, he just said it feels as
if the whole universe orginates from me. =
I am the sun, the moon, the
stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, ch=
ildren, the wind, the
water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger th=
an everything. It
cannot be accurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sri Krishn=
a to be God
and=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not li=
ke the
Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2 Rama to the
> =
level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to
show =
Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The difference he says is
that, an i=
deal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can
and should aim=
 to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by
ordinary men. On=
e cannot become Krishna, but one=C2 can try to lead his
life like Rama. I h=
ave argued with him over this, but I am merely
stating his idea. Also he do=
es not have a Guru - a human guru at least,
and advises people to not trust=
 most Gurus these days. Needless to say,
he is not an atheist any more.

=C2

fe=C2 that I know, let me say=C2 line or two about the nature of =
this friend of mine. I met him about two years back. What first attracted m=

ac=C2 when it comes to=C2 honestly.=C2 If someone were to pu=
t a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C2 lie,=
 like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes =
with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2 spoken even a single li=
e in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teac=
her told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his=
 teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive languag=
e and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he boug=
ht himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten y=
ears every day he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and<BR>>=
 one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C2 up volume=
s of Hindi and English literature.=C2 When I asked him why, he just sa=
id it is because he wanted to be=C2 equally adept at both the language=
s so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth abo=
ut=C2 which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncom=
promising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. B=
y education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields,=
 from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most =
places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sansk=
rit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry =
in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself a=
n atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for relig=
ion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that bl=
ank space, he asked<BR>> my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cle=
rk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk a=
nd tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wr=
iting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> S=
o this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, who=
ever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> One d=
ay, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to o=
ffice passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C2 his scoot=
er, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still=
 does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o c=
lock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening!=
 And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, th=
e priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he w=
as for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared =
to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered =
nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Then he star=
ted meditating at home, and it was there=C2 that he got visions etc of=
 Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know him=
 also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, no=
t moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same positio=
n for 3 days continuously.=C2  Only his wife and close relatives know =
about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he=
 often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt duri=
ng samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from m=
e. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women,=
 children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger=
 than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sr=
i Krishna to be God and=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why h=
e does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2&n=
bsp;Rama to the<BR>> level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=
ki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The dif=
ference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an or=
dinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be=
 emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2 can t=
ry to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am m=
erely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at leas=
t, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, =
he is not an atheist any more.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Later he had once=
=C2 mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around h=

 etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interac=
ting with people, specially=C2 with those in=C2 the age group of =
18 to 30, discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politic=
