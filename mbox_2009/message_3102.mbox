 A disciple once asked Bhagavan, who was then at Skandasramam, =93What is
m=
eant by desireless action?=94

Bhagavan did not give a reply but kept quiet=
. A little later, he went out
for a walk accompanied by the questioner and =
some others. Bhagavan saw a
branch of a tree, cut it and spent one hour sha=
ping it into a nice walking
stick. At about that time, an elderly shepherd =
who had no walking stick came
that way walking slowly and with difficulty.
=

Bhagavan gave him the stick which he just made and said =93Action is over =
so
also desireless action=94 and thus showed by example what the phrase mea=
nt.
