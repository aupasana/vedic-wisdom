namaste,

> If casts are determined by the nature,


If caste is determined by birth, what can we do about it? Nothing.
If caste is determined by profession / work, what can we do about it?
For many of us, not much.
If caste is determined by our tendencies, what can we do about it? Everything.

Our current and future professions, as well as our future births
follow our nature. So let us start there.

Caste is a loaded word with a lot of connotations. What is the
Sanskrit equivalent? jAti? varNa? both? neither?

bhavadIyaH,

      ajit
