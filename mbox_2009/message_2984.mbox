 MASTER: "It is 'woman and gold' that binds man and robs him of his freedom.
It is woman that creates the need for gold. For woman one man becomes the
slave of another, and so loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.

"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion,he is no longer attached
to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder,he is free from
fear of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and
the other small.Which one will attract the iron? The big one,of course. God
is the big magnet.Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can 'woman'
do?"

A DEVOTEE: "Sir, shall we hate women then?"

MASTER: "He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the eye of
lust; so he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so
many aspects of the Divine Mother. He worships them all as the Mother
Herself.
