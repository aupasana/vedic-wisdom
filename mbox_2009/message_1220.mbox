Namaste all, 

Sorry to encroach upon this thread. 

I would like to share =
something about the miraculous MahaMrityunjay
mantra. I have always come ac=
ross different variations in the
pronounciation of the MahaMrityunyay mantr=
a, more specifically in the
word 'Bandhanaan'. I have heard it being pronou=
nced as 'Aum Tryambakam
Yajamahe...Urvarukmiva Bandhanaam', 'Bandhanaat' an=
d 'Bandhanaan'. I
have no clue as to what part of the Rig Veda to look for =
- to verify
the correct sanskrit word. So, I have always pronounced it with=
 a
silent 'aan' at the end just because it 'felt' right. (Still don't
know =
if it's right) But it has nevertheless, always produced
positive results es=
pecially in regard to curing illnesses.

Such is the generosity of the Lord=
! :) 

Har Har Mahadev!
