Dear Narasimha,

Very good article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.

If I=
 can, Let me also ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all this.
Sea=
rch for some answers has brought me to this forum.)

a) Why Madhukaitam is =
 so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being
sustained by people keeping=
 their head down and doing the routine work? Do
we not please the God by ke=
eping our head down and playing the role assigned
to us ? An obvious answer=
 comes to mind is that it will keep us away from
emancipation and/self-actu=
alization. Correct/Incorrect?

b) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two =
poles apart (and twain shall
never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heig=
hts of professional success in
my career, Am I doomed not to become a good =
spiritualist (???)? or, If I
want to become self-actualized by 2025, does i=
t mean I should stop planning
to climb the professional ladder? I do unders=
tand about "Limited Bandwidth"
issue - but, then I also read about King Jan=
ak. Can I combine these two - if
yes, how?

 c) Getting even more confused =
now,  Why do we say that emancipation is
our spiritual goal. If GOD created=
 us, and put us on this stage - should our
goal not be to play the role dut=
ifully, which God wants us to play. By
seeking for emancipation, are we try=
ing to get off the stage and trying to
escape the role assigned to us. Are =
we not contradicting the God's scheme of
things by trying to get out of the=
 scheme?

d) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya" first =
and then
ask us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he w=
ill not be
playing "rats in the maze" game. Then, why??

e) Sometimes, I al=
so think that all these above questions are meaningless. I
look at my pre-s=
chool kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher.
She is not worr=
ying about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly,
probably, Ema=
ncipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should
not be thin=
king at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to
learn/experien=
ce more till we are ready (for what?)

f) Then, what do we mean by spiritua=
l journey? where/how do we start? I
thought about doing homam/reciting mant=
ra - but is that the right way? or
there is another way. Probably, there ar=
e many ways - then how do I choose
my way? An "user guide" or " spiritualit=
y for dummies" book  would have been
useful. Do we have one?

I will apprec=
iate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact,
probably, I d=
onot even have the right question right now - forget about
articulating the=
m well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))


Regards

Sanj=
ay

<div>Dear Narasimha,</div>
<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>Very good article/discuss=
ion..Thanks for sharing it.</div>
<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>If I can, Let me a=
lso ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some a=
nswers has brought me to this forum.) </div>
<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>a) Why =
Madhukaitam is =C2=A0so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being sustain=
ed by people keeping their head down and doing the routine work? Do we not =
please the God by keeping our head down and playing the role assigned to us=
 ? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from emanci=
pation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? </div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>=

<div>b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituality and materialism two poles apart (and twa=
in shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of professional =
success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spiritualist (???)? =
or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop=
 planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand about "Lim=

<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>
<div>c) Get=
ting even more confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation is our=
=C2=A0spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - should =
our goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play. By =
seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and trying to =
escape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God's sche=
me of things by trying to get out of the scheme? </div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>
=
<div>d) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya&quo=
t; first and then ask us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do=
 so? I am sure he will not be playing=C2=A0"rats in the maze" gam=
e. Then, why??</div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>e) Sometimes, I also think tha=
t all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid an=
d the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying about h=
er profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Emancipati=
on/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking at=
 the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more=
 till we are ready (for what?)</div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>f) Then, what =
do we mean by spiritual journey? where/how do we start? I thought about doi=
ng homam/reciting mantra - but is that the right way? or there is another w=
ay. Probably, there are many ways - then how do I choose my way? An "u=
ser guide" or " spirituality for dummies" book=C2=A0 would h=
ave been useful. Do we have one?</div>

<div>=C2=A0</div>
<div>I will appre=
ciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I =
donot even have the right question right now - forget about articulating th=
em well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))</div>

<div>Near the beginning of the 20th century the =
great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express=
 a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine =
union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of man=
kind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that t=
he time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heav=
en descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the in=
trinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdesc=
ent.=EF=BF=BD<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, Ind=
ia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother=
. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation =
that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.<br>
=EF=
=BF=BD<br>Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and=
 that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of the=
 divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The proces=
s by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolutio=
n. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two=
 events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw =
that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsup=
ramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change eve=
rything on Earth.<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what h=
e is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul i=
s somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eter=
nal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid=
 of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, ev=
en if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.</div>

<div>=
<font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></fo=
nt><br>Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutio=
nary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made trem=
endous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preven=
t its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befor=
e her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, w=
hat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the field=
s of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into =
cellular consciousness.<br>
</div>
<div>Evolution took a great leap forward=
 with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now=
 at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepa=
re for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stag=
es of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurr=
ently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current =
species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely ob=
structed from contacting and merging with it.<br>
=EF=BF=BD<br>Next is the =
=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =
birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=
hat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=
ind-consciousness. </div>

<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=
=A0</div>
<div>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inh=
abit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light,=
 which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular c=
onsciousness. </div>
<div><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"2"></font>=C2=A0</di=
v>
<div>Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental=
 Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matt=
er. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=
=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully re=
alized upon Earth.<br>
</div>
<div>The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the =
Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular con=
sciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this=
 meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought =
into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it wou=
ld flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.<br>
Whenever th=
ere is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri A=
urobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAs=
uras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. =
There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falseh=
ood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly app=
arent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. According =
to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation =
recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only th=
e latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spok=
e of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler dur=
ing World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his i=
nfluence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influ=
encing other world leaders in the current political sphere.<br>
</div>
<div=
>With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =
human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=
 although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=
rophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=
r the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=
 carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=
eans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =
be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=
h. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world t=
oday, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of ha=
rmonization!<br>
</div>
<div><u>When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo an=
d the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent=
, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramen=
tal transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a=
 minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerab=
le.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.</u></div=
