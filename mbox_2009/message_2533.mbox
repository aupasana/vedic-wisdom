Namaste all, 

I th=
ought that there was no better place to ask this question since this is the=
 yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the Chandi Homam along=
 with Shri Narasimhaji' s words. My desire to praise the Divine Mother in t=
his way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we are coming close =
to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to start with the recitat=
ion first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing the homam. (Learnin=
g to walk before learning to run) :)

I don't know if you had such dilemmas=
 before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly share how you have =
managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter objections from out=
side from fellow friends and family members who say that "the Chandi homam =
isn't part of the family tradition" hence the family devta won't be pleased=
 or "un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level ritual" or even "=
un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a regularly basis"!=
 However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am prepared to di=
sregard the superstitions. 

What I find harder to discard though, are pers=
onal objections that I create for myself..I call it the "I-am-not-worthy- e=
nough" syndrome. I am not confident of being able to stay completely detach=
ed during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is that I do not know =
to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At=
 some point or another won't one end up automatically asking for one's pers=
onal gains? After all, isn't it human nature to confide everything/ask the =
Mother for everything.. Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please give my kids goo=
d health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma's curse for reciting th=
e Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimo=
chan mantra enough to 'white-wash' one's selfish motives?

Secondly, I have=
 to admit that after listening to some tales about regular recitation of th=
e Chandi Paath being associated with 'Kundalini jagran', I am a bit worried=
. Can sadhana and 'kundalini jagran' ever be mutually exclusive? What if on=
e wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they still have to undergo=
 chakra awakening etc? 

Thank u.
Somanathan
