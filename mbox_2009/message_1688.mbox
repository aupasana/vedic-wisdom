Namaste,
 
A fantastic question and one that downplays the importance of re=
ligion and rituals in the minds of intelligent and rational people! Hence a=
 very important question to answer..
 
To answer it, I will go back to the =
analogy I gave just a few days back:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=
wisdom/message/1673 (Why rituals)
 
*        *        *
 
The child is taug=
ht by parents to say things like "thank you" and "sorry" in different situa=
tions. I compared it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantras without u=
nderstanding. I said that the child slowly understands the true meaning wit=
h experience and feels the emotions represented by those words when saying =
them. I compared it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented =
by the rituals as he gains experience and becomes more ready.
 
Now, think =
about this. Parents speaking different languages teach different words to t=
he child. A parent speaking English may teach "I am sorry". A parent speaki=
ng Hindi may teach "mujhe maaf keejiye". Another Hindi speaking person may =
teach "mujhe maaf karo". A parent speaking Telugu may teach "nannu kshaminc=
handi". Another Telugu speaking person may teach "nannu kshaminchu". And so=
 on. The words are different. But they represent the same thought and emoti=
on.
 
Actually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different in each cas=
e, depending on the peculiarities and cultural context of the language used=
. For example, the English expression has "I" as the subject and one is tal=
king about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the other p=
erson as the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect shown=
 is different in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning is slightly=
 different. Thus, children speaking different languages may visualize somet=
hing slightly different as their understanding of the languages improves. H=
owever, these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic emotio=
ns associated with these different expressions is the same in different lan=
guages and one will feel those emotions with compassion as one masters the =
language.
 
Similarly, deities, rituals and mantras used in different relig=
ious traditions may be different, but they may represent the same divine en=
ergy and the same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate visualizatio=
n of an expression in the mind of a child may change based on cultural cont=
ext and grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate imagination of a deit=
y's gross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka may change based on the re=
ligious paradigms and spirutal context that one is exposed to. However, the=
se differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic energies and expe=
riences represented by various deities and rituals are the same in differen=
t religious traditions and one will experience the same spiritual truths as=
 one masters one's path.
 
No wonder Rigveda says "ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa=
 vadanti" (Truth is One, but the learned say it differently).
 
*        * =
       *
 
One language may have a lot of different words for an object wit=
h slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. As an exa=
mple, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for "snow", "ic=
e", "dew", "mist" etc, whereas English has so many words. Native language o=
f Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many more words =
than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls al=
l of them as "snow".
 
Similarly, religious traditions that explored slight=
ly different kinds of the same divine energy may have personified those ene=
rgies as different deities. So some religions may have more deities than so=
me other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deities for different =
variations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion may have only one=
 deity.
 
*        *        *
 
If communication can be internalized and we=
 can communicate with our emotions, we do not need language and we will all=
 be on the same page always. But we cannot communicate with our internal em=
otions and need an external method. So language is needed. But language can=
 divide.
 
Similarly, spiritual truths are internal (like our emotions). In=
 order to express them and transmit them to others, we need deities, mantra=
s, rituals and religion. But religion can divide.
 
One child may say "I am=
 sorry" and another may say another expression meaning the same thing and t=
hey may argue who is right. One may say "my father said this is correct" an=
d another may say "my mother said this is correct" and they may fight on wh=
o is correct. People fighting over whose religion is superior and trying to=
 "convert" others are like such children. Unfortunately, my "child and lang=
uage" analogy is too mild in this area and the fights between religions hav=
e been far worse than two children arguing about their language. Countless =
people have been murdered in the name of religion.
 
Instead of arguing whi=
ch expression is correct and finding fault with others, children learning s=
hould focus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to understand w=
hat exactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions when they =
say things. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, one sho=
uld try to understand one's own religion better and experience the spiritua=
l truths represented in that religion.
 
*        *        *
 
One may thin=
k there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god etc and they are re=
sponsible for respective religions and societies. That is not true.
 
If on=
e believes that there is a supreme deity (whatever the name you use to desc=
ribe) who creates all beings, then one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, C=
hrist, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira were sent to this earth by that same s=
upreme deity and different religions came into being only because that supr=
eme deity willed so! Each religion serves a useful purpose at a given place=
 and a time. When a religion's time is up, it goes.
 
*        *        *
 =

Some may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspect=
s of divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. However=
, they are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulate=
d many layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have eve=
r seen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life=
, but may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulate=
d through many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following mess=
age:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761
 
He had not =
read about some of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw=
 them and could describe them. This is because those forms represent a pers=
onification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in that f=
orm in a previous life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not conscio=
usly) and it can come back anytime. So, though he did not know about that f=
orm, that form appeared before him.
 
Swami Vivekananda famously said (para=
phrased), "a human being imagines god as a super human being with many hand=
s and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffa=
lo with many horns". Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. I=
t may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a wo=
rk of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.
 
Until one learns how=
 to feel sorry and show that feeling, saying "I am sorry" as a ritual is an=
 important habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot anyway under=
stand their correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he=
 does not understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, =
though the energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific exter=
nal form associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy on=
ly by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one's mind tend=
s to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.
 
T=
hough we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences are a creation =
of mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe i=
s a creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is real and not cr=
eated by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind over the time.=
 If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imagination of the=
 mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connected to its fie=
ld of experience. Various minds in its field of experience are connected to=
 it. For example, the experience described in the following message was ind=
ependently "observed" by two people. Human mind can imagine things and hall=
ucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is different from a typical=
 hallucination:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951
 
=
Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of vari=
ous religions have been independently experienced by multiple people.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
When someone looks sad, one person may say "he is sad". =
Another person may say "woh dukhi hai". Another person may say "vaadu baadh=
a padutunnaadu". Similarly, when a divine energy is present in a place, one=
 may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perceive it as a deity =
Y. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeling one perceives is=
 based on the language one knows, similarly the form mentioned by one to de=
scribe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioning of one's mind an=
d the religious tradition one is exposed to.
 
I know one person who does C=
handi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the Divine Mother in=
to his heart by showing the fire with his hands and motioning the hands tow=
ards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, he just perceives a nic=
e energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he was doing this on=
eday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind him. His eyes were =
closed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he was baffled and o=
pened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess =
who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermillion pow=
der) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and opened his eyes. =
But the person who did homam perceived only some nice energy and no specifi=
c form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by different people in a dif=
ferent form. One person may perceive only some energy and another may perce=
ive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different form. The exact p=
erception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But the energy itself i=
s uniform, though the form is not.
 
*        *        *
 
I have covered v=
arious aspects related to this topic. I will stop now.

l one learns how to feel sorry and show 
that feeling, saying "I am so=
rry" as a ritual is an important habit. Not 
teaching a child words be=
cause he cannot anyway understand their correct meaning 
is wrong. The chil=
d should be taught even if he does not understand. He will 
understand the =
true meaning later Similarly, though the energy represented by a 
form is m=
ore basic than a specific external form associated with that energy, 
many =
people will reach that energy only by imagining that form and 
worship=
ping that form. So, if one's mind tends to imagine a form, one should 
imag=
ine the form and worship that form.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Though we say t=
hat forms of deities and mystical 
experiences are a creation of mind, that=
 is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire 
manifested universe is a creation=
 of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is 
real and not created by th=
e mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind over 
the time. If we say=
 that a form of a deity or an experience is an 
imagination of the min=
d, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is 
connected to its field =
of experience. Various minds in its field of experience 
are connected to i=
t. For example, the experience described in the following 
message was=
 independently "observed" by two people. Human mind can imagine 
things and=
 hallucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is different from 
a t=
ypical hallucination:</FONT></DIV>

His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When

Deities<BR> <B=
R>> Namaste<BR>><BR>> Just a curious 
thought.<BR>><BR>> We =
in Hinduism have a certain set of deities. In 
history we see that every <B=
R>> ancient culture had their own set of deities 
and rituals etc etc.<B=
R>><BR>> If deities are not universal and rather 
culture specific, a=
re they a <BR>> creation of the people? But if they are a 
creation of t=
he people, how do <BR>> they have such universal 
abilities/powers and a=
lso their avatarts. We have <BR>> in Sanatana Dharma 
many instances of =
amsa avatars of various deities <BR>> taking 
birth.<BR>><BR>> Wha=
t happens to the deities of a certain culture, once 
the culture has <BR>&g=
t; died and there is no one to worship that deity? And why 
did not the <BR=
>> ancient deities of different cultures protect those 
cultures from <B=
R>> anihilation?<BR>><BR>> Any thoughts on this would 
be interest=
ing.<BR>><BR>> -Regards<BR>>
