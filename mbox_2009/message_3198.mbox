Dear Anup,

You can read the mails =
below. Ravi has mentioned a nice technique of setting a 40 days period of r=
egular practise. Normally for anyone who is not well verses in Sanskrit, th=
e first few Chandi Paths can be taxing, but that is only a matter of few da=
ys. Also, you can try reading it in your mother tongue as mentioned by Nara=
yan in one mail below.

Hope you find the mails useful.

-Regards
