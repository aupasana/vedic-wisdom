dear narasimha ji and friends,
namaste!

i understand that the syllables / =
metre of the mantra is very 
important. that is why (probably) mantra was p=
assed on from the guru 
to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even said =
that in the end 
it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...and not =
even the 
words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat remaining eve=
n 
when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.

i too have bee=
n looking at / bringing to my consciousness the 
gayatri mantra of late. fo=
r lack of guidance, i have been relying on 
the internet. the first thing t=
hat kind of took my breath away was 
the layers and layers of meaning attac=
hed to each word of the 
mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit word=
s are like 
that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and th=
en 
still another and another....

but more importantly (perhaps) is the di=
fferent ways this mantra 
gets recited. i tried to count the syllables to s=
ee whether they 
added upto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i wa=
sn't sure 
whether om in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it pro=
baly 
is, but i want to be sure.

secondly, depending on who chants the man=
tra, the words 
are "spelt" / "pronounced" differently. For instance in one=
 
rendering i found "swah" being pronounced as "suvah" which becomes 
two s=
yllables instead of one. simarly, in the same 
rendering "prachodyat" is st=
retched to 3 syllables instead of 2.

so i am confused as to the "right" re=
ndition.

i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted his rendit=
ion 
of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not been able to find 
=
it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me about this.

i would also=
 like to know the importance of the number of syllables 
in each mantra and=
 how this is suitable for different persons 
depending on their "karmic str=
uctures" which are sometimes / always 
(?) reflected in the astrological ch=
art. maybe a guru by just 
looking at a person can know intuitively what is=
 the "right" mantra 
for the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do th=
e same. 

i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking 
gu=
idance on "appeasement" of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro 
saturn in =
6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. These 
planets aspect all the=
 other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury in 
2nd house and venus moon in th=
ird house).

thankyou!

love and best wishes,'
vinita
