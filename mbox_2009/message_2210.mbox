Subject: How do you pronounce the Vedic anusvara?

Namaste all,

What is the correct pronunciation of the Vedic anusvara ({\m+} in
itrans), for example in "aum gaNaanaaM tvaa gaNapati{\m+}"?

I have heard some audio recordings in which it is pronounced "gm"
(almost like a shortened version of "gam"). But some text books say it
should be pronounced as a short "gna", and others more improbably don't
seem to differentiate it from the normal anusvara.

Thanks,

Samir
