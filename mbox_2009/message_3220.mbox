Namaste,

Here is something to consider.   Most members of the society for=

prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA and similar organizations) in
North=
 America and Europe are non-vegetarians.  They believe that animals
that lo=
ok cute and are friendly to humans should be treated properly and
all other=
 animals which fit in the food chain should be killed
*humanely*and eaten. =
  In the US, a famous athelete called Michael Vick
lost all of his fortune =
as he was convicted of cruel behaviour to
animals when he was taken to task=
 by this same group of people.

I would request any member to define *human=
e* killing.  It is almost an
oxymoron since to be humane is *to be*

I woul=
d encourage people to watch the movie *Fast Food Nation*.  It
shows the ins=
ide story of beef factories and what happens and how
humanely the cows are =
killed before they end up in burgers and stakes
and what not.  Not suitable=
 for those faint of heart.  Anyone with a
spiritual seed in their heart wil=
l think seriously about giving up beef
after watching this movie.

My 2 cen=
ts

Veenu

Death is part and parcel of n=
atural law. One cannot avoid it however
much one tries. The Abrahamic relig=
ions are heavy on non-veg food. The
areas where they grew, arid, desert lan=
d, you need to have (at least
during those days) animal flesh to survive sp=
ecially considreing
irrigation options were so scanty.=C2 If you live in th=
e Artic region,
you need to have fish oil to survive the cold. The=C2 point=
 is, death
is a part of life. One does not survive without death. That is h=
ow the
