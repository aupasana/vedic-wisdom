Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
Some points came to my mind. Thought of mailing them to =
you. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0Jumping on conclusion without properly studying/thinking=
 about Thakur's life, just on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a s=
ure blasphemy.
=C2=A0
You are right. But since this is a debate and just a =
debate, =C2=A0let me put forth some logical points.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
1) Two wr=
ongs never make a right. This is one mistake we Indians do when we try to d=
ebate over something. When we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matte=
r whether Ramakrishna - who lived in a different century - was right or now=
. That would be a different debate. 
=C2=A0
2) Ramakrishna did not write an=
ything -:). He only=C2=A0woke up=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necess=
ary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, one can always contend that=
 a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Saradananda=C2=A0could very =
well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is di=
fferent from creating a composition. When one writes, one has more time and=
 energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up possibilities of different =
shades of meanings for the simple reason that the audience is large, unknow=
n and spread out=C2=A0over huge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and tha=
t too talking to friends, or close people, one does not need to be careful =
of every word or sentence one speaks. 
=C2=A0
To understand this better,=C2=
=A0=C2=A0we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication hap=
pens in three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the=
 words, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown'=
 or sub conscious communication. This last three percent is the most powerf=
ul. When a person can use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - h=
e can move masses of people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also d=
o so (IMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may f=
ind it uninspiring. But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, y=
ou will definitely feel an energy and get swayed.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Then comes =
body language which is so important.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a =
Govt office in India, you may find that the babus there will be sitting rel=
axed in their chair with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardl=
y make any impact on them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices =
move at a=C2=A0snail's pace.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are tal=
king to=C2=A0is sitting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the=
 right, even if the person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, kno=
w it for the sure that there is a strong change he is listening through one=
 ear and throwing out the words through the other. In short, pretending to =
listen. In effect, once you leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won't bothe=
r about what you said.
=C2=A0
And last is spoken word. When two people spea=
k with each other, both words and body language come into picture. Sometime=
s sub conscious communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of t=
he energy exchanged/communication not through words but through other means=
. 
=C2=A0
When you write down something, body languages gets negated. There=
fore, one needs to be extra cautious while writing something in order to co=
nvey the correct sense. That is why there are so many more rules to be foll=
owed=C2=A0for writing anything.
=C2=A0
So therefore, if Ramakrishna is "tal=
king" to someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But=
 if he were to write a book and mention "Kamini and Kanchan" without furthe=
r explanation of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to ques=
tion. But he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they=
 explained the sense. 
=C2=A0
Contrast this to that line from Ramacharit Ma=
nas, without any qualifications, that implies "women", "sudra", "pashu" are=
 worthy of "tadan".=C2=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C2=A0to t=
hat line.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious lite=
rature, I keep the Koran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judgi=
ng a book of religious nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement th=
at I use when I judge the Koran as a book.
=C2=A0
The Koran contains a vers=
e, translated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, which r=
ecommend husbands to beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. 
=C2=A0=


"Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to =
excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women a=
re therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to=
) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alo=
ne in their sleeping places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not se=
ek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great. (Shakir's version of th=
e Koran, Quran, 4:34) 
=C2=A0
A lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the=
 above=C2=A0giving various reasons one of which is 'misunderstanding contex=
t'. I find it inexcusable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing "=
nari", "pashu", "sudra" together, I find=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. Th=
at is the sense that comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not=
 commenting on the whole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.

Interesting doha. Maybe you are right, maybe you ar=

simply a bad composition. One way or the other, I cannot absolve the compos=

Dear(est) Rajarshi,
back engineering j=

Vow! Refreshing phrase.=C2=A0 Too good. It seems a season of=
 debating. Branches of threads are coming out.
'Kamini and `Kanchan' was th=
e exact words which=C2=A0Ramakrishna used freely during his life time. Now =
Kamini means a woman and its possible that several sections would have take=
n reservation at this. That seems very obvious otherwise why Swami Sardanan=
da required to defend Thakur in his book called Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. I=
t seemed to me that Paramahansa Yogananda also have referred to this issue =
without mentioning Thakur's name directly (I may be wrong but i strongly fe=
lt like that when i read the 'Autobiography of a yogi' some 4/5 years back)=
. Sardanada in a sense did 'Back engineering job to bail out :)'=C2=A0. If =
we go by 'Kamini' word=C2=A0literaly, then Thakur=C2=A0could be portrayed a=
s Women basher.=C2=A0 but we all know that Thakur refffered to Lust and=C2=
=A0Desire of=C2=A0worldly objects whenever he spoke those two words. Jumpin=
g on conclusion without properly studying/thinking about Thakur's life, jus=
t on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.
Same way, =
I also thought about Sant Tulasi das ji. I=C2=A0was telling=C2=A0myself tha=
t can a saint of his devotion and poetic skills and add to that steadfastly=
 devoted to Lord Rama (Who never shown slightest dis-resepct to =C2=A0women=
) , utter such words and saggrigate 'Nari' for nothing. I was not convinced=
.=C2=A0 One of the 'Dohas' of Tulasi Das goes like this -

si Juth Jabaan ||
(I have given=C2=A0this doha =C2=A0out of memory and its =
quite possible that first two=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C2=A0
If a=
 poet is asking to look at a woman as a Mother, how could he mean 'Nari' to=
 be 'Tadan Adhikari'? As you pointed out,=C2=A0 on a look at surface (at th=
e levelof text), it means which many belives but you and me need to look at=
 little deeper. A person who did the world of Good to Indias ordinary masse=
s by rewriting the whole Ramayana in a language which people (from north) c=
ould easily understand, The man who gave immortal 'Hanumaan Chalisa' can no=
t be lebeled so casually as 'Nari basher' or 'Shudra Hater' (As Mayaavati b=
rand poticians would capitalise).
Regarding your questions of why Pashu are=
 only Nari and not Nara ....
I think he was reffering=C2=A0to=C2=A0 Men wit=
h the words Ganvaar and Shudra=C2=A0and Pashu Nari must be a joint statemen=
t. Again as you already know, Shudra was not B.C., OBC, KBC, HSBC etc.. :-)=
. but a fallen man, a mean thinking man. I have to agree if you say that Ga=
nvaar and Shudra can also be said about Woaman=C2=A0however looking at the =
Doha and general=C2=A0prevailing conditions of society, it seems that he us=
ed those words for Men.=C2=A0
Grammar...Hmmmm. i don't know if he has reall=
y used proper grammer in such Dohas.
There are=C2=A0verse in Bhagvad Gita w=
hich=C2=A0can be criticised by people from other faiths if they are taken l=
iteraly and without understanding personality of Krishna .
***
Regarding Ra=
machandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend's view and your =
detailed explanation by giving examples. =C2=A0But again i don't think that=
 to consider Rama as God will actually be blockage in leading life like him=
 and that too when almost everybody in Sanatan Dharma knows him as God. Tth=
at is not reversible in any case. And above all, Incarnation of Lord Vishnu=
 - He is a GOD

You and I've notably common Astrological factors =

=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompr=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Some points came to my mind. Thought of mailing them to you. </DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia><EM> Jumping on conclusion witho=
ut properly studying/thinking about Thakur's life, just on literal meaning =
of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.</EM></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><EM><FON=
T face=3DGeorgia></FONT></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>You are=
 right. But since this is a debate and just a debate,  let me put fort=
h some logical points.  </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT=
> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>1) Two wrongs never make a right. T=
his is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When=
 we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - wh=
o lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a differen=
t debate. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>=
<FONT face=3DGeorgia>2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He only&nbs=
p;woke up people to what ever degree was necessary and gave general ta=
lks on spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the bi=
ographers mistake. M or Saradananda could very well have been mistaken=
 in what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a=
 composition. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in t=
hinking, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for =
the simple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out o=
ver huge spans of time. When one talks, and that too talking to friend=
s, or close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or senten=
ce one speaks. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
=
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>To understand this better,  we have to =
think - scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels=
. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent t=
hrough body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or sub conscious co=
mmunication. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person ca=
n use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of=
 people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you l=
isten to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. =
But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely f=
eel an energy and get swayed.  </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia=
></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>Then comes body language whi=
ch is so important. For example, if you enter a Govt office in In=
dia, you may find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their cha=
ir with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact=
 on them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a sn=
ail's pace. If you find that someone whom you are talking to is s=
itting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if t=
he person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure=
 that there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing=
 out the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect=
, once you leave his presence he probably won't bother about what you =
said.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT=
 face=3DGeorgia>And last is spoken word. When two people speak with each ot=
her, both words and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub consciou=
s communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exch=
anged/communication not through words but through other means. </FONT></DIV=
>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>W=
hen you write down something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one n=
eeds to be extra cautious while writing something in order to convey the co=
rrect sense. That is why there are so many more rules to be followed f=
or writing anything.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </=
DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia>So therefore, if Ramakrishna is "talking" to=
 someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he w=
ere to write a book and mention "Kamini and Kanchan" without further explan=
ation of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. Bu=
t he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they explain=
ed the sense. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DGeorgia></FONT> </DIV>
