The answer you gave just increased my respect for you Narasi=

=C2=A0
I keep mentally analysing various things around the world and =
then when I saw your mail, I thought this is similar to a solution that I h=
ad analytically arrived at.
=C2=A0
This was triggered by a book I was readi=
ng on the saying of=C2=A0 late Baba Bhagwan Ramji of the Kinnaram Ashram in=
 Kasi where he=C2=A0says a bunch of Aghoris at the helm of the country can =
make India a problem free place. I just exchanged the word Aghori for "seri=
ous sadhaka" in your mail.

Namaste Sri Radhakrishnan,
=C2=A0
While I respect the ort=
hodoxy of Kerala temples, it will not work in cold countries and even in no=
rth India during winter.=C2=A0Many priests do wear shirts when performing h=
omas in winter here, in Boston, USA.
=C2=A0
Honestly, the clothes that we w=
rap around the body to hide the true body are not a major issue and have ve=
ry little bearing on our sadhana. The layers of conditioning by various gun=
as that we wrap around our ego-consciousness to hide the true Self=C2=A0IS =
the major issue that blocks our spiritual progress. The former is a symbol =
and the latter is the real thing that matters. Shedding those layers surrou=
nding the ego is far more important than removing shirt.
=C2=A0
Actually, t=
hough I live in cold climate, the room in which I recorded the video was co=
mfortable enough and I could have done without the shirt. But I consciously=
 chose to record it with a shirt on, in order to not send a wrong message t=
o those living in cold climates and having to do homam in cold garages. Ins=
tead of sticking to unnecessarily strict=C2=A0rules and ending up not doing=
 homam as often, I want people to relax rules that do not matter=C2=A0and d=
o it as often as they can. I want to de-emphasize things that do not matter=
 that much.
=C2=A0
World is going to go through interesting times and we ne=
ed many serious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many clothes on the bod=
y but shed off as many layers as possible on their ego=C2=A0- doing homam o=
n a regular basis.
=C2=A0
I use more materials in my daily Chandi homam (be=
cause I use a bigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, but agai=
n that was a conscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I wanted=
 to demonstrate how a very=C2=A0simple homam can be performed quite easily =
with very few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple procedure li=
ke this will make a big difference in the world, if a lot of people are doi=
ng this sincerely everyday.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

 Video (based on the manual)

Namaste friends,

This weekend, Ravi shot vid=
eo of a 20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being 
performed by me, based on the=
 procedure in the manual. He uploaded it to 
Google Video and YouTube today=
. What is in Google Video is one file that is 
20 min 28 min long (and 92 M=
B in size). It is downloadable to your computer 
and you can play it using =
free software QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored 
as three parts and has a=
 higher quality. You can play those three parts 
directly from YouTube.

If=
 you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam 
p=
age, you will see all related links right there.

To limit the video size, =
we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra 
and beeja mantra are chan=
ted 8 times each and Atharva seersham once. You can 
of course use higher c=
ounts and do it longer.

Thanks to Ravi for his effort!

Best regards,
Nara=
simha

PM<BR>Subject: Maha Ganapathi Homam Video (based on the manual)<BR><BR>Nama=
ste friends,<BR><BR>This weekend, Ravi shot video of a 20-minute Maha Ganap=
athi homam being <BR>performed by me, based on the procedure in the manual.=
 He uploaded it to <BR>Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Vi=
deo is one file that is <BR>20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is d=
ownloadable to your computer <BR>and you can play it using free software Qu=
ickTime. On YouTube, it is stored <BR>as three parts and has a higher quali=
ty. You can play those three parts <BR>directly from YouTube.<BR><BR>If you=
 go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to
 Maha Ganapathi Homam <BR>p=
age, you will see all related links right there.<BR><BR>To limit the video =
size, we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra <BR>and beeja mantra=
 are chanted 8 times each and Atharva seersham once. You can <BR>of course =
use higher counts and do it longer.<BR><BR>Thanks to Ravi for his effort!<B=
