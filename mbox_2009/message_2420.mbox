Few Words about Shre=
e Vijay Bansalji
*

(Retired senior Company Executive, Scientist, Engineer,=
 International
Speaker and Author)

Engaged for the last 25 years in active=
 social service, Conducting workshops
and seminars on Art and Science of Mu=
dras for total well being.He had
addressed The United Nations Women=92s Gui=
ld, and UNAIDS group Geneva; The
Indian Assns. of Geneva & Lausanne; Rotary=
 and other clubs/ associations in
India, USA, France, Switzerland, China; C=
ompanies, hospitals etc. to spread
the message of "Health without medicines=
" worldwide, conducted classes in
France, USA, Shanghai and was interviewed=
 on Radio Geneva, Adelphia Channel
TV in US, Urbanatomy Shanghai among othe=
rs, in addition to this he had
conducted countless number of corporate work=
shops and seminars in various
organizations and corporates in various count=
ries.

We are truly fortunate and blessed to have him as our speaker and we=
 do hope
that you will grab this amazing opportunity to learn the Art and S=
cience of
Mudras right from comfort of your home.
*

Aim*: The purpose of t=
he sessions is to create an awareness and an deeper
understanding of Scienc=
e of Mudras. The human body functions with the help
of a unique communicati=
on system -The Nerves. The nerves carry all messages
between the various or=
gans and The Brain. For perfect communication the
nerves have to maintain p=
erfect tension. Nature equips each body with
correct settings (default tens=
ion). Due to various reasons like bad /
unnatural habits, pollution, body a=
buse etc, we spoil this tension setting.
The messages get distorted. The or=
gans fail to effectively communicate their
needs or problems and the Brain =
fails to send the correct response.

Mudra Vigyan helps in restoring the de=
fault tension naturally. By folding
different fingers in different manners,=
 and to different extents, different
tensions can be provided to different =
nerves to bring them to their default
values. Messages start flowing proper=
ly, the brain can exercise authority
once again, the organs get proper dire=
ctives and can do what is required to
meet their needs.

Mudras can maintai=
n good health. They can work as total cures by themselves
or can be used as=
 effective aids to any form of treatment because they DO
NOT interfere with=
 them, rather they only enhance their efficacy. They can
be done any time, =
anywhere and need no prior preparation. Mudras correct the
basic cause henc=
e, they can reverse destructive changes and provide
permanent results.

The=
 Knowledge of the Science of Mudras transcends all age, colour, cast,
creed=
 and nationality. It is universally applicable. Thus, this session is
open =
to all individuals and everyone is welcome to tune in

We look forward for =
your active participation and humbly request to share
this information with=
 all your contacts.
