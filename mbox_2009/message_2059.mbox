=A0
No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of =
us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in m=
y mind. One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.
=A0
If events have =
already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen=
 in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? Like =
a placebo that makes us "happy" but in reality does not exist!
=A0
=A0
I am=
 not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events having alread=
y happened, because same has been said by other great spiritual people in t=
he world. 
=A0
But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a fr=
eewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.
=A0
Theoriticall=
y speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world reforms itself, doe=
s a self correction exercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then why=
 should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has =
to incarnate - as our texts say - then such a self correcting option is alr=
eady negated out.
=A0
Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one=
 has any choice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with=
 the divine.
=A0
So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to th=
ink.

Namaste,

I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a v=
ery short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu's ten incarnations above the fire in =
the following mail:

http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/=
 761

This boy was born and brought up in US and is not proficient in his k=
nowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of the ten incarnatio=
ns. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and a little about =
them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a=
 white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn't come ye=
t.

* * *

This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I=
 was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was=
 abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.

I asked what h=
e was thinking. He said, "it is not that the future that is to come has not=
 already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen l=
ater when the time comes. You know what I mean?" I guessed what he was gett=
ing at, but pretended not to know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"

He said=
, "I don't know how to say what I am thinking." This boy is not known to be=
 overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is us=
ually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he wa=
s onto something today. But he could not express himself.

I helped him, "d=
o you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will =
reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been =
shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. Bu=
t people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front =
of them. Are you saying something like that?"

He exclaimed, "exactly. That=
 is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will ha=
ppen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future co=
mes, because it has already happened."

Though he did not mention it, I kne=
w why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the=
 horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was=
 probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand thing=
s, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody w=
ho had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came=
 to some important conclusions about "time" in his own way.

Time seems lin=
ear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conss=
ciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning w=
hen one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.

* * *

The s=
ame boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra o=
f Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditati=
ng after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was qui=
te different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my m=
ind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed=
 in words as "I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave=
" filled my entire consciousnss.

I had experienced the same kind of intens=
e energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was m=
editating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in In=
dia. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate insid=
e the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main =
Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in t=
he past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no o=
ther time did I feel that intense shakti.

Interestingly, after we finished=
 meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all the different h=
omas I did so far, this is the bestest homam." I asked him why. He said, "I=
 don't know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different."

* * *
=

This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what =
I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerfu=
l energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most=
 important thing.

Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual=
 better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one ha=
s to keep doing it until one breaks through.

Keep performing your chosen s=
piritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage i=
n external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and=
 purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can re=
sist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal enemi=
es like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego=
 - thinking that this is "I" and this is "mine" - is the root cause of all =
problems.

* * *

Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challengin=
g, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including=
 your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god's pro=
perty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties of =
god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion "this is =
mine". A faithful servant takes very good care of his master's properties, =
but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.

Realize=
 that thinking of things as "mine" is not necessary for taking good care of=
 them. A servant who loves one's master takes the best care of things entru=
sted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worr=
ying and crying. A servant will accept that is master's property and can be=
 taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one poss=
esses and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one's=
 control.

Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master's =
properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting cau=
ght and overcome ego.

Best regards,
Narasimha
