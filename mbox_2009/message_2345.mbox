Dear Mr. Balasubramanian,
Please forgive my ignorance as I have no idea abo=
ut Homam. I am a religious person do my japam's regularly. On special occas=
ions I do 108 Atharvashirsa japams.   We don't have access to learned Vedic=
 acharya's in Orissa.  After going thru Narasimhaji's mail I thought of doi=
ng Homam. And the curiosity of doing Shiva homam as he has mentioned in the=
 Shiva Homam can reduce Physical suffering.

So can you please elaborate Mr=
itunjaya Mantra Homam as it's not in Narasimhaji's list.

Regards,
Aashish =

We ge=

Homam  (which mantra  is part of Rudrapatam)  is  recommended  for good  he=
alth and longevity.

Namaskar Narasimhaji,
Is there any harm in do=
ing the Shiva Homam mentioned by you for physical health benefits? Can I do=
 it for my son's health on his behalf? If yes, what other process or sankal=
p's will be needed for that.

Regards,
Aashish
