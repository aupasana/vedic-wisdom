Dear Rajarshi,

I appreciated your previous message but i am a bit taken a =
back by this message.


Ramakrishna was not Ganwar
Dhirubhai Ambani was not=
 ganwar though he didn't go to even secondary school education.

Did you no=
t get ENGLISH Translation for 'Shudra' from your source? Shudra =3D Shudra =
in English? did you mean SHUDRA JATI because you haven't given any equivale=
nt meaning in english.

I'll not write anything now as i am saddened by you=
r message. I doubt your intention and it is not good to write further at th=
is moment.

Best Regards,

Utpal

s one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When we a=
re discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who liv=

on spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the biogra=

what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a com=
position. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in think=
ing, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for the =
simple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out=C2=A0over =
huge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and that too talking to friends, o=
r close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence o=
ne speaks. 
> =C2=A0
> To understand this better,=C2=A0=C2=A0we have to thi=
nk - scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels. A=
round 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent thro=
ugh body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or sub conscious commu=
nication. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person can u=
se this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of pe=
ople. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you list=
en to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But=
 if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel=
 an energy and get swayed.=C2=A0 
> =C2=A0
> Then comes body language which=
 is so important.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office in Indi=
a, you may find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair=

l's pace.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C2=A0is sit=
ting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the=
 person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure t=
hat there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing o=
ut the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, =
once you leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won't bother about what you sa=
id.
> =C2=A0
> And last is spoken word. When two people speak with each oth=
er, both words and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious=
 communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy excha=
nged/communica tion not through words but through other means.

When you write down something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one =
needs to be extra cautious while writing something in order to convey the c=

for writing anything.

to someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he=
 were to write a book and mention "Kamini and Kanchan" without further expl=

But he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they expla=

 It seems a season of debating. Branches of threads are coming out.

wrong but i strongly felt like that when i read the 'Autobiography of a yog=

 an accepted saint like Sri Tulasidasji' s spiritual level, but that senten=

pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=C3=

the second question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if =
it is right or wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0- but his personal opinion i=
s that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather th=
an worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He=
 could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right=
 from the place where he was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he firs=
t heard the news of Sita's abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead ch=
ose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend,=
 it is more important to emulate Rama's ideas than to worship Rama.

=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0

 a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi=
 to BrajBhasa. An author's paradise (since many rules of composition has be=

quates women with animals or something similar. He believes that was introd=
uces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. =
Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, h=
e argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Ava=
tarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna=
 was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on t=
his plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he th=
inks.

=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has a=

fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long i=
