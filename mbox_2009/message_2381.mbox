Dear Friends,
The topic selected by me for  posting viz.,  SELF ie., ATMA  is   vast and limitless.  I wonder whether I can do any 'justice'  to this topic. Invoking the grace of Lord Almighty let me take one step forward. Rest is God`s hands.

The SANSKRIT  term  ATMA  denotes "SELF" in English Language.   As you all might be aware, knowledge of the SELF  alone can liberate  all of us from  being a mortal.  Knowledge of ATMA alone wipes out spiritual ignorance and liberates human beings.   You, I and all that is seen here is Atman and nothing but Atman.  The Atman appears to be limited because of our ignorance.   When that ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of Reality, the Atman shines by itself as does the Sun when the cloud hiding the Sun passes away.  The Sun is ever-shining. But the passing cloud can hide it  though  temporarily.  Atman is ever present.  When we remove the apparent  veil of  ignorance, the Atman reveals by itself.    The sun shines even when  a cloud is said to be covering it.  In fact when we say that there is no sun, we say so only with the help of the sunlight which enables us to see the cloud covering the sun.  Similarly, Atman exists at all times even as we declare
 it is not there. 
 
 Atman is non-dual and infinite.  By infinite we mean that which is not limited, that which is not having any limitations of shape, form,time  etc. etc.  To the ignorant it appears as the pluralistic world.   In fact, ignorance of Atman is the cause  for the pluralistic phenomena.  Ignorance creates the body, mind and intellect which project the world of manifold perceptions, emotions and thoughts upon  the non-dual Atman.   When we destroy our ignorance we go beyond our equipment(Body, Mind and Intellect) and experience the Atman.    The Atman is self-effulgent ( Swayamprakasah).   In a dark room, just as a flashlight is itself illuminated by its own light, the Atman  does not need another light to illuminate it.  Atman reveals itself by itself.
The Chandogya Upanishad    says ," That which is infinite is truly happiness; there is no happiness in the small ie., in the finite; the grat(Infinite) alone is happiness.  The Infinite(Atman) alone should be sought after". 
(to be continued)
