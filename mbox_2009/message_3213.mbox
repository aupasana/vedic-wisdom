Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
I slightly disagree with your below mail. Without offenc=
e, let me state a few counter point for the sake of a discussion from a non=
-vegetarian's point of view.=C2=A0You said:
=C2=A0
=C2=A1=C2=A7I don=C2=A1=
=C2=A6t wish to stuff my stomach with the body parts of killed
creature. Wo=
uld never think of troubling any leaving creature when
mother-nature has pr=
ovided enough alternate food. 
=C2=A0
Even plants are living. The air we br=
eath is living (organisms). Death is part and parcel of natural law. One ca=
nnot avoid it however much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are heavy on =
non-veg food. The areas where they grew, arid, desert land, you need to hav=
e (at least during those days) animal flesh to survive specially considrein=
g irrigation options were so scanty.=C2=A0If you live in the Artic region, =
you need to have fish oil to survive the cold. The=C2=A0point is, death is =
a part of life. One does not survive without death. That is how the world h=
as been designed by the grand designer.
=C2=A0
What right I have, to snatch=
 away even a single life in
the universe for my selfish reasons. I consider=
 that as very very
cruel and that is the personal thinking why I am a veget=
arian and not
strictly due to any religious or cultural reason=C2=A1=C2=A8
=
=C2=A0
What harm have plants done? Why not the same kind of feeling when it=
 comes to plant life? They too are living beings, just like anything else!
=
=C2=A0
What you consider selfish=C2=A0maybe a law of nature. 
=C2=A0
Please=
 understand I am not advocating non-vegetarianism. But if someone is to do =
serious sadhana, no doubt vegetarian food is best. Otherwise, I am not sure=
 if it makes in any difference at all. 
=C2=A0
-Regards
Rajarshi

Na=
masrte SriRam,
Long back, i had posted the below message on this list.
I've=
 put my argument in the message in which i firmly belive.
Its possible this=
 may change the mind of your friend.
http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=
 wisdom/message/ 411
The exact Argument is given again as under which is th=
e extract from the above message:
[
I couldn=C2=A1=C2=A6t hold back myself =
and honestly explained my
conclusive view point on the whole subject as fol=
low
=C2=A1=C2=A7I don=C2=A1=C2=A6t wish to stuff my stomach with the body p=
arts of killed
creature. Would never think of troubling any leaving creatur=
e when
mother-nature has provided enough alternate food. Just for the sake
=
of filling my stomach or satisfying cravings of my tongue, I won=C2=A1=C2=
=A6t be
responsible for killing innocent birds, animals, fishes directly or=

indirectly. What right I have, to snatch away even a single life in
the un=
iverse for my selfish reasons. I consider that as very very
cruel and that =
is the personal thinking why I am a vegetarian and not
strictly due to any =
religious or cultural reason=C2=A1=C2=A8
]
Even if Shri Krishna has not men=
tioned a direct wording of Non-vegetarian food in Geeta, it is not right to=
 take that excuse for slottering creatures.
I ask any body to think for him=
/her self in the light of what is right and what is not...
Best Regards,
Ut=
