Dear Utpal,
   Namaste. A kind request - please avoid addressing me with "j=
i". I am young in age and experience to be addressed with a ji.

  First le=
t me correct myself. On a second look, my words were not accurate. Supramen=
tal transformation is not purely a spiritual state to be attained. It is an=
 _integral_ state of being where matter / physical reality is transformed t=
o be undistorted expression of the highest consciousness. In that sense, it=
 is not a higher spiritual attainment, but a higher _integral_ attainment, =
where the constantly changing relative reality of matter and material exist=
ence is transformed and the divide between matter and spirit abolished. 

S=
piritually, one can argue that there is no higher spiritual attainment than=
 attaining / merging with Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness which is accomplish=
ed in Nirvikalpa / Sahaja samadhis. 

To go further into this topic, we hav=
e to touch upon the reality of evolution (not just the bodily evolution) bu=
t evolution of consciousness in matter into more and more conscious forms. =
While all Avatara purushas come down from the same source (in a manner of s=
peaking) and the Force behind them is the same, each one comes down for a s=
pecific Mission appropriate for that age and collective consciousness of ea=
rth. For supramental transformation to be accomplished by human beings thei=
r various parts of the being such as mind, intellect, nervous system, etc, =
had to evolve to a certain stage and collective human consciousness had to =
take a giant leap. All the work of past Avatars were towards achieving some=
 of this in some way or other. There is no comparison between Avatars.

Whe=
n we talk about an event yet to happen, we say it is not yet realized on ea=
rth. That does not invalidate all the Giants of the past.

I am sure my exp=
lanation has many holes. If you are really interested in this topic, you ne=
ed to go to the source and read all the masterpieces of Sri Aurobindo and t=
he Mother. His masterpiece, Life Divine is an excellent scripture to unders=
tand this. (Yes, I used the word scripture to describe it, not at all in a =
casual manner though). 

Jai Gurudev!
-Siva.

lpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa=

This is analogous to a person's normal state.

ms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resu=
me what it was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadh=
i and leaving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer sta=
ys in the power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state m=
ay be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for t=
oo long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activi=
ties.

(CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program that accesses a su=
per computer that is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding=
 what this computer should do.

analogy shows how complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous com=
