Shri Narsimha Guruji,

I am not sure, whether I have right to address you a=
s Narsimha Guruji or not ? I donot know whether i have the eligibility to b=
ecome your Shishya also.  Still, i respect you as my Guruji and i am blesse=
d to have found you. I should thank my friend, utpal for this.. 

I need yo=
ur help. Professionally i work for private company in accounts and administ=
ration department since past 20 years. Besides my profession, i am script w=
riter also.. To earn more money, to lead good standard of life and to pay b=
ack my home loans, i have started writing script for Television serial as a=
 part time job. I am doing this script writing work since past 4-5 years. C=
onsidering my creative talents and good language control (not praising myse=
lf)I am getting good assignments of writing TV serials.

All daily soap tel=
evision serials are glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.. enemi=
ties.. Sometimes i am feeling guilty of writing scenes which shows  Conflic=
ts between SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts betwe=
en BROTHER and BROTHER. I am compelled to write harsh dialogues which hurts=
 me sometimes.. 

The formula on which TV serials are now based follow this=
: "More conflicts means more drama and more drama means more TRP(Television=
 rating points)and More TRP means more benefits, more money and popularity =
to the serial".

Guruji, I feel that i am doing wrong by writing serials.. =
I am passing wrong messages to the society.. i feel guilty about it. I am n=
ot in a position to leave this as it gives me more money besides it also gi=
ves me good standard of life and good recognition also.. If i would leave t=
his someone else would do it.. What should i do? I am really confused. If i=
 will leave writing this, i will find more difficult to survive in this wor=
ld with home loan and two small school going children..I need your help

I =
was fortunate to discuss this with utpal. He guided me to write this mail t=
o you.. to seek your guidance..

Waiting anxiously your reply.

Respectful =
regards,

Rajesh
