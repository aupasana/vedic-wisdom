namaste,

Maybe I'm deluding myself, but I see a strong similarity between this mantra
and the savitur gayatri. The words in the first half of this mantra, and the
first two padas of the gayatri have a strong correspondence. It is certainly
a potent mantra which will provide true spiritual upliftment.

Here is a translation based on the commentary of the Rishi Shaunaka -- We
pray to the eye of all three. (i.e. sadAshiva, who is the progenitor of
brahma, vishnu and rudra). He has the sweet fragrance (earned by the punya
of his good works). He nourishes us (by providing us with the shakti that
underlies the entire cosmic creation). (Through his grace,) we are liberated
from death (i.e. samsara, the cycle of life and death) and are lead to
(sAyujya) mokSha, just as the cucumber detaches itself from its plant.

bhavadIyaH,

         ajit
