Subject: DISCOVER THE ACTUAL D=
ATES OF THE LIFETIME OF LORD RAM


Dating the Era of Lord Ram: 
Discover th=
e Actual Dates of the Lifetime of Lord Ram

Excerpts=E2=80=A6(The following=
 document is the  'MOST' authentic scientific work that does
not need furth=
er scientific verification. )
 
The story of Shri Rams' life was first narr=
ated by Maharishi Valmiki in the Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram=
 was crowned as the king of Ayodhya. 

Maharishi Valmiki was a great astron=
omer as he has made sequential astronomical references on important dates r=
elated to the life of Shri Ram indicating the location of planets,
vis-a-vi=
s, zodiac constellations and the other stars (nakshatras) .  Needless to ad=
d that similar position of planets and nakshatras is not repeated in thousa=
nds of years. 

By entering the precise details of the planetary configurat=
ion of the important events in the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki=
 Ramayan in the software named "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of t=
hese events according to the English calendar can be known.

Mr Pushkar Bha=
tnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired this software from the US=
. It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and distance and location =
of other planets from earth. He entered the relevant details about the plan=
etary
positions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and obtained very interesting=
 and convincing results, which almost determine the important dates startin=
g from the birth of Shri Ram to the date of his coming back to Ayodhya afte=
r 14 years of exile.

Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 =
and shloka eight and nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi =
of Chaitra month when the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac co=
nstellations and nakshatras
(visible stars) were:  
a) Sun in Aries;  b) Sa=
turn in Libra;  c) Jupiter in Cancer;  
d) Venus in Pisces;  e) Mars in Cap=
ricorn; f) Lunar month of Chaitra;  g) Ninth day after no moon;  h) Lagna a=
s Cancer (cancer was rising in the east);  i) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini=
 constellation & Pllux star); j) Day time (around noon).
 
This data was fe=
d into the software. The results indicated that this was exactly the locati=
on of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, 5114 BC. Thus Shri Ram was b=
orn on January 10, 5114 BC (7123 years back). 

As per the Indian calendar =
it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month and the time was aro=
und 12 to 1 noon time. This is exactly the time and date when Ram Navmi is =
celebrated all over India.

Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. 

This fact can b=
e ascertained from several books written by Indian and foreign authors befo=
re and after the birth of Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa=
s' Raghuvansam,
Baudh and Jain literature, etc. 

These books have narrated=
 in great detail the location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya whic=
h had many palaces and temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was loca=
ted on the banks of the Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one s=
ide and Mithila on the other side. 

Normally 7,000 years is a very long pe=
riod during which earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change =
the
course of rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories=
. 

Therefore, the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present =
Ayodhya has shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 4=
0 km north/south. Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year =
as per Valmiki Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan (Sidhha=
shram) . 

>From there he went to Mithila, King Janakas' kingdom. Here he ma=
rried Sita after breaking Shiv Dhanusha (bow).

Researchers have gone along=
 the route adopted by Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found=
 23 places which have memorials that commemorate the events related to the =
life of Shri Ram.. These include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhha=
shram, Gautamashram, Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. 

Memorials a=
re built for great men and not for fictitious characters.

Date of exile of=
 Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayans' Ayodhya Kand (2/4/18) that =
Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king because Sun, Mars and Rahu had s=
urrounded his nakshatra and normally under such planetary configuration the=
 king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. 

Dashratha's zodiac sign w=
as Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This planetary configuration was pr=
evailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it was on this day that Shri Ram le=
ft
Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he was 25 years old at that time (5=
114-5089). There are several shlokas in Valmiki Ramayan which indicate that=
 Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left Ayodhya for exile. 

Valmiki Ramaya=
n refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war with Khardushan in later h=
alf of 13th year of Shri Rams' exile. It is also mentioned it was amavasya =
day and Mars was
 in the middle ... When this data was entered, the softwar=
e indicated that there was a solar eclipse on October 7, 5077 BC,
(amavasya=
 day) which could be seen from Panchvati. 

The planetary configuration was=
 also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one side were Venus and Mercury=
 and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. 

On the basis of planetary con=
figurations described in various other chapters, the date on which Ravana w=
as killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and Shri Ram completed 14 ye=
ars of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day was also Navami of Shukla =
Paksha in Chaitra month. 

Thus Shri Ram had come back to Ayodhya at the ag=
e of 39 (5114-5075). 

A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visi=
ted by Shri Ram during his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stat=
ed as visited by Shri Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan; starting from Ayodhya he =
went right upto Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memor=
ials connected to the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life =
of Shri Ram and Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singr=
aur), Bhardwaj Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya As=
hram (Markundi),
Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Si=
ta Sarovar, Ram Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkind=
ha (village Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.

In Valmiki Ramay=
an it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army constructed a bridge over the sea b=
etween Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing this bridge, Shri Rams' army h=
ad defeated Ravana. 

Recently, NASA put pictures on the Internet of a man-=
made bridge, the ruins of which are lying submerged in Palk Strait between =
Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka.

Recently the Sri Lankan Government had expresse=
d the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri Lankans believe =
this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a prisoner (in 5076 BC)=
.

Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh and=
 he was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant partic=
ulars of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written about 80=
 years ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. 

Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana Uni=
versity, in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also liste=
d 63 ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya.

Sri Rams' ancestors hav=
e been traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, King =
Dilip and so on. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Bengal to Gujarat, ev=
erywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Rams' existence, particularl=
y in the tribal areas of Himaachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the North=
-East.

Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas revolve around the =
events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna. The events and places rela=
ted to the life of Shri Ram and Sita are true
cultural and social heritage =
of every Indian irrespective of caste and creed. Therefore, it is common he=
ritage. 

After all, Shri Ram belonged to the period when Prophet Mohammed =
or Jesus Christ were not born and Muslim or Christian faiths were unknown t=
o the world.

The words Hindu (resident of Hindustan) and Indian (resident =
of India) were synonymous. India was also known as Bharat (land of knowledg=
e) and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - deri=
ved from word Indus).

During Ram Rajya (rule), the evils of caste system b=
ased on birth were non-existent. 

In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to =
be of shudra class
(scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adop=
ted daughter after she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his =
ashram as his disciples.. 

We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki wa=
s perhaps
the first great astronomer and that his study of planetary config=
urations has stood the test of times. 

Even the latest computer softwares =
have corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did n=
ot
commit any error. Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe..=


Shri Ram's army, which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by vario=
us tribals from Central and South India. 

The facts, events and all other =
details relating to the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the=
 Indians including scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians,=
 etc.

Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born 2,0=
00 years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram was bor=
n 7,000 years ago. 

Hence, discovering the details relating to Shri Rams' =
life would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, earthquak=
es and invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our ques=
t for learning more about our cultural heritage?

As Indians, let us all ta=
ke pride in the fact that the Indian civilization is the most ancient civil=
isation today. It is certainly more than 10,000 years old. Therefore, let u=
s reject the story of Aryan invasion in India in 1,500 BC as motivated impl=
antation. 

In fact Max Mueller, who was the creator of this theory, had hi=
mself rejected it. 

Let us admit that during the British Rule, we were edu=
cated in the schools based on Macaulay school of thinking which believed th=
at everything Indian was inferior and that entire "Indian literature was no=
t worth even one book rack in England." 

If there were similarities in cer=
tain features of Indian people and people from Central Europe, then automat=
ic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming from Europe invaded India and=
 settled here. No one dared of thinking in any other way.

Therefore, there=
 is urgency for the historians and all other intellectuals to stop reducing=
 Indian history to myth. There is need to gather, dig out, search, unearth =
and analyze all the evidences, which would throw more light on the ancient =
Indian civilization and culture..
