 Lady: Bhagavan! How can one attain the Self?

Bhagavan: Why should you att=
ain the Self?

Lady: For shanti (peace).

Bhagavan: So! Is that it? Then th=
ere is what is called peace, is there?

Lady: Yes! there is.

Bhagavan: All=
 right! And you know that you should attain it. How do you
know? To know th=
at, you must have experienced it at some time or other. It
is only when one=
 knows that sugarcane is sweet, that one wishes to have
some.

Similarly, y=
ou must have experienced peace. You experience it now and then.
Otherwise, =
why this longing for peace? In fact we find every human being is
longing si=
milarly for peace;peace of some kind.

It is therefore obvious that peace i=
s the real thing, the reality; call that
=91shanti=92, =91soul=92, or =91Pa=
ramatma=92 or =91Self =92 =97 whatever you like. We all want
it, don=92t we=
?

Lady: Yes! But how to attain it?

Bhagavan: What you have got is shanti =
itself. What can I say if some one
asks for something which he has already =
got? If it is anything to be brought
from somewhere, effort is required.

T=
he mind with all its activities has come between you and your Self. What
yo=
u have to do now is to get rid of that.

Lady: Is living in seclusion neces=
sary for sadhana, or is it enough if we
merely discard all worldly pleasure=
s? Bhagavan merely answered the second
part of the question by saying, =93r=
enunciation means internal renunciation
and not external,=94 and kept silen=
t.
