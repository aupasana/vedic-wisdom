Dear Members,

Sri Mandeswara (Saniswaraya) Temple is an ancient manument =
in Village
Mandapalli in East Godavari Distt of Andhra Pradesh.It is about =
35 Kms
from Rajamundry on the Vijayawada-Vishakhapattnam route. You are awa=
re
that Saturn is also called Mandi, or Mandachari.  in legends, it is 
kno=
wn as famous Siva Temple, which was built by Saturn. Lord Saturn had
atoned=
 the sin of Brahamhatya by installing and adoring his Ishta, Lord
Shiva. Th=
ere is another legend, which is also popular. When demons were
on the path =
of destruction of devatas, they all pleaded Sage Dadhichi
for help. Sage Da=
dhichi offered the shastras created from his body
bones. But, devatas could=
 not defeat the demons. Then sage Dadhichi
adviced them to approach lord Sa=
turn ,as he was the only capable entity
to use these shastras and kill the =
demons. When approached by devatas,
Saturn expressed his inability, as he w=
as performing Yajna for his ishta
devata, lord Shiva, for atoning  the sin =
of brahamhatya. However, after
forceful pleadings by the all devatas, Satur=
n consented to use the
shastras of the bones of sage Dadhichi and fight dem=
ons, thus leaving 
his yajna . The place where Saturn killed the demons is =
known after the
name of Saturn, Mandapalli.

After the victory Saturn creat=
ed a great temple for his ishta Shiva by
installing a black ahivling,then t=
he temple of Pavatiji was also
installed, followed by temple of Narayana an=
d Nageshwaray. All in the
same premises. Im this temple. the pujaris perfor=
m pooja for removing
the severe effects and Graha dosham of all the planets=
,and mantras are
also addressedd to Saturn to help the devotee to free them=
 from all
obstacles and bad times they are undergoing. This pooja takes abo=
ut 45
minutes. The pooja can also be specific for mahamritunjaya , if one
w=
ants that way. After this, gingelli oil is offered on the Shivlinga
through=
 a long funnel,and obeseience is paid to other deities. After
performing th=
e abhishekam ,the prasad given to the devotee  is Kumkum,
called Sri Ammava=
ri Kumkum.

I was undergoing very severe period in my life from 2004 onward=
s, and I
had done all the upayas, whatever I could do to the best of my
kno=
wledge,but of no avail. Guru Rafal Ji is in knw of the things. Even I
had s=
topped my astrology work. Then all of a sudden I just read about
this templ=
e in an article, and I simply proceeded to Rajamundry and
visited the templ=
e. AQfter my return, within 3 months my peace of mind
started returning, he=
alth improved, astrology centre started re-working
with more devotion and i=
nner energy. As a gratitude I again visited the
great temple in November, f=
or thanks giving, and now I feel greatly
energised and happy and satisfied.=
 It has been really a great
experience, after visiting almost all the know =
temples and places of
worship in the country during past 20 years.

The puj=
aris there are not at all greeedy or flece anyone. The samagri
costs Rs.40/=
- and you can give any amount to the pujari who performs
special pooja anyt=
hing between Rs.150 or more,as per your choice.
Offering to all deities are=
 normally done in cash to help the upkeep of
the temple, and pujaris in 4 t=
emples do not look askance at the devotee
for money. Great expereince indee=
d, when all other methods fail and
hopes are faded and one is on the verge =
of collapsing, a visit to Sri
Mandeswara (Saneswara) Swamy temple is a grea=
t blessings for all of us
who have lost hopes in life.

With my best wishes=
 to all members and especially to those for whom
nothing seems to be workin=
g right ! It is just the question of good
faith in His powers.
