Namaste Narasimhaji,
The episode of=A0 astral flight of the saadhaka and bu=
rnt coconut pieces over the ashes in the Homa kundam is both fascinating (t=
o the neophytes like me) and inspiring, at once.
My query is : can one imag=

ot performed !?!

Pranaamas !

=A0
This somehow reminds of a question posed=
 by Balaram Basu to 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakrishna's di=
vine vision, Balaram Basu 
belonged in a previous birth to the inner circle=
 of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! 
Balaram Basu was very devout and pious, did many=
 
austerities and spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from his ho=
metown 
of Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.
=A0
Wh=
en he met Ramakrishna for the first time, he sat 
in a corner and listened =
to Ramakrishna's words. When other people in the room 
left, Ramakrishna tu=
rned to Balaram and asked him, "Is there anything you want 
to ask me?"
=A0=

Balaram asked, "Yes, sir. Does God really exist?" 
Ramakrishna answered, "=
Certainly He does." Balaram asked, "Can a person see Him?"
=A0
Ramakrishna =
said, "Yes, He reveals Himself to the 
devotee who thinks of Him as his nea=
rest and dearest. Because you do not get any 
response by praying to Him on=
ce, you must not conclude that He does not 
exist."
=A0
Balaram asked, "But=
 why can't I see Him when I pray 
to Him so much?"
=A0
Ramakrishna smiled a=
nd asked, "Do you really 
consider Him to be as dear to your heart as your =
own children?"
=A0
"No, sir", Balaram candidly answered, "I never felt 
tha=
t strongly for Him."
=A0
Ramakrishna then said in a sweet, convincing voice=
: 
"Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer than your own self. Truly I tell=
 you, He 
is extremely fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself t=
o them. He 
comes to a person even before He is sought. If a person comes o=
ne step towards 
God, God comes ten steps towards that person. There is non=
e more intimate and 
more affectionate than God."
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As Ramakrishna once said, one needs to th=
ink of god 
more than one thinks about parents, wife, children and about on=
eself, all put 
together. Try to do that. Then you will find the answer to =
your question 
yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The proof of the =
pudding is in *your* 
eating it. If somebody else tells you that the puddin=
g exists and one can eat 
it, that information has very limited use. In ord=
er to convince yourself fully, 
you need to taste the pudding yourself!
=A0=

Though all gods and their stories are maya from a 
strictly vedantic point=
 of view, they are as much real as your own mind. If your 
mind is real, al=
l gods and their stories are real. When mind is in various 
planes of aware=
ness, it is possible for the mind to become aware of gods and 
their plays.=

In this context, =
I want to mention a small story. 
Manish was approached by a Christian miss=
ionary in UK once. He asked Manish if 
he was a Hindu. Then he told Manish =
about how Jesus Christ is the son of the 
real god, how Hindus are praying =
to unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and 
how followers of Jesus Chris=
t will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person, 
"have you seen god or Je=
sus Christ". The person was perplexed and said no. 
Manish asked him "how d=
o you then know that what you say is true? Are you sure 
that you guys have=
 understood Jesus Christ correctly and not misrepresenting his 
teachings n=
ow?" Then he=A0mentioned calmly and confidently,=A0"Actually, I 
have seen =
Jesus Christ. If you want, I can show him to you too. Do you 
want to see h=
im?" The missionary looked at him like a crazy person and simply 
ran away.=

=A0
See, one who is waxing eloquent about real god, son 
of god and heaven=
 does not even think that it is possible for someone 
to see Jesus Christ. =
When he was told that somebody saw Jesus and asked if he 
was interested in=
 seeing, he thought the other person must be crazy and 
just=A0ran away! He=
 wasn't even curious to pursue further and see what the 
other person was u=
pto. He simply concluded the other person is 
crazy!
=A0
People these days,=
 in many religions, have no 
faith. Even things that are quite=A0possible s=
eem impossible to people of 
this age.

Those who have seen the movie "Lage Raho Munnabhai" 
=
may recall how Sanjay Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and he=
ars 
Gandhi while others cannot. It is concluded at the end that the vision=
s of 
Gandhi were hallucinations caused by the attachment of the stressed o=
ut mind to 
Gandhi and resulting chemical imbalance in the brain.
=A0
Loose=
ly speaking, one may say that seeing gods is 
similar. But the difference i=

big difference, see the exam=

God can=
 be experienced as light, as sound or as a 
specific form similar to a huma=

was experienced as sound. I=

I will give another similar example. One person who 
does Chandi homam =
everyday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri 
Rama Navami =
morning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some 
preparati=
ons for the next day's homam (like he would do every night) and laid 
out s=
ome dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day's burnt 
as=
hes,=A0for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. In the=
 
middle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his body lying on the=
 bed. 
He then became aware of the homa kundam which was a few feet away on=
 another 
floor. It felt like his body and homa kundam were linked. Then it=
 felt like 
suddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, at the same time, h=
is energy rose. 
As soon as that happened, he lost regular awareness of his=
 body. He no 
longer felt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He=
 first felt like he 
lied with head down and legs up and then he became abs=
olutely weightless. Then 
he felt like he was a small point, a small partic=
le. It felt like Lord Hanuman 
pulled him up and he went very fast into a r=
egion filled with bright light. He 
was a weightless particle floating in t=
hat light along with Lord Hanuman and 
nobody else. He, the small particle,=
=A0started praying to Lord Hanuman and 
remained in a blissful state for a =
while.
=A0
Suddenly, from somewhere, a thought came about his 
body being i=
n a bedroom and fire in homa kundam. He wondered, "was there fire in 
homa =
kundam really?" This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness 
(i=
.e.. being aware of self as a body) returned.
=A0
The interesting thing is =
this. When he went to his 
homa kundam to do homam next morning, he saw tha=
t the dried coconut pieces 
placed there on the ashes=A0previous night were=
 burnt and completely black. 
It means there was indeed a fire in the homa =
kundam. He used the same 
procedure everyday and placed coconut pieces on t=
he ashes for the next day's 
homam before sleeping, but such a thing never =
happened. Basically, there must 
have been some ember left still from the p=
revious morning, though he did not see 
any ember in the night and thought =
the fire went out completely. For some 
reason, that unseen ember started u=
p a small fire in the night and the coconut 
pieces caught fire. Though the=
re is no way to know when that happened, it is 
consistent with what he fel=
t during the mystical experience! After daily homam 
for a long time, a rel=
ationship formed between him and the homa kundam. 
Moreover, the ember left=
 in homa kundam continued to be linked to his internal 
fire and developmen=
ts related to it still affected his internal fire and 
consciousness!
=A0
W=
hen you do homam for a long time with the mental 
visualization linking tha=
t external fire to your internal fire, the relationship 
is formed over the=
 time! What happens in that external fire does then 
affect your consciousn=
ess. Even if the fire goes and ember is left buried under 
the ash, that em=
ber is still linked to your internal fire!! When something 
happens in your=
 internal fire, the same thing happens to the ember too. And vice 
versa.

=A0
Dear Utpal, one ca=
n see God for sure. One can 
experience God in many forms. One can see god =
externally, in a limited form like 
a human form. One can see god internall=
y, when shakti (energy of self-awareness) 
rises to a specific place and be=
comes aware of beings in that place. One can 
experience god as an all-perv=
ading light or sound and experience oneself as a 
small part of that light =
or sound. There are many ways to perceive god, but the 
bottomline is that =
god does exist and one can perceive god. I 
cannot show you god, but I can =
guarantee you that god exists and can be 
perceived in various forms.
=A0
D=
o homam everyday with sincerity. That will burn 
the blocking karmas. Event=
ually you will be able to love god more than anything, 
including yourself.=
 That is when the final screen will start to disappear. 
Nothing can be a s=
ubstitute for spiritual sadhana.
=A0
Best

Narasimha

        Namaste Utpalji
        =A0
        I have had th=
e same experiences. Most of our puranic stories are 
        made fun of by=
 others. 

Well in most of the cases these questions 
        are of malici=
ous intent, those don't bother me much, but at some point 
        someone =
ask's these questions genuinely.
        =A0
        I tried reading differ=
ent opinions of different respected saints 
        and I found one explana=
tion in the introuductory chapters on Sri 
        Aurobindo's "Secrets of =
the Vedas".
        =A0
        He opines indirectly that the Puranas are d=
efinitely a toned down 
        version of what used to be the Vedic knowle=
dge. This was made this way 
        for the oridinary people to understand=
 and not leave the folds of 
        Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism=
. That is why not only these 
        stories were "made" which were based =
on deeper spiritual symbolism 
        generated from the Vedas but even th=
e lagugae was modified and made 
        easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas =
is different from the sanskrit of the 
        puranic age.
        =A0
   =
     The reason Buddism could become such a threat to Hinduism was 
       =
 because the people (priests)=A0had reducded the Vedas to a book of 
      =
  mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the priests 
=
        took over the religion from the sages/mystics and 
        reduced/=
neglected/forgot the internal and=A0relied solely on the 
        external.=
 That is why Buddha rejected the Vedas.
        Infact as per Sri Aurobindo=
, the comng of Buddha was a wrong step 
        in the cycle of evolution. =
He is not the next automatic choice after 
        Krishna and that, Kalki =
will recitify the mistake of Buddha.. However, 
        the coming of Buddh=
a was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall 
        spiritual evo=
lution of this world by increasing the distance between God 
        and ma=
n. 
        =A0
        So essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comem=
rcial Bollywood 
        movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art=
 films.
        =A0
        My personal take on this: As far as they are ab=
le to induce 
        spirituality in an very average ordinary person from =
a village they are 
        excellent. But at the same time, if a Hindu who=
 is not aware of the 
        comprehensive nature of his own scriptures, a=
 poor, uneducated 
        man,=A0is told that his idols are mere stones an=
d his stories are 
        cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily mu=
ch beyond all this, the 
        idea of a single God, would be enough reas=
on to make him switch 
        religions. It would sound very logical to hi=
m. Infact, this is how it 
        often happens.
        =A0
        Solut=

          Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,

Raj=
arshi's question 
          was in some aspect similar to one question i wa=
s asked about a month 
          ago. while traveling back to home from off=
ice, one person asked me 
          that what is these stories of our Gods =
such as Ganapati and his story 
          of being Shiva's son and cutting =
of head and replaced by elephant head 
          etc...
Stories of Vishnu a=
nd like wise many gods and goddesses. The 
          person told me that pe=
ople from other make fun about all these various 
          gods and their =
*mythological* events which is recorded in our 
          Shastras.

I wish=
 to ask here a nagging question. what is the 
          truth. for instance=
, did Ganapati and shiva's episode actually happen? 
          Stories in D=
evi Mahatmay are true?. Episode of Daksh Yagya and Uma's 
          self ki=
lling in yagya vedi out of anger and origin of Shakti pithas 
          are=
 true?

Stories of Indra and other many gods and goddesses 
          are t=
rue?

Do they really exist? (Even if at the different plane 
          of e=
xistence) or the people who criticize are right when they say that 
       =
   yours is a full of stories which are only mythological and you pray 
   =
       those imaginary Gods which are nothing but characters of Stories of =

          some writer.

I could not answer the question as i was not 
    =
      sure.

Spiritually yours,

Utpal

has "I" as the subject and one is talking about how one

ightly different. Thus, children speaking different languages may 
        =
  visualize something slightly different as their understanding of the 
   =
       languages improves. However, these differences are minor. As one 
  =
        delves deeper, the basic emotions associated with these different

          expressions is the same in different languages and one will feel =
those

immeidate 
          visualization of an expression in the mind of a child =
may change based 
          on cultural context and grammar that one is exp=

 about some of

some 
preparations for the next day's homam (like he would do every night) =

a few feet away on another 
floor. It felt like his body and homa kundam we=

suddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, a=

As soon as that happened, he lost <em>re=

longer felt his body or homa kunda=
m or energy in the body. He first felt like he 
lied with head down and leg=

he felt like he was a =
small point, a small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman 
pulled him up and=
 he went very fast into a region filled with bright light. He

he saw that the dried coconut pieces 
placed there on the ashes previo=

It means there <em>was</em> inde=
ed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same 
procedure everyday and plac=

homam before sleeping, b=
ut such a thing never happened. Basically, there must 
have been some ember=
 left still from the previous morning, though he did not see 
any ember in =
the night and thought the fire went out completely. For some 
reason, that =
unseen ember started up a small fire in the night and the coconut

aught fire. Though there is no way to know when that happened, it is 
consi=

=
for a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam.

        <div>I tried reading different opinions of different respecte=

        <div><f=
ont size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial"></font> </div>
        <div>He opines in=
directly that the Puranas are definitely a toned down 
        version of w=
hat used to be the Vedic knowledge. This was made this way 
        for the=
 oridinary people to understand and not leave the folds of 
        Hinduis=
m. The threat then was Buddhism. That is why not only these 
        storie=
s were "made" which were based on deeper spiritual symbolism 
        gener=
ated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and made 
        eas=
ier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskrit of the 
     =
   puranic age.</div>
        <div><font size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial"></font>&=
nbsp;</div>
        <div>The reason Buddism could become such a threat to H=
induism was 
        because the people (priests) had reducded the Ved=
as to a book of 
        mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and exte=
rnal, but the priests 
        took over the religion from the sages/mystic=
s and 
        reduced/neglected/forgot the internal and relied solely=
 on the 
        external. That is why Buddha rejected the Vedas.</div>
   =
     <div>Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was a wrong step=
 
        in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice af=
ter 
        Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. H=
owever, 
        the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to haste=
n the overall 
        spiritual evolution of this world by increasing the =
distance between God 
        and man. </div>
        <div><font size=3D"2"=
 face=3D"Arial"></font> </div>
        <div>So essentially, the Purans=
 were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood 
        movies as compared to the=
 Vedas which were the Art films.</div>
        <div><font size=3D"2" face=
=3D"Arial"></font> </div>
        <div>My personal take on this: As fa=
r as they are able to induce 
        spirituality in an very average ordin=
ary person from a village they are 
        excellent. But at the same time=
, if a Hindu who is not aware of the 
        comprehensive nature of his o=
wn scriptures, a poor, uneducated 
        man, is told that his idols=
 are mere stones and his stories are 
        cock and bull whereas God mus=
t be necessarily much beyond all this, the 
        idea of a single God, w=
ould be enough reason to make him switch 
        religions.. It would soun=
d very logical to him. Infact, this is how it 
        often happens.</div>=

        <div><font size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial"></font> </div>
        <=
div>Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to learn our
