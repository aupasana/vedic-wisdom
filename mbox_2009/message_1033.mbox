Hi,

Please forgive me as my views differ on this subject.
Religion is to =
be kept separate from state. I am sure we never aspired
to be a country lik=
e our neighbor Pakistan or Iran or Vatican.

Job of government is to mainta=
in order and provide equal opportunities
for all. Religion is to provide sp=
iritual Guidance. We don't want to
mix path of spirituality with lure of po=
wer. It will corrupt both, the
religion and the politics. They are better s=
eparate.

Regards.
