Dear Shri Narasimha:

Can you shed some light on you personally balanced yo=
ur
family life and your spiritual endeavors? 
How do you manage your profes=
sional
life (software engineering?), family responsibilities (children)
etc=
 as well as find time for homam/meditation etc. 
Are you still working full=
-time as an engineer?
I hope this is not a very personal question.

A regul=
ar hectic life in any modern city (Boston or Bangalore)
seems to consume th=
e physical energy of a person, and I find that
there is about an hour's wor=
th of time for any prayer. Of course
we can continue to think about god and=
 redirect our attitude
through out the day, but there still is only a limit=
ed time
for focused work like a homam or japam etc. 

Thanks and Regards.
