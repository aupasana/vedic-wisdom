Om Namo Bhagavate Venkateshaya

Dear Narasimhaji, Namaskar,

This is regard=
ing a question I have about the tarpanam procedure. I stay in a single room=
 accomodation (1 room and kitchen). Is it fine for me to follow the Tarpana=
m procedure in this room itself? I actually do not have access to any other=
 private place. I intend to start this procedure during this Mahalaya Paksh=
am.

Also, it would be great if you could kindly throw some light on other =
favourable/auspicious activities during this period which would appease the=
 Pitris. 

Apologies if these questions have already been asked. Awaiting y=
our kind guidance.

Warm Regards,
Ramesh M
