Hello, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Thanks. When I was very young I found t=
his shloka in Kalyan, and used to recite it a lot. I was able to pass my sc=
hool exams. Then after few months I had to come to London and my life chang=
ed completely. And I lost the plot.

Several years later I was living in a =
ashram in Vrajbhoomi and the next door Swamiji who was nearly 100 had a ver=
y powerful Lord Sri Hayagreavji in Shaligram. Swamiji wanted to make me his=
 chela and give the ashram to me. But I refused both.

=A0Then certain thin=
gs happened where I was living and I had to move with Swamiji. In a way wit=
h Lord. Then again I had to leave that place after some months and come bac=
k to London

In last few years I tried few times to start the worship of Lo=
rd Sri Hayagreavji=A0 for knowledge/vidya but each time I was blocked. So I=
 thought Mother knows best and so stopped
.Although there was this question=
 in my mind why Loving Lord is unhappy with me , what mistake I have made.
=

Composing this letter I suddenly realised that each time I do the intense =
worship of Lord there is very big change in life and perhaps it is not a ti=
me to do it.
Another problem solved.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Namaste,
 
Yes, this =
is not a Saraswati mantra, but Hayagreeva mantra. Hayagreeva is a horse-hea=
ded form of Vishnu who gives higher learning.
 
When Vijay was doing akshar=
abhyasam to his daughter, I had suggested making offerings to five deities =
representing five aspects of learning corresponding to five elements - Gana=
pathi, Saraswati, Medha Devi (deity of intelligence), Medha Dakshinamurthy =
(teacher form of Shiva) and Hayagreeva. While there are various mantras for=
 each (e.g. Medha sooktam for Medha Devi), the following are simple naama m=
antras.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
