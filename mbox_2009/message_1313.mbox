Namaste,
 
Rudras are realized beings who act as the agents of Karmaphala. =
Rudra is depicted as a bowman who shoots arrows, which are metaphors of kar=
maphala (fruits of actions).
 
Yoginis and Bhairavas represent various kind=
s of experiences in the sookshma sareera. There are many Yoginis and Bhaira=
vas, but 64 of them are considered primary. Yoginis are attendants of the d=
ivine Mother. These are the experiences surrounding self-consciousness. Yog=
inis represent Shakti and Bhairavas represent Purusha.
 
At the low level, =
Bhairavas are personifications of various subtle experiences. At the highes=
t level, Yoginis and Bhairavas are personifications of observing various su=
btle experiences. Yoginis personify the observation and Bhairavas the obser=
ver.
 
A fully realized person is neither attracted to nor repelled by any =
experience. As various experiences come, one simply observes. Bhairava is a=
n observer of various experiences within.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Namaste,

          In =
some quarters, there is a view that only abhishekam (bathing) is 
         =
 advisable for Rudra and not homam (fire worship). They think that Rudra is=
 
          full of fire and fire worship increases the fire and bathing co=
ols down the 
          fire.

          However, any deity can be called i=
n fire, even fiery deities. There is no 
          harm in calling a fiery =
planet like Mars or Sun in fire and doing homam with 
          their mantr=
as, as suggested by Maharshi Parasara (father of Vyasa). Also, 
          R=
udra homam is done at many temples. Traditionally, homam is done with 
    =
      1/10th of the count of Rudrabhishekam.

          Rudra is like a bow=
man who releases the fruits of your karmas like an arrow. 
          Homam =
really accelerates this. Moreover, Rudra namakam is a long veda mantra 
   =
       and it is nearly impossible for most of us to pronounce it correctly=
. Just 
          like Chandi homam, one should do Rudra homam if one is su=
rrendered to the 
          Lord and prepared to face the music for ANY kar=
mas done before and be done 
          with them. Of course, after a few pa=
inful blocking karmas are gotten over 
          with, one can make tremend=
ous spiritual progress. But, if one wants to go 
          slowly, I sugges=
t that Chandi homam and Rudra homam are not for that person.

          I w=
anted to distribute a manual for a Shiva homam with simple Shiva mantras. 
=
          But, somehow, the inspiration from inside has not come yet and it=
 has not 
          happened.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha
