This is a fantastic movement, where now they have 
do=

body.

Can=
 you kindly elaborate a bit more on this? Or if there is any link for the s=
ame. I am really interested to know more. Specially if there is any scienti=
fic angle to this.

Namaste Utpal

Very good post ...

There have always been some big pr=
oponents of Homan and Agni pooja.
Pandit Shree Ram Sharma of Gayatri pariva=
ar started it in a big way 
many decades ago. This is a fantastic movement,=
 where now they have 
done research on homan etc and the effects on the env=
ironment and 
body.

In Maharastra, followers of dattatreya had a simple ag=
nihotra process
of using cow dunk and ghee and cotton bud. I think this was=
 Gajanan 
Maharaj, I may have the wrong name, but they are very authentic
D=
atta followers and that lineage.

In the south also Swami Ganapati Sachidan=
andji again a Datta Avatar 
has been doing homans for many decades.

There =
may be more involved in Homam for many decades too, I am sure 
many people =
can add to this list.

I wanted to do homan for a long time but I had no cl=
ue and some 
months back I saw Narashima's manual and I did a few myself to=
o.

Best Regards
Mitesh
