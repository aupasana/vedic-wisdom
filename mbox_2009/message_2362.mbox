Actually, a woman's prana shakti is much stronger during her time of menses.
If a woman does manasika japa during this time, it is multiple orders more
powerful. In certain paths of sadhana (Matangi worship, for example), woman
is at her most auspicious when she is menstruating. So to compare this state
to a person being smelly or sweaty is, I think, a mischaracterization.

Yes, there are elements of ritual impurity. But it is also true that the
time of menstruation is a time ofi inner purification and cleansing (on a
physicial and spiritual level) for women that men (unfortunately for them)
do not have access to. In a way, external sadhana is required for men to
obtain the fruits of the automatic purification women attain through
menstruation.

That is another reason why women are advised to take complete rest during
their menses--not that they're going to contaminate everything around them,
but the process of cleansing going on within is a subtle and sensitive
process that is optimized when a woman can fully rest.

Also, a woman's work never ends, so this practice is a way of ensuring women
get their much needed rest, including rest from sadhana.

I just wanted to add this, because I think sometimes women get the wrong
impression that they are somehow debased or otherwise inauspicious during
their time of menstruation and therefore kept away fromthe privilege of
doing worship. But that is a very crude view and I think the more nuanced
understanding that our ancient rishis (and yoginis) had was that this is a
special time for women when external sadhana is not required since internal
cleansing is going on and a time when her energies and kundalini are
naturally sensitized and heightened, so special care should be taken.

Also, there is no restriction on doing manasika japa (without moving the
lips) for a woman during this time.
