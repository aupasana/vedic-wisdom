Dear Kishnendu,

I beg pardon for my reply to your message addressed to Siv=
a.

> One more thing friend spirituality is not a subject of debate or >dis=
cussion but OF REALISATION as i feel.

It is not inappropriate to debate an=
d discuss even in the matter of Spirituality occasionally. Realization may =
be the final thing but on the way, the journey is invariably subjected to m=
any such things like intellectual debate, discussions, various sadhanaas et=
c... Adi Shankaracharya and Swami Vivekananda, for instance, debated a lot =
on the subject.

>If you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONLY=
 and ONLY >your GURU.

That unshakable and blind faith without complete und=
erstanding of GURU's motives or anybody or any book or anything is NO FAITH=
 really but source of the mass production of Fanatics. The real faith also =
needs to be earned after a lot of struggle.
 
Swami Vivekananda has said in=
 one of his works which means that in every sect, immature Bhaktas are the =
real recruit which can be easily molded in to the fanaticism.

I know one s=
uch Fanatic. He said that so and so person was saved in the Mumbai Train Bl=
ast even when he was in the same train because he was a devotee of Art of L=
iving. The others died......

I know another fanatic who says that Krishna =
is the only supreme God and if somebody is praying to Shiva, he is ignorant=
 and fool. He must pray directly to the supreme God and not the lesser Gods=
.....

Another class of Fanatics believes in total that all the others who =
don't believe in Islam will go to hell....and same class in another faith b=
elieves that Jesus is the ONLY savior. 

And the Joke is that they are all =
so called Faithful (Actually it's an abuse to the real meaning of Faith).

=
Best Regards,

Utpal

  Very good question. In fact, this is a question that was raised by discip=

, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has co=

et me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fu=

guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to=
 be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself=
 had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other w=
ays. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is=
 essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri's elaborate =
and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guid=
e disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be est=
ablished.

s courses: AOL is world's largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL t=

proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of t=

either needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have =

Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to=

 1) Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to fol=
low the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri's guidance that no deservi=
ng person should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a=
 volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first han=
d many cases where people took courses for free and were also provided free=
 accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go the=
re paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and pr=
ovide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of i=
t.
> > > > > > > 
> > > > > > > 2) This is my understanding and not AOl pos=
ition. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who st=
ill may have some doership in them.

ri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the =
love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a =
