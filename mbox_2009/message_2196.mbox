Hi,
=A0
This is indeed very interesting.=A0I have one more question for you=
 Narayanji. Do you do homa with wood or coconut? If you are doing it with w=
ood, then initially when the Chandi homas took 4 hours, how did you keep th=
e fire going continuously?
=A0
Did you play the CD and keep practicing the =
Chandi with it, or you played it while doing the homam and pronounced it al=
ong with hearnig it?
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi



The upsurge (of consciousn=
ess) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste Rajarshi ji & Friends=
,

Thats nice. All the best!

One more thing, I don't know to read tamil/ma=
layalam (mother tongue) script, and very shaky with Devanagari script and h=
ence it's a chore for me. I am sure most members are well versed with their=
 mother tongue and will be able to read it fluently and in a shorter time t=
han mine.

Regards
Narayan
