D=
ear Narasimha,

I was thinking in the same line as Rajarshi has expressed i=
n the below message about Sain Baba. In the morning when i saw your message=
, first thing came to my mind is that How much influence Sain baba or Kabir=
 has on Muslims today? Immediately Shirdi temple and long queue came to my =
imagination and can we find any Muslims there?

The fact remains that be it=
 Sain Baba or Kabir or another saint, unifying effect is only on Hindus and=
 their followers today are also only those.

>>>It was heartening to me whe=
n I saw it. I saw a ray of hope<<<

Honestly, I am not very excited with th=
is.

The Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentioned are true. and tho=
se are the very reasons which prevents even the broad minded Islamic indivi=
dual to succumb finally.

In my opinion, it requires a radical force from w=
ithin the followers of Islam itself which can change their outlook for good=
.

Best Regards,

Utpal

Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C3=83=E2=80=9A to be a branch of Isl=

=80=9E=C3=82=C2=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realization was qui=

      <p>Dear Narasimha,<br>
<br>
I was thinking in the same line =
as Rajarshi has expressed in the below message about Sain Baba. In the morn=
ing when i saw your message, first thing came to my mind is that How much i=
nfluence Sain baba or Kabir has on Muslims today? Immediately Shirdi temple=
 and long queue came to my imagination and can we find any Muslims there?<b=
r>
<br>
The fact remains that be it Sain Baba or Kabir or another saint, un=
ifying effect is only on Hindus and their followers today are also only tho=
se.<br>
<br>
>>>It was heartening to me when I saw it. I saw a ray=
 of hope<<<<br>
<br>
Honestly, I am not very excited with this.<br=
>
<br>
The Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentioned are true. and t=
hose are the very reasons which prevents even the broad minded Islamic indi=
vidual to succumb finally.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it requires a radical fo=
rce from within the followers of Islam itself which can change their outloo=
k for good.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
Utpal<br>

 It is also true that Sai Baba did a lot for unifying the communities. Howe=

 the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=83=E2=80=9A Shams-e-Tabri=

that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and as=

 Allah, wake up!". But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothi=
ng happened. Finally he said, "In my name, wake up!" and the dead body woke=
 up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot inv=
oke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.<=

 And I do not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths wi=
