Girish ji,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I was born and raised in the U.S=
. and my faith in Sanatan Dharma becomes refreshed frequently.
If you can't=
 identify which saligrams you have, still worship them and meditate, if you=
 are doing something right you will know.
I have a video on youtube, search=
 "saligram puja" and it should be one of the first ones.
Days you don't hav=
e time for abhishekam and tulsi replacing, just read dhyanam shloka and say=
 Om Namo Bhagvate Vasudevaya 9 times, if you have more time say the Hare Kr=
ishna maha mantra 7 times or more as well.


Hope this helps.

Chetan

=C2=A0 
Namaste Narshima Guruji,

I staying un=
 Mumbai and many doubts on Hindu religious rituals.

I will ask one by one =
question and request you to clarify.

The question is:

" I have 2 shaligra=
m which I inhertited from my Father. Further I had read that it is inauspic=
iuos to have 2 shligrams or odd nos. So I purchased 2 more from Swami Chinn=
mayanad Ashram in Mumbai. 

Now how to indentify that the one inherited is =
which type and one purchased is which type ?

How to mainatin the same and =
perform the pooja and at what frequency ?

Best Regards
