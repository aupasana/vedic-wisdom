Namaste Narasimha Guruji,

Thank you for your MahaGanapati homam procedure document.

I would really appreciate if you could kindly help answer these  
queries:-


1.	I realised while performing the homam for the first time today,  
that I have yet to obtain your permission and blessings to name you as  
my guru. I would really
	appreciate if you could kindly grant me your permission and blessings.

2.	You mentioned that the Ganapati idol has to be placed on the East  
side of the homam kundam. I also noticed the same in your video.
	My homam kundam is slightly bigger at 15 inches square. Thus if I  
place the idol on the East side, I find it difficult to offer the  
items during the pooja.
	Is it aright to place the idol nearer, i.e. on the South-West or  
North-West corner so that it is easily accessible?

3.	What is the significance of offering the doership of the homam to  
Lord Krishna at the end?
	The homam was offered with the intention of spiritual cleansing and  
upliftment. I am sure Lord Krishna does not require spiritual  
cleansing and upliftment.
	So what then is the significance of offering the doership to Lord  
Krishna?

4.	My knowledge of Sanskrit is very basic and thus my pronunciation  
requires my improvement. I am really worried that my pronunciation of  
the mantras may be wrong
	in many places. While I try my best to listen to your video and  
learn, I realise that this is a long process.

	I do realise  that you had provided a very short procedure requiring  
very little mantras. However I find that my knowledge  is somewhere in  
between your 2 procedures.
	
	Would I be committing any grave mistakes and thus offending the  
deities and Agni?
	


Thank you.


Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

Warmest Regards,
Narayanan
