Astro Therapy For Saturn

Fasting on Saturdays
Worshipping the Tutelary Deity (Kula Devata) on Saturdays
Wearing Blue Sapphire on a Shukla Paksha Saturday
Lighting an ellunthiri at Lord Ayyappa temple on Saturdays
Wearing a Sastha Yantra
Wearing a Saturn Astral Talisman /Reciting the Mantra of Saturn
on Saturdays 

Reading the Holy Book ( Devi Mahatmyam ) on Saturdays & performing a Saturn Havan are some of the remedial measures recommended

Sastha Yantra is said to be Ideal in warding off the malevolent rays of radical Saturn. 


Fasting - Not only spiritually but medically recommended 
Naturopathy averrs that Fasting is the best Medicine ( Lankhanam Paramoushadham ). According to Ayurveda, the Annarasa in the body, during fasting, is converted into the Seven Gross Dhathus ( the seven tissue-elements). One of the Fivefold Worship in Naturopathy is Akashopasana, which is fasting. We overeat everyday with the result the digestive system has no rest. During fasting, the digestive system gets absolute rest. Overeating has been identified by Naturopathy as the main cause of disease. 

Vara Puja

Vara Puja is said to be the most effective remedy in Vedic Astrology.

On the day of the problem causing planet that planet is to be propitiated.

As Saturn is the problem causer
Saturday is the day where the Deity of Saturn - ( Lord Ayyappa )
The Yantra of Saturn - ( Shaneeswara Yantra )
Tthe Mantra of Saturn - ( Om Hreem Sanaischarai Namah),
The Holy Book of Saturn - ( Devi Mahatmyam) &
The Gemstone of Saturn - ( Blue Sapphire)

are to be propitiated.

Saturn Mantra 
Om Shanaishcharayai Namah 
Saturn Stotra

Neelanjana Samabhasam
Raviputram Yamagrajam
Chaya Marthanda Sambhootham
Tham Namami Sanaiswaram

O Son of the Sun and the Imparter of Patience and Perseverance. I
bow down to Thee !

Saturn Gayatri

Om Kakadwajaya Vidmahe Khadga Hastaya Deemahi.
Thanno Manda Prachodayath.

Maha Mrithyunjaya Mantra

This mantra is heavily used to ward off Saturn's attacks and is heavily used during the malevolent Elarata Saturnine phase.

Om Thrayambakam Yajamahe Sugandhim Pushtivardhanam
Oorvarukamiva Bandhanan Mruthyor Muksheeyu Mamrithath 
Saturn Peeda Hara Sthothra

Soorya Putro Deergha Deho

Vishalaksha Siva Priyah

Mandachara Prasannatma

Peedam Harathu Me Shanih

Chanting it 108 times is said to reduce Saturnine maleficence. 

Chanting Mantras needs the utmost purity of Body, Mind and Soul. This is difficult to achieve during the Dark Age ( Kali Yuga ).Hence wearing of the appropriate Yantra is recommended as we cannot keep up the purity of Body, Mind & Self. 


The Yantra is a silver or gold plate wherein the Mantra is inscribed and given after 10 days Puja by learned Brahmin scholars, who impart it with the necessary Pranic ( Positive ) Energy. 

Wearing a Blue Sapphire is another remedy. Listening to Navagraha Shanti Mantras cassette, particularly the mantras of Saturn is another astrotherapeutic measure. 

Sometimes, even Yantra may not be enough. If the affliction is severe, one has to go beyond Mantra and Yantra and go in for Havans. Mahamrityunjaya Havan and Saneeswara Havans are the 2 major Havans which are performed to offest the maleficence of Elarata Saturn. It has to be done with diligence, by bona fide Tantriks who have dedicated their life to Tantra and spirituality.

  Dear Narsimha guru, 
  Please let me know which mantra to chant for the recent nov-11, Shani transit for Karkataka, Mesha and Tula raashi and how to go about this.

  We say the ganesh shloka, hanuman chalisa and gayatri mantra on a daily basis as a part of our prayers, any other helpful advice for this transit? 

  Sincerely,
  Priya

When Saturn transits the Lunar Ist ( the First Sign from one's Moon Sign), the 12th & the 2nd, Elarata Saturn is caused. 

This is the most dreaded phase in one's life. 

Elarata Saturn manifests as vicious attacks on health and wealth. You will be subject to trouble through enemies and will suffer calumny. Health hazards manifest.

Dissipation of wealth indicated. ( Kurvanthi Pranasandeham Sthanabramsam Dhanakshayam ).

Your mind becomes a melting pot of mental turmoil. Saturn creates wilderness in the psyche, making you desperate at times. You may not get even proper rest. 

Problems surface like a ten-headed Hydra. Once you try to solve one problem, another takes its place.

Mental peace and happiness make a strategic retreat. Saturn will bend you, not break you.

The Western scholars defined Life as full of thorns ( "Life is not a bed of roses"). The Eastern intellectuals defined it as a Vaitharani river, a macabre river whose flow is deathward. You will feel that they were right in defining life in such dolorous terms

Elarata Saturn occurs in Three Phases

Phase I - Dwadasa Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the 12th - Is dangerous but not as severe as Janma Saturn

Phase II - Janma Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the Lunar Asc ( This is severe )

Phase III - Dwitheeya Saturn - When Saturn is in the Second - The evil is lessened considerably but the Dosha persists. 

On the positive side, you have to understand that the suffering which you undergo are merely wages and that Initiation is a process of intensive culture and accelerated evolution. Many lessons will be learnt during this phase. It is said that the wise recognise Negativity as an inevitable clearing process and maintain equanimity. 

You can chant the following sloka to ward off the negative radiation of Elarata Saturn.
