Respected Sir,

I have a few more questions if you can please help me with =
this.

1. Can homam be done two times a day? Will that give faster results?=


2. Presently I am doing homam on a daily basis. Due to woman issues every=
 month I get a break of 7 days after which when I start the homam I feel th=
e continuity is lost. I feel I have to start fresh. I have seen you mention=
 in the forums that homam should be done on a weekly or daily basis. Do you=
 think I will still get the benefit with breaks in between ? Is there anywa=
y I can keep the continuity going? 

3. I have an energised mahalakshmi yan=
tra which I pray on a regular basis. How should I care for it when I go on =
a vacation? Shall I carry it with me whereever I go so that its not neglect=
ed? Also can I use it in homam? 

Thanks,

Best Regards,

Sudha
