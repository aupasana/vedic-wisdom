Dear Sundeep,

As you eloquently say, "if mantra is to have ANY enlightening effect, mantra 
must resonate in the mind itself". You are correct that "we are no longer 
talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental 
energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind".

Mind is the connection between what you called external universe and what 
you called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has access to ALL realms 
of experience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material realm. 
Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of experience through 
effort, it is not easy.

Let me give a small analogy.

If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (who thinks all that 
all of us think, who desires all that all of us desire, who knows all that 
all of us know, and who does all that all of us do) is like the bottommost 
layer of ocean. Various deities are like intermediate layers. Various 
objects of the external material world that are perceived by our senses are 
like the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on the surface 
perceive other objects on the surface around them. One's body and the senses 
attached to it are an object on the surface in the analogy. When one's mind 
identifies "self" with that body and its senses, it perceives objects as 
perceived by those senses. When one successfully detaches mind from that 
self-identity and identifies with another object in the ocean in a different 
layer, one may perceive a different reality. An example was in yesterday's 
mail on mystical experiences.

Just as the ocean is vast and deep and has infinite objects at infinite 
depths, this universe has infinite possible self-identities. As one's 
self-awareness is focused on a specific object, one has specific 
experience/perception of self and "others". When self-awareness changes to a 
different object, one has a different experience/perception of self and 
"others". However, this is theoretical discussion for most people, as they 
cannot imagine self-awareness changing. The self-awareness of most people is 
focused on their body with its senses and their experience/perception of 
self is the body and "others" is various objects as perceived through the 
senses attached to that body. But, it IS possible for one's self-awareness 
to go from an object on the ocean surface in the analogy to a layer in the 
mdidle of the ocean or even a bottommost layer.

Repetition of a mantra is only a tool for calming down the mental activity 
that keeps feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identifying with a physical 
object made with gross matter (body). By keeping it busy with a particular 
repetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting off its identification 
with that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a rope right next to him 
and thought it was a snake and was scared. You may tell him no, but still 
the thought "snake is next to me" will keep scaring him. If you keep him 
busy with an activity that he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him 
may vanish from his mind slowly.

Once the identification of mind with the body is cut off or weakened, mind 
will have to identify with something else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock 
on an ocean surface. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock 
tightly, its thoughts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking 
about rock and becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the 
rock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of something else 
on the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will drop all the way to the 
ocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing at all, the frog is afraid of it 
and instinctively grabs something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind 
will get a hold of another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) 
and develop another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of "I" and "others". 
In the example from last night, the perception of "I" was not the body, but 
a tiny particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the 
sound of a beejaakshara. The perception of "others" was millions of 
particles of the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and 
aborbed in the same sound.

Let me come back to what you wrote: "if mantra is to have ANY enlightening 
effect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We are no longer 
talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental 
energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind."

Mind or individualized consciousness is just a window to the universe. If a 
room has window on the east, you see what is on the east. If a room has 
window on the west, you see what is on the west. And so on. The sound of the 
mantra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A 
mind with a strong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense 
inputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is 
filled with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the 
floodlights installed outside on the south. You have to close that window 
and open window elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with 
body is weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of 
mind can open to the mantra that resonates in the universe.

When I said earlier that a vaccum should be created in the mind for the 
mantra and the deity to fill, this is what I was referring to.

*        *        *

Different objects of the universe, including human beings and deities, are 
made up of gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the 
universe has different perceptions of "I" and "others". Each object of the 
universe has different energies, i.e. different abilities to affect 
interactions between "I" and "others".

The energy of an object is the energy that brought that object into being. 
Deities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get close to a 
deity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized ego and its 
potential energy. One needs to convert that potential energy into kinetic 
energy that helps one break away from that ego and approach a deity.

In the long run, none of those objects is permanent. None of those energies 
is permanent. In terms of the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an 
object on the way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not 
view any object as "I" and not consider any energy as "mine". The final goal 
is to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, without any 
sense of "I" and "others" or "energy".

*        *        *

Please realize two fundamental things:

(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after* the sadhana is fruitful 
and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect tool for overcoming ego. If 
one thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and its energy will free him 
from ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in conscious effort with constant 
contemplation to weed out ego and pride to make one's sadhana fruitful. 
Mantra does not replace that need. Instead, it works hands in hand with that 
and depends on that.

(2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one 
should not think that "I did it" or "I created that energy in my mind". One 
does not do anything (other than *undoing* what one did previously, viz 
putting together of a complex and weird self-identity called a body with so 
many things attached to it and so many pre-conceived notions about the 
world). The energy of the mantra IS already there and resonating everywhere. 
When mind experiences that energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* 
to something pre-existing and not really creating something or doing 
something. It is like a radio tuning to a different channel and one 
listening to newer and better music or a driver driving on a different 
scenic road and viewing beautiful and better scenery.

*        *        *

> If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra shastra would be
> 1/2 a page of text, not more.

I never said they were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras 
fills the mind with different kinds of enegies (associated with different 
deities). So there is a lot of difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean 
analogy, the possible experiences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as 
vast as an ocean.

But, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra 
and a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and its deity to 
fill. Other factors related to the specific details in each mantra are 
secondary. I want to de-emphasize all other things and emphasize this 
essential thing, i.e. control over ego.

One wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed book giving all 
the maps. But my point is that one should first learn driving. What makes 
one an expert driver going to various places is not possession of thousand 
maps but the basic driving skill. One not knowing driving will crash the car 
even if he possesses thousand maps. One good at driving may manage without 
maps too. People emphasize complicated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and 
forget the basic essence.

*        *        *

I want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neither 
necessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One may 
spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.

If the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite not 
knowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to one who gets 
some mastery over the essential factors.

The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara 
and meditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit 
comfortably with the back, neck and head erect, eyes closed and mind as calm 
as possible. Avoid all physical movement and remain as still as you can. If 
you have an urge to move, suppress it as long as you can and keep pushing 
the limit everyday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. Do this 
meditation sitting in the same place, facing the same direction and at 
around the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for yourself if 
it does something to you or not, despite not paying attention to the 
technicalities and nuances!

*        *        *

Some nuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most 
people. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of 
the mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all 
relevant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not 
the case with most people.

Let me give an analogy. There may be some nuances related to how to lift the 
foot up and land the foot while running, to maximize the speed. They are 
irrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk and only crawls. When the 
baby learns how to walk and later how to run, those details will most likely 
come to him naturally. Evem without them, one will run fine, perhaps a 
little
slower. Thus, there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running 
when one is still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances of 
running may even make one's learning of walking very slow - it is a 
distraction!

*        *        *

I answered whatever questions I could answer and felt like answering.

What we need today is not people who can discuss theory in detail and have 
an intellectual understanding of things. In fact, these things are beyond 
intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana is far more important. Do not 
wait till you get technicalities correct. Just start sadhana as I mentioned 
earlier and commit 1-2 hours of your time everyday and see what happens.

What sanatana dharma and Vedic wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas 
who *experience* mantras at the highest level and yet remain free from pride 
and ego and become purified instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will 
with actions of far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in those 
actions. This is possible not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by 
developing devotion, surrender and conscious effort with constant 
contemplation.

Best regards,
Narasimha
