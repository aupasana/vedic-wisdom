Dear Rajarshi and everybody else,


>(Non-violence is the ultimate dharma.=
 So too is violence in service >of
Dharma.)

>This I find very acceptable. =
Now if the question arises what is
>Dharma, I would request going back to t=
he mails of Narasmiha on
>Dharma, because no one has

Let me clear few thin=
gs explicitly. We are confusing and Mixing
different things here. I am taki=
ng 'Ahimsa' in the context of Food
habits/preferences and Hinsa involved in=
 that. Hinsa (Injury/Killing)
involved in that is quite different than say =
for instance, Injury and
killing involved in Military Wars.
If a Tiger is a=
ttacking human societies every now and then and killing
people then it is r=
equired to be captured or Killed. That Hinsa is
different.
So now if we tal=
k about Swa-Dharma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or
Collective society D=
harma or Rashtra Dharma, The Killing which happens
during Military war can =
fall in Swa-Dharma of a soldier who kills
solders of the other side. It can=
 be called Dharma of Group of people
(Society) to kill a Man eater Tiger.

=
What i am referring to again and again is the Killing involved for the
reas=
on of Food habits and THAT is what which can not fall under
Swa-Dharma of p=
eople eating meat. Its possible that the karma of people
working in Butcher=
y shops may not be that heavier then the people who
eat meat.

In my opinio=
n, references to Swadharma is not proper here.

***

It is also correct tha=
t Most have cravings for the palate. Vegetarian
people also have cravings f=
or Spicy, Hot, Sweet, etc.. food. The Major
difference however is that Crav=
ing for the Veg food is far better in
comparison because craving for a Chic=
ken or Mutton amounts directly to a
loss of life.

Again, I think that it i=
s not required to go in to philosophical
discussions here.

***
I understan=
d that people are born with the Karma baggage of past lives.
they will get =
the culture, family background, habits etc... due to that.
Mental condition=
ing will vary. BUT if a person comes to know about
certain things then it i=
s no use blaming or taking shelter under the
circumstances. His/her will is=
 always there. Discrimination is always
there. I dare give an advise here. =
if somebody wants to change Habits
which one feel to be disastrous, one can=
 try as much possible (Like
Rajarshi tried for 108 days) and at the same ti=
me surrender to God. pray
every day to almighty to help and over a period o=
f time, help will come.
will surely come.

I do not boast or take any pride=
 in eating Vegetarian food and my
intentions are never to insult the people=
 who eat meat. My only concern
here is *Killing of Animals, Birds etc...* f=
or NOT justifiable reasons.

***

a Plant and tree has a life. I agree. Let=
 me ask what to eat then?
Because if you stop eating vegetables and grains =
then it'll be a vital
questions of Survival.  Somebody suggested that It is=
 not useful to
discuss Veg and non veg. i respectfully disagree with that. =
Discussions
were required and this thread will prove to be immensely useful=
.  even a
single person changes his/her Mind and turns away from Nonveg eat=
ing.



Best Regards,

Utpal

during lunch. what she said was not at all expected. she said t=

is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food since 3 years now and wan=
ts to
continue that way whole life. As expected, i was very happy and i
fur=
ther asked the reason. The answer she gave so much happiness. She
said that=
 She does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I salute her from my
heart.

The air we breath is living
(organisms). Death is part and parcel of natura=
l law. One cannot avoid
it however much one tries. The Abrahamic religions =
are heavy on non-veg
food. The areas where they grew, arid, desert land, yo=

least during those days) animal flesh to survive special=

irrigation options were so scanty.=C3=83=C6'=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=
=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A If you live
in the Artic region, you need to have fis=

The=C3=83=C6'=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=
=9A point is, death is a part of life. One does
not survive without death. =
That is how the world has been designed by
the grand designer.

r few things explicitly. We are confusing and Mixing different things here.=
 I am taking 'Ahimsa' in the context of Food habits/preferences and Hinsa i=
nvolved in that. Hinsa (Injury/Killing) involved in that is quite different=
 than say for instance, Injury and killing involved in Military Wars.<BR>If=
 a Tiger is attacking human societies every now and then and killing people=
 then it is required to be captured or Killed. That Hinsa is different.<BR>=
So now if we talk about Swa-Dharma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or Coll=
ective society Dharma or Rashtra Dharma, The Killing which happens during M=
ilitary war can fall in Swa-Dharma of a soldier who kills solders of the ot=
her side. It can be called Dharma of Group of people (Society) to kill a Ma=
n eater Tiger.<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAM=

ed for the reason of Food habits and THAT is what which can not fall under =
Swa-Dharma of people eating meat. Its possible that the karma of people wor=

 correct that Most have cravings for the palate. Vegetarian people also hav=
