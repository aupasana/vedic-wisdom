Respected Narasimhaji,

I have now understood the difference between 'Tyaga=
' and jettisonning.The illustration of a hike to the mountain was a very st=
raightforward and easy to drink.

As you have wrote - a person carries a lo=
t of load on self and more importantly on the 'mana' (intellect) starting o=
n the path of 'Saadhanaa' but many of these suppossedly useful and protecti=
ve gear is to be shedded from the self as the journey progresses ! 
I think=
 very crudely putting Homam is that 'Swiss Knife' which makes the 'Saadhaka=
' travel light=A0 and without any fear from the vagaries of the darkness ah=
ead.We may not worry about carrying too many things if we have the handy to=
ol of Homam to guide our senses......

Namaskaaram !
amit =A0 =A0

Namaste,
=A0
The goal of spiritual sadhana is to make ego=
 (sense 
of "I") melt completely. A normal person is so attached to the bod=
y that one 
believes firmly that body is I. From the limited self-identific=
ation where there 
is so much attachment to a body, a name and a specific i=
dentity, one cannot 
evolve in a single day or in a single step to a stage =
where one does not 
identify with anything (and becomes liberated). There c=
an be several steps 
depending on the force of previous mental conditioning=
.
=A0
One possibility is to attach oneself to a larger 
cause and overcome =
the over-attachment to the body, name and specific identity. 
Anything that=
 lessens the mind's attachment to the body, name and specific 
identity is =
helpful in the short run. Suppose one is so dedicated to one's 
country (or=
 to a cause such as spreading Yoga or spreading praanaayaama or 
spreading =
Jyotisha)=A0that one ignores comfort of body and starts to live and 
breath=
 that cause. It is helpful in overcoming the attachment to the limited 
sel=
f-identity.
=A0
However, in the long run, even attachment to a 
country or =
attachment to a cause such as spreading Yoga or Jyotisha blocks one 
from l=
iberation. However, attachment to bigger and more abstract causes like 
the=
m is easier to let go than attachment to a seemingly concrete and specific =

identity such as a body. So, devoting oneself to country or to a cause and=
 
working hard on it is a step in the right direction.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
It all depends on what debts you have =
and what 
stage of spiritual evolution you are at. For a person close to li=
beration, there 
is no need to bind further by attaching oneself to a cause=
, however noble it may 
be. For someone else, however, attachment to a caus=
e is a step towards 
liberation.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Suppose you are climbing a mountain. You need 
mountaineeri=
ng gear, supplies for many days etc. You start with a heavy load on 
your b=
ack. As you get higher and higher, you may consider throwing away things 
a=
nd reducing your load. But, if you start throwing away your supplies in the=
 
beginning itself, you will not make to the top. You will run out of suppl=
ies in 
the middle itself.
=A0
Similarly, forming attachment with working f=
or a 
country, working for a cause, devotion to a god, devotion to a person=
, a ritual 
such as homam, a mantra etc are like loads you carry which help=
 you climb the 
mountain. When you are closer to the top and the supplies b=
ecome a load, you can 
consider throwing them away. But you need them to su=
rvive and climb in the 
beginning.

Best 
regards,
Narasimha

        Namaste Narasimha, 
        =A0
        I want to narrate an =
incident before I pose this question. The 
        excerpts are from "Livin=
g with Himalayan Masters" book. 
        =A0
        Incident: (Before the =
independence of India)
        Swami Rama is a disciple of XXX guru (Guru's=
 name is not mentioned 
        in the book as Guru preferred secrecy) and =
is practicing the rigorous of 
        spiritual sadhana=A0in the abode of =
serene Himalayan 
        mountains,=A0to feel the cosmic consciousness. 
 =
       It was during this time, the independence movement was in progress 
=
        in India and Rama too got tempted to be a part of the movement. 
  =
      It was at this juncture, his guru advised him to continue with 
     =
   sadhana and not to take part in the movement as India is destined to get=
 
        freedom. 
        =A0
        Incident 2: 
        We keep hearin=
g/reading from noble people like Gandhi, 
        Chanakya,=A0Lord Krishna,=
 Abdul Kalam etc, that country is first 
        before you. (Can we here i=
mply "you" as=A0sadhana too?)
        =A0
        These two illustrations a=
re quite contradictory?
        What should we give the first priority to? =
Country or understanding 
        self? Isn't the comfort of being in a cou=
ntry necessary to understand 
        the self? 
        =A0
        Please=
 do let us know your thoughts.

        spiritual sadhanaÂ in the abode of serene Himalayan 
        mountains,Â to feel the cosmic consciousness. </div>
        <div>It was during this time, the independence movement was in progress 
        in India and Rama too got tempted to be a part of the movement. </div>
        <div>It was at this juncture, his guru advised him to continue with 
        sadhana and not to take part in the movement as India is destined to get 
        freedom. </div>
        <div><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>Â </div>
        <div>Incident 2: </div>
        <div>We keep hearing/reading from noble people like Gandhi, 
        Chanakya,Â Lord Krishna, Abdul Kalam etc, that country is first 
        before you. (Can we here imply "you" asÂ sadhana too?)</div>
        <div><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>Â </div>
        <div>These two illustrations are quite contradictory?</div>
        <div>What should we give the first priority to? Country or understanding 
        self? Isn't the comfort of being in a country necessary to understand 
        the self? </div>
        <div><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>Â </div>
        <div>Please do let us know your thoughts.</div>
