Respected Sir,
=C2=A0
This was indeed an eye opener for me too. Can't thank=
 you enough for imparting us with such divine knowledge? 
=C2=A0
Thanks,

=C2=A0 



=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Ram and o=
ther friends,
=C2=A0
Before I try to address this quandary, I want to tell =
a small story.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
More than 120 years ago, Rama=
krishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar. Next=
 to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine with a beautiful Krishna i=
dol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes. Due to an accident wh=
en another priest was carrying the idol during a festival, the idol broke o=
neday.
=C2=A0
The priests and the highly learned scholars were in a quandar=
y and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras were clear that a broken=
 idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in flowing=
 water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Ganges.
=
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view. He =
thought for a while and said calmly, "Suppose you have a son and his leg is=
 broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue to lo=
ve him or will you throw your son into Ganges?" His simple common sense vie=
w prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself fixed=
 the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to be wor=
shipped.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The idol was in your house for 56 y=
ears. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your mind, =
after all these years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental peac=
e by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is better off being ign=
orant than having such knowledge.
=C2=A0
If you have an idol that was worsh=
ipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it would've captured a=
nd stored some of the positive energy and positive thoughts of those people=
. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.
=C2=A0
It should not =
be a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing si=
mple things should suffice.
=C2=A0
Whenever you see the idol, imagine that =
there is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bow t=
o him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some fruit or raisins or so=
mething to the idol now and then, when you get a chance, and imagine that G=
anesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in water and wipe it (t=
o keep it clean).
=C2=A0
The key is not how detailed your rituals are and w=
hether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in your ritual. The key=
 is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol and how deeply you l=
ove that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Rituals are only meant =
to facilitate such a visualization and increase such a love. They are neith=
er necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relationship with a deity (w=
hich is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =

=C2=A0
How does a metallic (or stone or whatever) object become divine?
=
=C2=A0
Of course, each object and each atom of this universe is filled, in =
essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But, that would apply to =
the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as being more divine th=
an the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pervading non-dual god her=
e. We are talking about a deity within the field of duality here. That deit=
y is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. But, how does the deity =
get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in it simply because of its=
 shape? Of course not!
=C2=A0
All lokas and all devatas are present within =
you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought, you concentrate a =
part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or any object). When a p=
riest with a good level of purity and good ability to visualize (which come=
s from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pratishthaa in an idol,=
 his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa mantra as an instrume=
nt and a deity's essence enters the idol.
=C2=A0
Even if you do not do a pr=
aana pratishthaa formally, deity's essence will slowly be established in th=
e idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all about the power o=
f thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down by a dense and =
heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work faster, but e=
ven thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed down by a dense and hea=
vy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, albeit=C2=
=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol ove=
r a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invariably be established =
in the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.
=C2=A0
=
If you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care of hi=
m, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this negati=
vity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saattwika form with who=
m you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when you =
see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity's anger), it will indee=
d create such a presence in the idol and do you good.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*
=C2=A0
There are several *well-meaning* people out there with half-baked =
understanding that is not based on any direct experience, who go around sca=
ring people in several matters relating to god, religion and spirituality. =
But god is not to be feared.
=C2=A0
Love god. Do not fear god. When your fa=
ther or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is for a good reason and=
 it will eventually be for your good. They are not really angry at you and =
they actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes you or gives bad resul=
ts, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. Do not=
 fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always *love* god and love g=
od very deeply. More deeply than you love your parents, spouse, children et=
c. That is a simple principle for sureshot=C2=A0spiritual progress.
=C2=A0
=
Good luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you decide to do with it!

Narasimha
