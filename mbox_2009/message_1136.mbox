Dear Narasimha ji, Namaskar,
  I just saw the video of the sri Mahaganapati=
 homam on your website! 
Please accept my sincere thanks! 
With gods grace =
I performed my first homam, the whole experience was 
liking riding the bik=
e first time, few moments of peace but mostly 
struggling.  Unfortunately, =
I was not able to make use of your video. 
I will study and try to learn fr=
om my mistakes and your video. I 
would like to understand the reasoning be=
hind mudras you've 
performed. Is it possible for you to provide video of m=
udras 
(closeup, side and front angle)? Also I noticed, you have placed the=
 
purnahuti to your brahm-randrha before sacrificing it in fire. What 
is t=
he reasoning behind it? is it like requesting karmas to permeate 
into the =
coconut to be burned? 
Again thanks very much for your service to the commu=
nity!!!

Regards
