Namaskarams Narasimhaji:

I wanted to ask you about why you chose Mars and Saturn Homa manuals first.
Previous other writeup  seemed to indicate Sun and Moon are closer
to self development (Atma and Mind?) Should we perform a homam to
Lord Surya and Lord Chandra?
On a related note, please give some guidance on which deities are best
prayed to
for control of anger and speech.

Regards,
Suvarna
