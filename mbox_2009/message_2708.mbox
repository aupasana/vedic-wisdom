Namaskar Rajarshi,

   Like all of us, you have picked up =
some pointers about the nature of things which is all the knowledge availab=
le to you, but what you want to know is the complete picture. As a rule of =
thumb, if one begins his study from a biased point of view, he will never h=
ave the complete picture, even if he is given all the relevant pointers.

 =
  Why do you think I would paint the complete picture, somebody has already=
 painted it time and again in scriptures, but you seem to fail to read it ?=
 

> If you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. 
> A=
nd the rest are subtle. So when normal creation is spoken of, it 
> is spok=
en off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. 

  Despite all the knowledge that=
 you have - it is evident that you have not studied Sankhya thoroughly.
   =
6 x 4 =3D 24
   It actually refers to 6 tattwas - Where are the 4 antahkara=
nas' coming from NaraSimha  - and why are they called AntahKaranas' at all =
? Are your doubts over that Sankhya mentions about the 6th tattwa ?

  Give=
n the amount of discord and contradictions amongst the scriptural interpret=
ations and authorities, Badrayana had to write "Brahma Sutras".

  If you a=
re discerning enough and re-read all the scriptures you have ever read, you=
 will most certainly figure out that every scripture has mentioned about th=
e 6th tattwa everywhere. All we need is to rise above the dogma propounded =
by a lot of people around us who have selfish motives, and keep working in =
the correct direction.

  Vivekananda, mentioned it, but had not coined the=
 term "superether" for this 6th tattwa, while Yogananda was not a Jnana Yog=
i - but I take his word as scriptural authority given his level of self-rea=
lization.

> When you say that Gunas by "inherent duality" in nature give r=
ise 
> to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x >=
 2 and arriving at six.

  Also, what is so wrong with a simple multiplicat=
ion where multiplication is required ? Do you know what is "Law of Duality"=
 ?

> Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy. Lot of hazy areas 
> ye=
t. Kindly check above.

  Do you know Jyotish ? Didn't I mention that Naras=
imha could probably figure it out ? Let him reply at his own accord.

  BTW=
, don't really want to go into kriya yoga of lahiri mahashaya, because it i=
s better learnt from a teacher than discussed.

> "....Ajna and mooladhara =
chakras are closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the o=
ther.

   What is any other possible meaning of this line than that the two=
 chakras awaken each other and are related ?

   Ganesha is worshipped firs=
t because mooladhara is connected with Ajna chakra and the breathing proces=
s involves these two chakras
(HaM-SaH). The breath connection makes it the =
most suitable place to connect the highest and lowest expressions of God-co=
nsciousness, from brahma to a worm - every living creature breathes! 

   I=
 hope this explicitly clarifies.

Regards,
Nitish

 the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta is a 6=
th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and "a finer man=
ifestation". Maybe the intented audience for this passage was one who is no=
t intellectually aware of the basic=C2=A0idea of five creative elements. Ot=
herwise, the "super-ether" needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti? It is Chitt=
a? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he calling it a=
 vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the five=
, therefore clubbing everything together into one?

I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetra=
te the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half for=
med. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mul=
tiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many whic=
h 'claim to explain' in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a=
 correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble o=
pinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between bas=
ic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-locali=
ty etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of p=
anch-mahabhuta? !..
