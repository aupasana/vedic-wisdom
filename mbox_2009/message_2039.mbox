---------- --------- -----
One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are =
calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris =
and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespe=
ctive of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in =
their horoscope.
=A0
In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking =
karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from va=
sanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. =
If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry=
 or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having =
those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the connecti=
on and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. You can f=
ree yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor.=
 If the ancestor's consciousness is attached to a new body, the thoughts an=
d cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousness in the =
same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, whil=
e homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very important =
sadhanas for spiritual progress.
=A0
Devatas are very subtle forms of consc=
iousness. Their self-identification is to what is known as soul and represe=
nted by Sun. They work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas =
it carries. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachmen=
ts and desires. Their self-identification is with what is known as mind and=
 represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with De=
vas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natur=
al media for them respectively.
=A0
Devas and pitris have different ways of=

 Chanting Vishnu's 1000
 names is very powerful in this age. It is the best=
 antidote for many problems, material and spiritual. Fire of a reasonable s=
ize augments the effect. The philosophy of fire ritual is explained in the =
manual.<BR>> <BR>> This is a part of the effort to enable a community=
