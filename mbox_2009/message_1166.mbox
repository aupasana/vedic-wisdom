respected narasimha garu,

namaskar

This is a very important question. Mor=
e or less I find the same difficulty
of the mind wandering in many 'rajasik=
' thoughts. Kindly help to control the
mind and to divert it toward Japa.

Namaskar<br>
<br>
Thank you for answering all my queries. I=
 really have a nagging problem <br>
which others may be experiencing at var=

<br>
Without fail, my mind thinks of a very particul=
ar highly negative thought whenever  I am <br>
doing Japa.<br>
Often I try =
to negate it in my mind with the obvious result that my Japa gets destroyed=
.<br>
I am paranoid about these bad thought coming true, especially as I am=
 thinking them <br>
while doing Japa. In my heart I definetly do not want t=
hem to materialize. How should I <br>
proceed? <br>
<br>
Please advise.<br>=

<br>
Thank you yet again.<br>
