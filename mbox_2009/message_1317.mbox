Dear Arunisha,

>which said "your priority is
>not m=
e...but burning off that piece of wood?". 

This is a note worthy point you=
 made. See, Narasimha has cautioned 
members about the un-burnt material of=
fered as Aahuti. I am sure 
people doing Homam will be cautious about that =
and it is equally 
possible that many will be *Over cautious* about that. T=
he danger 
here is that the attention is diverted to un-burnt Aahuti and NO=
T to 
the invoked deity and what motive behind that is our SELFISHNESS. 
Be=
cause we are scared of facing any unpleasant fruits of our 
surfaced karma,=
 we even forget the lord for who we are doing the 
whole ritual. Major part=
 of my Aahuti is White Til, and i see some 
of them burst during burning an=
d come out of Homa Kundam. Initially 
i was little distracted worrying abou=
t the Un-burnt Aahuti issue but 
i stopped worrying about that after a coup=
le of Homa. However it is 
important that one learn quickly to optimize the=
 *type* & *quantity* 
of Aahuti offered depending upon the capacity of Agni=
. This is not 
difficult and within a couple of Homa, one can easily adjust=
 to it 
and then distraction is removed. 

By the way, please note my exper=
ience, whenever i have started 
reciting Chandi Paath and Now Homam, My rel=
ation with some of the 
close colleagues are becoming tensed for no fault o=
f mine 
(Honestly). My only fault was that earlier i happily accepted their=
 
misbehavior and pampered their ego in effort to reduce my `I' ness. 
Now =
i have decided not feed their ego and selfishness and changed to 
little bi=
t offensive mode.

I wonder (though it is very painful) if this is mother's=
 way of 
removing some unwanted & harmful bondage!!!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
