Namaste Ashwin ji,
 
> ... regarding Shri Vishnu Sahasra Naam. Is it really=

> worth reciting daily?
 
Honestly speaking, I am embarrassed that somebod=
y thinks a fool like me can certify or endorse or comment on the "worth" of=
 Vishnu sahasra naam, which was taught by Bhishma to Dharmaraja at the onse=
t of Kali yuga to help human beings in Kali yuga in following their dharma.=

 
*        *        *
 
Mantras like Vishnu sahasra naam (1000 names of Lo=
rd Vishnu), Hanuman chalisa, Chandipath, Mahamantra (Hare Krishna), Gayatri=
 mantra, Rudram, Arunam, Pavamana sooktam, Mrityunjaya mantra, panchakshari=
, ashtakshari, dwadasakshari etc are well-established and many people achie=
ved spiritual progress with them. One cannot question their worth.
 
*     =
   *        *
 
However, that is not to say that everyone meditating with t=
hem will make fast spiritual progress. To explain this, let me return to a =
previous analogy, as I believe that analogies help one understand concepts =
better.
 
Mantras are for protecting mind (from its enemies, i.e. one's wea=
knesses like ego, pride, attachment, lust, anger etc). Imagine one's mind t=
o be a person. Imagine one's weaknesses to be enemies charging at the perso=
n aggressively. Imagine mantra to be a weapon (stick or stone or gun) in th=
e hands of the person.
 
One may have a nice stick that was used by thousan=
d people before him to beat up strong enemies. Yet, he may not know how to =
use it and the weapon may become ineffective in his hands. If one taps an a=
ggressive enemy gently with a stick, that will hardly be effective. One has=
 to beat hard and with all the energy one can muster. Similarly, one's will=
 power should be strongly focused on overcoming ego, pride, lust, anger, je=
alosy etc and one should make conscious and forceful effort.
 
If one with =
some experience in beating up enemies with sticks tries to throw stones at =
them, he may not know how to aim and may fail. Similarly, one with experien=
ce in chanting other mantras tries beejaksharas, one may not succeed in aim=
ing them correctly and making them work.
 
If one not knowing how to shoot =
a gun aims a gun confidently as the enemy approaches and tries in vain to s=
hoot, one will fail and be beaten by enemy. Similarly, one not knowing how =
to use powerful Veda mantras is overconfident, he may fail in sadhana and s=
uccumb to ego, pride etc. If one atleast realizes that one cannot shoot, on=
e can atleast use the gun as a stick and try to beat up the enemy. Similarl=
y, if one atleast realizes that one does not know how to put veda mantra to=
 use, one can chant the veda mantra hundreds or thousands of times everyday=
 with sincerity, surrender and humility and try consciously to control nega=
tive emotions such as ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy etc.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
Bottomline is this: Just as how well a person puts a weapon to use=
 and overcomes enemies depends on how strong and serious the person is, how=
 much training and practice he has in using the weapon, similarly how well =
a person puts a mantra to use use to overcome internal weaknesses depends o=
n what kind of mental conditioning one has, how strong a desire one has for=
 spiritual progress, what kind of a guru one has and how much effort one pu=
ts into spiritual sadhana. Thus, we cannot make a blanket statement that re=
ading Vishnu sahasra naam, for example, everyday will help one become pure =
and get moksha.
 
While one engages in various external practices as a part=
 of the spiritual sadhana, one should remember that the internal goal is to=
 overcome ego and attain a spirit of complete surrender and detachment and =
try to cultivate that internal spirit. In the beginning, things are difficu=
lt and this is a mere thought. But, as one progresses and crosses a threshh=
old, external practices promote stronger internal focus and purity and stro=
nger internal focus and purity promote better and more effective sessions o=
f external practice. A kind of synergy develops between them. Eventually, o=
ne makes sufficient progress internally, which is the goal after all.
 
Wha=
tever mantra or stotra or ritual was given to you by a guru that you *surre=
ndered* to, you should follow it while engaging in internal contemplation o=
n an ongoing basis.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
