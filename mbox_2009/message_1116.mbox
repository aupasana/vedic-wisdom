Dear Narasimha,

Namaste. I would like to ask you yet another 
question.


=
Which mala is best for Ganesha Japa? I know you 
say to stick with one mala=
 for all Japa however my 
mind cannot fully accept this.

Which mala is bes=
t for Ganesha? Sandalwood, 
Turmeric or Sphatik? Or something
else entirely=
? Thank you.



Regards
