Sudha,

Narayan has already replied, but I thought I will add my two cents:=


1. Normally, fire alarm is not present in every room. If so, sit in a roo=
m that does not have fire alarm, close the door, open the window and go on =
to do the homam. If you are getting smoke, you can consider dropping a towe=
l near the closed door

2. Take smaller pieces of dry coconus - may be 1.5 =
to 2 inc in size (take a dry coconut half and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. That =
will be small enough to keep the smoke level low.

3. After the homam is ov=
er and the burnt dry coconut pieces cool down, remove them and try to keep =
the homakundam clean. The pieces even though are burnt, will catch fire if =
you keep them in the homakundam, and they will generate higher levels of sm=
oke. So, keep it clean.

4. Keep marmaya, and pelalu (these are like pop-co=
rn but in a smaller size and devoid of oil etc). They are very effective in=
 burning with out much smoke

5. I purchased a window exhaust fab ($20-40 i=
n Wallmart), and kept in my window. The amount of smoke during the homam is=
 not too much if you keep the ghee level and the size of dry coconut pieces=
 small. How ever, after the fire goes off, there will be some smoke. The ex=
haust will help in sending this out. How ever, you can move the homakundam =
out.

6. I purchased 2 bricks from Homedeopt and kept my Homakundam on them=
 so that carpet does not get the heat

7. I also bought a terpentine (also =
found in Wallmart for about $15 in trekking related ile - it is used to mak=
e tents. I used to put it first and then bricks and then the homamkundam. T=
his helped my ensure that carpent did not get any strains.

8. Initially I =
was very skeptic about the fire alarm, but, the day I started (with window =
exhaust fan), I was relieved and never bothered again.

9. Narayan's tip ab=
out keeping the lights at night is good. But, Candles are normal and if you=
 keep the window blinders for the area above the window exhaust, the light =
will not be so much for the out siders and will be similar to a bright cand=
le if your fire size is small.

10. Ravi Poruri has a beautiful set up at h=
ome. I request Ravi to photo the arrangement and put for the benefit of the=
 public.

Best regards,
Vijay

Fire will go away by itself after a while. If you use firewood and have a b=

small fire, it will go away quite quickly.
