Dear Kishore and Utpal,
=C2=A0
I am troubled by one thing just like you are=
. It is understandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe =
that such a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what re=
ally is the definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?

Some=
 months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with h=
im on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/t=
heological debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he sto=
pped the debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected o=
ur friendship. 
=C2=A0
Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will o=
nly mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never genera=
lly discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate s=
criptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C2=A0but not about mystici=
sm or sadhana or anything which=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why mos=
t people know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and unco=
rruptable=C2=A0human being.=C2=A0=C2=A0They have no clue about his meditati=
ons or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally would=
 not discuss God in public.
=C2=A0
Therefore our discussion was also on tho=
se aspects which can be proved or disproved theologically=C2=A0- 1) Is Rama=
 a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him =
as God=C2=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.
=C2=A0
=
1) To the first question, he believes the answer is "no". 
=C2=A0
2) To the=
 second question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it =
is right or wrong=C2=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to=
 follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He s=
aid, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ra=
vana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he=
 was=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita's abduction, but Ram=
a did not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the h=
uman way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama's ideas=
 than to worship Rama.
=C2=A0
3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a l=
iterary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to =
BrajBhasa. An author's paradise (since many rules of composition has been f=
louted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equat=
es women with animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces=
 in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Ther=
efore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he ar=
gues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarh=
ood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was=
 there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this =
plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks=
.
=C2=A0
The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. 
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
One request, if you can speak to him about his th=
ought on Food habits, it'll be great.
=C2=A0
I have been out of touch with =
him since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However I don't know =
whether he will respond. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/=
debates anything from a purely spiritual angle. 
=C2=A0
It was only by chan=
ce that I found out one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed=
 them when asked.
=C2=A0
I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from=
 a scientific point of view - about why there is no harm in having regulate=
d amounts of meat (not red meat). 
=C2=A0
But I say, as Narasimha said, thi=
s person should not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C2=A0 habits. Sachi=
n can bat and score century even with a sore back, we will not be able to d=
o it. His strength is his control of mind and his dedication to truth. 
=C2=

Namaste Rajarshi,

Thanks for painting such an portrait of this gre=
at person with your words.

Spending 72 hours in meditation is act of no or=
dinary person. His other characteristics and experiences assert that he is =
a great person. I am troubled by one thing just like you are. It is underst=
andable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a gre=

inition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?

Dear Laxmi Narayan,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I was intrigued by above =

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Yes he is a friend of mine.=C2=A0 I can only tell =
you very little about his spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it =
with anyone. He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.
=C2=A0
Be=
fore I tell you anything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I kno=
w, let me say=C2=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I m=
et him about two years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him w=
as his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=
=A0honestly.=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to j=
ust say a simple, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would n=
ot say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never =
ever=C2=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he=
 was in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are ric=
her than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him Engl=
ish is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got =
confused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one=
 English, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading t=
he English dictionary and
 one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from=
 reading=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked=
 him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at =
both the languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to ju=
dge the truth about=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, h=
e has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth abo=
ut anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in dif=
ferent fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for=
 long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hind=
i, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He co=
mposes poetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he consid=
ered himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place mak=
ered for religion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the for=
ms saw that blank space, he asked
 my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, =
the clerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the =
clerk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist=
 and writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. 
=C2=A0
So this gives=
 a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows h=
im, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.
=C2=A0
One day, long back, he was going to =
office for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna templ=
e. As he was passing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urg=
e to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside =
the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he =
sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how th=
e time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into th=
e temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any =
movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had =
no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep slee=
p.
=C2=A0
Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he=
 got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most =
people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=
hi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=
ce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0 Only his wife and close=
 relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits f=
or meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him =
how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe =
orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the anim=
als, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the=
 atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He=
 considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.Tha=
t is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevate=
d Sri=C2=A0Rama to the
 level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=
ki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The differ=
ence he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordin=
ary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be em=
ulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to =
lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely =
stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and=
 advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is =
not an atheist any more.
=C2=A0
Later he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew th=
e relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mot=
her he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lo=
t of time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=
=C2=A0with those in=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and=
 everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, et=
c etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be th=
e future of this country.
=C2=A0
He is am omnivorous person. Like any other=
 Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.
=C2=A0
I shall refrain from mentioning his n=
ame because I had not asked his permission before mentioning him.

In the Git=
a Lord is saying whatever you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is offerin=

?

My curious questions are not against your acceptance of his exexperience=

cting gruesome=C2=A0 pain and misery on animals and birds on his behalf and=
 he is consuming them and yet he is experiencing all these exotic=C2=A0 vis=
ions, But no feeling of kindness towards birds and animals.

Where did I go=
 wrong? Simple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no s=
uch samadhi? 

When we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I sa=
w in a book/article=C2=A0 about Dayamata who succeded=C2=A0 Paramhansa Yoga=

This is very complex world. No outright solutions=

rom which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also ene=

Then I have read stories about several people, who follow these faith=

 him about two years back. What first attracted me to  towards him was=
 his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac when it comes to =
;honestly. If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to jus=
t say a simple, harmless lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not=
 say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ev=
er spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he w=
as in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are riche=
r than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him Englis=
h is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got co=
nfused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one E=
nglish, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one
 hour reading th=
e English dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from r=
eading up volumes of Hindi and English literature. When I asked h=
im why, he just said it is because he wanted to be equally adept at bo=
th the languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judg=
e the truth about which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he =
has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about=
 anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in diffe=
rent fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for l=
ong in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi,=
 Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He comp=
oses poetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he consider=
ed himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place maker=
ed for religion as blank. When the clerk who was
 supposed to take the form=
s saw that blank space, he asked my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, th=
e clerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the cl=
erk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist a=
nd writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his frie=
nds, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. H=
is way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in h=
is scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says =
he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was =
at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the =
evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the pr=
iest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed=
 as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt=
 scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He rem=
embered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>T=
hen he started meditating at home, and it was there that he got vision=
s etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who =
know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 h=
ours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same=
 position for 3 days continuously.  Only his wife and close relatives =
know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditati=
on he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt=
 during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates f=
rom me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, w=
omen, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and b=
igger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed. He considers =
Sri Krishna to be God and Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he=
 does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it
 elevated Sri =
;Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana=
 was to show Sri Rama as an ideal <I>man, </I>not a God.The difference=
 he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary =
man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulat=
ed by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one can try to lead=
 his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stat=
ing his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and adv=
ises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not =
an atheist any more.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Later he had once me=
ntioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around him in his p=
ast lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowad=
ays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interacting with p=
eople, specially with those in the age group of 18 to 30, discuss=
ing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian histo=
ry, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young peopl=
e who will be the future of this country.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>He i=
s am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I h=
ad not asked his permission before mentioning him.</DIV>

R>Hello Rajarshi,<BR>         =
             I =
was intrigued by above line in your mail and want to know more about this d=
evotee. Do you know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/s=

hanges happened in his life after  he had these samadhi and visions.An=
y other special things about him.<BR><BR>In the Gita Lord is saying whateve=
r you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is offering all these non-veg to L=
ord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all around??<BR><BR>My curious ques=
tions are not against your acceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.A=
fter all he is
 part of hidden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome&nb=
sp; pain and misery on animals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming =
them and yet he is experiencing all these exotic  visions, But no feel=
ing of kindness towards birds and animals.<BR><BR>Where did I go wrong? Sim=
ple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi=
? <BR><BR>When we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in =
a book/article  about Dayamata who succeded  Paramhansa Yoganand.=
 Once she went to India and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has s=
topped. Master said, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was do=
ing  secretly.<BR><BR>This is very complex world. No outright solution=
s for so many difficult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originat=
ed in middle east are fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, =
from which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also en=
emies
 there?? Their Gods said in their holy books that animals are their f=
ood. So they cannot even think about souls in animals or their pain and emo=
tions.<BR><BR>Then I have read stories about several people, who follow the=
se faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperience  spiritual highs a=
nd other such phenomena. It is so difficult to comprehend.  Would they=
 remain in the cycle of b/d  till they learn about kindness???<BR><BR>=
