Namaste,

(1) When you invoke the presence of a deity like Ganesha or Krishna or 
Lakshmi or Durga or Vishnu or Shani or Shiva in a fire, it is one thing. 
When you invoke the presence of manes (departed souls) in a water pot, it is 
a different thing. The manes who are invoked in pitri tarpana have some 
strong desires. Their ethereal bodies have more restrictions than deities. 
To make it a bit easier for them to come and leave, standard rules involve 
some place restrictions.

(2) I personally do it also for the seven rishis of my gotra. You can add 
the 1/3/7 rishis of your gotra if you know them. There is no need to do more 
times in one sitting.

(3) Yes, it is ok. Durva (sacred grass used for purification) can be reused. 
Water can be thrown away at the base of a tree or a plant.

(4) Only for pitri tarpana.

(5) Yes. If a deity has a desire, you are doing your part in fulfilling it. 
Every embodied being (embodied in gross and ethereal matter) has desires and 
stuck in maya to some extent or the other. You fulfil your duty towards them 
and repay your debt to them by offering tarpana to satisfy their desires.

Best regards,
Narasimha

>
> 3) I am planning to do only the Rishi and Dev tarpana, is that ok?
> Also after saying the mantras, and it is finished what to do with

> 4) Seamease seeds should be used only for pitri tarpan or also for
> RIshi and Deva tarpan?
>
> 5) In the deva tarpan can I take the name of my Devata for tarpan?
