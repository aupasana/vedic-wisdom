If one answers only when there is "sincerity in the 
heart of the qu=
estioner", why would one then agree to debate a ruthless debater 
who is kn=
own to not have "sincerity in the heart" and who only wants to

If a yo=
gi has such stature, one can do 
"justice to the topic" without even taking=
 part in the debate and just by being 
oneself.

Wh=

debating Truth/God and mislea=
ding the world, great teachers in the past stepped 
in and directed the deb=
ate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or 
recently Aadi Shankara=
charya or Swami Vivekananda. They had the knack of 
steering the debate in =
a direction that they wanted - a direction that 
would help establish sanat=
ana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and 
ignorance with "polite words=
". They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the 
sword of detached, and ye=
t firm, actions.
 
Fighting with hatred or anger or agitation in the

 is bad. But, fighting with a calm and equanimous mind is completely 
saatt=
