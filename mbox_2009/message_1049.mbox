   =
         Namaste



Jyotish Vidya gives an indication of past, present and
=

future,sometimes it is accurate and sometimes it is not accurate.

Jyotish=
 Vidya is not an issue, however the native's chart (It is the

sanchit sans=
kars + other things of the native), the astrologer(his

mind, his understan=
ding of astrology), and the time of consultation

contribute towards to the=
 accuracy and inaccuracy.



Also we are so anamoured that sometimes even i=
f good thing happens to

us, we feel it is a bad thing, it is our frame of =
mind at the time.



You gave an example of a car accident for a native whe=
n he did

Vishnu sahastranama, and considered it negative, however more wor=
st

things could have also happened, it is that the chanting saved the

nat=
ive to the extent possible. Everything tends to have two sides,

depending =
on our state of mind one side resonates more than other.



Now with respec=
t to ista devata, we can deviate little bit here. I

have seen two types of=
 sadgurus, one type that always give same mantra

to all their disciples as=
 they have realized that mantra and have full

confidence in it. There is a=
lso other type which give out mantras

based on the disciple, some examples=
 are Ramakrishna paramhans and the

Guruji of famous astrologer Shri K N Ra=
o. Both types of Sadgurus were

very capable to see the past. present and f=
uture of their respective

disciples. So both these methodolgies are correc=
t. How do we

explain/apply here the concept of ista devata and bhadkesh in=
 this case.



Further I have read in a book about a disciple of Swami Rama=
nanda( The

very realized saint who started ramanandi samparadaya) . There =
used to

be one king in Rajasthan, he was a devi upashak, devi used to mani=
fest

to him and so he was asked for a boon by devi and he asked for

mooks=
ha. The devi indicated to him that she cannot grant it, but he

should go t=
o Swami Ramananda and become his disciple and get

initiation from him, tha=
t will get him Mooksha. Also if you look at

disciples of Swami Ramanada, l=
ike Ravidas, Kabir, and many others they

all had very unique experiances a=
nd different types of devotion,

Mirabai was a krishna devotee.



So we ca=
n easily conclude that the ista devata has many forms and it

is a concept =
that applies to many births rather than just one birth.



Ista devata to c=
lear up ones sanskars can in one life also take the

role of bhadkesh and a=
lso a different form.



The most important thing is one should respect all=
 forms and pursue a

form rigourously to which one is attracted most, rest =
all will fan out

in time, there are no short cuts.



>From an astrology pe=
rspective, there is some confusion too,

Ista devata is computed from the 1=
2th house from atmakaraka in D9

chart. However for atmakaraka some people =
include rahu and some donot.

There is 7 karaka scheme or 8 karaka scheme a=
nd then there is also

karaka replacement. Based on this one can get potent=
ially 3 different

atmakarakas and so 3 different ista devatas. So which is=
ta devata to pick?



It appears to me that we are not that advanced to rel=
ate concepts of

astrology and spiritualism perfectly yet. There is still l=
ot of gray area.



Hope this helps you to stir some more thoughts in your =
mind and see

things differently.



Best Regards

Mitesh
