*Right ear is 'better for heari=
ng' *
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8116321.stm

If you want to get som=
eone to do something, ask them in their right ear, say
scientists.

Italian=
 researchers found people were better at processing information when
reques=
ts were made on that side in three separate tests. They believe this
is bec=
ause the left side of the brain, which is known to be better at
processing =
requests, deals with information from the right ear.

The findings are repo=
rted online in the journal Naturwissenschaften.We can
also see this tendenc=
y when people use the phone, most will naturally hold
it to their right ear=
 Professor Sophie Scott, of University College London.

In the first study,=
 286 clubbers were observed while they were talking with
loud music in the =
background. In total, 72% of interactions occurred on the
right side of the=
 listener. In the second study, researchers approached 160
clubbers and mum=
bled an inaudible, meaningless utterance and waited for the
subjects to tur=
n their head and offer either their left or their right ear.

They then ask=
ed them for a cigarette. Overall, 58% offered their right ear
for listening=
 and 42% their left.

In the third study, the researchers intentionally add=
ressed 176 clubbers in
either their right or their left ear when asking for=
 a cigarette. The
researchers obtained significantly more cigarettes when t=
hey spoke to the
clubbers' right ear compared with their left.

In conclusi=
on, the researchers said: "Talk into the right ear you send your
words into=
 a slightly more amenable part of the brain. "These results seem
to be cons=
istent with the hypothesised specialisation of right and left
hemispheres."=


Professor Sophie Scott, of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at
Uni=
versity College London, agreed.
"Most people process speech and language on=
 the left-hand side of the brain
and while it is not cut-and-dry a lot of w=
hat goes in our right ear will be
dealt with by the left-side of the brain.=


"The other side of the brain is more involved in things such as interpret=
ing
emotion and that is why we have these kind of findings. "We can also se=
e
this tendency when people use the phone, most will naturally hold it to
t=
heir right ear."
