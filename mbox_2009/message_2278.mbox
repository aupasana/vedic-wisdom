THE FUTURE OF INDIA
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora

The Brahminh=
ood is the ideal of humanity in India, as wonderfully put
forward by Shanka=
racharya at the beginning of his commentary on the Git=E2,
where he speaks =
about the reason for Krishna's coming as a preacher for the
preservation of=
 Brahminhood, of Brahminness.

It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to=
 work for the salvation of the
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, a=
nd so long as he does that, he
is a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he g=
oes about making money. You on
the other hand should give help only to the =
real Brahmin who deserves it;
that leads to heaven. But sometimes a gift to=
 another person who does not
deserve it leads to the other place, says our =
scripture.

You must be on your guard about that. He only is the Brahmin wh=
o has no
secular employment. Secular employment is not for the Brahmin but =
for the
other castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that they must work hard to=
 raise
the Indian people by teaching them what they know, by giving out the=
 culture
that they have accumulated for centuries. It is clearly the duty o=
f the
Brahmins of India to remember what real Brahminhood is. As Manu says,=
 all
these privileges and honours are given to the Brahmin, because "with h=
im is
the treasury of virtue".

But it is one thing to gain an advantage, a=
nd another thing to preserve it
for evil use. Whenever power is used for ev=
il, it becomes diabolical; it
must be used for good only. So this accumulat=
ed culture of ages of which the
Brahmin has been the trustee, he must now g=
ive to the people at large, and
it was because he did not give it to the pe=
ople that the Mohammedan invasion
was possible.

It was because he did not =
open this treasury to the people from the
beginning, that for a thousand ye=
ars we have been trodden under the heels of
every one who chose to come to =
India. It was through that we have become
degraded, and the first task must=
 be to break open the cells that hide the
wonderful treasures which our com=
mon ancestors accumulated; bring them out
and give them to everybody and th=
e Brahmin must be the first to do it. There
is an old superstition in Benga=
l that if the cobra that bites, sucks out his
own poison from the patient, =
the man must survive. Well then, the Brahmin
must suck out his own poison.
=

To the non-Brahmin castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry. Do not seize eve=
ry
opportunity of fighting the Brahmin, because, as I have shown, you are
s=
uffering from your own fault.Who told you to neglect spirituality and
Sansk=
rit learning? What have you been doing all this time? Why have you been
ind=
ifferent? Why do you now fret and fume because somebody else had more
brain=
s, more energy, more pluck and go, than you? Instead of wasting your
energi=
es in vain discussions and quarrels in the newspapers, instead of
fighting =
and quarrelling in your own homes =97 which is sinful =97 use all your
ener=
gies in acquiring the culture which the Brahmin has, and the thing is
done.=
