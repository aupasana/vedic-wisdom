Dear Sri,

I try to understand the frustrated feeling you have of your past=
. As you
understand upto some extent it is the "Neej Dosha" which has given=
 you the
karm phala through the people around you.

In order to forget and =
forgive you need to take resort to one of the
shakti's of 'das mahavidhya'.=
 Shakti is Maa "Maatangi" and the beej akshara
is "Gaum". Standard practice=
 is you do Gaum Beej for -40- days regularly.
Only take "maha prasad" daily=
 after "Gaum" beej Matangi saadhana. And then
after 40 days look for a new =
begining. I am sure you will find a new light
at the end of the 'sadhana'. =
It will make your soul / mind pure and clean
and you will not have any grie=
f on the past history.

Easier said then done. Kindly search for more ritua=
ls and praction on
"matangi" sadhana and "Gaum" beej through a Guru.

Hari =
Om tat satt.

Jitu
