Well, free will DOES exist. In fact, what exactly i=
s destiny anyway? There is no destiny if there is no free will, for today's=
 act of free will shapes tomorrow's destiny.
 
In fact, Vasishtha tells Ram=
a in "Yoga Vaasishtham" that there is nothing called destiny. He says all t=
hat is there is your free will. He says that actions done in the past using=
 your free will will catch up with you and that catching up is given the na=
me of destiny. This destiny is thus nothing external, but acts of your own =
free will getting back at you.
 
Just as a person who spends all his monthl=
y salary in the first 10 days of the month may have no money to spend in th=
e next 20 days, similarly people who abused their free will in the past may=
 be faced with such a weighty destiny that their free will is useless right=
 now. Such people may feel that there is nothing called free will.
 
The am=
ount of leeway and wiggle room available for free may may vary from person =
to person and situation to situation, but it is a fact that free will exist=
s and that acts of free will shape one's future.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
