Namaste Sundeep and Rajarshi,
 
Yes, Pt Rath's astrology book "Brihat Naksh=
atra" gives a different order of creation starting with water and ending wi=
th the pair of ether and earth. It seems to be his extrapolation.
 
What yo=
u quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am famili=
ar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including "Y=
oga Vaasishtham", where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction an=
d liberation to Lord Rama.
 
*        *        *
 
This Upanishadic underst=
anding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The fi=
ve chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent =
ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, eart=
h element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are e=
ffaced in one's self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, wate=
r element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are e=
ffaced in one's self-awareness. And so on.
 
By earth and water etc, don't =
just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a =
solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of=
 existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular thing (e.g. a=
 car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of ea=
rth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a hou=
se, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, di=
fferent mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.
 
Whe=
n one thinks of "I", one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a=
 particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think o=
f "I" as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongin=
gs etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one's self-awaren=
ess and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Mo=
olaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one's cum=
ulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaad=
hishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature withi=
n one's cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.
 
Many=
 people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often=
 talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which=
 may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actua=
lly being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perc=
eive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly,=
 as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one's cumula=
tive idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of exi=
stence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one's notion of =
self ("I"), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.
 
The or=
der in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - ea=
rth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced ele=
ments return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and ear=
th.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding physics and spiritual realities:
 
> =
Does physics describe reality?
 
Physics tries to describe/model reality at=
 the gross physical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, on=
e's mind can "perceive" things without the external senses playing a role.
=
 
As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one's mi=
nd may "see" some people and "hear" a conversation between them. In another=
 example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and "se=
e" some scenes and/or "hear" some things. These things cannot be perceived =
by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.
 
It =
is reasonable to define reality as something that can be perceived by the e=
xternal senses, because different people can experience the same reality us=
ing their senses individually and verify the observation. However, some exp=
eriences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very =
powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating influence =
on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of modern sc=
ience.
 
*        *        *
 
One may categorize dreams and internal yogic=
 experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no indepen=
dent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases tha=
t make one wonder. For example, see the following messages from the archive=
s.
 
Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)
http://groups.y=
ahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951
 
In the above message, one person =
had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another pe=
rson seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to t=
he experience, suggesting that he too "observed" the experience of the firs=
t person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!
 
Re: =
Guru (message 391)
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391
 =

In the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience that=
 was described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and sup=
plied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggesting t=
hat he too "observed" the experience of the first person, though it was bey=
ond the external senses of either person!
 
Internal god and external god (=
message 2498)
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498
 
In =
the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a d=
eity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision involvi=
ng the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything wi=
th their external senses, suggesting that the second person "observed" the =
experience of the first person through a specific prism.
 
*        *      =
  *
 
Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *so=
me* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses=
 are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then=
, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be =
measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the "reality" =
that mind can access.
 
But, how can modern science study it?
 
Because the=
 only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality involving the g=
ross body and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle bo=
dy may be studied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. Fo=
r example, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through various part=
s of the brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle=
 body.
 
On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that =
subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some corresponde=
nce between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a ma=
ny-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept =
of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model ca=
n be moderled using just the gross body!
 
If you drive through a neighborh=
ood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of what =
is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and many car=
s parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular house with=
 no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what is goin=
g on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are doing =
etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.
 
Similarly, by looking a=
t the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to se=
e some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are b=
eyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical=
 domain.
 
*        *        *
 
Unfortunately, modern science cannot study=
 that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unl=
ess scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.
 
Wh=
ile rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the=
 microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, =
even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. Whe=
n Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of =
the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes a=
nd exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed t=
o have a perfect control.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

I get the thrust of your point. Yes, sadhana is the only way to know this f=

I am not interested in a he-said/she- said type game (if perhaps that is wh=
