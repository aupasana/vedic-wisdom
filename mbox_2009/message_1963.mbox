Subject: Chanting Gayatri mantra in water (Re: Mantras, Kavachas and Stotras)

Namaste,

I am afraid there is something amiss with the interpretation of Devi 
Bhagavatham.

Gayatri mantra is indeed very fiery. However, water cools it. Rishis did 
Gayatri mantra while standing in river water. That is a great way to do 
Gayatri. Some people like Vimalananda actually recommend sitting in a tub of 
water when doing an intensive Gayatri japam.

I can personally attest that intensive and focused chanting of Gayatri 
mantra generates tremendous heat inside. There was a day when I sat the 
whole day and did Gayatri mantra from 5 am till 9:30 pm. I felt extremely 
light and tremendously hot at the end of it. It is not because of sitting 
for too long and Gayatri mantra IS a factor. For example, when I chanted 
Devi Sooktam from 5 am till 11 pm on another occasion, that heat was 
missing. Even when I spent 5 am-9 pm doing Chandi homam continuously for 2 
consecutive days (i.e. sitting in front of fire continuously), I did not 
feel that kind of heat. Intensive chanting of Gayatri mantra definitely 
produces heat inside.

However, I do not think that that means contact with water is bad. On the 
contrary, contact with cool things in the gross and subtle planes balances 
that heat. My recommendation is: Feel free to chant Gayatri mantra while 
immersed in water.

Best regards,
Narasimha
