Namaste,
 
If one is able to do homam, it is the best spiritual practice in=
 my opinion.

I am not aware of Ramakrishna advising fire worship in that birth.
 =

Shree Maa (see the recent mails on her) had visions and encounters with Ra=
makrishna (after he physically left the world), who she considers her guru.=
 She claimed that Ramakrishna told her to do fire ceremonies and help estab=
lish truth and world peace.
 
My guru was told by the Mother to spread homa=
m and create a community of people performing regular homam around the worl=
d. To me, Ramakrishna's words and the Mother's words are not that different=
. When he lived, Ramakrishna essentially carried out the Mother's will.
 
*=
        *        *
 
Ramakrishna's disciples were spiritual giants with imp=
eccable backgrounds and pedigree. Still each of them needed really serious =
sadhana to find Self again. That is the nature of rebirth and Kali yuga. Th=
ey all were lucky to have Ramakrishna's company. Ramakrishna taught the hig=
hest spiritual truths in simple words to them, made their thinking clear an=
d inspired them so much. They had clarity from Ramakrishna's influence and =
meditated for 4-5 hours everyday and sometimes more. STILL, they needed one=
 or two decades of such serious sadhana to become liberated again.
 
When o=
ne is able to meditate for 5 hours everyday, that may be sufficient and the=
re may not be a need for homam. But lifestyles have changed in the last 100=
 years. If one is unable to meditate for 4-5 hours everyday, fire ritual is=
 a great option. In other words, there may not have been a compelling need =
for a homam movement 100 years back, but it may be there now.
 
When Ramakr=
ishna lived, intelligent young Indians were being indoctrinated with wester=
n thinking and started to look at Hinduism as primitive. Some of them were =
also attracted by the impersonal philosophy of Brahmo samaj and detested id=
ol worship. Ramakrishna did two things: (1) To those attracted by the imper=
sonal philosophy, he showed the magic of surrendering to a deity such as Ka=
li or Krishna and demonstrated true bhakti, (2) He had his sishyas such as =
Vivekananda propagate the non-dualistic Advaita philosophy in the west and =
in India. This two-pronged approach countered the intellectual onslaught on=
 Hinduism and kept many intelligent young minds from running away from Hind=
uism.
 
Times are different now and needs are different. IF Ramakrishna is =
reborn now, his specific teachings and approach may be different.
 
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha

  Subject: Yoga Vs Homam (Need perso=
nal suggestion)

        Dear Narasimha garu,

        Namaste.

        Ju=
st two days ago I asked Utpal Ji's suggestion on whether I should do Sudars=
han Kriya (Art of Living) regularly or Homam regularly, since he too was pr=
acticing Sudarshan Kriya. He suggested to try one of them a weekly basis an=
d the other daily if I can't practice both of them daily.

        But agai=
n I was confused as to which one to practice daily and which one weekly.

 =
       Today I came across your mail where you said practicing pranayama, m=
udras and Bandhas (Sudarshan Kriya has these only) is difficult. Do you sug=
gest me to prefer Homam over Sudarshan Kriya if I can't do both of them dai=
ly ?

        Also you mentioned that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say t=
hat Raja Yoga is not for this age. Did he advice people to worship through =
fire ? I'm a bit curious because my knowledge of him is that he was a pries=
t and was worshipping the idol which means he chose 'earth' element.

     =
   Thanks and Regards,
        <deleted>
