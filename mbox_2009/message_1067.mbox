Namaste Narasimha Garu,

>Though the first word in that picture is "shava",=
 YOU will pronounce 
it as
"shav". Please note that the second symbol in "s=
hava" is identical to 
the
first symbol in "vasha". However, YOU end up pro=
nouncing that symbol 
as "v"
>in the first word and as "va" in the second w=
ord.

When we pronounce first word i.e Shava, we say Shava (va will be 
pro=
nounciate such that it has a trailing 'a' sound)

as you said Va in Shava a=
nd Va in Vasha should be same, it is agreed 
but as i mentioned above, I pr=
onounce it the same way in both the 
words i.e. Shava & Vasha. I can pronou=
nce Va with 'a' as a trailing 
sound. what i didn't understand is that why =
i'll need to pronaunce as 
Vaa ('aa' as trailing sound). I mean i can prono=
unce 'Shava' 
comfortably. i don't end up pronouncing it 'v'. in that case =
why i 
should make it Vaa sound?

When is say Raam (Raama), i pronounce 'M'=
 with trailing sound of 'a' 
so the sound of 'M' is not abruptly ending but=
 it is completeing with 
sound of 'a'. Same is for Shiva, for Krushna.

in =
all the above, why i need to say 'AA' sound at the end.

I don't pronounce =
'Va' in 1st & 2nd word as it is given in the 3rd 
word.

For Example take '=
Tat' from 'Om Tat Sat'. First 'Ta' has trailing 
sound of 'a' and the next =
'T' is abruptly ended without trailing 
sound of 'a' and that should be cor=
rect i suppose.

***
secondly, in the 2nd word, if Va is pronounce as Va ('=
a' and 
not 'aa') then in the first word, why i need to say Va as Vaa.

I d=
on't know if i was clear in what i wanted to convey.

yours,

utpal
