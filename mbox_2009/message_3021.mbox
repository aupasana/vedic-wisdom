Very well said.

Those that are in Sahaja Samadhi are embodiment of God in =
human form and are Avatara purushas. They can be worshiped directly as we w=
orship God.

Below link is what Ramana Maharishi (one who was established i=
n Sahaja Samadhi himself) had to say about this.

http://www.messagefrommas=
ters.com/Enlightenment/Ramana_Samadhi.htm

Sri Aurobindo and the Mother mai=
ntained that while not yet achieved on earth, it is still possible to reach=
 a stage beyond even  Sahaja Samadhi. That is maintained as Supramental tra=
nsformation, where not just the consciousness is established at once in bot=
h the Absolute and the relative but all other grosser levels of existences =
including the body "transform" and become direct manifestation of the absol=
ute without any distortions as is currently the case. People took some of h=
is words on physical transformation or bodily immortality out of context an=
d misrepresented this as Sri Aurobindo wanting physical immortality in the =
ordinary sense of the term, etc. 

Anyways, all of this is mental concepts =
to me right now, and I will sign off this thread.

Regards,
-Siva.

 activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small pro=
gram that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the computers of=
 the world and deciding what this computer should do.
