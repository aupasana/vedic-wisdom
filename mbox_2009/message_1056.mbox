Namaste,

Yes, what you said is right. 'Bet' means Island in Gujarati and t=
hat 
is why it is Bet-Dwaraka.

You must be knowing a Poem called "Okha Har=
an" which is quite famous 
amongst gujarati ladies (My mother's generation)=
. They used to 
specially recite that long poem in 'Chaitra' Month.

Sauras=
htra is also said to be birth place of Shani if i am not wrong.

Thanks for=
 the post

best regards,

utpal

 All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I've had 
for qui=
te sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to 
any Hanuman te=
mple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my 
natal chart which su=
ffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha 
in navamsa). When I visite=
d the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha 
Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near =
Chennai and asked the priest about 
a mantra, he advised me to chant the ma=
ntra inscribed on the walls of 
the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram|=
 which comes out to be a 7 
word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th h=
ouse to the 10th house 
with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mant=
ra shastra 
teachings. I've been doing this every evening since.

how does=
 this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?
