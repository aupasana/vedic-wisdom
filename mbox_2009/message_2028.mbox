Namaste everyone!

What an interesting thread!! Dear Rajarshiji, I join you=
 in your 'confusion'. I have myself often wondered about the hierarchy of D=
ivine beings.. however I do believe that there is nothing 'higher' than the=
 Supreme Brahman. 

When we delve into the metaphysical/abstract realms, th=
ings do get confusing. All the more so, because our intellectual/logical mi=
nd is limited and cannot grasp these 'complexities'. I have read that there=
 are several astral planes/dimensions/parallel worlds that exist alongside =
our world, i.e planet Earth. Some of these astral planes are very close to =
our dimension, so it's easier for the ascended Siddhas who dwell in these p=
lanes, to have an impact onto our existence directly. For example, someone =
on the Moon would communicate more easily with us earthlings than say, some=
one from a farther planet like Saturn. However, the Supreme Brahman is beyo=
nd all these planes of existence...

My two pence.
:)

I know very little. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the by=
gone ages will be established on earth for a few hundred years in the comin=
g decades. The reason the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked hi=
m to spread simple homam procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds=
 for that. Manish also told me that all this is the play of a senior mahars=

 of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Au=
robindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In h=

e in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right=

e face today.
> =EF=BF=BD

The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called invo=
lution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter =
is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a sta=
ge where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner vi=
sions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he c=

immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people=

by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine pla=

what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fiel=
ds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into=
 cellular consciousness.

e. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=
=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world=
 today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura o=
f Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwa=
rdly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. Ac=
cording to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transfo=
rmation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so=
 only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, t=
hey spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hi=
tler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in counteri=
ng his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may =
be influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.
> 
> Wi=
th the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete hum=
an structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that al=
though the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrop=
hic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for t=
he most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, ca=
rried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by mean=
s other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be =
absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. =
It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world toda=
y, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmo=
nization!
