=93Upanayanam does not mean just putting round the neck three strands of
co=
tton thread. It means that there are not only two eyes but a third also.
Th=
at is the jnana netram (wisdomeye). Open that eye and recognise your
swa-sw=
arupa (own form); that is what is taught. Upanayanam means additional
eye. =
They say that the eye must be opened and for that purpose they give
trainin=
g in pranayamam (breath control). After that they give Brahmopadesam
(Initi=
ating about Brahman), give the boy a begging bowl and tell him to go
about =
begging. The first bhiksha is mathru (mother=92s). When the father gives
Br=
ahmopadesam, the mother gives three handfuls of bhiksha (rice) to enable
th=
e young boy to do manana (repeat inwardly), the upadesa given by the
father=
. He is expected to fill his stomach by begging, stay in the Guru=92s
house=
 for training and realise his self by opening the jnana netram. That is
the=
 significance of Upanayanam. Forgetting all that, what is done at present
i=
s this: pranayamam has come to mean just closing the nose with the fingers
=
and pretending to control the breath; Brahmopadesam means just to cover bot=
h
the father and the son with a new dhoti when the father whispers somethin=
g
in the ear of the son; bhiksha means just filling up the begging bowl wit=
h
money. What could they preach to the boy when the father who gives the
up=
adesa and the priest who gets this done,do not know the real significance
o=
f Upanayanam? Not only that. After receiving the required knowledge by
stay=
ing with the Guru for a sufficiently long time, the Guru used to send
the b=
oy to his parents to find out whether his mind would get caught in
worldly =
affairs or turn towards sannyasa. After staying for some time in
their own =
homes, the boys used to start on a pilgrimage to Banaras, devoid
of worldly=
 desires and with a view to renouncing them completely. At that
time, paren=
ts having girls of marriageable age dissuade the boys from going
to Banaras=
 and offer them their daughters in marriage. Those that are
strongly inclin=
ed towards renunciation would go without caring for the
offers of marriage =
and those that are otherwise, return home and accept the
offer of marriage.=
 All that is forgotten now. Pilgrimage to Banaras at
present means the youn=
g man puts on a silver-lined silk dhoti, his eyes are
coloured black, his f=
orehead bears a caste mark, his feet are ornamented
with yellow and red pas=
te, his body is smeared with sandal-paste, his neck
is adorned with flower =
garlands, an umbrella is spread over his head and
wooden sandals are worn o=
n his feet and he walks on stylishly to the
accompaniment of music. When th=
e girl=92s brother comes and offers his sister
in marriage and presses him =
to accept the offer, he says, =93I want a wrist
watch. I want a motor cycle=
, I want this and I want that. If you give them,
I can marry, otherwise not=
.=94 Afraid that the marriage which is arranged may
fall through, the paren=
ts of the bride give whatever is demanded. Then they
have photos, feasts an=
d presentation of cloths and the like. Nowadays,
bhikshas are used for fill=
ing up the begging bowl with rupees and
pilgrimages to Banaras are used for=
 extracting dowries.=94
