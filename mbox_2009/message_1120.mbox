Namaste,

On Videographer:

The videographer is Ravi Poruri, who has been doing daily homam for more 
than 2 years now. Soon after creating the manual, I gave homa kundas to him 
and Narayan Iyer (who wrote here once) and they both started at the same 
nice muhurta on the Dattatreya Jayanti day in 2006. They are both doing 
daily homam still.

On lustre etc:

External things such as facial lustre are quite subjective, misleading and 
not that important. Let us please leave out the superficial things.

Honestly, at the time of the shooting, I was quite tired, without much sleep 
for a few days and feeling a bit awkward and self-conscious about the 
artificialness of the shooting, i.e. pauses in the shooting to change angles 
frequently as suggested by Manish. My focus was in bits and pieces and 
frequently disturbed by the demands of the shooting. Only when I meditated 
at the end could I forget everything and sustain a good level of focus.

On "severe sadhana":

In general, I encourage people to do serious sadhana, but I also urge them 
to constantly contemplate one's thoughts, motives and actions and 
consciously try to improve self-control. Serious sadhana tends to bring 
those changes internally, but it can still take a long time. There are some 
who do serious sadhana for years and yet stuck in the quicksand of ego. Yes, 
ego IS a quicksand. Getting out is very very tough.

Contemplation and conscious effort to overcome ego should go in parallel to 
the "severe sadhana". In fact, I see them as much as a part of one's sadhana 
as the external rituals, practices and meditation.

Without a conscious effort to weed out ego, even serious sadhana can cause 
pride in one and make one fall. Perhaps nobody exists today who can do more 
severe sadhana than Ravana. But, despite such severe penances, Ravana was 
not immune to pride and he fell.

Sadhana makes things easier on the effort to overcome ego, but does not 
guarantee anything. One needs to supplement sadhana with a conscious effort 
to overcome ego.

On ochre/saffron robes:

Yes, they symbolize detachment. Clothes symbolize the gunas that condition 
our consciousness. Saffron is different from red. Saffron symbolizes 
sacrifice. Yellow color symbolizes auspiciousness. Red color symbolizes 
bravery and steadfastness. White color symbolizes peace and calmness. And so 
on. Usually, white and yellow colors are preferred in rituals. But red color 
is the favorite of Ganesha. I was using a red color veshti simply because it 
was gifted to me by my favorite priest who was originally instrumental in 
giving us the resources that enabled the homam manuals.

Best regards,
Narasimha
