Some time back some one suggested us to introduce each of us. Ravi made a p=
hoto album and publish the link.

I feel we can actually use the database f=
eature available with in groups. I have created a table:
http://groups.yaho=
o.com/group/vedic-wisdom/database?method=3DreportRows&tbl=3D1

You can use =
the link to add record for yourself:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=
sdom/database?method=3DaddRecord&tbl=3D1

None of the fields are mandatory.=


Best regards,
Vijay
