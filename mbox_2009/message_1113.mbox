Namaste!

I've some recent pictures (around 1 year back) of Narasimha. what=
 i 
felt that his face in those pics looked tired and exhausted. I told 
my=
self that it is surely due to the amount of stress, his body must 
have gon=
e thro' because of tremendous Sadhanaas he has performed in 
recent years.
=

like you all noticed, i was also pleasently surprised to see 
the 'Glowing=
 Face' of his in the video when i saw it for the first 
time day before yes=
terday. actually i was very happy to see his 
shining face in that video.
B=
UT it hardly matters to me if his face is shining or lusterless. To 
be hon=
est, Even his knowledge has not impressed me that much because 
You'll find=
 great many 'Orators' and philosophical lacturers. even i 
can give a good =
philosophical lacture. it may not be a big deal now 
a days. What has reall=
y impressed me is his attitude of engaging 
into practical Sadhanaas. He ha=
s inspired me with his demonstration 
of doing Sadhanaas. His steadfastness=
 in putting long hours for God. 
32 chandi Homas in 3 days is not a joke. H=
e is very very serious in 
his quest for Realisation and THAT is the thing =
which inspires me.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
