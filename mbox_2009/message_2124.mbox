Namaste Narayan,

Thanks for your graciousness! No apologies needed because=
 I'm sure that's what you meant. However, just curious as to the larger sig=
nificance of rejecting the dharba (or sprinkling water over the left should=
er after purification of all the items in other traditions) towards the SW =
direction.

Many Thanks,
Alok.
