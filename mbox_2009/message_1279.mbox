Namaste members,

I did my first Homa around oct/nov of 2006 (i am not sure=
 of exact 
month). The first Homa i did was of '108 MahaMrutunjaya Mantra'.=
 The 
information and propagation came from 'Art of Living'.

It is intrest=
ing Coincidence to note here which i realised yesterday:

MAHA KAALI gave D=
arshan to Manishji on 3rd March 2006 and Instructed 
him to start Homam mov=
ement. chain of events happened in that line 
and Narasimha (My Guru) took =
the task of propagating it.

Now consider this - Sri Sri Ravishankar also s=
tarted propagating 
Homam on Daily basis (15 minutes Agnihotra Homa, MahaMr=
utunjay Homa 
etc..) around the same time. AOL came out with a small book f=
or 
doing Homam everyday, they started supplying Homa Kundam and Cow-
dung =
blocks for fire rituals. I Purchased the Homa Kundam and 
CowDung Slices fr=
om them when i was in Mumbai and did my couple of 
Homam for MahaMrutunjaya=
 Mantra. AOL has a giant numbers of 
followers all over the world and its o=
bvious that many people are 
doing Regulay Homam (As per AOL's way).

aroun=
d the same time Narasimha came out with the first Manual and 
that was Maha=
Ganapati Homa.

This tells me that, Homam is NOT without reasons. Some divi=
ne plan 
is strongly behind this movement which is evident by activities of=
  
Manish & Narasimha, Ravishankar, Shri Maa and others who have 
started i=
t on regular basis.

This were my thoughts. i suddenly realised a Yesterday=
 the 
coincidence mentioned above and thought it proper to put in front of =

all the list.
  
Warm Regards,

Utpal
