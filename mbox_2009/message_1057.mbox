while reading the above two paragraphs, i could feel you=

and excitement. I am sorry if i gave a wrong impression by m=
entioning 
the word 'South Indian' in my post. infact i am by nature agains=
t all 
these differences of South-north, shaivaites-vaishnavites, brahmin-
=
non brahmin etc.... i innocently asked you what was in my percieved 
knowle=
dge. it was never to belittle people from some part of india or 
to create =
any differences of SouthIndian or North indian. I wouldn't 
even dream of t=
hat. we've had enough differences amongst ourselves 
which made us conquere=
d race for nearly 2000 years.

I thought that you, as a sanskrit scholar, w=
ould be the fittest 
person to shed light on the subject but I must say tha=
t you reacted 
passionately. you missed guilelessness in my post and instea=
d gave an 
impression that i was creating rift. you seems to have been pain=
ed 
by 'south indian' word.

***

I would carefully look in to the attachme=
nt and come back to you for 
any query.

forgive me, if a Shishya shouldn't=
 have written such words

Spiritually yours,

Utpal
