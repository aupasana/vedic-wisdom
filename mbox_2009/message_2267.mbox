Namaste,

I have one more question. I plan to do Maha Ganapati Homam on Gan=
esh Chaturthi.

1. Is that ok to do it?
2. Should the Ganesh Idol puja and =
Homam be done as separate rituals?
3. If I perform Homam in front of the Ga=
nesh Idol after the puja is it ok?
4. Are there any steps that I should obs=
erve? e.g. Can same prasadam be offered to both Ganesh Idol and Homam?

Dha=
nyawaad,

Jagmohan
