Namaste 

Good work, great job

A slight =
mistake in sankalpam, it says about sani, just for 
correctness otherwise p=
eople familiar will be ok.

Also it seems now you seem to accept aluminium =
foil on the homa kundam
for ease of cleanliness, what happens to rahu's inf=
luence? Is it 
ok?...

I agree in principle what you suggest in email about=
 faster progress, 
but, there are so many ways to realize god, bhakti, nam =
sankirtan, 
manav seva or any type of seva or mantra yoga, hath yoga etc. T=
here 
are so many, I am sure I cannot list all.

It depends on the sanskars=
 or accumulated impressions of a sadhak as 
to which path will help better,=
 we donot know that for sure except 
for Siddha Sadaguru.

Also a lot of pe=
ople donot even have means to eat or cloth how will 
they do homam, even if=
 they read this on the internet? What will 
happen to their feelings and mi=
nd. Does that mean they cannot realize 
God in a speedy way?

Along with Pa=
rashara we also have bhagvatam which signifies in 
kaliyuga naam sankirtan =
and similar other documents offer other 
methods, all these are equally imp=
ortant and valuable.

A good way is to accept all paths that lead to self r=
ealization
and suggest that homan is also a very good way. I hope that you =

please accept this in a positive way.

Very Happy Shivratri to you and all=
 members.

Best Regards
Mitesh
