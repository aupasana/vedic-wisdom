Namaste friends,
 
This is what I recommend:
 
Say "Om Bhur bhuvah suvah" o=
nce in the beginning. Then start repeating the following:
 
Om tatsavitur .=
... varenyam Om
 
This is what should be repeated for one mala or two malas=
 or, as Manish said below, 10 malas.
 
*        *        *
 
I know somethi=
ng about Manish. He has the rare ability to transform normal people into in=
struments of the divine and egoistic people into detached persons fulfillin=
g their dharma without ego. I know that there is some power in his words. T=
he following is a specific advice from him in vaikhari. Those who are inter=
ested can try following it.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Dear N=
arasimha,

          When the sadhaka effaces his own personality such that=
 the deity of the mantra comes and occupies him, then at that stage there i=
s 
          no real difference between the sadhaka and the Deity(even if t=
he deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there is no real diff=
erence).
          The difference that one feels is as follows:
          O=
ne feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
          A few re=
pititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity possesses t=
he sadhaka and the sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas),=
 
          During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or h=
ands or face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details=
 of the room (even though the sadhak's eyes are closed).
          The sadh=
ak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.
          The who=
le day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i again experie=
nce the Beloved.
          That then is the experience of mantra when it is=
 done correctly.
          When the sadhak's personality is effaced such th=
at the deity's personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself a=
s that Deity(Devata).
          There then arises no difference in the sadh=
ak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to=
 be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity's personality i=
s crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so=
 self identification is minimised and the person's spiritual evolution cont=
inues.
          Remember, there is very little according to me which is bl=
ack magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher =
shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your po=
wer will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the deat=
h of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was ori=
ginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings=
. 
          Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto =
the heads of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrim=
ent( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Sha=
kti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black mag=
ic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal pe=
rson, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed=
 maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifyi=
ng with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself=
 attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identif=
ication, ie God or the universe).
          If people persist in using the =
Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shak=
ti which can be used, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be =
free of identification with the body and so their actions are those which a=
re generally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spir=
its which they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experi=
ence.
          Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifet=
imes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a s=
adhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous=
 effort).
          On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in th=
is lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial=
 and may not acheive in this lifetime.
          According to me the proof =
of the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.
       =
   If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reitition=
s of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden=
) every day, main constraints
          Same time every day.
          Same=
 place.
          Same materials.
          Same direction.
          As li=
ttle movement as one can.
          Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your =
inclination.
          Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body=
, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.
          Do not ea=
t 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before you start.=

          Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.
=
          See the difference in your personality before and after.
        =
  Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some =
sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possibl=
e.
          I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being di=
scussed.

          Kind Love and Regards
          manish
          You ma=

            I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of =
mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants t=
o be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousan=
ds of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantra=
s and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of different resu=
lts from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this =
commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborat=
e.

            Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low lev=
el beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not qu=
ite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commandin=
g higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually elevated pe=
rson with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to=
 is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only=
 a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this=
 commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:

  =
          The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many being=
s and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between=
 them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able t=
o perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts =
but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences =
the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then ca=
uses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (sp=
ecific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the=
 universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.

 =
           Each set of "karmic interactions between various objects" is a "=
result". Various mantras are for various "results". One may term merging se=
lf-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as "co=
mmanding a result" from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essent=
ially that.

            *        *        *

            But the bottomlin=
e is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command speci=
fic results from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but act=
ing as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Na=
ture). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishi=
s are meant for such sadhakas.

            Those are hardly of use to so m=
any people out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They=
 cannot command specific results from god (because of their heavy attachmen=
t to the result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited =
ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the ass=
ociated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these techni=
calities, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at God's door=
.

            Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracte=
d to, without worrying about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble=
 and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you wan=
t. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.

            Keep pr=
aying every day or every second when you are able to. Even when you are not=
 praying, remember him in all of your actions. When you enjoy something in =
the material world, tell yourself that it is his and that he gave it to you=
. If you remember him all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start=
 to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important t=
han picking the right mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too base=
d on unreliable knowledge coming from questionable sources!).

            =
*        *        *

            There may be a mountain with thousands of =
paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (dif=
ferent experience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert=
 advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see=
 a specific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped p=
erson without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only t=
o person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully c=
limb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).

   =
         Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually cli=
mb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and trav=
erse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are=
 bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantr=
a advice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by =
doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a po=
werful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after*=
 one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a=
 path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particula=
rly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive th=
e climb along the long path.

            We need to emphasize the attitude=
 and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice=
 of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spir=
itual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pickin=
g the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having =
the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persisten=
ce, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful =

god.

            You can do anyday. Parasara does not mentio=

            In fact, if one wants, o=

            Parasara's definitio=
n of gandanta is restricted to two neighboring areas in a contiguous space =
having a predominance of fire and water elements. "I see fire and I see wat=
er. So there is gandanta" is a wrong approach. One can then call Venus, a w=
atery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a wat=
ery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *transition* in a contiguous spac=
e.

            In your example of upapada lord's tithi, there is no contig=
uous space where there is a water-fire transition.

            Dear Sanjay,

    =
        > Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, I am dropp=
ing that

            I do have a definition of gandanta, which is Parasara=
's definition in BPHS.

            Since some of you are extrapolating it =
based on the fire embodied in UL and water embodied in tithis, the onus is =
on you to outline and justify your definition. I got into this thread becau=
se statements were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a =
chart can cause "insult to Vishnu", "serious doshas" and "danger to spouse"=
, based on these far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.

            > Whi=
ch is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.

            Well, y=
ou once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent =
Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful. Now, you associated UL, an arud=
ha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri and water. I question w=
hether the new theory on fasting is really in line with everything you have=
 learnt (and taught).

            BTW, I specifically asked for a clarific=
ation on whether this was based on your own thinking or from classics/param=
para (see quoted mail below for the full context). Like so many times with =
similar questions I asked privately and recently publicly, you did not resp=
ond.

            *        *        *

            > Statement 1 is an arro=

thers to be done on specific days are irrlevant and
            > not of mu=
ch consequence.

            First of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fas=
ting on specific weekdays or tithis based on any arudhas or houses in a cha=
rt.

            For doshas in birth chart or to get relief from planetary =
afflictions or to get the blessings of planets, he suggested various *homas=
* (fire rituals) and described how to perform them. His section on remedial=
 measures is full of various homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taug=
ht by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so=
 that anybody can do them by themselves.

            Parasara did *not* sp=

Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosh=
a), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But t=
he days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.

            Thu=
s, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.

            Se=
cond, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated =
principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring pe=
ople that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause "dan=
ger to spouse" or "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu", based on horoscop=
e. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may=
 be a little difference between doing an austerity on different days, but m=
y point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and =
not doing at all and that doing it on a "wrong day" does not cause danger a=
s being suggested.

            Third, our shastras primarily talk about wo=
rshipping various deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deit=
y*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra =
is better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the p=

            I did =
not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is l=
imited and we should take our limitations into consideration.

            =
The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many=
 objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Acc=
ordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectl=
y control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the ma=
ntra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra=
. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes inter=
nal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to =
the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe =
and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.

           =
 However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to=
 one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the min=
d fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is =
quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extrem=
ely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantra a=
nd mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

            *    =
    *        *

            Just repeating a combination of sounds does not=
 guarantee anything. Some people may think that certain results come when t=
hey repeat a mantra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A=
 mantra may work for one person quickly and another may spend the whole lif=
e chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a =
mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult =
than one may think.

            *        *        *

            A highly =
learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to command the king and =
get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging the=
 king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sure).

            S=
imilarly, most people are better off begging god for what they want rather =
than trying to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar doe=
s not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of =
humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what hel=
p a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge=
. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good b=
eggar at god's door.

            What people today need for material and s=
piritual progress through remedial measures is a better attitude in begging=
 god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras and other specifi=
cs such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result from god.

     =
       It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in=
 the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra based o=
n horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - sur=
render, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility e=
tc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be oversmart w=
ith the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

            *        * =
       *

            One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis,=
 but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based=
 on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely=
 based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various tradi=
tions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures =
associate various mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. =
For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A=
6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so o=
n. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's astrologers, way beyond th=
e scope of Parasara's guidelines.

            If one has a sadguru, I reco=
mmend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theore=
tician.

            If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right pa=
th. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to=
) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latte=
r is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god's door.=
 Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in b=
eing a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than grea=
t scholars.

            Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchaksha=
ri, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna mah=
a mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) ca=
n help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without the ri=
ght attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.

         =
   *        *        *

            I hope this sufficiently clarifies my s=
tand. I discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana more on the vedi=
c-wisdom yahoogroup. Some writings are sampled at http://www.vedicastrologe=
r.org/homam/writings.htm.

asimha,

              Since you do not have any real definition of Gandant=
a, I am dropping that and continue with my belief of the junction between A=
gni and Jala rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctions. Which is =
perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.

              Two stateme=
nts you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. =
Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out here -

          =
    1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as th=
e sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results mayb=
e a bit delayed but will be there.
              2. Statement 2: *reciting =
any prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy=


              Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?

=
              Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra =
is bogus and has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasa=
ra and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much con=
sequence. This sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back wh=
ose statements like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so=
 that people are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.

              =
Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and t=
he Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantr=
as for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman=
 when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take p=
aracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to write a boo=
k on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.

        =
      I think there is something wrong in the way you are saying what you w=
ant to say. Please rethink and correct your statements for the sake of good=
 record in this list.

fter all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the ele=
ment of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Ven=
us (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marria=
ge is represented by water element and fasting on UL lord's tithi brings th=
e element of water (prosperity and well-being) to one's marriage (UL)? One =
could even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited =
as it brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and=
 causes "gandanta"!
              > 
              > [Sanjay Rath:] UL is t=
he Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is=
 the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everything throug=
h the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to the lor=
dships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will=
 be a *more correct* answer.
              >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

       =
       [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun=
 (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).

              Thus, 12th=
 house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of=
 maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and S=
hiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be as=
sociated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the t=
ripod method in dasa judgment.

              Thus, it is actually more log=
ical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and=
 UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.

              Is the above=
 "*more correct* answer" based on your own thinking or is it from a classic=
 or from tradition?

              <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
            >=
 The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day's fasting is far more ef=
fective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on =
digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fa=
st or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of=
 the mantra.
            > 
            > [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree wit=
h this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On da=
ys when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to bur=
n and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is=
 many many times better than complete fasting.

            >>>>>> End quot=
e >>>>>>

            [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is des=
tined to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy=
 on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should med=
itate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In a=
ny case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are he=
avily restrained in effectiveness.

            >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

            [Narasimha] Putt=
ing a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. But the ques=
tion is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in w=
ater, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.

            My point=
 is that the examples given have no real identifiable contact between water=
 and fire.

            One can be creative and come up with a lot of theor=
ies. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all r=
asis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and som=
e as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause c=
ontact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of =
the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.

    =
        It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what counts =
as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.

            Just a factual correction tho=
ugh
            : I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after=
 my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other things went down=
 (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana =
intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, m=
y guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasar=
a independently, meditate on them and share my interpretations with the wor=
ld. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he =
wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachment.=
 He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me t=
o do it as an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.

           =
 What I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said=
 above.

            However, if your judgment is correct and if Jyotish is=

 later and change his command to me.

r a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a specific pu=

be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!

  > 
            > [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you se=

hould choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are th=
e same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few =
days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you=
 did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you =
are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.

            >>>>>> End q=
uote >>>>>>

            [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.

       =
     Is all that is being taught and practiced now strictly from "Puranas a=
nd other teachings of the seers"?

            I did not say all days and t=
ithis are the same. Of course, there is some difference. But, it is not as =
big as being made here.

            To make khoa, whether one uses cow mil=
k or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or =
another cow does make some difference. But it is secondary. To say that "da=
nger" and "serious doshas" (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be ca=
used by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will=
 take 100 years to make is also a gross exaggeration.

            The main=
 thing is that you need milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claim=
s of khoa making consultants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will =
be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick some milk or the other, take su=
gar and start cooking khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job wi=
ll be done.

            I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humb=
ly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fas=
ting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause "danger" and "ser=
ious doshas". No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and =
dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not h=
elp our cause!

            Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversel=
l it or overplay the importance...

            [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is=
 much more, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a g=

reases the efficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna vrata, medi=
