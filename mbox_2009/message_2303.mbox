On the contrary, there have been notable Brahmanas who hav=
e associated themselves with "lower caste people", changed them into Brahma=
nas and arguably "attained greatness".
 
When Srila Prabhupada, for example=
, came to the West and taught Krishna Bhakti to all and sundry with compass=
ion and without differentiating a drug addict hippie from a religious schol=
ar, he sowed the seed for one of the greatest bhakti movements ever. I marv=
el when I look at how many Brahmanas of a very high order have been created=
 as a result of his selfless and compassionate actions! Imagine a 69 year o=
ld man walking barefooted on the streets of a very cold foreign city filled=
 with men of material pursuits and wondering how to start the mission of es=
tablishing devotion to Krishna there! Only a man whose heart is devoted to =
Krishna and his Guru can do it.
 
Upasani maharaj, who lived a century ago,=
 was a great scholar of Vedas and Upanishads. Shirdi Sai Baba once called h=
im god himself in a human body and did ritual worship to him. He once went =
and lived in Harijanawada (colony of untouchables) with harijans (untouchab=
les) and did things like sweeping the floors with them. He taught Vedic kno=
wledge to harijans and women.
 
Jnaneshwar Maharaj pleaded with the learned=
 Brahmanas and keepers of dharma at Paithan to interpret dharma shastras wi=
th compassion and wisdom. When they failed and the Brahmanas of Alandi cont=
inued to consider his family (of three brothers and a sister, considered as=
 incarnations of Trinity and Shakti) outcastes, he went and lived with lowe=
r caste people and taught his Marathi translation of Bhagavad Gita to them =
first. He was first adored by lower caste people and Brahmanas came to him =
later. Irrespective of caste, so many people in western India are influence=
d in their thinking and attitude by Jnaneshwar Maharaj today! His interpret=
ation of Bhagavad Gita is arguably the best ever.
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
 was orthodox in the beginning. Though he worshipped Mother Kaali at the te=
mple, he refused to eat Her prasad (food offered to Her and eaten by devote=
es later) as it was not cooked by a Braahmana! He left after the pooja with=
out taking prasad and ate food cooked by himself. Such barriers were broken=
 down later as he realized Self. He requested a rich landlord to give him a=
 lower caste servant he had with him and turned that boy into a saint of a =
very high order. Despite being illiterate, Swami Adbhutananda (Latu Maharaj=
) had spiritual experiences and spiritual realization that many Brahmanas w=
ho spend their entire lives memorizing Vedas and Upanishads cannot even fat=
hom. When the young man was meditating in the muggy Calcutta weather and wa=
s profusely sweating, there were times when Ramakrishna himself sat in fron=
t of him and fanned him! Such was his love for the young sadhaka from a low=
er caste. Ramakrishna also freely associated with fallen drunkards (e.g. Gi=
rish and Kalipad) and turned them into devoted men of god. He once took the=
 "karmik power of attorney" from Girish and told him, "you are free to do w=
hatever you want. Drink, pursue women and do whatever you want. Nothing wil=
l happen to you. Each bad karma performed by you will come to me." Girish c=
ontinued his debauched lifestyle for some more time, but reformed later. Wh=
enever he did something bad, he could not stand the thought that Ramakrishn=
a was to receive the karmik punishment. So he reformed. In later days, Swam=
i Vivekananda held Girish in great respect and Girish touched many lives. T=
hough some believe that Ramakrishna's throat cancer was because of taking o=
n Girish's karmas, obviously he thought it was worth it. It had several pur=
poses.
 
*        *        *
 
Dharma is not a constant.
 
Dharma is the ri=
ght thing one should do. The right action changes from person to person and=
 from time to time. The right action is a function of one's cumulative back=
ground through many lives. It is possible to lay down some generic guidelin=
es, but they can never be perfect. They need to be adopted with time.
 
***=
 Dry rice grains cannot be eaten and digested, but they stay fresh longer w=
ithout getting spoiled. Cooked rice is ready to eat and digest, but it beco=
mes stale faster. ***
 
Similarly, non-specific and unprocessed guidelines =
(that need to be processed in order to digest, i.e. put to use) remain appl=
icable longer, while specific and processed guidelines (that can be put to =
use right away) become stale faster and lose their relevance. For example, =
a statement that god is everywhere and one should see happiness and sadness=
 alike is timeless and never expires (like uncooked dry rice grains). But w=
hat do you do with it? How do you put it into practice? It is not specific.=
 On the other hand, a specific guideline that one should do so and so ritua=
l or not do so and so action is specific to a time and may not apply after =
some time.
 
The bane of many religions that are based on one prophet and o=
ne text is that the text may become stale after some time. It may have been=
 perfect for a previous time, but it may be imperfect now.
 
Though we have=
 texts in sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) also that preach specific time-lim=
ited dos and donts, we have several texts that also spread the timeless tea=
chings. So sometimes things may seem contradictory. Moreover, people transl=
ating things do not always get it right. Words are just words. A meaning is=
 the imagery generated by those words in the mind of a reader, which is con=
trolled by the mental conditioning of that reader.
 
Luckily, sanatana dhar=
ma is not based on one prophet or one text and individual sadhana for indiv=
idual Self-realization is emphasized. We have a steady stream of Self-reali=
zed saints and yogis, who interpret the words of shastras to us, through th=
eir own words and deeds!
 
They reject the cooked grains that became stale =
(i.e. sometimes break orthodox rules), take uncooked grains from shastra (t=
imeless principles), cook them with the heat of their spiritual understandi=
ng and serve the cooked food of spiritual instruction to people through the=
ir words and actions.
 
Thus, I will say to people who have a fancy for sha=
stras, "Read shastras, but do keep the above in mind and distinguish betwee=
n uncooked grains and grains that were cooked long back and may have become=
 stale by now. Try to supplement your understanding of shastras using the w=
ords and deeds of saints like Aadi Shankara, Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Chaitanya =
Mahaprabhu, Raghavendra Swami, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Para=
mahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Srila Prabhupada etc. Words of a realized person =
automatically become scripture."
 
*        *        *
 
Caste is a touchy =
topic. Unfortunately, neither orthodox people nor politically correct ratio=
nalists get it completely correct.
 
Caste is based on one's attitude and i=
nternal value system. To a braahmana, self-realization is the goal in life.=
 To a kshatriya, power and authority over others is the goal in life. To a =
vaisya, money is the goal. To a shudra, basic physical comforts are the goa=
l.
 
However, one's birth and environment do influence one's value system.
=
 
If one is born and grows up amid people who value strength, valor, vanqui=
shing others and exerting power and authority over others, there is a good =
chance that one will also start valuing those qualities. In other words, if=
 one is born and grows up amid kshatriyas, there is a good chance that one =
will become a kshatriya oneself!
 
That cannot be denied. Thus, there is a =
good chance that one will end up with the value system of one's caste of bi=
rth.
 
However, there can be exceptions. Based on other rinas from previous=
 lives and life circumstances, one's attitude can change from that indicate=
d by the family one is born into. After all, a king like Vishwamitra can be=
come a great braahmana and brahma jnaani and a shudra like Vaalmiki can bec=
ome a great braahmana and brahma jnaani. Thus, while the caste of birth is =
an important factor, it is not the only one. Caste mobility is possible bas=
ed on other circumstances faced in one's life.
 
*        *        *
 
Also=
, if a braahmana (a person interested in spiritual progress and self-realiz=
ation) associates with a shudra (a person interested in bodily comforts), t=
here is a chance that the former is influenced by the latter and becomes in=
terested in physical pleasures. Such an attachment to the body may take one=
 off the course of self-realization. Thus, you can see where the quote from=
 Manu Smriti is coming from.
 
However, making that a rigid rule is debatab=
le. Not every yogi who associates with a shudra develops attachment to body=
 and its comforts. On the contrary, one may change the shudra and make him =
realize that body is temporary and not worth worrying so much about. Throug=
h the association, he may convert the shudra into a purified devotee of god=
.
 
*        *        *
 
Read things, but have a sense of balance in under=
standing various dictums of shastra. At the end, there are infinite people =
in this world and infinite viewpoints. We are not responsible for all their=
 views. Make sure that your understanding of various things is clear and co=
nsistent.
 
Make sure that you are making spiritual progress and slowly ove=
rcoming ego and attachment to the body. Make sure that your devotion to god=
 is increasing and devotion to body and its comforts is decreasing. Make su=
re that your understanding of what is perennial vs what is temporary is inc=
reasing and your attachment to temporary things is decreasing. If all these=
 things are happening, then you are on the right course and will sooner or =
later realize what is worth realizing.
 
That is the most important thing a=
nd other things are secondary. Let other people do what they see as their j=
ob, as long as they do not interfere with what you see as your dharma.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha

 these professions fall under the category of  sudra`s  domain.  They hold =
that a Brahmin should not take employment from anyone (especially from sudr=

another occupation.  Verse 47 of chapter 17 of Canto 11 says that if a Brah=
mana  can not support himself through his regular duties and is suffering,h=
e  may adopt the occupation of a merchant  and overcome his destitute condi=
tion by buying and selling material things.  If he continues to suffer extr=
eme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kshat=
riya.  But under no circumstances become like a dog, accepting an ordinary =
master. Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.35) also states  that this is one of the sy=
mptoms of Kaliyuga. It says," Businessmen will engage in petty commerce and=
 earn their money by cheating. Even when there is no emergency, people will=
 consider any degraded occupation quite acceptable.
> 
> The Dharma Sastras=
  declare that if one takes birth in a Brahmana  family but does not cultiv=
ate scriptural knowledge, he can not be accepted as a Brahmana.  Visnu Dhar=
ma Sastra 93.7 says that religious- minded  people should never give even a=
 drop of water to the hypocritical son of a   Brahmana,  who is ignorant of=
 the Vedas.  Manu Smriti 2.157   says that a brahmana  who does not study t=
he  Vedas  is  similar to a wooden elephant or a deer made of skin, i.e.,  =
an elephant or deer only in name but does not function effectively as such.=
  Moreover,  the same   smriti  says that until a  Brahmana  qualifies hims=
elf in the  Vedas, he is on the same level as a sudra(2.172 Sudrena hi sama=
h tavad  yavad vede na jayate). In Mahabharata, Santi Parva 189.7  it has b=

are impure and indulge in all kinds of  karmic  activity in order to mainta=
in their

without discrimination, who is attached to worldly things, who will accept =
any occupation just to make money(sarvo karma karo asuchih), who has given =
