Namaste friends,
 
Which person, which entity, which organization, which mo=
vement and which religion needs to be born, needs to sustain itself, needs =
to transform and needs to "die", at which time, is decided by the Supreme P=
ower that runs the universe. Even the greatest yogis may not know everythin=
g and may know only part of the divine plan.
 
A wise sadhaka observes thin=
gs and unattachedly performs what one sees as one's dharma at a given time,=
 but does not get agitated by anything or get attached to any ideas about p=
ast or future.
 
Sanatana dharma has seen a steady stream of saints of high=
 levels of realization for a very long time, but other religions too have s=
een saints of high levels of realization, though perhaps not at the same ra=
te.
 
*        *        *
 
Even religions that you consider too rigid may =
get transformed over time, if that is the will of the Supreme Power running=
 the universe.
 
For example, Baha'i Faith is an offshoot of Islam, started=
 by Bahaullah in the 19th century Persia, and differs considerably from Isl=
am. It fits well with other faiths and experiences of saints from other fai=
ths. It has 6 million followers and that is not too bad for a relatively re=
cent religion.
 
World is far better connected today compared to 150 or 100=
 years back. The impact of a Bahaullah or a Sai Baba or a Swami Vivekananda=
 may be many times higher. God has a plan of what to do with which part of =
the world and with which religion, at which time. I suggest leaving things =
to god and doing one's own job with sincerity, equanimity and detachment.
 =

*        *        *
 
The language being used by some in this thread is in=
appropriate for this forum. Please be civil and restrained. Apart of watchi=
ng your language, one thumbrule I suggest is: do not write anything to this=
 list when there is some agitation or anger or hatred or grouse or frustrat=
ion in your mind. Write only when your mind is calm, clear and relaxed.
 
B=
est regards,
Narasimha
