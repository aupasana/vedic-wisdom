Dear Narasimha,

 

Thnak you for your email below. Please could you shar=
e your thoughts on Michael Jackson's demise?

 

He was running Ketu-Rahu. =
Ketu being 7th lord can give death. Also being a malefic in 8th from AL i s=
uppose it can give sudden unfavourable events. Being in 12th house could sh=
ow death in bed?

 

I have been a huge fan of his for the past 20 years or=
 so. Are you able to analyse his death chart?

 

Best wishes

 

Kasim

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Tale of a young man








Nama=
ste,
 
I was reading a small interview by Deepak Chopra on Michael Jackson.=
 Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into prescription medi=
cines and how that ruins some people's lives. That somehow reminded me of a=
 story.
 
Sometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show his chart=
. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brilliant from th=
e spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations. I declar=
ed, "this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of a sannyas=
i (ascetic/monk)." She broke down into tears and gave me some background. I=
 found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mother does =
not want him to.
 
This boy had been calm, peaceful, contented and an intro=
vert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he had an interesti=
ng experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was teaching math to=
 some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices. Suddenly, he st=
opped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for a while. His mi=
nd was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind returned to normalcy=
 and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense of bliss a=
nd contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.
 
He realized=
 that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in front of what he experi=
enced then. He did not want to study or do anything anymore. He only wanted=
 to experience that state. His parents became worried and took him to docto=
rs. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found nothing. He was a=
lso confined to a mental facility for one month. They put him on powerful d=
rugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doctors that there=
 was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understand what he expe=
rienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he was normal and had no pr=
oblem. The powerful drugs he received during the month wreaked havoc on him=
, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doctors. He says he underst=
ands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He does not want to =
hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but does not know how to get=
 it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material life will not g=
et him what he wants.
 
When I chatted with him alone, I realized that he i=
s a brilliant young man with clear thinking. He is certainly not a mad pers=
on. He just needs someone to show him a spiritual path to make something pe=
rmanent, which temporarily came to him and left him! To get it permanently =
now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also took him to many so-c=
alled swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice given anyone. He s=
tarted reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and liked some of them. But=
 he is still without a clear direction.
 
Interestingly, just when I was ab=
out to chat with this person after making his parents leave, my guru Manish=
 called me. He asked me what was going on. I mentioned that I was about to =
talk to a teenager who had a nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, checke=
d it out and confirmed my feeling that this boy had great spiritual potenti=
al.
 

Unfortunately, the system we have in place looked at him with suspic=
ion and gave powerful drugs to mess up his mind for one full month! He is l=
ucky and survived the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live in that s=
omeone who realizes, albeit momentarily, the essence of scriptures, is labe=
led as a mentally disturbed person and powerful drugs are given to him, ins=
tead of clear spiritual direction to make that realization more permanent.

Narasimha
