 Some people are proud of their wealth, their fame and social position, but
these things are transitory. None can take them away after death. It is not
good to be proud of wealth. You may say, "I am wealthy," but then there are
millionaires, multimillionaires, and so on. In the evening fireflies think
that they are lighting the world; but when the stars begin to shine, their
pride is subdued.

The stars in turn think that they are lighting the world, but when the moon
shines, the stars are put to shame. The moon, too, believes that her light
illumines everything; but lo! the dawn appears and the rising sun effaces
the light of the moon. If wealthy people thought of these things, they would
no longer be proud of their wealth.

A householder! Revered Sir, we are householders; please give us some further
instructions. Sri Ramakrishna: First know God, then perform the duties of a
householder.[p. 75 & 76]
