Dear Narasimha,
=A0
Could you please explain a few terms and their differen=
ces?
=A0
1) Hiranyagarbha - how is it different from Shiva/Vishnu/Narayana/=
Kali etc. Is it the same an Ishwara?
=A0
2) What is "Prana" or "vital force=
" as some people translate the term. Is it just a manifestation of Shakti? =
What it it's relation to Brahman.
=A0
3) What is Prajapati? How is it diffe=
rent from Hiranyagarbha? 
=A0
4) What is viraj? How is it different from Hi=
ranyagarbha?
=A0
5) In the last few centuries or more, we have never read o=
f any sadhaka or yogi who has done any sadhanas for Hiranyagarbha or Viraj.=
 We only read of them when someone is discussion the Upanishats, not practi=
cal sadhana.=A0We see only sadhakas attaining communion with deities like S=
iva, Vishnu, Krishna, Kali etc. What could be the reason?
=A0
=A0
Thanks in=
 advance for your time and patience!
=A0
-Regards

e upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra
