 10th October, 1948

A few days ago, Mahadeva Sastri, son of Kavyakanta Gan=
apati Sastri, came
here. Bhagavan introduced him to us all.

As he is now l=
iving in this place our talk turned on his father Sri
Kavyakanta yesterday =
afternoon. Bhagavan began telling us:

=93When I was living in Virupaksha C=
ave, sometime in 1903, Nayana* came there
with his family. At that time thi=
s Mahadeva was about four or five years of
age. Nayana prostrated before me=
 and then asked the little boy to do
likewise.

He appeared not to have hea=
rd it and, with an air of indifference, kept
quiet. Nayana too did not mind=
 it. Then,all of a sudden, that boy prostrated
before me in full length (Sa=
shtanga namaskaram).

Like a young boy who has had his Thread Ceremony he p=
laced his hands on his
ears and then touched my feet.

I wondered how that =
little boy could have known the correct procedure of
prostration and felt t=
hat it must have come from family traditions.=94

=93You know what I did on=
e day? Seating Mahadeva on my back I began swimming
in the tank opposite th=
e Pachiamman Shrine from one end to the other.

When we were halfway throug=
h he began pressing me down, greatly elated,
shouting =91Aha, Hai!=92 as ca=
rt drivers do to their bullocks.

Another devotee enquired if it were a fac=
t that Bhagavan and Nayana used to
swim in the Pandava Tank.

Bhagavan repl=
ied, =93Yes. That also was only in those days.We used to try to
excel each =
other in swimming. That was great fun.=94

Another devotee said, =93It seem=
s you played marbles with children?=94

Bhagavan replied, =93Yes. That was =
so. That too was while we were in the
Virupaksha Cave. The holes dug for th=
e purpose of playing marbles must be
there even now. Those
children sometim=
es used to bring packets of sweets.We all shared them.

During Dipavali the=
y used to put aside my share of crackers and bring them
up to me. We used t=
o fire the crackers together. It was most entertaining.=94
