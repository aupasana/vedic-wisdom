Namaste

It is good to hear you have checked the brain and head etc, so tha=
t is very good.

I am just a sadhak on the journey like all and am not a sp=
iritual master.
I do my things,try to move forward, and share information i=
f I have and know it is authentic.

Movement like ant is a sign of Kundalin=
i Shakti awakening and movement, normally one feels in the spinal cord from=
 bottom to top

There are other signs too jumping like frog, seeing varoius=
 lights, laughing, crying, tongue getting pulled in and up etc. one can fin=
d all about this in many good books available today.

I wish you all the be=
st in your endevours, Sri Ganapati Sacchidanada
Swami of Mysore a living da=
tta avatar has capabilities to help in situations like this. I am sure ther=
e are others saints too, if you have access to him or other great Saint, th=
ey can help.

If you feel like above than you can try meeting spiritual mas=
ters who have capability to awaken kundalini and also give guidance. Again =
depeding on your location you may be able to reach one of them.

Swami Shiv=
om Tirth Maharaj was a very capable and renouned shaktipatacharya and he es=
tablished many ashrams in India. These places are very authentic. In Nasik =
there is Narayan Kaka. So it all depends on your comfort and to a great ext=
ent where your sanskars lead you. I am sure there are other equally good sa=
ints too.

Also advice from Narasimha and others may be of great help too.

Best Regards
Mitesh
