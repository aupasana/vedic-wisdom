Dear Utpalji

Namaste=
 Narasimha & other Sanskrit Scholars,

One pending issue with me which i wi=
sh to put in front of all of you 
for clarifications-

Take instance of Jyo=
tish Classics. I've seen Scholars (Who are 
having knowledge of Jyotisha as=
 well as Sankrita) debating endlessly 
on a particular verse . one or two l=
ines or sometimes even a couple 
of words in a verse seems to create great =
confusions. we have seen 
that different scholars tend to interpret and der=
ive different 
meaning from a same verse. i took the example of jyotish cla=
ssics 
because we are more familiar with controversies in that area.

This =
confusion is also applicable in other literature of Sanskrit 
language.

Wh=
y Sanskrit (Held as the finest language and mother of all the 
other langua=
ge - One Arabic language teacher recently made a bold 
comment that basis o=
f Arabic language is sanskrit) should create so 
much confusions among the =
scholars. is it that ambiguous or the 
writers didn't wrote in a clutter-le=
ss fashion or the current 
generation is not sharp enough to grasp the righ=
t meaning. Whatever 
may be the case, why a verse should fail to give one a=
 simple 
undisputable meaning at least literally like in our modern languag=
es?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
