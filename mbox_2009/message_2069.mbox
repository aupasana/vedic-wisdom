Dear Manishji
=A0
Narasimha has very clearly explained this before in a mai=
l. I could not find the exact mail, but the gist of it is that if you want =
spiritual growth ONLY, then doing any sadhana during an eclipse is good. Bu=
t if your aim is material, or anything short of pure spirituality, then it =
maynot be the best option. 

-Regards
=A0Rajarshi

The upsurge (of consciou=
sness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Hello All,

I read somewhere that japam done D=
URING grahan has huge effect. But now I read on a website that 

"Perform r=
itual bath, Puja, Japam, havan and all other rituals ONLY AFTER Grahan Moks=
h Kaal (the time when grahan is released)."

It says to do japa only after =
grahan is over.Is this true?

How is this Grahan Moksh Kaal calculated? 

T=
hanks,
Manish
