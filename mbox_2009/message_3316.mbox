One day, one of the devotees came to Bhagava=
n and said in an excited whisper, "Look, Bhagavan! Just look at that man!"
=

Everyone turned to look. We saw a gentleman who was asleep, swaying back a=
nd forth. The gentleman who had approached Bhagavan complained, "I have bee=
n watching him for the past few days. He always sleeps in Bhagavan's presen=
ce."

Bhagavan looked at the devotee and said, "That man is doing what he c=
ame here to do. But what about you? Did you come here just to check on peop=
le, and see who is awake and who is asleep? Why don't you mind your own bus=
iness?"

Seeing the overzealous devotee rebuked like this, all the others b=
urst out laughing.

Bhagavan did not like it at all when people complained =
about others. He used to say that as long as a person concentrated on the w=
ork he was engaged in, he would not even notice what others were doing.=C2=
=A0One can find the time to criticize others only when one's attention wand=
ered from the work at hand.
