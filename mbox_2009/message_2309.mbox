Practical Religion: Breathing And Meditation (Delivered in San Francisco,
A=
pril 5, 1900)

What is the difference between men and animals? ... "Food an=
d [sleep],
procreation of the species, and fear exist in common with the an=
imals. There
is one difference: Man can control all these and become God, t=
he master."
Animals cannot do it. Animals can do charitable work. Ants do i=
t. Dogs do
it. What is the difference then? Men can be masters of themselve=
s. They can
resist the reaction to anything.... The animal cannot resist an=
ything. He is
held ... by the string of nature everywhere. That is all the =
distinction. One
is the master of nature, the other the slave of nature. Wh=
at is nature? The
five senses....

[The conquest of internal nature] is the=
 only way out, according to Yoga....
The thirst for God is religion.... Goo=
d works and all that [merely] make the
mind a little quiet. To practice thi=
s =97 to be perfect =97 all depends upon our
past. I have been studying [Yo=
ga] all my life and have made very little
progress yet. But I have got enou=
gh [result] to believe that this is the
only true way. The day will come wh=
en I will be master of myself. If not in
this life, [in another life]. I wi=
ll struggle and never let go. Nothing is
lost. If I die this moment, all my=
 past struggles [will come to my help].
Have you not seen what makes the di=
fference between one man and another? It
is their past. The past habits mak=
e one man a genius and another man a
fool. You may have the power of the pa=
st and can succeed in five minutes.
None can predict the moment of time. We=
 all have to attain [perfection] some
time or other.
