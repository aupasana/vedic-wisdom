Sai Ram Everyone.
We are teaching Lingasthakam to our Balvikas Kids.  I loo=
ked at various scripts and it all looks different.  Some of the differences=
 we noticed:
1. Nirmala Baashita or  Nirmala Baasita
2. Shobita or sObita
3=
. Astha Dharidra Vinashitha / Astha dharidra Vinashana
4. Vinaashana / Vina=
ashaka

Can someone help us with a correct version of Lingasthakam?  Your h=
elp is greatly appreciated. You can send the document to sureshes@...=
 

Thank you,
Suresh
