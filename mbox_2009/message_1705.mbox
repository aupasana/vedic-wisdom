Namaste,

If someone is cheating you or hurting you now, there are two things 
happening simultaneously:

(1) You cheated or hurt that person in a previous life. Nature has created a 
situation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed that 
person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.

(2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the 
opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in the 
action while identifying with the action ("I am doing it"), he now gets a 
new karma. He will be paid back later.

Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification 
and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid 
back for what you did before.

*        *        *

In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody does something 
to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don't think "why does it 
have to happen to me". Think only about your current action ("what is the 
best thing for me to do NOW?") and do NOT think about what happened, why it 
happened, who did it and how things happening to you are unfair.

The tricky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back 
somebody else's bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do so. 
You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to someone! But 
remember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense of doership ("I am 
doing") will create a new karma, even if the other person brought it on 
himself with a previous action.

If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and surrendering 
the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is 
very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also 
postpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the 
temptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we live 
in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion, 
self-control and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most 
troublesome karmas to a later time.

When the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who is 
not in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So you 
can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large 
extent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.

Best regards,
Narasimha
