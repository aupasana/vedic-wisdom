Namaste Aswin ji,
 
I am very happy to hear that. All the very best!
 
Whil=
e Dwaraka area is very good, Manish said that an area closer to Girnar moun=
tains (e.g. Junagadh) will be better for this purpose. Please consider his =
input.
 
Just do it as an offering to the Mother and do it with as little e=
go or sense of "I am doing this" or "I am doing something important" as pos=
sible.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Na=
rsimhaji,
        I am glad to know this and perhaps I will be the lucky pe=
rson to start the first center in India. Money is no problem when Jagdamba =
is with me. I will be happy to be the instrument in this great devine missi=
on. First I will start this at the place near Dwarka. This is the extreme w=
est coast of India. I have stayed there for 7 years and good contacts are t=
here. It may be at Okha port or Near Harsiddhi temple near Dwarka or near G=
opnath (?) one of the Dwadash Jyotirlingam near Dwarka. You just pray for m=
e and also tell Manishji also to bless me so that I can succeed. Next I wil=
l think for Ujjain.

          =EF=BB=BF 
          Namaste Ashwin ji,=


          My guru's idea is to start four such centers in east, west, nor=
th and south parts of India and then establish one in Ujjain.

          Th=
e idea with each center is as following: It should be in some peaceful and =
calm place that is easily accessible by modern transportation and yet a lit=
tle away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. There need not be a big=
 or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible expansion i=
n future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with four pillars=
 on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from rain. The are=
a is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Close to it, a=
 small one or two room structure is built to store materials.

          A =
priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he should b=
e a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifestyle dedi=
cated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, one more in=
 forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chandi homam =
in the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no idols to wor=
ship and no other rituals to do.

          This will pretty much take up a=
ll his time and hence enough money should be arranged to take care of the p=
riest and his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi h=
omam, that is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most important thing =
is that he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother. If one ha=
s the basic simplicity, innocence, devotion and purity, other things will f=
all in place by themselves.

          Buying of the land and construction =
of room and homa kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Sala=
ry of the priest and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing=
 expense. This project requires a good amount of money and energy.

       =
   *        *        *

          After a center is established and sadhana=
 progresses in each center, slowly the presence of Mother will be establish=
ed there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will start making faster progress.=
 As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will generate more and more en=
ergy.

          After establishing 4 other centers, a center in Ujjain is =
to be started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi homam centers will have=
 a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many many people will star=
t doing different kinds of homas around the world. This will have a major i=
mpact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.

          *       =
 *        *

          I did not want to force or impose on anybody. So thi=
s has waited. When the time comes, people who will make this happen will co=
me and take charge.

          Time has probably not yet come for Ujjain. B=
ut if there is a village in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, p=
lease consider. But please realize that this requires money commitment and =
also a committed sadhaka.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

                   Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few sn=
ippets from an 
                                interview posted on her web=
site. Please see below.

                                It is interesting =
that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
               =
                 is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fi=
re ceremonies and 
                                show what is truth" and =
"at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
                       =
         is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appe=
ared to 
                                him during Shata Chandi homam at C=
hennai.

                                She told him that many people are =
and will be born who will perform a short 
                                =
fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the =

                                world and also make quick spiritual progre=
ss individually in that process. 
                                Shree Maa=
's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar 
            =
                    lines.

                                My guru was als=
o told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
              =
                  should be established around the world, where Chandi homa=
m is done 3 times a 
                                day. These places do n=
ot need to be near any temples or famous places and 
                      =
          can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, t=
here is no 
                                need to offer silk sarees etc i=
n fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
                                =
offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a =

                                few such centres are established, it will =
apparently lead to a chain of 
                                events that =
will help re-establish sanatana dharma.

                                Th=
ough not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for =

                                3 years in the same place and finished 100=
0 such homas. That is fantastic! 
                                It is the=
 sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings 
           =
                     deities to a place. While several ancient temples are =
without any divine 
                                presence these days, ne=
w places of divine presence may be created by pure 
                       =
         souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the w=
orld.

                                As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa=
 of the Shata Chandi homam during which 
                                Mo=

    =
                            taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and t=
he time of sankalpa was within 
                                a few minut=
es from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. 
         =
                       All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of=
