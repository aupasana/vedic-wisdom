Namaste Rajarshri ji,

Something moving at an extremely fast pace does not=
 observe space-time
as you or I do.

There are a set of particles called Ta=
chyons which move at speeds
greater than that of light and whole of cause a=
nd effect gets reversed
for them.

So this idea of linear cause followed by=
 effect makes sense only here,
and this cannot be superimposed on other fra=
mes of reference, where the
question itself may breakdown.

Wow, this is su=
ch a lovely mail.

Now carrying this forward in some kind of a fantasy worl=
d (of which one
has no direct "real" experience)...is it that the grosser (=
impure) we
are, the slower we move in respect to light (god?)? ...the more =
lighter
(pure) we become, the more closer we could move in respect of
light=
?...and then we can perhaps "jump" the space-time duality....the
way the yo=
ung boy jumped it while looking  into the fire during homam?

karma / desti=
ny applies only in a dualistic framework, isn't it?...or
the time-space dim=
ension that we presently live in?

As for free will ... is'nt there some re=
lationship between this and
quantum mechanics where if the position of the =
particle is "pinned down"
the speed of the particle cannot be determined an=
d vice versa??? So
everything may not be fully determined / determinable?..=
.and that is
where free will kicks in???

Supreme co=

field of duali=
ty within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time
continua within =
the field of duality exist within Him. From the
perspective of supreme cosm=

His parts and all their individu=
al wills are parts of His cosmic will.
As all space-time continua are withi=

unknown to Him. Past, present and future; h=

you and others, this possibility, that possib=
ility and yet another
possibility - all are accessible and fully "known" to=
 His
self-awareness.
