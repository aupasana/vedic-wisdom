Namaste Rajarshi,

I think you make a very good point. You've raised something that has
made me stop to think many times. It seems to me that Swami Vivekananda
made many statements - especially about Hinduism and India - that could
be construed to be disparaging of other religions and cultures, and that
to me at least seemed a little unwarranted.

Whether this can be put down simply to naivete, or whether it served
some purpose which we do not see, and is now taken out of context, I
don't know. In either case I have yet to reconcile those statements with
the rest of his teachings.

Kind regards,

Samir
