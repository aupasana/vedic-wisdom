THE GOAL (Delivered in San Francisco, March 27, 1900)

Why did the infinite=
 God make this world? [The dualist says:] Just as the
potter makes pots. Go=
d the potter; we the pots. . . . In more philosophical
language the questio=
n is: How is it taken for granted that the real nature
of man is pure, perf=
ect, and infinite? This is the one difficulty found in
any system of monism=
. Everything else is clean and clear. This question
cannot be answered. The=
 monists say the question itself is a contradiction.

Take the system of du=
alism =97 the question is asked why God created the
world. This is contradi=
ctory. Why? Because =97 what is the idea of God? He is
a being who cannot b=
e acted upon by anything outside.

You and I are not free. I am thirsty. Th=
ere is something called thirst, over
which I have no control, [which] force=
s me to drink water. Every action of
my body and even every thought of my m=
ind is forced out of me. I have got to
do it. That is why I am bound . . . =
. I am forced to do this, to have this,
and so on . . . . And what is meant=
 by why and wherefore? [Being subject to
external forces.] Why do you drink=
 water? Because thirst forces you. You are
a slave. You never do anything o=
f your own will because you are forced to do
everything. Your only motive f=
or action is some force. . . .

The earth, by itself, would never move unle=
ss something forced it. Why does
the light burn? It does not burn unless so=
mebody comes and strikes a match.
Throughout nature, everything is bound. S=
lavery, slavery! To be in harmony
with nature is [slavery]. What is there i=
n being the slave of nature and
living in a golden cage? The greatest law a=
nd order is in the [knowledge
that man is essentially free and divine] Now =
we see that the question why
and wherefore can only be asked [in ignorance]=
. I can only be forced to do
something through something else.

[You say] G=
od is free. Again you ask the question why God creates the world.
You contr=
adict yourself. The meaning of God is entirely free will. The
question put =
in logical language is this: What forced Him, who can never be
forced by an=
ybody, to create the world? You say in the same question, What
forced Him? =
The question is nonsense. He is infinite by His very nature; He
is free. We=
 shall answer questions when you can ask them in logical
language. Reason w=
ill tell you that there is only one Reality, nothing else.
Wherever dualism=
 has risen, monism came to a head and drove it out.

Many want pleasure [as=
] the goal. For that pleasure they seek only the
senses. On the higher plan=
es much pleasure is to be sought. Then on
spiritual planes. Then in himself=
 =97 God within him. The man whose pleasure
is outside of [himself] becomes=
 unhappy when that outside thing goes. You
cannot depend for this pleasure =
upon anything in this universe. If all my
pleasures are in myself, I must h=
ave pleasure there all the time because I
can never lose my Self. . . . Mot=
her, father, child, wife, body, wealth =97
everything I can lose except my =
self . . . bliss in the Self All desire is
contained in the Self. . . . Thi=
s is individuality which never changes, and
this is perfect.

Whatever we [=
think] that we become. If you think you are poor sinners you
hypnotise your=
selves: "I am a miserable, crawling worm." Those who believe
in hell are in=
 hell when they die; those who say that they will go to heaven
[go to heave=
n].

There is not much value in books, and in [secondhand] religion there i=
s no
value whatsoever. It is like eating. Your religion would not satisfy m=
e
Jesus saw God and Buddha saw God. If you have not seen God, you are no
be=
tter than the atheist. Only he is quiet, and you talk much and disturb the
=
world with your talk. Books and bibles and scriptures are of no use. I met
=
an old man when I was a boy; [he did not study any scripture, but he
transm=
itted the truth of God by a touch].

Silence ye teachers of the world. Sile=
nce ye books. Lord, Thou alone speak
and Thy servant listeneth. . . . If tr=
uth is not there, what is the use of
this life? We all think we will catch =
it, but we do not. Most of us catch
only dust. God is not there. If no God,=
 what is the use of life? Is there
any resting-place in the universe? [It i=
s up to us to find it]; only we do
not [search for it intensely. We are] li=
ke a little piece of maw carried on
in the current.
