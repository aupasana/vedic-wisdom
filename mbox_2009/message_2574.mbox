=A0 
Namas=
te Anup ji,

My Daily Homam is still Ganapati Homam. I recite Chandi Paath =
daily. To clarify, i didn't move from Ganapti Homam to Chandi Homam (I thin=
k you wish to ask the same). However i perform chandi Homam occasionally.

=
Regarding your query of switching from Ganapati Homam to some other homam, =
i can only say that it depends upon individual. once can have strong intuit=
ion/urge to switch to some other deity. some people might get indirect or d=
irect indications. i do not know about the criteria to fix a time frame for=
 switch. peronally for me, i am not having any such urge/intuition/ indicat=
ions till date and i have left it to my guru to suggest if at all there nee=
ds a shift from Ganapati Homam to some other homam (say Chandi Homam). howe=
ver, i must say that i've liking towards Chandi homa.

warm regards,
Utpal
