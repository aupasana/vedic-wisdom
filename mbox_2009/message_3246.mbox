I know a devotee of Krishna - not just a devotee but one who sees
Krishna=
=A0during his=A0meditations and have experienced samadhi many times
over, w=
ho is=A0omnivorous.

Hello Rajarshi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I was intrigued by above line in your mail and =
want to know more about this devotee. Do you know him as a friend and is he=
 a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or=
 a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life after=A0 he had t=
hese samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.

In the Gita L=
ord is saying whatever you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is offering a=
ll these non-veg to Lord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all around??

=
My curious questions are not against your acceptance of his exexperienceut =
to learn more.After all he is part of hidden violence. Somebody is inflicti=
ng gruesome=A0 pain and misery on animals and birds on his behalf and he is=
 consuming them and yet he is experiencing all these exotic=A0 visions, But=
 no feeling of kindness towards birds and animals.

Where did I go wrong? S=
imple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/pepper but no such samadh=
i? 

When we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a boo=
k/article=A0 about Dayamata who succeded=A0 Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she w=
ent to India and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has stopped. Mas=
ter said, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was doing=A0 secr=
etly.

This is very complex world. No outright solutions for so many diffic=
ult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east ar=
e fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of S=
piritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also enemies there?? Their =
Gods said in their holy books that animals are their food. So they cannot e=
ven think about souls in animals or their pain and emotions.

Then I have r=
ead stories about several people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg a=
nd how they exexperience=A0 spiritual highs and other such phenomena. It is=
 so difficult to comprehend.=A0 Would they remain in the cycle of b/d=A0 ti=
ll they learn about kindness???

Kind Regards
LaxmiNarayan
