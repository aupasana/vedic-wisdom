Namaste

Very interesting question !

There are many ways to look at it. I =
have some perspective on this too.

When a person does more spiritual sadha=
na, they loose interest in
their looks and start growing hairs and beard. T=
his in general make 
them less attractive, offcourse in the west people get=
 attracted to 
long hairs and beard.

Now who is able to grow long beard an=
d a long hair by nature. You will 
find many few, what I mean here is, by l=
iking and not by force or any 
religoius restrictions.

Only those who have=
 better control on their senses naturally grow their 
hair or beards or tho=
se in the past have done some sadhana which led 
them to grow the hair and =
beard. Those sanskars are still present with 
them in their future lives.

=
The Hippys are those folks,they may have done some sadhanas in their 
previ=
ous life and hence in this life like long hairs, beard etc.

Not everybody =
like to grow both hair and beard or even if they like it 
they donot suceed=
 all the time, also in a similar way only a few can 
seat in one place for =
a long period of time i.e. 6 or 8 hours. 

These are some side effects of m=
aking progress in spirituality. 
Offcourse there are many fakes too these d=
ays, but in general all these 
things like long hairs, long beard, or sitti=
ng for a long period of 
time in a place etc. are somethings that accompany=
 a sadhak after some 
progress. One need not get entangled in these types o=
f things as they 
also can be very instrumental in blocking one's progress
=


Other way of looking at this is both long hairs and beard provide 
protec=
tion from rough cold weather and also protect in other ways.

Best Regards
