"Whether a political leader is in limelight and becomes MP or =
the leader of opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjoyin=
g some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjoy t=
hat power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate pre=
diction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of free wil=
l in this life until now make a difference in some high profile charts?"

.=
................................................

 
There is one thing that=
 we - todays astrologers - miss badly, and that is some genuine intution. W=
hatever astrology we practise is only and purely a logical exercise. 
 
I h=
ad the good luck of coming across a man who was possibly the most spiritual=
ly advanced person I have come across till date, who could tell things with=
 such pin point accuracy that it would put any astrologer to shame. 
 
So i=
ntution is a far better way of predicting the future, if one can acquire th=
at. And since our astrology mostly rests on logical with little or no intut=
ion, it could be the reason why we make mistakes.
 
Secondly, to assume tha=
t political people have a higher degree of freewill (less binding prarabdha=
 karma) does not make sense. I  believe freewill and destiny have a strange=
 relationship. The more freewill I use today, will increse my destiny at a =
later date such that I won't have much maneuverability left. So that means =
a political person must have used less amount of freewill inhis previous bi=
rth to be able to use more of it now. But that seems improbable. A person w=
ho uses less freewill is a very spiritual person, he leaves things to God o=
r takes things as it comes.. Politicians are not exactly that way.
 
Anothe=
r thing with Indian polticians is that, many of them do actually indulge in=
 employing people to do heavy duty tantrik pujas etc to help them out. For =
example, when teh UPA Govt was facing the no confidence motion last year, a=
 very famous Indian politician sent a team of tantriks to perform some puja=
s at the Ugra Tara temple in Kamakhya. The homas lasted for 21 days with in=
numerable animal sacrifices. I know of quite a few other cases too. Of cour=
se the UPA Govt came out of the problem.
 
All these do play a part without=
 doubt.  
 
An average astrologer sees at least 10 times more nymber of ord=
inary charts than political charts. Even in ordinary charts, mistakes WILL =
and do happen. But since the volume of charts is more, we tend to see more =
successes. In the case of Political charts, the volume is less,  therefore =
mistakes seem more pronounced. If we do a statistical analysis, we may see =
similar ratio of mistakes in both cases (ordinary vs political charts).
 
T=
herefore, the issue is with astrology itself. The factors maybe way too man=
y to be judged correctly only by rules. Some genuine intution is must.
 
Ju=
st my views.
