Subject: Re: On Remedial Measur=
es Difference (Re: Resolving Points)
 

Dear Narasimha,
 
When the sadhaka =
effaces his own personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occ=
upies him, then at that stage there is 
no real difference between the sadh=
aka and the Deity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say=
 that there is no real difference).
The difference that one feels is as fol=
lows:
One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
A few repit=
itions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity possesses the =
sadhaka and the sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), 
D=
uring all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face,=
 etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of the room =
(even though the sadhak's eyes are closed).
The sadhak typically becomes dr=
eamless except for suchaka dreams.
The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a=
 love lorn person. How can i again experience the Beloved.
That then is the=
 experience of mantra when it is done correctly.
When the sadhak's personal=
ity is effaced such that the deity's personality sits there then the sadhak=
 experiences himself as that Deity(Devata).
There then arises no difference=
 in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it wha=
t appears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity's p=
ersonality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing=
 himself, so self identification is minimised and the person's spiritual ev=
olution continues.
Remember, there is very little according to me which is =
black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a highe=
r shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your =
power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the de=
ath of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was o=
riginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these bein=
gs. 
Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the head=
s of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Pat=
an comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti caus=
ing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here=
 there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, an=
d you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5=
 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with =
the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks=
 you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification,=
 ie God or the universe).
If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by=
 a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be us=
ed, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be free of identifica=
tion with the body and so their actions are those which are generally terme=
d as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they hav=
e been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.
Imagine if s=
omebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birt=
h he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a fe=
w repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).
On the other hand =
somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 thing=
s which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.=

According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me sugge=
st an easy sadhana.
If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, =
do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real =
Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints
Same time every day.
Same pl=
ace.
Same materials.
Same direction.
As little movement as one can.
Count o=
n rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
Complete restraint on sex(from=
 the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a bear=
d.
Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty befor=
e you start.
Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times=
.
See the difference in your personality before and after.
Long and short ,=
 what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persi=
st with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.
I hope this cla=
rifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.

  I mentioned the above wi=
th respect to the need of thousands of mantras and technicalities. If one d=
oes not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who will take whatever=
 is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and all the umpteen te=
chnicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for=
 commanding thousands of different results from god. That is why I talked o=
f commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works slightly differentl=
y than one may imagine. I will elaborate.

  Also, commanding god is NOT bl=
ack magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which can be accompl=
ished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a =
heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only =
for a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This comm=
anding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an e=
goist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing in=
dividual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the =
previous mail to clarify:

  The universe has many lokas (planes of conscio=
usness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactio=
ns possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras.=
 When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra=
 (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), th=
en one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in=
 the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally i=
n specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding exte=
rnal changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between =
various objects.

  Each set of "karmic interactions between various object=
s" is a "result". Various mantras are for various "results". One may term m=
erging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from =
it as "commanding a result" from god. Whether you like the term or not, it =
is essentially that.

  *        *        *

  But the bottomline is this: =
Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results=
 from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an u=
nattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Nature). Vari=
ous mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant=
 for such sadhakas.

  Those are hardly of use to so many people out there =
with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command speci=
fic results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, whic=
h is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they us=
e all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astr=
ology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will b=
e better off learning to be good beggars at God's door.

  Just pick any pr=
asiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so=
 many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Pat=
iently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever=
 and whenever he gives.

  Keep praying every day or every second when you =
are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your act=
ions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it=
 is his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowl=
y the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude =
is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekd=
ay, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from que=
stionable sources!).

  *        *        *

  There may be a mountain with=
 thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a diffe=
rent spot (different experience) on the top and show a different scenery (r=
esult). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (=
mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a=
 handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is r=
elevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can =
successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very lit=
tle ego).

  Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually=
 climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and =
traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who=
 are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take customized m=
antra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly=
 by doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. The power of =
a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *af=
ter* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin =
to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a parti=
cularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to surviv=
e the climb along the long path.

  We need to emphasize the attitude and a=
pproach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice of th=
e path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spiritual =
teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the =
right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the co=
rrect attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, di=
scipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful than t=
rying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

  You can do anyday. Parasara does n=
ot mention any day for doing homam to a graha.

  In fact, if one wants, on=
e can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even b=

  If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is f=

  Parasara's definition of gandanta is restricte=
d to two neighboring areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of f=
ire and water elements. "I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta" =
is a wrong approach. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a f=
iery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gand=
anta requires a *transition* in a contiguous space.

  In your example of u=
papada lord's tithi, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fi=
re transition.

  Well, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based on marrying=
 two different teachings of Parasara (bhava karakas and special lagnas). I =
do not really consider it as my creation but as understanding Parasara's te=
achings only.

ject: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: Resolving Points)


  Dear Sanja=
y,

  > Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, I am droppin=
g that

  I do have a definition of gandanta, which is Parasara's definitio=
n in BPHS.

  Since some of you are extrapolating it based on the fire embo=
died in UL and water embodied in tithis, the onus is on you to outline and =
justify your definition. I got into this thread because statements were mad=
e that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can cause "insul=
t to Vishnu", "serious doshas" and "danger to spouse", based on these far-f=
etched extrapolations of gandanta.

  > Which is perfectly in line with eve=
rything I have learnt.

  Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/S=
hiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful=
. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, w=
ith Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is really=
 in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).

  BTW, I specifical=
ly asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your own thinking=
 or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context). L=
ike so many times with similar questions I asked privately and recently pub=
licly, you did not respond.

  *        *        *

  > Statement 1 is an a=
rrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus
  > and has no relevance=
 as the remedial measures prescribed by
  > Parasara and others to be done =
on specific days are irrlevant and
  > not of much consequence.

  First of=
 all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis b=
ased on any arudhas or houses in a chart.

  For doshas in birth chart or t=
o get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of planets,=
 he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform t=
hem. His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not di=
smissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly =
preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.

  Par=
asara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. =
planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya d=
osha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha an=
d the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart=
.

  Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.

  Seco=
nd, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated pr=
inciples that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring peop=
le that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause "dange=
r to spouse" or "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu", based on horoscope.=
 I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may b=
e a little difference between doing an austerity on different days, but my =
point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and no=
t doing at all and that doing it on a "wrong day" does not cause danger as =
being suggested.

  Third, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping va=
rious deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deity*. For wors=
hipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better th=
an others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the person worshi=
pping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to g=
ive to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better off going and begging =
on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more important.

  Choosing =
the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and the variations=
 based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not saying there ar=
e no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I q=
uestion if they are actually well-understood by astrologers today to apply =
*reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable princip=
les of questionable origin and scaring people on that basis.

  *        * =
       *

  > Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is=
 useless

ntras for

  I did not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our=
 ability to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into consi=
deration.

  The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many be=
ings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible betw=
een them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is abl=
e to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no though=
ts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experienc=
es the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then=
 causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways =
(specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in =
the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.=


  However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant=
 to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the =
mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness =
is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are ext=
remely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantr=
a and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

  *        *  =
      *

  Just repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anythi=
ng. Some people may think that certain results come when they repeat a mant=
ra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work =
for one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it and=
 nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed =
for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one may thin=
k.

  *        *        *

  A highly learned scholar in the court of a kin=
g may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An i=
ncapable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying to command =
(and failing for sure).

  Similarly, most people are better off begging go=
d for what they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command =
what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarsh=
ip or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience =
and persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right at=
titude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most peopl=
e is to learn to be a good beggar at god's door.

  What people today need =
for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better a=
ttitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras=
 and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific resul=
t from god.

  It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who=
 came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra=
 based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitu=
de - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, hu=
mility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be ove=
rsmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

  *        *   =
     *

  One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the gui=
delines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the horo=
scope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on th=
em. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various traditions. They =
are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate va=
rious mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. For example,=
 irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Ri=
na Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking o=
f horoscope is overplayed by today's astrologers, way beyond the scope of P=
arasara's guidelines.

  If one has a sadguru, I recommend following the wo=
rd of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretician.

  If not, the=
re is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pick any path (given by an a=
strologer or one that you feel attracted to) instead of wasting time and th=
en keep working on your attitude. The latter is the key. As I said earlier,=
 learn to be a humble beggar at god's door. Choice of Mantra is secondary a=
nd attitude is primary. If you succeed in being a really humble beggar, you=
 stand a better chance of success than great scholars.

  Any prasiddha man=
tra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu saha=
sranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva see=
rsham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make progress if one develops t=
he right attitude. Without the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked m=
antra will do nothing.

  *        *        *

  I hope this sufficiently c=
larifies my stand. I discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana mor=
e on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. Some writings are sampled at http://www.v=
edicastrologer.org/homam/writings.htm.

    Dear Narasimha,

    Since you do not ha=
ve any real definition of Gandanta, I am dropping that and continue with my=
 belief of the junction between Agni and Jala rasi as the case of gandanta =
and the loka junctions. Which is perfectly in line with everything I have l=
earnt.

    Two statements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyoti=
sh and Mantra Shastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well=
 out here -

    1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good =
so long as the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to.=
 Results maybe a bit delayed but will be there.
    2. Statement 2: *reciti=
ng any prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to rem=
edy

    Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?

    Sta=
tement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has =
no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to =
be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This so=
unds like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements li=
ke this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are =
not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.

    Statement 2 is an arrogance=
 that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=E2=80=99s were was=
ting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands=
 of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it =
is like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. =
I think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachi=
ngs of the vedic seers.

    I think there is something wrong in the way yo=
u are saying what you want to say. Please rethink and correct your statemen=
ts for the sake of good record in this list.

to one's marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the weekday of U=

    >

 UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L =
which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everythin=

 the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th l=
ord will be a *more correct* answer.
    >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

    [Nara=
simha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun (aatman) an=
d arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).

    Thus, 12th house is the actual c=

should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), =
while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associated with Moon (mi=
nd) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod method in dasa j=
udgment.

    Thus, it is actually more logical to say that 12th house and =
12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala =
tattva of Moon.

    Is the above "*more correct* answer" based on your own=
 thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?

the effect of the mantra.
  >

 Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days when=
 one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and c=
hurn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many m=
any times better than complete fasting.

  >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

  [Nara=
simha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy=
 on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bot=
tomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either without or wit=

 It is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =E2=80=93 t=

  My point is that the examples given have no real identifiable=
 contact between water and fire.

  One can be creative and come up with a =
lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tatt=
va and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni r=
asis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and V=
enus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the =

  It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what count=

course, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.=


  To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a br=

t making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick=
 some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an=
 extra half hour, but the job will be done.

  I request Jyotishis to behav=
e responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a s=
peicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can c=
ause "danger" and "serious doshas". No wonder some spiritual teachers look =

 My friends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, but do realize that it is=
 imperfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord important? So many planet=
s may have so many kinds of influence on UL in a chart. And UL is one of se=
veral factors showing marriage. There may be various influences in a chart =
showing marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lord's weekday missing some=
 important factors? Quite possible!
  > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] That is a very =
nasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives (*imperfect, corrupted=
*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use nasty statements? Can=E2=

 that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *jyotish=

 embody it in different levels of their understanding and intelligence.
