Namaste,
 
Thank you for the story. This parable is absolutely brilliant.
 =

I just want to point out one thing in the story. When the first robber (ta=
mas) wanted to kill, the second robber (rajas) interrupted him and executed=
 his preference instead. However, the third robber (sattwa) could help only=
 when the other two were away. This is very apt.
 
When one has both rajas =
and tamas, rajas is capable of overriding tamas. However, sattwa will flour=
ish only when tamas and rajas are suppressed mostly. Sattwa will be passive=
 when one also has considerable amounts of rajas or tamas.
 
One with a lot=
 of tamas can increase rajas temporarily and make some progress. As a simpl=
e example, laziness in the matter of spiritual progress (i.e. tamas) can be=
 replaced with doing several rituals and reading books passionately (rajas)=
. It is difficult to transition from tamas to sattwa straight away. As one =
engages in rituals, reading books and contemplation, slowly the passion (ra=
jas) is replaced by steadiness and equanimity (sattwa). When sattwa becomes=
 predominant in one's personality and rajas and tamas become negligible, on=
e starts to make tremendous progress. But, until that happens, rajas is use=
ful to have!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Ramakrishna Parable About Satva, Rajas, And Lamas Gunas


  Once, a man wa=
s going through a forest, when three robbers fell upon him and robbed him o=
f all his possessions. One of the robbers said, "What's the use of keeping =
this man alive?" So saying, he was about to kill him with his sword, when t=
he second robber interrupted him, saying: 'Oh, no! What is the use of killi=
ng him? Tie his hand and foot and leave him here." The robbers bound his ha=
nds and feet and went away. After a while the third robber returned and sai=
d to the man: "Ah, I am sorry. Are you hurt? I will release you from your b=
onds." After setting the man free, the thief said: "Come with me. I will ta=
ke you to the public high way." After a long time they reached the road. At=
 this the man said: "Sir, you have been very good to me. Come with me to my=
 house." "Oh,no!" the robber replied. "I can't go there. The police will kn=
ow it."

  This world itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here=
 are Satva, rajas, and lamas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of=
 Truth. Tamas wants to destroy him.Rajas binds him to the world.

  But Sat=
va rescues him from the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the protection o=
f Satva, man is rescued from anger, passion and other evil effects of tamas=
.

  Further, Satva loosens the bonds of the world. But Satva also is a rob=
ber. It cannot give man the ultimate Knowledge of Truth, though it shows hi=
m the road leading to the Supreme Abode of God.Setting him on the path, Sat=
va tells him: "Look yonder. There is your home." Even Satva is far away fro=
m the knowledge of Brahman.
