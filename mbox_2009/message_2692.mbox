Narasimhaji,

I do a daily homam in the morning before leaving for work but=
 sometimes due to time constraints it is not possible and in that case I co=
me back from work and perform the homam in the evening.  

Is there a time =
in the day beyond which performing a homam is not advised such as sunset, e=
tc?

Regards

Veenu
