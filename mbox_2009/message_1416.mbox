Dear Friend, I don't think daily Chandi homam is being conducted at Modasa =
now. Still if you say, I will make a visit and ensure this.

Namaste

Some time back I read in a news paper that some =
folks in Modasa, Gujarat have organised on a grand scale Chandi Homams and =
the acitvity is going to go on for some years atleast.

They have invited p=
andits and purohits from all parts of india and daily are doing some homans=
. 

May be people close to the region can report more accurate news and the=
 logic behind conducting Candi Paath Homams on this grand scale.

It is on =
a very grand scale.

A few years ago I believe the Present Spiritual Head o=
f Saacha Baba Ashram in Hrishikesh or Hardware conducted for many months Ca=
ndi Paath Homams. It was more than Shaat Chandi, I donot know what is the n=
ext one level up.

Best Regards
Mitesh
