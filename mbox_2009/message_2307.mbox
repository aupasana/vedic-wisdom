namaste,

I am relived to have this information that Raman Maharashi also e=
xhibited the Emotions. Till now whatever i read about Maharshi, it seemed t=
hat being a self realized person he always remained in an emotionless state=
. I am really happy to be informed about his emotional reactions for the de=
ath of Mahatma and gives me a confirmation that Mahatma Gandhi really was a=
 Mahatma, whom even self realized Saints looked upon with high esteem.

I a=
lso read something similar incase of Swami Vivekananda. when he was touring=
 India in early nineties, he got news of Balaram Basu's passing away. Immed=
iately tears flowed from his eyes. Looking at that some person asked swami =
that why he is crying over death although he is gnyani and Sanyaasi. Swami =
told that he is not a dry person. He can also display emotions over death o=
f loved ones. Gnyaan does not make one dry and emotionless.

Thank you!

Re=
gards,

Utpal
