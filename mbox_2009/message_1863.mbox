Namaste,

There may be a couple of factors behind this.

The energy of some deities is more active during night than the day. After 
all, night is symbolic of the primordial state of the universe. Deities 
personifying the energies and state of the universe in the initial 
primordial stages are easier to identify with during the night. Thus, if you 
do homam for Mahaakaala, Kaali, Bhairava etc, night time is more apt.

More importantly, some people doing homam in the morning before going to 
work feel some kind of time pressure in the mind (atleast sub-consciously). 
When you know that you have to finish and go to work in another 30 min or 
hour or whatever, that pressure may be at the back of the mind. Whereas if 
one does at the end of the day, when there is no pressure of any kind, the 
mind may be more relaxed and one may be able to focus better.

In any case, I suggest not worrying about all these things and starting the 
practice with some time or the other. If morning is convenient, do in the 
morning. If evening is convenient, do in the evening. If night is 
convenient, do in the night. Pick a time and do it at that time everyday or 
every week or at whatever frequency you have chosen. After you do it for a 
while, then you may think of experimenting with a different time and see 
which time is working better. In the beginning, it pays to just get started 
with some time or the other.

When one focuses mind on a mantra, one MAY feel activity in various parts of 
the body, like a tingling sensation or pressure or heat or coldness or 
crawling of ants etc. Such activity may be felt in various parts of the 
body, like the crown of the head or forehead or throat or heart or solar 
plexus etc. It merely shows the movement of praana vaayu in various chakras 
and nadis that are in need of praana (life force). For example, Manipoora 
chakra in the solar plexus area is the seat of fire element, which is the 
center of one's sense of control and pride. Any personality traits related 
to short temper, pride, anger etc will be linked to some deficiencies in the 
Manipoora chakra. When one is able to focus in meditation well, some praana 
may be moving in the Manipoora chakra area and trying to improve the 
deficiency.

Similarly, if a considerable amount of praana moves in particular nadis, one 
may even get a sensation of moving up ot tilting to a side or back etc.

But the important thing is to ignore all these and not be distracted by any 
of these sensations. Awareness and analysis of the sensation distracts the 
mind from its focus on the mantra. As praana moves everywhere and clears all 
deficiencies, one becomes ready for realization.

Yes, you can meditate even after the fire goes off. Homam burns some 
internal impurities and internal purity is at a maximum (local maximum) 
immediately following homam. Just sit and meditate as long as you can. After 
that, as the day progresses and we start thinking of various things, newer 
impurities may accumulate again. So meditating immediately after homam is 
helpful to maximize the effect.

Narasimha

Namaste,
I too do havan in the evening,but before sunset.I do it around 6 pm.
It always feels great.
I also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar plexus....sort of 
,what one feels at the heart when one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?
I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i meditate even after 
the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it does not last very long after the 
aahutis are done.And i would like to stay 'There' more.

Regards,
Sunita.
