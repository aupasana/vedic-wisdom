Talk 161

An elderly man from Ananthapur, after hearing the Vedas recited i=
n the hall,
stood up and asked: =93It is said that the non-Brahmins should =
not hear the
recital of the Vedas.=94

Maharshi:

Mind your business. Take =
care of what you came here for. Why do you waste
your time in these matters=
? =93I heard the recital,=94 you say. =93Who is that
=91I=92? Without knowi=
ng the =91I=92 you are using the word. If its significance be
known there w=
ill be no doubt. Find the =91I=92 first and you may afterwards
speak of oth=
er matters.=94

Continuing, Sri Bhagavan said:

=93The smritis say somethin=
g. They are not appropriate now. I will reform the
world, rewrite the smrit=
is.=94 Saying so, people are cutting capers in the
world from time immemori=
al. Such reformers have come and gone; but the
ancient smritis still stand.=
 Why waste time over such matters? Let each one
mind his business. All will=
 be well.
