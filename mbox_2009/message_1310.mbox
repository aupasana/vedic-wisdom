Dear PVR Sir,

I had read on this before through your correspondences and h=
ave been 
adviced as well on this.

This happened to me today...I had some =
offerings...especially a 
large chunk of wood that did not burn in the last=
 homa that I did. 
Further to which I had some troubles which were emotiona=
lly 
disturbing. Considering your reflections on the same, I was sanguine 
=
that may be those emotional disturbances were a result of certain 
karmas a=
ccelerating and arriving before time.

Hence i was a little scared and tens=
ed...and what was on priority 
today while doing the homa was to burn those=
 unburnt portions. 
Interestingly...I sat to do the homa...did my sankalpa.=
..ahutis 
started and all that...when i heard this distinct voice 
(admonis=
hingly)from within me (i guess) which said "your priority is 
not me...but =
burning off that piece of wood?". Now this was 
something that embarassed m=
e to the core...

I said sorry...and went on to concentrate on the task at =

hand...though could not fully concentrate partly because i was still 
appr=
ehensive of the offerings were properly burning or not and 
partly because =
I was still reeling from embarassment.

This is what I wanted to share with=
 you and also the members of the 
forum

Regards
Arunisha
