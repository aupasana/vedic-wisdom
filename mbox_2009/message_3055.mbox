 When (on 2-11-45) Mr. Roy asked Bhagavan the best way of killing the ego
(=
bodily I ), Bhagavan said,

"To ask the mind to kill the mind is like makin=
g the thief the policeman.

He will go with you and pretend to catch the th=
ief, but nothing will be
gained.
So you must turn inward and see where the =
mind rises from and then it will
cease to exist."

In reference to this ans=
wer, Mr. Thambi Thorai of Jaffna (who has been
living in Palakothu for over=
 a year) asked me, whether asking the mind to
turn inward and seek its sour=
ce is not also employing the mind.

So, I put this doubt before Bhagavan an=
d Bhagavan said,

"Of course we are employing the mind. It is well known an=
d admitted that
only with the help of the mind the mind has to be killed.

=
But instead of setting about saying there is a mind, and I want to kill it,=

you begin to seek the source of the mind, and you find the mind does not
e=
xist at all.

The mind, turned outwards, results in thoughts and objects.Tu=
rned inwards,
it becomes itself the Self.

Such a mind is sometimes called =
arupa manas or suddha manas
