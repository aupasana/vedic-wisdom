WHEN asked why he did not lead the life of a householder with his wife, the
Master replied:

'Kartikeya (Son of Siva) one day happened to scratch a cat with his nail. On
going home, he saw that there was the mark of a scratch on the cheek of his
Divine Mother, Parvati. Seeing this he asked her, 'Mother, low did you get
this ugly scratch on your cheek?' The mother of the universe replied,'This
is the work of your own hand; it is the scratch of your nail.' Kartikeya
asked in wonder: 'How is it, Mother? I do not remember to have scratched you
at any time. The Mother replied, 'Darling, have you forgotten the fact of
your laving scratched a cat this morning?' Kartikeya said, Yes, I did
scratch a cat, but how did your cheek get the scar?'

The Mother replied, 'Dear child, nothing exists in this world but Myself.
The whole creation is Myself; whomsoever you may hurt, you only hurt me.'

Kartikeya was greatly surprised to hear this; and then he determined never
to marry. For, whom could he marry? Every woman was mother to him.

Realizing thus the motherhood of woman, he gave up marriage. I am like
Kartikeya. I consider every woman as my Divine Mother."
