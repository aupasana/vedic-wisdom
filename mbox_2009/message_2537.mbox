Namaste Narayan,

How beautifully you put these sentences !!!


---Don't w=
orry about your worthiness, we all are definitely worthy!! You
see, when GO=
D made us in his own mold, he performed prana pratishthapana
on us, i,e, we=
 all have GOD inside us, through which we are divine, and
get in touch with=

him!!!

I suddenly realized how worthy I am !!  Even though I am doing gan=
apathi
homam regularly, I am a little scared to do Chandi homam. And your m=
ail
gave me so much encouragement.

Thanks a lot,

Bharathi Kumar
