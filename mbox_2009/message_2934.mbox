MASTER (sharply): "That's the one hobby of =
you Calcutta people =E2=80=93 giving lectures=C2=A0and bringing others to t=
he light! Nobody ever stops to consider how to get the light=C2=A0himself. =
Who are you to teach others?

"He who is the Lord of the Universe will teac=
h everyone. He alone teaches us,who has created this universe; who has made=
 the sun and moon, men and beasts, and all other beings; who has provided m=
eans for their sustenance; who has given children parents and endowed them =
with love to bring them up. The Lord has done so many things =E2=80=93 will=
 He not show people the way to worship Him? If they need teaching, then He =
will be the Teacher. He is our Inner Guide.

"Suppose there is an error in =
worshipping the clay image; doesn't God know that through it He alone is be=
ing invoked? He will he pleased with that very worship. Why=C2=A0should you=
 get a headache over it? You had better try for knowledge and devotion your=
self."

This time M. felt that his ego was completely crushed. He now said =
to himself: "Yes, he has spoken the truth. What need is there for me to tea=
ch others? Have I known God? Do I really love Him? 'I haven't room enough f=
or myself in my bed, and I am inviting my friend to share it with me!' I kn=
ow nothing about God, yet I am trying to teach others. What a shame! How fo=
olish I am! This is not mathematics or history or literature, that one can =
teach it to others. No, this is the deep mystery of God. What he says appea=
ls to me."

This was M.'s first argument with the Master, and happily his l=
ast.

MASTER: "You were talking of worshipping the clay image. Even if the =
image is made of clay, there is need for that sort of worship. God Himself =
has provided different forms of worship.=C2=A0He who is the Lord of the Uni=
verse has arranged all these forms to suit different men in different stage=
s of knowledge.

"The mother cooks different dishes to suit the stomachs of=
 her different children. Suppose she has five children. If there is a fish =
to cook, she prepares various dishes from it =E2=80=93 pilau, pickled fish,=
 fried fish, and so on =E2=80=93 to suit their different tastes and powers =
of digestion.
