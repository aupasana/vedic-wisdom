Dear Vijay,
=A0
We can see the difference between a body with prana and wit=
h out prana. Can't we? Then, why can we try to narrow our focus and try to =
see prana/atma sceintifically? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is=
 not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse tha=
t path.

My=A0statement was not against the "path of Gyana". Indeed it is o=
ne of the finest path I am sure.
=A0
However, my understanding of this path=
 differs a little from your understanding. Gyana, I believe,=A0is not reall=
y study of scriptures or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc=
. Gyana, in my opinion, is a state of being,=A0 where one percieves a certa=
in oneness in the universe. It is achieved through sadhana. To be constantl=
y in a state of discrimination between real and not-real, rejecting the non=
-real, such that whatever is finally left is nothing but the eternal. This =
is the sadhana of the marga called Gyan. But sadhana it is without a doubt.=

=A0
Whatever be the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Sh=
ankara, they say, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. B=
ut I feel, he engaged in all these once he had already become a gyani throu=
gh his sadhana. He was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many sc=
riptures, he was a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness. 
=A0
I=
MHO, scriptural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.Gyana marg is more compl=
ex and requires more than mere intellectual abilities.
=A0

Rajarshi,

With all due respect, I disagree.=


There is no question that is useless and there is no answer that is not r=
elavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that God is not =
there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be perceived. By =
Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your current kno=
wledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing you can not =
otherwise.

There are 4 known margas for self realisation. My understanding=
 of any of these limited.
1. Bhakthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all =
other thoughts but for thought pertaining to God. You do not question any t=
hing related to him and give-in completely to the believe that he is there =
and is your master. By doing so, you are coming out of the clutches of the =
regular perceptions or dimentions of this material world.

2. Raja - You fo=
cus on doing specific postures and concentrate deeply on the way you do thi=
ngs and draw your self away from the regular senses.

3. Karma - Unattached=
 karma. If you can do it, you are not even thinking about God, but, have go=
t him.

4. jnana - By questioning available information, using logic and tr=
y to break out of current assumptions and try to discover. Saying, this wil=
l not yield results is not a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the mos=
t defficult. But, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, w=
hy the wrong in current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those w=
ho are realised, do not perhaps think it is relavent.

There is a soul. Now=
 is Soul physical or not? Can it be seen? If not with naked eyes, to see it=
 materialistically, what is needed?

We can see the difference between a bo=
dy with prana and with out prana. Can't we? Then, why can we try to narrow =
our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintifically? I am not for this path,=
 but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who are de=
stine to traverse that path.
Best regards,
Vijay
