Dear sir
Ask your soul what was right n what was wrong? whatever urs soul s=
ays is right for you. Proper knowledge of rites is important, but better is=
 devotion towards god and perform whatever u want and whichever way. 'Ishwa=
ra' is great and understands urs emotions. Rituals are ok but remember too =
much of them is obstacle for spritual sadhana.

"Maalik sab par kripa kare"=



Regards,
sanjeev sharma
