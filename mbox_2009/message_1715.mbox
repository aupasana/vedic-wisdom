Please =
explain this paragraph in more detail. calling the strong will to counter t=

arma? (not break the chain?).

If it only postpones the Karma phala at late=
r date then the successful excertion of Self control & Will is not of any u=
se in the final analysis.

please explain Narasimha! these chain seems to b=
e going towards wonderful and satisfying conclusions. solving the riddles o=
f one of the most complicated issue.

You also tell us about the state whic=
h Sthitprgya always enjoys!

A very happy Akshay Tritiya to everybody

Utpal
