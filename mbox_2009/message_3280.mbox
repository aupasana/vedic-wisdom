I have been following all the threads with keen interest, and finally givin=
g my two cents:

1. Sudha wrote that in olden days Rishis eat only fallen f=
ruits
Is it then acceptible if one consumes meat of anials that die natural=
ly?

2. At the end of Mahabarata, Krishna takes Dharamaraj to Bhishma and B=
hisma tells him what is dharma and what is adharma. In there, he clearly in=
structs killing animals and eating meating as adharma. I read these verses =
long time back.

3. Tulasidas as women basher:
Normally when you take one v=
erse it could convey different meaning. Was there any context set prior to =
one doha where he said Nari Pasu?

Also, it could have been corrupted by so=
me one later on!

Even greats saints may have weaknesses and may have done =
wrong things. I do not personally see any benefit of debating and trying to=
 proove that a specifc personality had a bad quality as it would not help m=
y spiritual progress.

4. Even plants have life: True. So, is vegatarian fo=
od about not taking a life or is it not creating pain or is it not eating m=
eat?

As I am typing, an incident in Ramakrishna's life came to my mind. On=
e day, Tagore was looking at a lawn and was amased by its beauty, and he id=
entified himself with grass, and at that time a bird landed on the grass an=
d pecked on the grass. Ramakrishna's body recieved those peckings and start=
ed bleeding.

I was told by my guru that even non-living things have a suks=
hma sarira and qualities. That is why we purify even the non-living things =
we use for puja.

Now coming back to my original thinking:
Plants have two =
major differences from Animals.
 a. Plants make their own food from Sun lig=
ht, Air and water. Animals can not do it
 b. Plants can grow even if we cut=
 their leafs and branches. Even though some anamials can regenerate (like l=
izards can grow their tail), the capacity is much slower and we can visuall=
y see the pain of an animal when we injure it or kill it

Good or bad is in=
 the eyes and mind of the doer! Dharmavatha was a butcher by profession and=
 he killed animals but was a learned man.
If one can feel completely unemot=
ional and unattached while killing he perhaps will not be touched by the si=
n resulted in killing an animal. How ever, for most of us it is easy to avo=
id the feeling of guilt by eating vegetarian food. Please note unattachment=
 is different from avoiding thinking.

The animals like lion kill other sma=
ll animals but, they can not survive on grass, their body is not meant for =
it. How ever, our body can live healthy on vegetarian food.

Most of the de=
adly virus have spread by consuming meat.

5. Tamas: Narasimha has mentione=
d eating meat will result in increased Tamas. Is Satwa, Tajas and Tamas men=
tal qualities or physical qualities?

Best regards,
Vijay
