 To believe that fire is in the wood is faith. This is one thing, but it is
another thing to bring that fire out of the wood, to cook something with it,
to eat this and to attain peace and happiness afterwards.

So to believe that God is in the world and to catch a distant glimpse of Him
is one thing; but to come into direct communion with Him, to enjoy His
company and taste Divine Bliss is another. No one can set a limit to the
various aspects of God which a Bhakta can realize. They rise ever higher and
higher.

A devotee: Bhagavan, why can some attain to realization more quickly than
others?

Ramakrishna: It depends upon the Samskaras or impressions of previous lives.
Nothing happens suddenly or by accident. A certain man drank an ounce of
wine in the morning and began to act like a drunkard. People, seeing him,
wondered why he should be drunk after taking one small glass of wine.
Hearing them, however, another man replied: "Because he has been drinking
all night." [p. 324]
