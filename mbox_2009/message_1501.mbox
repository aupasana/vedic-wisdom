First of all, thanks to Shri Narasimha and Shri Utpal
for responding to my=
 queries on how he manages to find time.
The details are very inspiring, I =
hope our intellects get
turned the right way similarly.

While we eagerly w=
ait for a formal document on the potent Vishnu Sahasranama Homa Prayoga man=
ual from Shri Narasimha, 
I wonder why we cannot do it based on  the text i=
tself. Namely, the Sahasranama already has the Dhyana Sloka and other preli=
minaries which are by now very well known to most of us. So isn't it a simp=
le matter of using these, doing the prana prathistha of Lord Narayana or Lo=
rd Krishna and then using each verse for one offering to the fire?

There i=
s also a detailed anga nyaasa procedure available here
http://www.ecse.rpi.=
edu/Homepages/shivkuma/personal/music/vishnu-sahasranamam-meanings.htm

if =
one wishes to do these.

Any comments?
