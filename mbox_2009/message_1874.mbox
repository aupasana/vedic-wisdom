Namaste,
 
The original mail to which you replied was not sent to vedic-wis=
dom, as I keep astrology mails away from this list. However, I realize that=
 the issue of the role of horoscope/destiny vs free will is not too irrelev=
ant here. Thanks for your reply. I am attaching the original mail at the en=
d of this mail.
 
My main point was that actions of free will modify destin=
y as captured by the horoscope. Some people are prisoners of their past act=
ions (i.e. destiny) and their free will operates under heavily restricted c=
ircumstances. But there are some who have more leeway with their free will.=
 The relevance of free will vs destiny in such cases was the topic.
 
Best =
regards,
Narasimha

Subject: Horoscope, free w=
ill and high profile charts (Re: Your prediction on Chiranjeevi)


Namaste,=


I will share some freewheeling thoughts, in response to your question. I =
am cc'ing this to some astrology lists after removing your name from the ma=
il.

*        *        *

For those who are unaware of the prediction refer=
red to below, here is a little background.

I had predicted in print in 200=
0 that Telugu film actor Chiranjeevi would come into politics in 2007-2009 =
and and enjoy some political power. At the time of that prediction, there w=
ere no such indications on the ground. But he did come into politics in the=
 same timeframe. The initial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in=
 2008 and elections were in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was electe=
d as a legislator (MLA) in May 2009.

Thus, the original prediction was qui=
te successful. However, I upped the ante last year by suggesting that Chira=
njeevi's party would do well in 2009 elections. Though I was not specific r=
egarding his level of success and did not predict that he would become the =
Chief Minister, I was honestly expecting his party to do better than they m=
anaged. Thus, the followup of my original prediction is a failure.

*      =
  *        *

It is my personal observation that the success rate in high p=
rofile political predictions is less than in regular predictions like marri=
age, job, childbirth etc in "regular" charts.

In some cases, the reason is=
 that the birthdata is not accurate and yet we are eager to make prediction=
s. But sometimes we make bad predictions with good data too. Of course, it =
can be a human error in judging various factors. However, that human error =
seems to be a little more common in high profile political predictions than=
 in regular predictions. What could be the reason?

I wonder if the factor =
of free will that is left out of astrology plays a bigger role in political=
 charts. I will try to think loud and elaborate what I mean.

*        *   =
     *

One's birth chart contains the list of actions committed in previou=
s lives using one's free will that are to give their reactions in this life=
. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions committed in THIS=
 life using one's free will. What happens at any point of time in one's lif=
e is a function of ALL actions committed by one until that point of time, I=
NCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life until now. Some key actions com=
mitted using one's free will in THIS life, especially at important crossroa=
ds in life, should impact the life events from then onwards.

Many people a=
re weighed down by too many karmas and always playing a catchup. In other w=
ords, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives which are to give a rea=
ction now) is too weighty and free will in this life has little scope. When=
 the options available for the free will in this life are limited, there ma=
y not be significant actions using free will and hence the modifications to=
 destiny based on actions of this life may not be big enough. Thus, horosco=
pe may be sufficient to predict events.

However, highly popular, successfu=
l and high profile public personalities may have less restrictions and more=
 options available for their free will. With their free will being more fre=
e and powerful, the actions committed by their free will may have a higher =
weightage. As we are able to see only their destiny in the horoscope (free =
will exercised upto birth) and unable to factor in how free will was exerci=
sed in this life until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our astrological =
predictions.

Whether a political leader is in limelight and becomes an MP =
or the leader of opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjo=
ying some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjo=
y that power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate =
prediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of free =
will in this life until now make a difference in some high profile charts?
=

*        *        *

I am just thinking loud here. Rather than posing a qu=
estion and answering it myself, I will let learned friends ponder on this f=
or themselves...

Best regards,
Narasimha

    Dear PV=
R garu,

        Namaste.

        If you don't mind, could you please look=
 in to why your prediction on Chiranjeevi failed ?

        I am not asking=
 this question with a wrong intent. I wanted to understand if 
        1) I=
t is a human error (May be you ignored some data ? )
        2) You still c=
an't understand why it failed and you think that was the correct prediction=
 to be best of your knowledge.

        I had a 50-50 faith on astrology 3 =
years ago and after coming to know about you / your lessons I developed str=
ong faith and I thought all the failures are not because of astrology but b=
ecause of astrologer's lack of knowledge.

        If it is case #1, it is =
okay. But if it is case #2, then we have a problem. We will have to conclud=
e that the Jyotish knowledge that is available to us at this age is very li=
mited and may not be accurate.

        Best Regards,
        <deleted>

will being more free and 
powerful, the actions committed by their free wil=

As we are able to see only their destiny in=
 the horoscope (free will exercised 
upto birth) and unable to factor in ho=
w free will was exercised in this life 
until now, we are perhaps handicapp=
ed in our astrological 
predictions.</FONT></DIV>
