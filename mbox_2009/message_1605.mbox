Namaste Utpal,

Homam/Tarpanam are good, but it has to be backed by Saadhan=
aa. There is no getting away from Saadhanaa. It is the only way. Easier sai=

 Being able to engage in action with very little (or no) attachment and sen=

 have a perfect idea of what one's dharma is. As I said, "If one's guru is =
an elevated soul with a clear insight into one's inner core, such a guru ca=

ne engaged in in the past lives while identifying with the actions, what ka=
rmik debts were created and what mental conditioning was created. Those thi=
ngs can be known with certainty only by a guru who is self-realized.

    He has given the idea of of terrorists. When a terrorist is doing a sui=
cide attack he may just be doing his dharma. That is what he maybe drawn to=
 as per his perceptions, that is what his "gurus" may have asked him to do,=
 and that is what his ideals/principles/books maybe asked of him to do. So =
from teh point of view of dharma, how can he be blamed? Therefore, the stat=
ement taht "Dharmo rakshati rakshitah..", does not make sense. How is his d=

why he has this karmas.
