Narasimha  garu

i have some queries regarding homam.

my parents  are saying , we should not do homam at home because our homes
are not clean like temples , where homam's are performed.

Also women's get period every month , so  our homes are not sacred to do
homam at home.

Even at my home we do satyanarayana swami vratam and Kedareswrara swamy
vratam , after painting our home (in telugu we say ellalu veyinchina tarvata
matrame) and no women when they are in periods  should not enter into home
till completion of the vratam.

If this is the case , then how can i do homam at home , i dont have seperate
pooja room ?

How can i clean my home before doing homam ?
(homam chaala pavitram ga , nishta ga cheyali ani)

Also  is the homa kundam should be of shape square or it can be any , i am
not getting square shaped utensil at any where.

is round shaped utensil can i use ?

Please advice me

Regards
seshagiri
