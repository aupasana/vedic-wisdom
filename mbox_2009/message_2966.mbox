namaste,

>  This is lucid, but where can i find "*bodhAyaNa sheSha sUtra-s*" online?

Unfortunately, I do not have any online links handy. You might try searching
the catalog of a nearby university. Look for "Bodhayana Grhya Sutras", and
you are likely to find this as an appendix.

> it is interesting from the fact that we can find contents which are not in
KYV 4-5-26 to KYV 4-5-27 interlacing in the 11th anuvaaka (with a bottom
note) ... are the above sought of variations mentioned in bodhaayaNa sheSha
sutra's as well?

I do not know the source of this variation. The bodhayaniya-s themselves do
not consider this to be a part of the rudra-prashna, but they still inject
this line. I do not remember any mention of it in the bodhayana-sutra-s. Thanks
for reminding me about the pdf. I had totally forgotten about it ! This was
the version that I learnt, and contains the variations that I had alluded
to.

bhavadiiyaH,

      ajit
