e.Divine mother was shining like gold.Time seemed to have stood still.Divin=
e shyama kirtan was going in the natmandir.Moon was shining bright just abo=
ve the tip of the temple it seemed.The fires of the pradips were blazing fu=
riously like homam fires.In total the atmosphere was spellbinding.Will rema=
in in memory for long.
