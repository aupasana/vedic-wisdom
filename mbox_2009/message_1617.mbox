dharma vyadha was a butcher by birth, how ever, he is a very learned man an=
d should easily qualify as a brahmin. Now, for a brahmin, butchery is a sin=
. But, dharma vyadha continues the same and he says it is his kula vRtti an=
d hence he is oblised to follow the same.

Prasasurama was a kshatriya by n=
ature (I may be making a controvercy here) as he opted to fight and engage =
in war fare. But, still he is called a brahmin. Same with Drona.

So, the k=
ula is depend on 3 things:
1. Birth
2. vRtthi (profession)
3. pravRtthi (Na=
ture)

Dhramavyadha was a sudra by birth, and profession but brahmana by na=
ture. Viswamitra was a kshatriya by birth. When he became a brahmin, his pr=
ofession as well as nature changed.

I am inclined to say the majority betw=
een the three decide the cast of the person.

How ever, birth influences th=
e other 2. If you are bought up in a sudra company you will get some the su=
dra qualities (like Karna getting the dasya pravRtthi). Also, you will imit=
ate your father and mother and will most likely get into Kula vRtthi.

A pe=
rson born to brahmins would see his mother, father and other engasing in go=
od karmas and will automatically develop a liking for the same. This could =
be the reason both people born brahmins end up brahmins by nature and profe=
ssion. How ever, the % of brahminism in the so called brahmins will be goin=
g down due to the impurities in this yuga.

This could be a reason, we do n=
ot see many good examples. 
Best regards,
Vijay

 Queries of Vijay are note worthy. I share the same doubts. It is not easy =
to solve the riddle of cast system in its original form becuase as back as =
Mahabharata days, Ashwatthma was not reduced to Shudra cast even after doin=

=E2=80=98Of what family are you, my lad?=E2=80=99 inquired the sage. Satyak=
