 Dear ALL,

Today Western Medical Science is indeed deeply studying mental =
and
psycho-somatic diseases. And yet right since ancient times Yoga Sutras =
and
other sacred literature have given their root cause and method of overc=
oming
them. Spiritual Sciences opine that a sound mental balance and high s=
tature
thinking is not only required for material gains but that it is most=

required for advancement of man=92s spiritual arena and rendering man=92s
=
physical and mental body sound and healthy. It is therefore that great
Rish=
is of yore encouraged mankind vociferously to imbibe spiritual
practices, h=
ealing methods and faith in God along with great thinking. All
this comes u=
nder the umbrella of Soul Studies. Without doubt spiritual
applications are=
 scientific in nature.

Actually spiritual practices were not meant for mer=
e healing of diseases and
illnesses. This is because at their root certain =
principles exist wherein
the psyche was made powerful via awakening of subt=
le centers. Blooming
vibrations of the psyche evolves our vision positively=
 and directs our
bodily actions in a wholesome manner. Without watering the=
 roots of a tree
it is futile to expect it to grow and give us luscious fru=
its, colorful
flowers etc. Spiritual Sciences encompass Yoga practices, Yaj=
na rites and
Mantra Science for the all round health of mankind i.e. the bo=
dy, mind and
soul are nourished under their jurisdiction. Material Sciences=
 have erred by
focusing exclusively on the health and comfort of the physic=
al body. Hence
indirectly they ignored the uplifting of mankind=92s sacred =
sentiments at the
soul level. As a result the world over, we are witnessing=
 the horrifying
scene of the downfall of human, spiritual and ethical value=
s. Thus it goes
without saying that along with physical well being the mind=
 and soul too
needs ample nourishment. Once our character and soul are made=
 taintless man
will experience infinite peace and bliss. The path of materi=
al and spiritual
progress will be thrown wide open and amazing Divine Power=
s will be ours for
the keeping.

Today=92s generation demands visible proof=
 based on sound scientific research.
If we fail to test Spiritual Principle=
s with apt scientific experimentation
people will continue to gaze at them =
atheistically. Today because our
ancient spiritual sciences are looked upon=
 skeptically man is forgoing all
material and spiritual benefits attained b=
y imbibing spiritual precepts.
Hence Brahmavarchas Research Institute uses =
very scientific modern
technology and apparatus in its hi-fi laboratory. Wi=
th its help we will give
sound evidence to one and all which will then enco=
urage world humanity to
imbibe a spiritual vision via spiritual endeavors. =
This great responsibility
of scientifically proving the priceless nature of=
 Spiritual Sciences is
being handed over to great modern scientists and gif=
ted spiritual thinkers.
We humbly request them to work in tandem and focus =
all their attention on
this great task for the benefit of the entire world.=
