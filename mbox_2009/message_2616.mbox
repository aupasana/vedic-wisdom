Namaster Shri Rajarshi/Vijay

On JK=
's views on a Guru:

This is what Osho has to say about JK and his views on=
 a Master. May be it is useful. I haven't read a lot of JK or even Osho (li=
ttle bits and pieces on the web or an occassional article or so). So I cann=
ot vouch for the truth level of this. You can make your own judgements.

<B=
egin Quote>

Question: Osho, Can An enlightened person be wrong? This refer=
s to what you told us about J. Krishnamurti, who keeps on saying that one d=
oes not Need a Master, which is actually not right please comment.

Osho: P=
rem Pantha, An Enlightened person can never be wrong. Neither J. Krishnamur=
ti is wrong, but he never considers the situation in which you are. He cons=
iders only the space in which he is, and that freedom is part of enlightenm=
ent. The enlightened person has reached the highest peak of consciousness; =
his abode is on Everest.

Now it is his freedom to speak according to the p=
eak, the sunlit peak where he is, or to consider the people who are still i=
n the dark valley, who know nothing about the light, for whom the peak of t=
he Everest is only a dream, only a perhaps". This is the freedom of the enl=
ightened person. Krishnamurti speaks in terms where he is.

I speak in term=
s where you are, I consider you, because if I am speaking to you, you have =
to be taken in consideration. I have to lead you towards the highest peak, =
but the journey will begin in the dark valley, in your unconsciousness. If =
I talk about my experience, absolutely inconsiderate of you, I am right, bu=
t I am not useful to you.

An enlightened person is never wrong, but he can=
 be useful or he can be useless. J. Krishnamurti is useless! He is perfectl=
y right; about that there is no question, because I know the peak and what =
he is saying is certainly true -- from the vision of the peak. Those who ha=
ve arrived, for them the journey becomes almost a dream phenomenon. For tho=
se who have not arrived the journey is real, the goal is just a dream. They=
 are living in two different worlds. When you are talking to a madman you h=
ave to consider him; if you don't consider him you cannot help him.

Once a=
 madman was brought to me. He had this crazy idea that one afternoon when h=
e was sleeping, a fly has entered his mouth. And because he used to sleep w=
ith open mouth, nobody can deny the possibility. And since then he was very=
 much disturbed because the fly was roaming inside him, jumping inside him,=
 moving in his belly, going to his bladder, circulating in his bloodstream,=
 sometimes in his head, sometimes in his feet. And of course he could not d=
o anything because he was continuously occupied, obsessed with the fly.

He=
 was taken to the psychoanalysts and they said, "This is just in your mind =
-- there is no fly! And no fly can move in your bloodstream, there is no po=
ssibility. Even if a fly has entered it must have died! And now six months =
have passed; it cannot be alive inside you."

He listened, but he could not=
 believe it because his experience was far more solid. He was taken to the =
doctors and everybody examined him and they did everything, but finally the=
y will say, "It is just a mental thing. You are imagining." He will listen =
what they were saying, but he could not trust because his experience was fa=
r more certain than their words.

His family brought him to me as a last re=
sort. The man was looking very tired because he was being taken to one pers=
on, then to another, then all kinds of physicians -- allopaths and homeopat=
hs and naturopaths -- and he was really tired. In the first place the fly w=
as tiring him, and now all these "pathies", medicines. And everybody was in=
sulting him -- that was his feeling, that they were saying that he was just=
 imagining. Is he a fool or he is mad, that he will imagine such a thing? T=
hey were all humiliating him -- that was his feeling.

I looked at the man =
and I said, "It is so clear that the fly is inside!"
For a moment he was pu=
zzled. He could not believe me, because nobody has said that to him -- beca=
use nobody has considered him. And they ALL were right and I was wrong -- t=
here was no fly, but the madman has to be considered.

And I said, "All tho=
se fools are just wasting your time; you should have come first here. It is=
 such a simple thing to bring the fly out; there is no need to bother. Medi=
cines won't help -- you are not ill. Psycholanalysis will not help -- you a=
re not crazy."

And immediately he was a changed man! He looked at his wife=
 and said, "Now what do you say? This is the right man," he said, "who real=
ly knows. And all those fools were trying to convince me that there is no f=
ly. It is there!"
I said to him that, "It is simple -- we will take it out.=
 You lie down."

I covered him with a blanket and told him to keep his eyes=
 closed and "I will do some mantra, some magic, and we will bring the fly o=
ut. You just keep quiet so that the fly sits somewhere. Otherwise the fly i=
s continuously running -- where to catch it?"

He said, "That looks logical=
. I will keep absolutely still!"
And I said, "Don't open your eyes. Just re=
main silent, breathe slowly, so the fly settles somewhere, so we can catch =
hold of it!"

Then I rushed into the house to find a fly. It was a little b=
it difficult because for the first time I was trying that, but finally I su=
cceeded -- I could get a fly in a bottle. And I came to the man, I moved my=
 hand on his body, and I asked him, "Where the fly is?" And he said, "In th=
e belly." And I touched the belly and I said, "Of course it is there!" And =
I convinced him that I perfectly believe in him and then I uncovered his bl=
anket and showed him the fly.

And he said to the wife, "Now see! And give =
this bottle to me; I will go all to those fools and take all the fees that =
they have taken from me! I have wasted thousands of rupees, and all that th=
ey did was they told me I am mad! And now I don't feel the fly anywhere, be=
cause it is in the bottle!"

He took the bottle, he went to the doctors.
On=
e of the doctors who knew me, he came to see me. He said, "How you managed?=
 Six months a fly can live in the body? And that man has taken his fee back=
 from me, because he was making such a fuss that I said, 'Better give it ba=
ck to him!' And he proved that he was right!"
I said, "It is not the point =
who is right."

Gautam the Buddha defines truth as "that which works". This=
 is the ancient most pragmatic definition of truth: "that which works"! All=
 the devices are truth in this sense: they work; they are only devices. The=
 Buddha's work is Upaya; Upaya exactly means device.

Meditation is an Upay=
a, a device. It simply helps you to get rid of that which you have not got =
in the first place -- the fly: the ego, the misery, the anguish! It helps y=
ou to get free of it, but in fact it is not there. But it is not to be told=
...

And Krishnamurti has been doing that: he has been telling crazy people=
 that the fly does not exist and you don't need any doctor. I say to you: t=
he fly exists and you need the doctor! Because just by telling to you that =
the fly does not exist is not going to help you at all.

For thousands of y=
ears you have been told the ego does not exist. Has it helped you in any wa=
y? There have been people who have told, in this country particularly, that=
 the whole world is illusory, MAYA, it does not exist, but has it helped In=
dia in any way? The true test is there: whether it has helped, whether it h=
as made people more authentic, more real. It has not helped at all. It has =
made people more deeply cunning, split, schizophrenic; it has made them hyp=
ocrites.

All the religions have done this, because they don't consider you=
. And you are far more important than the ultimate truth, because the ultim=
ate truth has nothing to do with y ou right now. You are living in a dreamw=
orld; some device is needed which can help you to come out of it. The momen=
t you are out of it, you will know it was a dream -- but a person who is dr=
eaming, to tell him that it is all dream is meaningless.

Have you not obse=
rved in your dreams that when you are dreaming it looks real? And every mor=
ning you have found that it was unreal. hut again in the night you forget a=
ll your understanding of the day -- again the dream becomes real. It has be=
en happening again and again: every night the dream becomes real, every mor=
ning you know it is false, but that knowing does not help. In the dream one=
 can even dream that this is a dream.

And that's what has happened in Indi=
a: people are living in maya, deeply in it, and still talking that "This is=
 all maya." And this talk too is part of their dream; it does not destroy t=
he dream. In fact it makes the dream more rooted in them, because now there=
 is no need to get rid of it -- because it is a dream! So why get rid of it=
? It does not matter.

In a subtle way all the religions have done this: th=
ey have talked from the highest peak to the people for whom that peak does =
not exist yet. The people are living in darkness, and you go on telling the=
m that darkness has no existence. It is true -- darkness has no existence, =
it is only the absence of light -- but just by saying to people that darkne=
ss has no existence is not going to bring light in.

That's what Krishnamur=
ti is doing; it has been done by many people. Nagarjuna did it -- Krishnamu=
rti is not new, not at least in the East. Nagarjuna did it: he said, "Every=
thing is false. The world is false, the ego is false, nothing exists. Becau=
se nothing exists you are already free. There is no need for any meditation=
, there is no need for any Master. There is no need to find out any device,=
 strategy, technique, because in the first place there is no problem. Why g=
o on looking for solutions? Those solutions will create more problems; they=
 are not going to help."

Nagarjuna did it; before Nagarjuna, Mahakashyap d=
id it, and it has been a long tradition. Zen people have been saying the sa=
me thing for centuries. Krishnamurti never uses the word "Zen", but whatsoe=
ver he is talking is nothing but Zen -- simple Zen.

Zen says no effort is =
needed, nothing has to be done. When nothing has to be done, what is the ne=
ed of a Master? -- because the Master will tell you to do something. Nothin=
g has to be done -- what is the need of the scriptures? -- because the scri=
ptures will tell you to do something, to know something. Nothing has to be =
done, nothing has to be known. You are already there where you are trying t=
o reach.

And I know this is true, but to talk about this ultimate truth to=
 people who are living in tremendous darkness is futile . Prem Pantha, no e=
nlightened person can ever be wrong, but only few enlightened persons have =
been of help. The majority of enlightened people have been of no help at al=
l, for the simple reason because they never considered the other.

In fact,=
 George Gurdjieff used to say, "Don't consider the other." It was one of hi=
s basic teachings: "Don't consider the other. Just say what is absolutely t=
rue." But the absolute truth is truth only when experienced; people are liv=
ing in relative truth.

My approach is different from Krishnamurti's. I kno=
w that one day you will come to that point where nothing is needed -- no Ma=
ster, no teaching, no scripture -- but right now the scripture can be of he=
lp, the methods can be of help, and certainly a living Master can be of imm=
ense help. The function of the Master is to give you that which you already=
 have and to take away that which you don't have at all.
