Namasrte SriRam,

Long back, i had posted the below message on this list.
=
I've put my argument in the message in which i firmly belive.
Its possible =
this may change the mind of your friend.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=
ic-wisdom/message/411
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4=
11>

The exact Argument is given again as under which is the extract from t=
he
above message:
[
I couldn=A1=A6t hold back myself and honestly explained=
 my
conclusive view point on the whole subject as follow
=A1=A7I don=A1=A6t=
 wish to stuff my stomach with the body parts of killed
creature. Would nev=
er think of troubling any leaving creature when
mother-nature has provided =
enough alternate food. Just for the sake
of filling my stomach or satisfyin=
g cravings of my tongue, I won=A1=A6t
be
responsible for killing innocent b=
irds, animals, fishes directly or
indirectly. What right I have, to snatch =
away even a single life in
the universe for my selfish reasons. I consider =
that as very very
cruel and that is the personal thinking why I am a vegeta=
rian and not
strictly due to any religious or cultural reason=A1=A8
]

Even=
 if Shri Krishna has not mentioned a direct wording of
Non-vegetarian food =
in Geeta, it is not right to take that excuse for
slottering creatures.

I =
ask any body to think for him/her self in the light of what is right
and wh=
at is not...

Best Regards,

Utpal
