Respected Narasimhaji,
In view of your explanation of the swara and beeja-i=
t strikes me that the Buddhists are chanting Om Mani Padma Hooma and the sa=
me mantra is chanted in=A0 the form of 
Om Mani pembe hoom by Tibetan Buddh=
ists as per my rough understanding.
May I request some enlightenment on the=
 mysticism of this mantra and the phonetic arrangement thereof !

Namaskaar=

Dear Narasimha ji,

Thank you very much for the c=
larification of the nasal ending of beeja mantras. I have been seeking answ=
ers about this for years by asking various scholars in India, but no-one co=
uld clarify it like you. My hat off to the depth of your knowledge.

You me=
ntion that the 'ka' consonant group corresponds to fire (as it does to Mars=
) and 'pa' consonant group corresponds to air (Saturn). This fits to Parash=
ara's assignment of Bhutas to the Grahas (BPHS 3. 20 / Ranjan publ.). So my=
 question is: Would it be right to assign each element to the consonant gro=
ups as per the Graha assigned to it (as per Parashara)?

So would this be c=
orrect?:
'ka' group -> Agni (Mangal)
'ca' group -> Jala (Shukra)
'Ta' group=
 -> Bhumi (Budha)
'ta' group -> Akasha (Guru)
'pa' group -> Vayu (Shani)

T=
he nasal (anunaasika)in each group represents Akasha, which makes sense as =
it is all-pervading. However, I wonder if it is correct that the 'ta' group=
 (Guru) would also be assigned to it.

I don't mean to go off topic.
I woul=
d love to hear more about the correspondence between the various beeja mant=
ras, their corresponding deities, Grahas and the Sanskrit alphabet.

Best r=
egards and thanks,

Andri
