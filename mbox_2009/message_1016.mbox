 else can advise better

I know this is not a forum to discuss astrology but if you w=
ould be so 
kind as to answer just one question regarding astrology and hom=
a.

I was reading somewhere that the fire of a homa is represented by 
Jupi=
ter among planets. So in case someone has a very badly placed 
jupiter whic=
h badhakesh or much afflicted, is it adviseable for such a 
person to perfo=
rm homa? Or will it lead to great dangers?

-Regards
Aparajita
