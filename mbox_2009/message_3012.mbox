 Saturday, June 2, 1883

Sri Ramakrishna had been invited to visit the home=
s of his devotees
Balaram,Adhar, and Ram in Calcutta. Devotional music had =
been arranged by
Adhar and Ram.The Master was accompanied in the carriage b=
y Rakhal, M., and
others.

As they drove along, Sri Ramakrishna said to the=
 devotees: "You see, sin
flies away when love of God grows in a man's heart=
, even as the water of the
reservoir dug in a meadow dries up under the hea=
t of the sun. But one cannot
love God if one feels attracted to worldly thi=
ngs, to 'woman and gold'. Merely
taking the vow of monastic life will not h=
elp a man if he is attached to the
world. It is like swallowing your own sp=
ittle after spitting it out on the
ground."
