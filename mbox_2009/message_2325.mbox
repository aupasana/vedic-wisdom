Dear Friends,
 A question has been raised as to who is a Brahmana.   A  Brahmana  was  considered as a person  who had attained higher spiritual knowledge (Brahmavidya), which was an extremely difficult path of discipline of body, mind and intellect  and people irrespective of birth or class, who dedicated to such an austere life were recognised as  Brahmanas   in the Vedic  age.  The concept that people born in Brahmin  caste  automatically become  a Brahmana  is a concept that came into existence much later.   Viswamitra   was a warrior (Kshatriya).  He became a  Brahmana after attaining   Brahmavidya. 

Sage Atri   has in his  Atri Smruti  defined  Brahmanhood clearly as follows:-
By birth, every man is a Shudra, meaning  an ignorant person.  Through various types of disciplines(samskaras),  he becomes a dwija (twice born).  Through the stuies of scriptures, he becomes a  vipra (scholar).  And through realization of the Supreme Spirit (Brahmajnaana), he becomes a Brahmin (Janmana jayate sudrah;samskarat dwija uchyate vedapati bhavet viprah brahma  jaanaati brahmanah).

In the Mahabharata,  we come across a dialogue between Yudhistira and  Yaksha.  It reads like this:-
"O King, how does one  become a Brahmin by birth? character? study of the Vedas? education? Tell me precosely.  Listen. Yaksha, it is neither by birth, nor education, nor even the study of the Vedas. Without doubt, it is character alone that marks a Brahmin." Yudhisthira`s answer is crisp, clear and unambiguous when he replies, 'na samsayah... there is no doubt about it.  In a previous passage in the Mahabhrata itself, in a dialogue with King Nahusha, Yudhisthira says," He is known as a Brahmana in whom truthfulness, liberality,patience, deportment, mildness, selfcontrol and compassion are found. And he may gain the knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, beyond happiness and unhappiness.... on reaching which they grieve no more".  The long list of attributes may be looked upon as components of character.

As to who is a Brahmin has been very clearly  defined by Lord Krishna in verse 42 of Chapter 18 of Bhagawad Gita. The Lord says:-
Samo damastapah saucham kshantih arjavam eva cha gyanam vigynam astikyam brahma karma svabhavajam.  Serenity, self-restraint, austerity,purity, forgiveness, uprightness, patience, humility, wisdom in theory and practice and faith in God--from these flow the natural duties of Brahmana.

 In the distant past, Brahmins, Vedic Priests, adhered to the principles of Brahminism.  They used to follow the Sanatana Dharma based on the Vedas. They had three compulsory duties viz., studying the Vedas, worshipping the Deity and giving charity.  A Brahmana could not take up any professional occupational duty for ekeing out his livelihood.

 Caste depends on one`s own natural proclivities. Brahmins are required to be learned,  According to  Manusmriti,   a Brahmana unable to live by the codes of his caste, may take to the profession of the caste below him--kshatriyas, vaisyas, but with certain restictions, against the spilling of blood and the sale of certain commodoties. In the past Brahmins had adorned the role of Priests, Ministers, scholars, advisers to kings etc. etc.  History says that Kautilya, later known as Chanakya was a Brahmin and he helped Chandra Gupta Maurya in establishing the Mauryan Empire. The Peshwas, were Brahmin ministers of Maratha kings.

Much more can be said on this topic. But for the present this is enough.
G.Balasubramanian

The image of a brahmana that crops up in my mind whenever this question is raised is the one of a successful accountant who used to visit our Matham in Chennai.  He used to come in his chauffeur driven Hundai Santro, all decked up in Mr.T style golden necklace with a large pendent dangling around, gabbing from his beetle-juice reddened mouth his astrological expertise, expounding on the intricate rules for the determination of when to perform certain sapindikaranam, and generally throwing his weight, which was quite enormous both literally and figuratively, around.  Yes, he lives in Bharatha Kanda which I guess confirms his otherwise impeccable brahmanahood.
