Dear All,

If this query sounds simplistic, please pardon me. 

In our daily Sandhyavandanam, we are advised to offer Arghya to the Sun 3 times, and while doing that, to chant the holy Gayatri mantra also thrice - and lateron to chant the Gayatri 108 times or 64 times as appropriate. I was wondering whether is a reason behind restricting the offer of Arghya to only 3 times. In fact, is it ok to offer Arghya more than 3 times, say 18 times or even 108 times, all the while chanting the holy Gayatri? Would it not enhance the spiritual act? Please offer your guidance on this. 

Regards
Hari
