Namaste Narasmihaji



Recently I had gone home for a few days and had the =
good fortune of being able to spend a lot of time at the Kalighat temple.

=

There I heard the priests reciting mantras of Dakshina Kali. 

What is the=
 difference between Dakshina Kali and Bhardra Kali?

Both these forms are p=
rayed across west bengal but I can't find out the difference between these =
two forms..

-Regards
 Rajarshi
