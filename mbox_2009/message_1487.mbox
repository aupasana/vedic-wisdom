While Narasimha can answer the question, I want to what I know:
1. Narasimh=
a is still working as a full time employee
2. I work close to 10 to 12 hour=
s a day.
I always gave the excuse of not having enough time. How ever, Nara=
simha kept telling me if you really want to do some thing, you will find ti=
me for it. We wast quite a bit of our time in activities not too important.=


For example, I used (even now to some extent) watch movies online, see cr=
icket matches, read news, watch TV.

If we perceive doing sadhana is more i=
mportant that these activities, we can cut down from these.

This is my per=
sonal experience. For 2 years after Narasimha urged me to do Japam regularl=
y, I kept giving excuse that I work too much and not having time. From last=
 3 years I am able to Japam regularly. From 2008 onwards doing Homam.

My w=
ork has been as hectic as it was earlier. It is matter of wanting.

Best re=
gards,
Vijay
