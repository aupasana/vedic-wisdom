Namaste,

Krishna, Shiva, Sain baba and such other beings are considered as=
 Gods and Self realised being.

They can eat *anything*. After complete rea=
lisation, differences dont exist for them. Brutality and compassion, Vegeta=
ble and Meat, Southpole and North Pole etc...dont make sense, But for most =
of us there is a clear differences.

Hence i say that Krishna, Sain Baba, R=
amakrsihan and Vivekananda may have had eaten also meat but it may not be w=
ise to take their example and shut the door of our own discrimination.

Man=
y SAIN Bhaktaas actually take Sain baba's quote as a strong argument and cl=
ose their eyes to the killing which goes in eating Meat and fish. Its not r=
ight IMHO.

***
Please do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspec=
tive of Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point =
in Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Viole=
nce) against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).  

Best Regards,

Utpal=

firm believer of Veg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to sp=
iritual growth. But, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some =
spiritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food=
, he has put a counter argument. He says that if I can find him a single sh=
loka on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would give up.

on-veg. If anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can beco=
