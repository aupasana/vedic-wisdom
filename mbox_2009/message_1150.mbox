Namaste Nalini and Hari,
        I agree with Hari. Starting off with Ganapathi Homam is definitely better. The procedure is short and it helps one practice the fire management, the mantras, the swaras and the whole nine yards. Moreover, the Chandi Homam Manual by itself is not self-sufficient. It relies on Ganapathi Homam manual. So, you have to go back and forth between the 2 manuals to perform Chandi Homam which can be done but gets little bit tricky in the beginning. So, get comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure.
        After you feel comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure, while continuing to do Ganapathi Homam daily, you can actually do Chandi Homam occasionally on certain days say weekends, or on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdasi which are especially auspicious for Chandipath/Chandi Homam. When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip your Ganapathi Homam for that day. After doing this for few months or when you feel you are comfortable with the Chandi Homam, finally settle down with it.
        It's getting close to an year since I did my first Chandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding me with fire management and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my pronunciation and all. I used to do it over weekends, which for me was taking about 3- 3 1/2hrs initially, owing to my poor Telugu reading skills. Then, slowly switched to daily after the whole process started taking about 2 hrs. While still, I am not perfect, I continue to practice. On this note, I am reminded of Narayan.
        The idea of writing a Maha Ganapathi Homam manual started off as Narayan asked Narasimha to help him out with the Homam Procedure. (Narayan's own inspiring message in this regard can be read at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/727). After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed the first copy to Narayan. Such was Narayan's dedication that he started going through the manual over and over. A few days later I met Narayan and enquired about the Homam manual and all. He very casually mentioned that he was doing the Homam mentally. I was dumbstruck. I said "What?". He said he would perform the whole procedure as mentioned in the document, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, imagining Agni pratishtapana, imagining invoking Ganesha, imagining offering ahutis, everything, start to finish in mind. I was really bowled over by his creative thinking. That is how Narayan practiced. Later, Narasimhaji gifted us Homa Kundam and we started
 our Homas. After few months passed by and I had to go on couple of trips where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and all the samagri. I implemented Narayan's idea and did my homam mentally for those few days. It then helped me avoid that feeling that I missed my homam. Though this process is not a replacement for the Homam with all the physical materials, yet, it is a form of a prayer to God. Something is better than nothing.
        Naliniji, She has already decided when you would start the Homam, it's just that we have not been informed yet. 
        I wish you all the very best.

Best Regards
Ravi

Dear Nalini, namaste



...thought I should probably start with Ganapati Homam and wondered if I also start Chandi homam... 



 
{Hari} I also had similar thoughts like you but I think that starting with Ganesha homam is better and then one can 'graduate' to Chandi homam.

 
Sadly, when I enquired locally (New Zealand) at the Indian shops I could not find Homa Kundam...



{Hari} Why not try to purchase it from rediff.com? A small copper homa kundam will cost around Rs 150 or so. Additionally you could ask the priest at the local temples there...I am sure they will guide you. 

After the first attempt to do Ganesha homam on 26 January, I did the homa again last Sunday and this time, it worked out fine.  

best regards
Hari
