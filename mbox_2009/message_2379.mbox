Namaste Rajarshi,

Unf=
ortunately, this verse depends on the context built by the previous 14 vers=
es of RV 10.95. Though I intended to type out a detailed mail with my indep=
endent interpretation of all the verses in that chapter, it is a big task a=
nd I am unable to find time for it.
 
Fortunately, I chanced upon a nice we=
bsite giving the Hindi translation (including word-by-word meanings) of all=
 the four Vedas by Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Though not at the same depth =
as Aurobindo's commentary (which was limited to a few verses), his exhausti=
ve work is quite good.
 
If you are comfortable with Hindi language, please=
 use this website for commentary on Vedas in future. It is far far far far =
better than the English commentary on the site you referred to. I checked o=
ut some sample verses and quite pleased with the commentary. This work is s=
imilar in wavelength to my own thinking and I am comfortable recommending t=
his. Though it does not internalize enough in several places, it is not dum=
b and silly like other internet commentaries.
 
In the case of RV 10.95 tha=
t you enquired about, Swami Dayananda Saraswati interpreted Pururava as a c=
loud containing water and Urvashi as vidyut (electricity, i.e. lightening).=
 This is quite intelligent and acceptable to me, though my view expressed i=
n the mail below internalizes it further.
 
The website is

Click the link on the right for Rigveda bhashya (bhas=
hya=3Dcommentary). God bless Arya Samaj folks at Jamnagar!
 
Best regards,

> Veda is for self-realization. Veda deals with various aspects of dual=
 and non-dual self. There are hardly any good translations or commentaries =
on Veda in today's world. Aurobindo's commentary (on a small number of riks=
) is the only intelligent commentary I have come across.
>  
> Just as Adi =
Sankara devoted his life to commenting on some Upanishads, someone like him=
 needs to come and devote life to commenting on Veda, if we are to have a g=
ood commentary. Actually, Vivekananda commented on his last day (1902 July =
4) on the commentaries on Veda. He had his disciples read a verse from Sukl=
a Yajur Veda, read the commentary by Mahidhara and said that Mahidhara's in=
terpretation did not appeal to his mind. He connected the verse to some lat=
er day tantra concepts and wished that his disciples would make an attempt =
at fresh independent interpretation of mantras from Veda, as the existing c=
ommentaries were not good. This was one of the last few desires expressed b=
y Vivekananda before he gave up his body.
>  
> Aurobindo said that he had =
a vision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda explained s=
ome things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with a sublime =
commentary on some Vedic verses in later years.

Commenting on a verse from Veda is different. It is not merely an intellect=
ual activity requiring scholarship and logical thinking.
>  
> I cannot giv=
e a complete sense of what this verse is saying (will try later), but can g=
ive an overall big picture first. The verses around this verse alternate be=
tween having Pururava as the rishi (seer) and Urvashi as the devata (deity)=
 and having Urvashi as the rishi (deity) and Pururava as the devata (deity)=
. This is an exchange between Pururava and Urvashi as they pursued each oth=
er. You can read various puranic stories about Pururava, the great king fro=
m Chandra vamsha, and Urvashi, the beautiful apsara (celestial nymph). They=
 were attracted to each other and lived together on earth. They are personi=
fications of some qualities inside us.
>  
> Urvashi comes from ura and vas=
ha. It means one who has the power to control and pull the heart. Urvashi i=
s personification of the attraction that pulls one's heart towards various =
objects in the field of duality. As a sadhaka does great tapascharya and st=
arts to overcome duality, Urvashi is sent to test one. Urvashi successfully=
 seducing a sadhaka and disturbing his tapascharya means that the sadhaka s=
uccumbed to the power of attraction that pulled his heart towards objects a=
nd his heart desired something.
>  
> Pururava means a crying a lot or cryi=
ng majestically. He is a personification of the emotional nature and compas=
sion within us. No wonder he is a king in the Chandra vamsha. The solar and=
 lunar lineages that are popular in the scriptures have to do with the sola=
r and lunar channels - Pingala and Ida (respectively). Ida nadi is the chan=
nel of emotions, intuition, feeling, compassion etc. So Pururava is from th=
at lineage.
>  
> While everyone is charmed by Urvashi - the power of attra=
ction that binds one's heart, Urvashi herself was charmed by Pururava, the =
majestic and noble king. Pururava rescued Urvashi from a demon once. The ma=
jestic and noble quality of compassion saves the power of attraction from h=
aving to combine with meaner motives. One's heart can be pulled towards var=
ious objects out of the spirit of self-gratification (a demon) or out of ki=
ndness and compassion (Pururava). When compassion arises in one's heart, th=
en the heart's attraction to others is driven by compassion rather than the=
 spirit of self-gratification.
>  
> The verses you referred to are a dialo=
g between the personification of compassion and personification of the powe=
r of attraction that pulls one's heart towards various objects. This whole =
series of verses has to be interpreted in abstract and internalized terms. =
It is not a commentary on men and women at all.
