Namaste,
 
The best would be do homam and then separately perform deva, ris=
hi and pitri tarpanas together.

For doing any spiritual activity - japam or tarpana or just reading a scrip=
ture or contemplation - strong bhootaagni is very important for internalizi=
ng and digesting the experience spiritually. If a person with a very weak o=

ligible. As a person's bhootaagni is maximized immediately following a ritu=

 activities.

 you are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, you can even integrate it with=
 homam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas while sitting in front of the fi=
re, after the uttaraangam and before the poornaahuti, and then go on to off=
er poornaahuti. However, if you also want to include pitris (deceased ances=

homam.

and asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of homam, I s=
tudied and practiced several approaches and experienced some things interna=
lly and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals were create=
d. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding was limited=
 when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish's blessings, I had some do=
ubts=C2=A0on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enough or =
not. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Chandi ho=
mam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/ Durga idol I us=
e for homam, "O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, but my e=
xperience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and distribu=
te tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manuals in =
future. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please give me s=
ome signal today as I perform the
>  procedure. I will understand. I will p=
ublish them only if you give your approval."
> =C2=A0
> Then I sat down to =
perform tarpanas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, th=
ere was such a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of =
the wind was really loud. I started deva tarpana and said "brahmaa tripyata=
am" and left water. Then I took water into my palm again and said "vishnuh =
tripyataam". As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds fro=
m outside. When I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heav=
y rain with really big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previ=
ous 10 days and there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It=
 was very sunny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as =
tarpana started and the rain continued till the end of the day.
> =C2=A0

I took the wind and the rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanke=
d her at the end=C2=A0and went ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed=
 the ritual more times later, I slowly understood the real meaning and purp=
ose of tarpana. For many people with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas=
 to deceased ancestors with mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very usefu=
l ritual. I now fully understand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter=
, emphasized performing both homam and tarpana and how they supplement each=
 other. I am glad that more people are considering performing a quick homam=
 and a quick tarpana on a regular basis. Even a combination of=C2=A0a 30-mi=
nute homam and a 5-minute tarpana performed daily will go a long way in fre=
eing one.
