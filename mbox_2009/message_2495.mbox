Hello,

Our mothers carry us in their intern=

fire for years so that one day we may light outer fire. Physical mothers ar=

. I am sure Divine Mother will feel pleased with you.

Thanks.

Namaste Krishna Kanth,
 
Suppose god really came to your pl=
ace in a human form and asked you to give him some nice food. Will you allo=
w someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why=A0 not allow him to "serve god"?
=
 
It is not just about "serving god", but serving god *well*. A purified se=
rvant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no ot=
her thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may think vario=
us things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-centeredness an=
d ego even in serving god.
 
The god in your homam fire is not an external =
god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecti=
ng the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ab=
ility to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Thou=
gh there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with=
 so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can fo=
cus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. =
Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the d=
ivinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus=
, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside =
you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity s=
hould be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnec=
essary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desi=
res and other thoughts
 will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly=
 focus on that divinity.. Some precautions will help you in the journey.
 
=
Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in your homam fire a=
re basically being received in your internal god. If he has enough power (h=
is power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific=
 desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who kn=
ows whether the desire was worthwhile?!
 
Of course, when you are offering =
things in fire, you yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may sl=
ow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is =
no escape. But, why let someone else's desires cause an extra slow down?
 
=
Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being nice.
 
Howev=
er, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closel=
y connected to one karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife's desi=
res may affect husband's desires and mother's desires may affect son's desi=
res already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So th=
ere is no significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.
 
Bottomline=
:
 
If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas =
and their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then=
 allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow sp=
ecifically, some close people's karmas and desires may already be directly =
affecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!
 
Usually=
, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better..
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha

I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family. Immediate famil=
y includes spouse, children and parents. However, if you have a strong karm=
ic connection with someone from previous lifetime's then they can also part=
icipate. Of course, this may not be obvious. For example, there was a gentl=
eman whose last rites was performed not by his kids, but by one of his fore=
ign students. Needless to say, the last rites are considered very important=
 ritual and is a privilege of the children, however, in this case since the=
re was a karmic connection, the foreign student (whom the gentleman also co=
nsidered as one of his spiritual children) ended up performing the ritual. =

ngs in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fi=
re for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whos=
e karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and child=
ren. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you ar=
e
 ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong=
 individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing t=
hat ego. When one's ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on =
more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking l=
eaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it =
and let it grow very<br>> >  big, it can give flowers and fruits=
 to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn =
your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) cause=
d by them.<br>> > <br>> > But some people use fire in the same =
way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, ha=
ndle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies =
one's internal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastro=
us.. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not
 underst=
and much about fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. =
So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from =
fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or maki=
ng offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at wor=
st.<br>> > <br>> > The best approach is: You start your own fir=
e. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identif=
y it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body=
. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your =
knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.<=

 times, these n=
yaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a particular=
