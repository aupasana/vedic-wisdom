lines? Like where it ends with "|" or where it ends with "||" ?

> Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do homan of it
=A0
That=
 is not a valid reason. Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in homam=
. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri mantra are very very powerfu=
l mantras and they are offered in homam. On the Tantrik side, Pratyangira m=
antra, Mahasudarsana mantra, Paashupata mantra etc=A0are very very powerful=
 astra mantras=A0and they are offered in homam. As these examples show, eve=
n very powerful mantras can be offered in fire for amplification.
=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The power of powerful mantr=
as is a mirage for most people. The experience given by a mantra and the in=
ternal/external results brought by a mantra vary from mantra to mantra. But=
, even with a very powerful mantra, one needs to be ready for the mantra to=
 actually work.
=A0
When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fil=
l it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the m=
ind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption=
=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow=
 of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that ca=
uses corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmi=
c interactions between various objects. 
=A0
There may be thousands of path=
s to climb a mountain. Each path takes one to a different spot atop the mou=
ntain. The view one has from the top may be different accordingly. One view=
 may be more breathtaking and amazing than another. However, one taking a p=
ath leading to a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading to a norma=
l view both have to struggle on their paths and reach the top despite obsta=
cles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, but none is too easy. All paths a=
re difficult to walk, but some result in a more breathtaking view than the =
others.
=A0
Similarly, one chanting a "powerful mantra" and a "normal mantr=
a" will both have to put in effort and overcome the weaknesses and get cont=
rol over mind. The power of the powerful mantra refers to a more powerful e=
xperience after one succeeds with the mantra (more breathtaking scenery on =
reaching the mountain top). It is not correct to think that things will hap=
pen automatically and easily because one if chanting a powerful mantra 11 (=
or whatever) times.

Coming back to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommend homam with Kunjika =
stotra. Kunjika stotra is a coded stotra containing several mantras in code=
d form. It is not what it may seem to be. It is for a reason that Shiva tel=
ls Parvati that this prayer should be hidden like one's privates. It is wei=
rd that we are discussing such a secretive mantra on a public forum. It is =
a collection of powerful mantras for specific prayogas that would be consid=
ered raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the act=
ions is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.
=A0
I see no point =
in wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to do a homam with Kunjika=
 stotra to stop the army of a country in their tracks or kill someone or de=
lude someone etc and if you are detached enough to carry it off successfull=
y, then you will be given an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. O=
therwise, why even try?
=A0
My advice is to drop the idea of doing a homam =
with Kunjika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses). If that is too =
long for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th chapter or just th=
e 11th chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just the moola mantra =
(navaakshari) .
=A0
If one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well,=
=A0a homam with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.

are pending reply. I am aware of it and will try to catch up. I am very bus=
