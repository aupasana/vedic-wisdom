NAMASKAR

Dear Narasimha Ji,

Got your point perfectly, though read all of =
those spiritual advices/lessons listed in this group specially shortlisted =
in your site "http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/writings.htm", there are=
 no direct guidance of many simple things, visiting many holy places are no=
t enough getting "self realization and GOD" as you already taught...but sup=
pose I like to visit, I want to refresh my mind from every perspective of t=
ouring,seeing the temple,visiting deities,pray before GOD,pray to make myse=
lf happy,spend time with my family, everything... that's why that innocent =
question arises...I am satisfied with your answer too...

As you stated LAK=
SHMI-NARASIMHA is my ISHTA DEVATA before, I always chant "OM HRIM KSHYOUM S=
HRIM SRILAKSHMINRISIMHAYA NAMAH" consciously and sub-consciously when my mi=
nd filled with nothing or even thinking else...

Whether I may not address =
you "Guruji", but I need your blessings, I need you as a guide, as a teache=
r, I respect you most as you changed my view already, I need you atleast wi=
th a little conversation in this forum...

I am going to Chennai this eveni=
ng with my family though making a "short neverending quarrel" with my wife =
yesterday...I worried most for my little son...may GOD bless to end the dif=
ference and make my family happy...

best regards with lots of hope,
Biswaj=
it

 I was a bit amused when I read your innocent query. This is like asking "I=

your account is small, you cannot withdraw one million dollars even if you =
go to the biggest bank in the world. The focus should be on working hard an=

 keep chanting "Om Namo Venkateshaaya" or "Om Namo Bhagavate Venkateshaaya"=
 within your mind, whatever you are doing externally. If your mind is dwell=
ing on a mantra most of the time, it minimizes undesirable thoughts and cre=
ates purity of the mind. A pure mind receives and reflects god's light bett=
er than a mind pre-occupied with a lot of useless thoughts arising from the=
 mental conditioning. Keep chanting the mantra.

> You can, of course, d=
o that even when you are not in Tirupati. Repeated sadhana with a mantra ca=
n create a situation where your mind starts chanting that mantra sub-consci=
ously when it is idle. That saves the mind from some useless activity.
