Dear Narsimhaji,
  You and your writings,....this group itself is very insp=
iring.
Earlier i would just plan to do something,but reading all the messag=
es 
here,has got me implementing them.And i thank you and all the members 
=
of this group.

I have a few queries sir,

After puja in the morning, i do =
japa,one mala each for 
Kuladevi,/Ganapati,Shiva and Narayan.I do one mala,=
turn the mala and 
do the next ,in the above order.Is this fine Or should i=
 change 
something?If i do one mala for one 'god',i feel i should do one fo=
r 
this 'god' also.Please explain,i'll be very grateful.
Thank you
  Sunita=
.
