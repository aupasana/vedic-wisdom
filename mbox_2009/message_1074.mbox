Editor's Corner

Welcome to LIVING DHARMA TODAY, the free online news=
letter dedicated
to the spiritual teachings of Sri Dharma Pravartaka Achary=
a, and to
the global renewal of Sanatana Dharma.

Though 2008 was a year of=
 great economic catastrophe for much of the
world, and 2009 promises to als=
o be a year of similar perilous
economic and political developments, this n=
ew year also offers us many
unique opportunities for personal spiritual gro=
wth, and for the
revival of Sanatana Dharma globally. Where there are treme=
ndous
challenges, after all, there is also the opportunity for tremendous
a=
chievement!

As we enter into this new year, there have been many new and e=
xciting
developments in the teaching mission of Sri Acharyaji, with many mo=
re
to come!

The first of these changes is the new name of our old newslett=
er
Dharma Journal. Signaling the new dynamic momentum of our activities,
we=
 are now called LIVING DHARMA TODAY. LIVING DHARMA TODAY is
dedicated to br=
inging you the most cutting-edge articles, news, and
information on the glo=
bal Dharma community. As our new name
indicates, our focus is on Dharma as =
the dynamic, living gift that it
is for us today. Dharma is alive! Dharma i=
s meant to be lived. And
Dharma represents the future of our planet.

The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita

Always perform your duty efficiently=
 and without any selfish
attachment to the results, because by doing work w=
ithout attachment
one attains Supreme. (3.19)

King Janaka and others attai=
ned perfection of Self-realization by
selfless service (Karma-yoga) alone. =
You should also perform your duty
with a view to guide people, and for the =
welfare of the society. (3.20)

Because whatever noble persons do, others f=
ollow. Whatever standard
they set up, the world follows. (3.21)

O Arjuna, =
there is nothing in the three worlds =97 heaven, earth, and
the lower regio=
ns =97 that should be done by Me, nor there is anything
unobtained that I s=
hould obtain, yet I engage in action. (3.22)

Because, if I do not engage i=
n action relentlessly, O Arjuna, people
would follow My path in everyway. T=
hese worlds would perish if I do
not work, and I shall be the cause of conf=
usion and destruction of all
these people. (3.23-24)

Sanatana Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way

"S=
anatana Dharma (commonly referred to erroneously as "Hinduism") is a
spirit=
ual path that has existed since the beginning of time. It is a
path that is=
 both ancient in origin, and profound in its understanding
of the nature of=
 reality. Sanatana Dharma is completely unlike any
other religious traditio=
n in existence. Rather than reflecting the
dogmatically inclined expression=
s of denominationalism, sectarianism,
and divisive religious doctrines that=
 are of more recent origin,
Sanatana Dharma is a spiritual expression of th=
e divine intelligence
that naturally underlies the more empirical aspects o=
f our cosmos.
Sanatana Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way. As such, this pat=
h
represents the pre-religious, primordial essence of all true
spirituality=
, philosophy, and yearning to know the higher Reality, as
well as the very =
foundation of any and all attempts to establish a
civilization based upon e=
ternal ideals."

2. Acharyaji's Fast U=
pdate:

As was previously announced, on January 5, 2009, Sri Dharma Pravart=
aka
Acharya began an arduous thirty day fast. Living on only water and
juic=
e, and engaging in intense public meditation and prayer every day
of this p=
eriod, Sri Acharyaji has undertaken this very austere Great
Vow for Dharma =
(Dharmodaya Maha Vrata) in order to prepare the
spiritual groundwork for th=
e revival of Dharma in our world, as well
as to encourage others to practic=
e Dharma more faithfully.

While such Maha Vratas have been performed in th=
e past by great gurus,
rishis, and Acharyas, as recounted in the ancient Hi=
ndu scriptures,
such an undertaking is very rarely performed in today's era=
. As of
this writing, Sri Acharyaji is on day 20 of his thirty day fast, an=
d
has lost 15 pounds. We thank all the hundreds of people who have sent
the=

Acharyaji=

Yog=
ini: The Enlightened Woman
Written by Shambhavi Chopra

>From the book, Yogi=
ni: Unfolding the Goddess Within by Shambhavi Chopra


In the Bhavani-nama-=
sahasra (the Thousand Names of the Goddess
Bhavani) as beautifully explaine=
d by Pandit Jankinath Kaul, "A Yogini
is one who is possessed of magical po=
wers.'' Para Shakti, the Supreme
Shakti, in the form of Durga is given the =
name Yogini. She assumes
various forms and takes on different divine energi=
es to maintain
harmony in the Universe, to combat evil and uphold the good.=
 A woman
who gains a transcendental state in sadhana comes back as a celest=
ial
Yogini or Bhairavi, a female adept at Yoga. She carries the energy of
D=
urga within her.

A true Yogini is an enlightened woman with exuberant pass=
ion,
spiritual powers and deep insight. Yoginis communicate a sense of
free=
dom, a sheer mastery in whatever they do. With their compelling
gazes, they=
 can hypnotize even a great yogi and are capable of
changing their shapes a=
t will. Tantric scholars have written about
Yoginis as independent, outspok=
en, forthright women with a
gracefulness of spirit. Without them, yoga can =
fail in its purpose and
remain sterile.

Shakta texts honor both women and =
the Earth alike as sources of
energy, vitality, physical and spiritual well=
-being. Noting this
analogy between a Yogini and the earth, an eleventh-cen=
tury Tibetan
Cakrasamvara commentary states: "Having recognized a Yogini wh=
o will
delight and transmit energy and power to him, and feeling passionate=
ly
attracted to her, if the male aspirant does not worship that Yogini,
she=
 will not bless the yogi, and spiritual attainments will not
arise.'' Miran=
da Shaw's book, Passionate Enlightenment, which was
introduced to me by Lok=
esh Chandraji, first exposed the world of the
Yogini to me from a Buddhist =
perspective.

In Hindu thought, the Yogini represents the Yoga Shakti herse=
lf, the
Kundalini, as well as the resident powers or female deities of the
=
different chakras. The Yogini possesses the power of Yoga herself and
can a=
waken that in others, not only generally but at any point or
place in the b=
ody or mind. A man's ability to achieve the higher
states of Yoga can be fa=
cilitated by his association with such a
female companion who reflects this=
 energy.

Just as a Goddess blesses and benefits her devotees, and the Shak=
ti
vivifies all biological, cultural, and religious practices, so a woman
c=
an channel this life force or spiritual energy to her
consort-devotee. A wo=
man is no more depleted by providing this
spiritual nourishment than a moth=
er by nursing her child. In fact, it
causes deeper energies to well up from=
 within her.

This spiritual energy is not something that a man can extract=
 or take
from a Yogini at will. She chooses when and on whom to bestow her
=
blessings. Her ability to enhance a man's spiritual development
depends upo=
n her innate divinity as awakened and brought to fruition
by her own yogic =
practices, which include envisioning herself in the
forms of various Goddes=
ses and investing herself with Their
appearances and ornaments, tender and =
wrathful expressions, and
supernatural powers for liberating beings. By con=
ferring energy and
grace upon a man - ''blessing '' or ''empowering'' him -=
 she is not
weakening herself but rather sharing her energy voluntarily wit=
h one
who has won her favour by meeting the various requirements that she
m=
ay impose.

This relationship parallels human-divine relationships in so fa=
r as
the deity is the benefactor and the human devotee is the beneficiary.
=
Although the Deity may derive some gratification from the
relationship, the=
 devotee has much more to gain than does the
sovereign object of his devoti=
on. What supplicants ultimately want
from their deity is supreme deliveranc=
e or liberation, and this is
what male Tantrics should seek to gain from th=
eir relationships with
spiritual women. Tantric texts reiterate that a man =
cannot gain
enlightenment without respecting women and allying himself inwa=
rdly
with a woman. The woman's beneficence is a gracious, yet voluntary
res=
ponse to her devotee's supplication, homage and worship.

The Goddess is a =
great Yogini, devoted to Shiva, yet matching His
powers. She is the embodim=
ent of pure energy, the Mother and matrix of
all manifestation, the source =
of all time, space and creation. As they
practiced Yoga together, Shakti ac=
cepted Shiva as her Guru, and he
taught her the ways of transcendent being =
to guide her to her ultimate
liberation. Shiva in turn also accepted Shakti=
 as his Guru, and she
initiated him into his ultimate liberation through pu=
tting him in
touch with the supreme power of consciousness.

The Goddess Ch=
hinnamasta, the deity who cuts off her own head,
symbolizes the great Yogin=
i, the wonderful consciousness beyond the
mind. She represents the opened T=
hird Eye from which flashes forth the
lightening of direct perception that =
destroys all duality and
negativity. She is the Yoga Shakti or power of Yog=
a in its most
dramatic action of granting enlightenment. Hence she is also =
known as
Vajra Yogini. The Vajra is the supreme lightning force of the inne=
r Self.

Chhinnamasta is the Para-Dakini, the supreme or foremost of the
Da=
kinis, the attendant Goddesses on the yogic path, who are the
yoginis as th=
e powers of the chakras. Sadhakas seeking the path of
occult or yogic power=
s should worship her, as reiterated by David
Frawley in his book Tantric Yo=
ga and the Wisdom Goddesses, invoking
her through the mantra based on her n=
ame as Vajra Vairochani. This
facilitates all inner transformations in a dr=
amatic way.
The Yogini is also Bhairavi or the Goddess of Fire below in the=

muladhara or root chakra. It is she who becomes Chhinnamasta as she
reache=
s the third eye and opens the crown chakra beyond. Her blood is
light that =
illumines everything.

Mary Magdalene was such a Yogini, manifesting her Sh=
akti through the
flow of light from her heart and soul. Her Divine love was=

unconditional and independent of external situations and dogmas. Yet
Divin=
e love is not limited to the ascetic. In my understanding of
Tantra, if two=
 spiritually evolved beings come together in
unconditional love, they also =
can create an energy field that is most
positive and rare, exuding high vib=
rational levels of peace and love
into the universe.

The ancient cultures =
of Egypt, Greece, Tibet and India have esoteric
traditions glorifying the i=
nitiatory power of the woman. She is
considered to be the high priestess wh=
o unfolds all higher knowledge
and powers for us. She is Sophia, the source=
 and font of wisdom or
Prajna, the deepest insight into the nature of thing=
s. Tantric
teachings stress the importance of physical beauty in a companio=
n but
only to initially stimulate and then elevate passion from the sensual=

to the spiritual plane. The beauty of the soul surpasses physical beauty.
=

The `initiatory' power of woman is tremendous, providing the force of
pass=
ion that is necessary for developing experiential mysticism. By
sharing the=
 secrets of love, a woman can bestow transcendental power
on her lover. The=
 highest form of Shakti is the direct expression of
the wisdom-energy she r=
eleases, creating a joyful transformation. A
woman can initiate her partner=
 into such mystical experiences through
trust, surrender to higher ideals a=
nd spontaneity. It is the Goddess
within each woman who really initiates.

=
To be a Yogini is the highest spiritual goal for all women. It is the
way t=
o become one with the Goddess within and to bring her out in
expression to =
uplift the world that is really her creation. Yet it is
not an outer appear=
ance but a state of inner energy and ecstasy that
makes the Yogini. She can=
not be manipulated, defined or even ever
entirely known.
