Namaste Rajarshi,

you have given a popular opinion but we need to now go b=
eyond that and find out some truth  for our own understanding. Harsh truth =
is that we ourselves are in a complete doubt of the 'Madeup stories' or oth=
erwise of the so called narrations. (Such as some  one called Shiva is one =
of our great God - Paarvati is his spouse- Ganesha & Kartikeya are their So=
ns and so on and so forth).

>This was made this way for the oridinary peop=
le to understand and >not leave the folds of Hinduism. The threat then was =
Buddhism. That >is why not only these stories were "made"

if the above phr=
ase means that they are all stories and were MADE to counter some threat, t=
hen we are for many geneartions building our faith upon false ground.

> So=
lution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to learn our >religion bet=
ter. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on >television would do well to=

ure of Hinduism instead of mere >reciting the stories from teh Puranas.

No=
 need to depend upon any Babas and swamis. first all of us need to understa=
nd the truth ourselves. if even spiritual teachers themselves are not sure =
of these answers, how they'll pass on the knowledge and what quality.
 
Mai=
n question to all: Is the Story of Ganapati & Shiva is true?

or should wai=
t for Ganapati himself in the hope that at one fine day he dicides to grant=
 me Darshna during one of the Homam time and tells me the truth himself :)
=

Sach kya hai - is it ITIHAAS or MYTHOLOGY (Just like Fantom and Herry pott=
er)

Best Regards,
Utpal
