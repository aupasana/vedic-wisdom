Dear Narsimhaji / Utpal,

Can we do mahaganapathi homam by sitting in diffe=
rent directions?.. Like i have heard that each direction=A0 has its own imp=
ortance.. I normally sit facing east and doing homam every day.. but for a =
change or for betterment is it ok=A0 if i do homam every day by sitting in =
different direction,? sometimes facing east, sometimes facing west., north =
and south? I would be happy if varous hands movements as shown by shri nars=
imhaji in video can be explained to us.. so that we also can perform.. duri=
ng chanting=A0 ''AAVAHITO BHAV.. SANNIHOTO BHAV...ETC.."

I have few other =
friends who would like to be a part of this homam.. is it possible if i go =
to their house and would perform homam in their front.. so that they will o=
bserve me doing this and then they can do it by themself.. I know i am not =
perfect by myself yet.. but my intention is to help them performing this ho=
mam. this is how i can encourage others and they also can get the benefit o=
f this..

As for bali.. i normally use any fruit.. and after offering six p=
ieces, balance part of fruit is not consumed by me .. it is thrown..but for=
 example.. i purchase one killo grapes.. and each day i use six grapes out =
of full bunch for balli.. and next day another six grapes out of that bunch=
.. will that be ok? 

Regards,

Rajesh

        =
    Namaste,



this is a very good question by Krishna Kanth. i remember o=

I am sure that this dilemma is faced by many many more.

as our narasim=
ha said, refrain from giving if you know before that it will be misused. It=
 is ideal NOT TO feel that you are giving or helping or favouring. it is be=
st to think that "Maa ka tha, maa ne merese leke kisi aur ko diya" then i t=
hink balance sheet will tally.



but most of us are yet to reach that exal=
ted state and therfore I have a good proverb (Excellent proverb in my opini=
on for such tricky situation) for such dilemma



"Neki Kar aur Dariya me d=
al" 



Warm Regards,



Utpal
