Ramkishoreji,
It appears you have not seen my subsequent postings on this subject.  Performing a Homa at home is unavoidabel during Sraddha ceremony in which coconut is not offered for Poornahuti. In respect of other homams which are optional  a person is going to spend quite a good amount on the homam and I do not think he will grudge the cost of half a coconut. In India no coconut costs more than Rs. 20. On this point we may not continue the discussion.
G.Balasubramanian

Balasubramanyam ji

I do understand the spirit in which you are suggesting the below , definetly giving higher value to the well laid rules of the rishis is a nice suggestion.

But given the progress of Kali and its effects. 

1.Most food including Milk nowadays is contaminated with Pesticides.Thanks to the hybrid culture propagated by the big genetic seed companies... No food on earth is left untainted.

So should such food be offered to god.Should we altogether give up offering food >

2.The water that comes from the tap in the US is heavily contaminated with heavy metals, lead , chlorine and what not....filtered water is striped of its natural healing properties.. .

So should we use such a water in Pitri Tarapana..Kalasha etc etc...

3. Fire should not be lit with Matches according to Vedic homa rules , it must only be lit with Samidhas and that too with a elaborate procedure... .

So should we stop using matches untill we attain perfection with the procedure...

When the whole world is under the effect of Kali yuga it is but a part of nature that impurities will creep into all the materials that are offered to god.

Same goes for the search for the perfect ingredients. .
Same goes for the search for the perfect guru who can be followed..
Same goes for the search for the perfect muhurta....
Same goes for the search for the perfect astrological remedy.....

What is visible to the naked eye is 10% whereas the invisible is 90% ...so what is to guarantee that any of those calculations will work.

Does not Krishna say in the 9th chapter Verse 26 of the gita...he is easily pleased with a offering of a flower , leaf ,fruit done with the purest of intentions.

I strongly beleive it is much better to do homa with complete surrender to the divine and he/she will absolve us of the lapses committed conscious or unconscious.

Simply because half coconut burns faster than full coconut, in my humble opinion we can not substtute a full coconut with a broken half of coconut in Poorna Ahuti. Already our purohits are using camphor for lighting Agni.  This is not the prescribed method of generating fire for Homam( Havan).Some of them are also blowing fire with  a gush of wind from their mouth for  the purpose of creating flame  instead of  using hand fan or  by blowing through a cylindrcal pipe or blowing through Dharba grass. My appeal to learned people is let us not devite from the procedures and dos and donts handed over to us by Rishis.
