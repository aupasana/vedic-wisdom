Namaste,

Feeling the pain of others and being compassionate for it is a saintly 
quality. Any thought or action with which you identify strongly does become 
a karma for future. But some karmas are good and their fruits are sweet, 
while some karmas are bad and and their fruits are bitter. Thinking of good 
to someone or doing good to someone is a good karma. Thinking of your good 
and hurting someone else is a bad karma. So do not worry about karmik 
consequences when you genuinely feel compassion for someone.

Though the prophesy of Mayan civilization seems to refer to 2012 Dec 21, I 
see the planetary position around 2012 Dec 12-13 as more interesting. I can 
see why some seers from ancient civilizations may have anticipated big 
changes at this time.

However, I see no apocalypse or end of world as some prophesize. We are 
about 5,000 years into Kali yuga and another 427,000 years are left. 
However, Kali may have brought some changes too fast and Nature may want us 
to slow things down. It is my expectation that some transformation will take 
place in our world in the coming 10 years and 2012 may indeed be an 
interesting year. But I see nothing to fear. I see a better phase within 
Kali yuga setting in during the next decade or two. Worry about nothing, 
leave things to Her and do your individual dharma sincerely without thinking 
too much about either the past or the future.

Best regards,
Narasimha
