Yes, that is a v=
ery good sight. if you have noticed in Narasimha's Homam vedio, smoke line =
from Agarbatti is seen entering in to Homa Kund fire. when i perform Homa, =
initially i used to notice it and gave a very good feeling. recently, my so=
n was almost screemed when he observed that. It is really a beutiful specta=
cle to see a smoke line connecting burning tip of agarabaati and Agni of th=
e Havan kuna.
But we all know that it is due to the sucking effect of vaccu=
m created due to fire which draws the smoke of agarabatti towards itself - =
Bhakto ko science se kya lena dena:)

Warm Regards,

Utpal
