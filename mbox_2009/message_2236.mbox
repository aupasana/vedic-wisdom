namaste,

Especially when it comes to Advaitins, there is a prevaling senti=
ment that they
are interested in gyAna at the expense of bhakti. For exampl=
e, in this thread,
between the words "God-realized" and "self-realized", Sh=
ankaracharya was
labelled as "self-realized". We often have such theoretica=
l discussions without
understanding the terms involved (I am more guilty of=
 this than most). For me,
this book helped clarify some of these terms and =
concepts, from a learned
jagadguru who had directly experienced.

Based on =
my reading, the path to spirituality requires destroying the
ego. I don't
t=
hink that it is possible for me to reduce my ego without both bhakti
to Ish=
wara
and vicAra as part of the picture.

I have to surrender to a higher po=
wer in order to reduce my ego. But then my ego
shows up elsewhere and becom=
es happy that I am a good bhakta that is pleasing
Ishwara. Then I have to r=
ealize that Ishwara isn't pleased by my
action or inaction.
And then, witho=
ut a higher power in the picture, the original ego
resurfaces. Hence,
as fa=
r as the process is concerned, I believe that bhakti and vicAra
go hand in =
hand.
Using an illustration from the Yoga-Vasishtha, it is like the two
win=
gs of a bird that
wants to fly.

I understood the question as asking about =
self-realization (through vicAra) and
God-realization (through bhakti). Fro=
m my perspective, the path and desired
result are really the same, regardle=
ss of how they are labelled. Looking back,
reading this book helped form my=
 opinion, and I thought that others might find
the book to be equally revea=
ling.

bhavadiiyaH,

      ajit
