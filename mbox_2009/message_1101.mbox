Hariom Sri Narasimhaji

Thank you for the video, it clarifies a lot of ques=
tions (mudras 
etc), wonderful idea!! I was also under the impression that =
you were 
refferring to coconut shell, which by and large is a no-no for 
h=
omam's. It looks like you performed the entire homa with one copra 
only, a=
nd ghee, and the 2nd addition of 1/2 coconut for poornahuti.
Does cow dung =
produce smoke?
