F THE LIFETIME OF LORD RAM


Dating the Era of Lord Ram:=C2=A0
Discover the=
 Actual Dates of the Lifetime of Lord Ram

Excerpts=E2=80=A6(The following =
document is the=C2=A0 'MOST' authentic scientific work that does
not need f=
urther scientific verification.)
=C2=A0
The story of Shri Rams' life was fi=
rst narrated by Maharishi Valmiki in the Ramayana,=C2=A0which was written a=
fter=C2=A0Shri Ram was crowned as the king of Ayodhya.=C2=A0

Maharishi=C2=
=A0Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has made sequential astronomical re=
ferences=C2=A0on important dates related to the life of Shri Ram indicating=
 the location of planets,
vis-a-vis, zodiac constellations and the other st=
ars (nakshatras). =C2=A0Needless to add=C2=A0that similar position of=C2=A0=
planets and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of=C2=A0years.=C2=A0

B=
y entering the precise details of the planetary configuration of the import=
ant=C2=A0events in the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in =
the software named=C2=A0"Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these ev=
ents according to the English=C2=A0calendar can be known.

Mr Pushkar Bhatn=
agar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired this software=C2=A0from the=
 US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and distance and locati=
on=C2=A0of other planets from earth. He entered the relevant details about =
the planetary
positions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and obtained very int=
eresting and=C2=A0convincing results, which almost determine the important =
dates starting from the birth=C2=A0of Shri Ram to the date of his coming ba=
ck to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.

Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in B=
al Kaand sarga 19 and shloka eight and nine=C2=A0(1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram w=
as born on ninth tithi of Chaitra month when the=C2=A0position of different=
 planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and nakshatras
(visible stars) wer=
e: =C2=A0
a) Sun in Aries; =C2=A0b) Saturn in Libra; =C2=A0c) Jupiter in Ca=
ncer; =C2=A0
d) Venus in Pisces; =C2=A0e) Mars in Capricorn; f) Lunar month=
 of Chaitra; =C2=A0g) Ninth day after no moon; =C2=A0h) Lagna as Cancer (ca=
ncer was rising in the=C2=A0east); =C2=A0i) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini c=
onstellation & Pllux star);=C2=A0j) Day time (around noon).
=C2=A0
This dat=
a was fed into the software. The=C2=A0results indicated that this was exact=
ly the location of planets/stars in=C2=A0the noon of January 10, 5114 BC. T=
hus Shri Ram was born on January 10,=C2=A05114 BC (7123 years back).=C2=A0
=

As per the Indian calendar it was the ninth day=C2=A0of Shukla Paksha in C=
haitra month and the time was around 12 to 1 noon time.=C2=A0This is exactl=
y the time and date when Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.

Shri Ram =
was born in Ayodhya.=C2=A0

This fact can be ascertained from several=C2=A0=
books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the=C2=A0birth=
 of Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasas' Raghuvansam,
Baudh =
and Jain literature, etc.=C2=A0

These books have narrated in great detail=
=C2=A0the location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many=
=C2=A0palaces and temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located o=
n=C2=A0the banks of the Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one=
=C2=A0side and Mithila on the other side.=C2=A0

Normally 7,000 years is a =
very long period=C2=A0during which earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign =
invasions change the
course of rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alte=
r the territories. 

Therefore, the task of unearthing the facts is monumen=
tal. The present=C2=A0Ayodhya has shrunk in size and the rivers have change=
d their course=C2=A0about 40 km north/south. Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya i=
n his=C2=A0childhood (13th year as per Valmiki Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwami=
tra=C2=A0who lived in Tapovan (Sidhhashram).=C2=A0

>From there he went to M=
ithila, King=C2=A0Janakas' kingdom. Here he married Sita after breaking Shi=
v Dhanusha (bow).

Researchers have gone along the route adopted by Shri Ra=
m as narrated=C2=A0in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places which have me=
morials that=C2=A0commemorate the events related to the life of Shri Ram. T=
hese include=C2=A0Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, Gautamas=
hram,=C2=A0Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc.=C2=A0

Memorials are bu=
ilt for great=C2=A0men and not for fictitious characters.

Date of exile of=
 Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayans'=C2=A0Ayodhya Kand (2/4/18) =
that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the=C2=A0king because Sun, Mars and =
Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and=C2=A0normally under such planetary co=
nfiguration the king dies or becomes=C2=A0a victim of conspiracies.=C2=A0

=
Dashratha's zodiac sign was Pisces and his=C2=A0nakshatra was Rewati. This =
planetary configuration was prevailing on=C2=A0the January 5, 5089 BC, and =
it was on this day that Shri Ram left
Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, =
he was 25 years old at that=C2=A0time (5114-5089). There are several shloka=
s in Valmiki Ramayan=C2=A0which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old whe=
n he left=C2=A0Ayodhya for exile.=C2=A0

Valmiki Ramayan refers to the sola=
r eclipse at=C2=A0the time of war with Khardushan in later half of 13th yea=
r of Shri=C2=A0Rams' exile.. It is also mentioned it was amavasya day and M=
ars was
=C2=A0in the middle ... When this data was entered, the software in=
dicated=C2=A0that there was a solar eclipse on October 7, 5077 BC,
(amavasy=
a day) which could be seen from Panchvati.=C2=A0

The planetary=C2=A0config=
uration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one=C2=A0side were V=
enus and Mercury and on the other side were=C2=A0Sun and Saturn.=C2=A0

On =
the basis of planetary configurations described=C2=A0in various other chapt=
ers, the date on which Ravana was killed works=C2=A0out to be December 4, 5=
076 BC, and Shri Ram completed 14 years of=C2=A0exile on January 2, 5075 BC=
, and that day was also Navami of Shukla=C2=A0Paksha in Chaitra month.=C2=
=A0

Thus Shri Ram had come back to Ayodhya=C2=A0at the age of 39 (5114-507=
5).=C2=A0

A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched=C2=A0on places visited by =
Shri Ram during his exile, and sequentially moved=C2=A0to the places stated=
 as visited by Shri Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan;=C2=A0starting from Ayodhya =
he went right upto Rameshwaram. He found 195=C2=A0places which still have t=
he memorials connected to the events narrated in=C2=A0the Ramayana relating=
 to the life of Shri Ram and Sita. These include=C2=A0Tamsa Tal (Mandah), S=
hringverpur (Singraur), Bhardwaj Ashram=C2=A0(situated near Allahabad), Atr=
i Ashram, Markandaya Ashram (Markundi),
Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of G=
odavari), Panchvati, Sita Sarovar,=C2=A0Ram Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nas=
ik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha=C2=A0(village Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Ra=
meshwar temple.

In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army co=
nstructed a=C2=A0bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After c=
rossing=C2=A0this bridge, Shri Rams' army had defeated Ravana.=C2=A0

Recen=
tly, NASA=C2=A0put pictures on the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins=
 of which=C2=A0are lying submerged in Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and S=
ri Lanka.

Recently the Sri Lankan Government had expressed the desire to=
=C2=A0develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri Lankans believe this was=
=C2=A0Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).

=
Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh=C2=A0a=
nd he was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant=C2=
=A0particulars of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written=
=C2=A0about 80 years ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram.=C2=A0

Professor Subhash =
Kak=C2=A0of Lousiana University, in his book, The Astronomical Code of the =
Rig=C2=A0Veda, has also listed 63 ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayod=
hya.

Sri Rams' ancestors have been traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha=
,=C2=A0King Aja, King Raghu, King Dilip and so on. From Kashmir to=C2=A0Kan=
yakumari and from Bengal to Gujarat, everywhere people believe=C2=A0in the =
reality of Shri Rams' existence, particularly in the tribal=C2=A0areas of H=
imaachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the North-East.

Most of the festiv=
als celebrated in these areas revolve around the=C2=A0events in the life of=
 Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.=C2=A0The events and places related to the life =
of Shri Ram and Sita are true
cultural and social heritage of every Indian =
irrespective of caste and=C2=A0creed. Therefore, it is common heritage.=C2=
=A0

After all, Shri Ram belonged=C2=A0to the period when Prophet Mohammed =
or Jesus Christ were not born=C2=A0and Muslim or Christian faiths were unkn=
own to the world.

The words Hindu (resident of Hindustan) and Indian (resi=
dent of India)=C2=A0were synonymous. India was also known as Bharat (land o=
f knowledge)=C2=A0and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and Hindustan=C2=A0(lan=
d of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).

During Ram Rajya (rule), the evi=
ls of caste system based on birth were=C2=A0non-existent.=C2=A0

In fact, M=
aharishi Valmiki is stated to be of shudra class
(scheduled caste), still S=
ita lived with him as his adopted daughter after=C2=A0she was banished from=
 Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as=C2=A0his disciples..=C2=A0

We=
 need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was perhaps
the first great astr=
onomer and that his study of planetary configurations=C2=A0has stood the te=
st of times.=C2=A0

Even the latest computer softwares have=C2=A0corroborat=
ed his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did not
commit any e=
rror. Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe..

Shri Ram's ar=
my, which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by=C2=A0various tribals=
 from Central and South India.=C2=A0

The facts, events and=C2=A0all other =
details relating to the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage=C2=A0of al=
l the Indians including scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims,=C2=A0C=
hristians, etc.

Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ wa=
s born 2,000 years back. Gautam Buddha was born=C2=A02,600 years back, wher=
eas Ram was born 7,000 years ago.=C2=A0

Hence,=C2=A0discovering the detail=
s relating to Shri Rams' life would be lot more=C2=A0difficult as destructi=
on caused by floods, earthquakes and invasions etc.,=C2=A0would be far grea=
ter. But, should that stop our quest for learning more=C2=A0about our cultu=
ral heritage?

As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the India=
n civilization=C2=A0is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly=
 more than=C2=A010,000 years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Ary=
an invasion=C2=A0in India in 1,500 BC as motivated implantation.=C2=A0

In =
fact Max Mueller,=C2=A0who was the creator of this theory, had himself reje=
cted it.=C2=A0

Let us=C2=A0admit that during the British Rule, we were edu=
cated in the schools=C2=A0based on Macaulay school of thinking which believ=
ed that=C2=A0everything Indian was inferior and that entire "Indian literat=
ure was=C2=A0not worth even one book rack in England."=C2=A0

If there were=
 similarities=C2=A0in certain features of Indian people and people from Cen=
tral Europe,=C2=A0then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming=
 from=C2=A0Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking =
in=C2=A0any other way.

Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and =
all other intellectuals=C2=A0to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There=
 is need to gather, dig out,=C2=A0search, unearth and analyze all the evide=
nces, which would throw more=C2=A0light on the ancient Indian civilization =
and culture.
