 THERE was a king who used daily to hear the Bhagavata recited by a pandit.=

Every day, after explaining the sacred book, the pandit would say to the
k=
ing, "O King, have you understood what I have said?"And every day the king
=
would reply,"You had better understand it first yourself." The pandit would=

return home and think; "Why does the king talk to me that way day after da=
y?
I explain the texts to him so clearly, and he says to me, =93you had bet=
ter
understand it first yourself=94. What does he mean?" The pandit used to=

practise spiritual discipline.

A few days later he came to realise that G=
od alone is real and everything
else - house,family, wealth, friends, name,=
 and fame - illusory.Convinced of
the unreality of the world, he renounced =
it.

As he left home he asked a man to take this message to the king: "O ki=
ng, I
now understand."
