  HARI OM

 The Sanskrit word Karma has been derived from the root word=
 "kru" which means "to do". The plain meaning of the word Karma is action o=
r deed. Karma  is  also   being used by some to indicate Destiny.   Karmaph=
ala means effect. . Karma comprises the entire cycle of cause and effect. W=
e can say that Karma is a sum total of what a jiva has done, is currently d=
oing and will do and their resultant reactions. Present and future experien=
ces are the effect of all past deeds.  This makes one
> responsible for one=
`s one life.  Karma extends through  not only one`s  present life but also =
through past and future lifes, according to the religions which talk of
> r=
ebirth.  All religions which were
> either native in Bharath  viz., Hinduis=
m or were  conceived  in India,viz.,  Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism contain=
  law of Karma.

>The concept of Karma is an integral part of Hinduism. A=
ction and reaction govern  all life.  Karma  is not fate, as man acts with =
 free will  creating his own destiny.  Bhagawan Satya Sai Baba says, "If yo=
u sow Goodness, you will reap Goodness; if we sow evil, we will reap evil".=

>Conquest of Karma lies in intelligent  and detached action and  dispassio=

be a Spiritually oriented law that can not be abrogated by any person but c=
an be mitigated by God, the Karmaphaladhata. Karma is not

 retribution.  To my humble
