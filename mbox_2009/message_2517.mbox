 20th January, 1946

When the personal attendants of Bhagavan were advised =
by doctors to give him
food containing vitamins to relieve the pain in the =
legs they began doing so
and were also massaging his legs with some special=
 ointment. They were thus
serving him to the best of their ability. Bhagava=
n used to say humorously,
=93A guest comes to your house. If you are indiff=
erent towards him he will go
away early, but if you show great respect towa=
rds him, and are very
attentive he will never go. So is disease. If you att=
end to the disease in
the manner you are doing now, why should it go? If yo=
u take no notice of it,
it will disappear of its own accord.=94

Sometime a=
go, a young man set up an establishment about a mile from the
Ashram, on th=
e road round the hill,saying he would cure diseases by giving
vibhuti. Peop=
le get
mad over such things, don=92t they? People who were diseased,possess=
ed and the
like started going in crowds to see that Vibhuti Swami, and on t=
heir way,
they used to come to our Ashram also. What is there at this Ashra=
m? No
vibhuti! No magic lockets! They used to have darshan and then go away=
.On
such occasions, if any attendants happened to be massaging his legs wit=
h
medicated oil, Bhagavan used to say in a lighter vein, =93Excellent, this=
 is
also good in a way. When these people see me thus, they would say, =91t=
his
Swami himself is suffering from pains in the legs and is getting massag=
ed by
others. What can he do for us?=92 and go away without coming anywhere=
 near me.
So far so good.=94

Two or three years back when Bhagavan had jau=
ndice,he could not relish his
food and felt a great dislike for food.For ab=
out a week or ten days he ate
only popcorns and the like. As Echamma and Mu=
daliar Patti have a vow that
they will not eat until Bhagavan takes at leas=
t a morsel of food cooked by
them he used to take a few grains from the ric=
e brought by these ladies and
mixing them with popcorn,used somehow swallow=
 that food so that their vratam
or deeksha might remain unimpaired.

Months=
 passed by; the jaundice persisted. A reputed doctor from Madras was
called=
. The result was the same. After all had come and gone, and after all
medic=
ines had been tried without success,he cured himself of jaundice in no
time=
 with sonti (dry ginger),pippalu (ipecac) and other Ayurvedic herbal
medici=
nes. Let any one venture to ask him how the disease was cured!
