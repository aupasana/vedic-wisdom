Namaste

Goo=
d information,

May I add one more place, that is located in Rajkot Gujarat=
,
Ranchod Vadi, the Ranchoddasji Maharaj's ashram.

They are also doing 24 =
by 7 uninterrupted ram dhun for many many years. I do not remember the exac=
t years but I may not be surprised if it is also 25 plus years.

When visit=
 India, I visit this place and do raamdhun for few minutes.
People in stayi=
ng in rajkot are lucy, they can swing by the place all the time at their co=
nvinience.

Best Regards
Mitesh
