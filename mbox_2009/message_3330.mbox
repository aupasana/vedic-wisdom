A pregnant woman can perform homam. If sitting cross-legged is =
a problem, one can sit on a raised platform (e.g. a small stool). Homa kund=
am can also be on a raised platform and ensure that homa kundam is on a pla=
tform that is a couple of inches higher than your seat, or atleast the same=
 height but not lower.
=C2=A0
What homam are you doing?
=C2=A0
My guru call=
ed me when I was thinking about replying to you. His intuition is that some=
 homam for Lord Vishnu is beneficial to you and your child (e.g.. homam wit=
h Vishnu Sahasranaam or a homam with Vishnu's 8 or 12 lettered mantra). I t=
hought I'd mention it.

Narasimha
