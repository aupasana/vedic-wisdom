Dear Sri PVR:

thank you for doing this service to all of mankind.

I have =
a few questions and some suggestions on the procedure.

1. I am curious as =
to how you dispose of the homam ashes everyday?

2. On the usage of puffed =
rice, dhanyams etc, Are these to be used
   dipped in ghee? 
   I have read=
 somewhere for e.g. that sesame seeds are dipped in ghee
   for the offerin=
g.

3. Like another gentleman asked, What is the brihat or extended
   proc=
edure? I see that the Jayadi homam step and
   punyahavachanam, Varuna pooj=
a at the beginning etc are missing.
   For completeness, would you elaborat=
e on the missing steps?

4. A suggestion. 
   Please post references to the=
 source of each step/mantra.
   I feel that this would greatly solidify the=
 document and make it
   formal. I completely understand that this is meant=
 as a spiritual
   guide, and yet one doesn't preclude the other.
   
   Fo=
r example: What is the source of using the chamakam verses in
   the Vasord=
hara step?
   My suggestion is to post it exactly as one would in a scienti=
fic
   paper, with a reference number, and the last page listing
   the ref=
erence sources.
   Similarly on the verses used in Uttarangam etc.
