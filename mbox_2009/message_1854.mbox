Namaste,

Yes, one can imagine homa karma mentally on a day=
 when the actual homam is not performed. If one can imagine an action in th=
e mind with the same level of intense self-identification with the action a=
s when it is done externally, it gives the same effect then. But that is di=
fficult for most people. Self-identification is far less intense when an ac=
tion is imagined in the mind. So external practices help first.

Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha

sp; <BR>> Those who have seen the movie "Lage Raho Munnabhai" <BR>> m=
ay recall how Sanjay Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and hea=
rs <BR>> Gandhi while others cannot. It is concluded at the end that the=
 visions of <BR>> Gandhi were hallucinations caused by the attachment of=
 the stressed out mind to <BR>> Gandhi and resulting chemical imbalance =
in the brain.<BR>>  <BR>> Loosely speaking, one may say that see=
ing gods is <BR>> similar. But the difference is that it is far more bli=
ssful. For another <BR>> big difference, see the example:<BR>>  =

><BR>>  <BR>> God can be experienced as light, as sound or as a =
<BR>> specific form similar to a human form, etc. In the above example, =
one goddess <BR>> was experienced as sound. It can certainly be a halluc=
ination, but the <BR>> interesting thing is that another person had the =
same experience and he knew <BR>> that this first person had that experi=
ence!<BR>>  <BR>> *        <BR>> *  =
      *<BR>>  <BR>> I will give another similar e=
xample. One person who <BR>> does Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama=
 in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri <BR>> Rama Navami morning and did a=
 homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some <BR>> preparations for t=
he next day's homam (like he would do every night) and laid <BR>> out so=
me dried
 coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day's burnt <BR=
>> ashes, for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. =
In the <BR>> middle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his bod=
y lying on the bed. <BR>> He then became aware of the homa kundam which =
was a few feet away on another <BR>> floor. It felt like his body and ho=
ma kundam were linked. Then it felt like <BR>> suddenly there was fire i=
n homa kundam and, at the same time, his energy rose. <BR>> As soon as t=
hat happened, he lost regular awareness of his body. He no <BR>> longer =
felt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He first felt like he <=
BR>> lied with head down and legs up and then he became absolutely weigh=
tless. Then <BR>> he felt like he was a small point, a small particle. I=
t felt like Lord Hanuman <BR>> pulled him up and he went very fast into =
a region filled with bright light. He <BR>> was a weightless particle
 f=
loating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and <BR>> nobody else. He,=
 the small particle, started praying to Lord Hanuman and <BR>> remained =
in a blissful state for a while.<BR>>  <BR>> Suddenly, from some=
where, a thought came about his <BR>> body being in a bedroom and fire i=
n homa kundam. He wondered, "was there fire in <BR>> homa kundam really?=
" This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness <BR>> (i.e.. b=
eing aware of self as a body) returned.<BR>>  <BR>> The interest=
ing thing is this. When he went to his <BR>> homa kundam to do homam nex=
t morning, he saw that the dried coconut pieces <BR>> placed there on th=
e ashes previous night were burnt and completely black. <BR>> It means t=
here was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same <BR>> proced=
ure everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day's <BR>=
> homam before sleeping, but such a thing never happened.
 Basically, th=
ere must <BR>> have been some ember left still from the previous morning=
, though he did not see <BR>> any ember in the night and thought the fir=
e went out completely. For some <BR>> reason, that unseen ember started =
up a small fire in the night and the coconut <BR>> pieces caught fire. T=
hough there is no way to know when that happened, it is <BR>> consistent=
 with what he felt during the mystical experience! After daily homam <BR>&g=
t; for a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam. =
<BR>> Moreover, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to =
his internal <BR>> fire and developments related to it still affected hi=
s internal fire and <BR>> consciousness!<BR>>  <BR>> When you=
 do homam for a long time with the mental <BR>> visualization linking th=
at external fire to your internal fire, the relationship <BR>> is formed=
 over the time! What happens in that external fire
 does then <BR>> affe=
ct your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left buried under=
 <BR>> the ash, that ember is still linked to your internal fire!! When =
something <BR>> happens in your internal fire, the same thing happens to=
 the ember too. And vice <BR>> versa.<BR>>  <BR>> *  &nb=

>> Dear Utpal, one can see God for sure. One can <BR>> experience God=
 in many forms. One can see god externally, in a limited form like <BR>>=
 a human form. One can see god internally, when shakti (energy of self-awar=
eness) <BR>> rises to a specific place and becomes aware of beings in th=
at place. One can <BR>> experience god as an all-pervading light or soun=
d and experience oneself as a <BR>> small part of that light or sound. T=
here are many ways to perceive god, but the <BR>> bottomline is that god=
 does exist and one can perceive god. I
 <BR>> cannot show you god, but =
I can guarantee you that god exists and can be <BR>> perceived in variou=
s forms.<BR>>  <BR>> Do homam everyday with sincerity. That will=
 burn <BR>> the blocking karmas. Eventually you will be able to love god=
 more than anything, <BR>> including yourself. That is when the final sc=
reen will start to disappear. <BR>> Nothing can be a substitute for spir=
itual sadhana.<BR>>  <BR>> Best <BR>> regards,<BR>> Narasi=
