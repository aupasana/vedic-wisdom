Dear Narasimhaji

I know this is not a forum to discuss astrology but if yo=
u would be so 
kind as to answer just one question regarding astrology and =
homa.

I was reading somewhere that the fire of a homa is represented by 
J=
upiter among planets. So in case someone has a very badly placed 
jupiter w=
hich badhakesh or much afflicted, is it adviseable for such a 
person to pe=
rform homa? Or will it lead to great dangers?

-Regards
 Aparajita
