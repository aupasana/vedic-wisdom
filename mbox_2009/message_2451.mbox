Friends,
What is a Mantra?  Which is the most powerful Mantra? How are Mantras to be learnt  and chanted?  I want to share my understanding in this regard. 

 
 
A Mantra can be said to be a word-symbol or symbols representing and expressing, as nearly as possible, the particular view of God and the universe they stand for.  When the Mantras  that are of the nature of symbols, syllables etc. etc.   is given to the disciple or sadhaka by an illumined  Guru, it becomes a living seed. The Guru, by his spiritual power, gives life to the word and at the same time awakens the spiritual power latent in the disciple. That is the secret of Guru`s initiation.  A Mantra is an aid to meditation.
 
There are three types of Mantras: -
The first category include those that invoke the low powers of nature and are called as Tamasik  Mantras. The second category of Mantras excite and manifest might and power and are called Rajasik Mantras. Lastly, those that are of quiet and purely spiritual types are called Satwik.
 
All the Mantras  again fall under two classifications:-
(a) those that need only to be chanted and there is no need for one to know their meaning and 
(b) those Mantras  that are of the nature  of an invocation and the devotee must  necessarily know the meaning of those Mantras.  In the abscence of knowledge of meaning of the Mantras he will not be able to bring his mind  to play upon the Divine theme constantly.
 
The Vedic Mantras are both in prose and poetry.  Metrical Mantras are called "Rik" and "Yajus" is  the name of the prose .
(to be continued)
