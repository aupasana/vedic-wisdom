Dear Narasimha,

1.=A0 =A0 =A0Fortunately or unfor=
tunately you have repeatedly broken the decorum yourselves.=A0
2.=A0 =A0 =
=A0While it has been told explicitly in a mail addressed to you, that the d=
ebate is over as far as you are concerned, you continue to send me mails on=
 the same topic, without any reason whatsoever.

3.=A0 =A0 =A0By virtue of =
my spending precious time on writing these mails, I have a right to exercis=
e on whom I entertain for further discussion.
4.=A0 =A0 If you are left wit=
h even a little respect for the individuality of another person, please ens=
ure that you don't send unsolicited intercepting mails particularly when yo=
ur name has not been mentioned inside the mail.
5.=A0 =A0 If you are intere=
sted in propagating your ideas, take up a new thread, on a part of the mail=
 and invite responses or criticism or what ever you want to.
6.=A0 =A0 =A0Y=
ou have no right to tell others that they have a limited understanding - as=
 you just did in your mail on Ahamkara =3D Asmita - till you are an omnisci=
ent being yourselves.

7.=A0 =A0 If you tried this sort of a thing again, I=
 will ensure that I don't reply to any of your mails ever again.

8.=A0 =A0=
 If you don't give space to members, then, as a moderator, you won't ever b=
e able to achieve the "state of discipline and decorum" and "participation =
of group members" at the same time.
9.=A0 =A0The only persons whom I consid=
er as "still active in Gyan Marg debate" include:
a. Sundeep
b. UtpalJi

c.=
 probably those who have not yet replied.
10.=A0 =A0=A0 As far as a ban or =
moderation is concerned, there is no dearth of people, nor is it an issue t=
o run a yahoo group of ones' own. We all know the fate of heavily moderated=
 groups, like "sohamsa".Regards,
Nitish
