=C2=A0=C2=A0 I agree with Hari. Starting off with Ganapathi 
Homam is defin=
itely better. The procedure is short and it helps one 
practice the fire ma=
nagement, the mantras, the swaras and the whole 
nine yards. Moreover, the =
Chandi Homam Manual by itself is not self-
sufficient. It relies on Ganapat=
hi Homam manual. So, you have to go 
back and forth between the 2 manuals t=
o perform Chandi Homam which 
can be done but gets little bit tricky in the=
 beginning. So, get 
comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure.
> =C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 After you feel comfortable with the=
 Ganapathi Homam 
procedure, while continuing to do Ganapathi Homam daily, =
you can 
actually do Chandi Homam occasionally on certain days say weekends=
, 
or on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdasi which are especially auspicious 
fo=
r Chandipath/Chandi Homam. When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip 
your Gana=
pathi Homam for that day. After doing this for few months 
or when you feel=
 you are comfortable with the Chandi Homam, finally 
settle down with it.

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 It's getting close to an year s=
ince I did my first 
Chandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding me w=
ith fire 
management and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my 
p=
ronunciation and all. I used to do it over weekends, which for me 
was taki=
ng about 3- 3 1/2hrs initially, owing to my poor Telugu 
reading skills. Th=
en, slowly switched to daily after the whole 
process started taking about =
2 hrs. While still, I am not perfect, I 
continue to practice. On this note=
, I am reminded of Narayan.
> =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Th=
e idea of writing a Maha Ganapathi Homam manual 
started off as Narayan ask=
ed Narasimha to help him out with the 
Homam Procedure. (Narayan's own insp=
iring message in this regard can 
be read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=
p/vedic- wisdom/message/ 
727). After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji =
emailed the first 
copy to Narayan. Such was Narayan's dedication that he s=
tarted going 
through the manual over and over. A few days later I met Nara=
yan and 
enquired about the Homam manual and all. He very casually mentione=
d 
that he was doing the Homam mentally. I was dumbstruck. I 
said "What?".=
 He said he would perform the whole procedure as 
mentioned in the document=
, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, 
imagining Agni pratishtapana, imagini=
ng invoking Ganesha, imagining 
offering ahutis, everything, start to finis=
h in mind. I was really 
bowled over by his creative thinking. That is how =
Narayan practiced. 
Later, Narasimhaji gifted us Homa Kundam and
>  we star=
ted our Homas. After few months passed by and I had to go 
on couple of tri=
ps where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and all 
the samagri. I implement=
ed Narayan's idea and did my homam mentally 
for those few days. It then he=
lped me avoid that feeling that I 
missed my homam. Though this process is =
not a replacement for the 
Homam with all the physical materials, yet, it i=
s a form of a prayer 
to God. Something is better than nothing.
