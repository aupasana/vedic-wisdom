If someone says "so and so person is a terrible person", one may feel offen=

Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, d=
oesn't account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is =
independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - oth=

tially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not=
 related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the ap=
plication of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi be=
ing two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not =
"controlled" nor "derived" in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very c=

 Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't work upon that particular idea.
