Narasimha Garu,

Thank you for the elaborate message. i am contemplating on=
 the message and not yet very clear about some ideas.

A couple of clarific=
ations required whenever you have time and urge.

1) Kundalini reaching Sah=
asraar for the first time and every time is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi?

2) =
you wrote: >if one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi long enough, all >the condit=
ioning in chitta is erased. Then one becomes free. If one >stayed in nirvik=
alpa samadhi for a little time, it makes chitta >lighter but not empty.

Ni=
rvikapla means The one without Alternative. now if we literally go by name,=
 then what does it mean by *staying Shorter or longer time* in Nirvikalpa S=
amadhi. Nirvikalpa should mean nirvikalpa - reaching that one does not come=
 back. Thakur have also repeatedly said that a normal soul when goes in to =
Nirvikalpa samadhi, merges in to brahman and does not return back (Salt dol=
l example) and the body drops off in 21 days. only special souls who have t=
o fulfill some important mission can only come back to the world of duality=
.

Warm regards,

Utpal

 that stage, the other properties of the previously individualized consciou=

tanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The f=
ive chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent=
 ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, ear=
th element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are =

 water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to =
the five elements.

Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of "I" as someone who has cer=
tain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts o=
ne has about who one is, form one's self-awareness and Kundalini represents=
 that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anyth=
ing* that is *solid* in nature within one's cumulative idea of who one is i=
s still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anyth=
ing* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one's cumulative idea of w=
ho one is is still remaining. And so on.

a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as K=
undalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one's cumulative =
idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existenc=
e! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one's notion of self =
("I"), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.

between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..

 with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how=
 exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited understan=
d fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since the=
 M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.

other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics=
. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? The=
se two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. I=
t need not be exactly as reality is.

 And so also for everything else that is below the reach of the senses (e.g=
. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do read about them (all these things e=
.g Atma etc), and about the significance of the vedic gods anyway, dont we?=
 They do offer a mild complement to sadhana, dont they? They do help make t=
he mind more receptive toward the benefits of sadhana..

and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead =
