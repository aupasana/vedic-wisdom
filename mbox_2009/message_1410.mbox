Namaste Sundeep,

f his

> remedie=
s *for the average man* given by Jyotishis.
 
What I am objecting to is dif=
ferent from "tried and tested remedies for the average man".
 
Yes, astrolo=
gers and religious people in India have given various remedies for a long t=
ime now and many "average" people followed them with faith, devotion and di=
scipline and got the material results they desired.
 
However, teachings su=
ch as the ones I questioned (*fasting* on some days bringing "insult to Vis=
hnu", causing "serious doshas" or bringing "danger to spouse") are hardly a=
 part of "tried and tested" principles. These and several other remedy prin=
ciples being advanced in recent years are merely principles taught in ONE p=
arampara. Moreover, this is a parampara represented by a single individual =
today. There is no opportunity for cross-checking the presumed teachings of=
 this parampara with another representative to whom knowledge was passed in=
dependently. Thus, they are not a part of what one would call "tried and te=
sted remedies" of Indian astrologers for centuries.
 
*        *        *
 =

Simple and pure-hearted astrologers and religious people across India have=
 given simple remedies to "average men" successfully for ages. You have deb=
t problems? Ok, then do Rina Vimochaka Angaraka stotra n times a day for m =
days. You want children? Ok, then do Santana Gopala mantra n times a day fo=
r m days. Also, who is your 5th lord? Mars? Ok, then do Subrahmanyashtakam =
n times everyday for m days. You want to get married? Who is your 7th lord?=
 Mercury? Ok, then do Vishnu sahasra naam everyday for n days.
 
Simple stu=
ff like that. And it worked for ages for many faithful "average men"!
 
The=
y used very few horoscopic factors and different groups of Jyotishis used d=
ifferent sets of common remedies successfully. This shows that there ARE ma=
ny paths, not just for spiritual progress but also for material progress th=
rough prayer. In the same chart, various deities and various mantras can gi=
ve the desired material result. Most of them did not follow the strict "dos=
 and don'ts" suggested in this specific parampara that I am questioning.
 
=
*        *        *
 
If a village astrologer gave a person a mantra to get=
 married, the person did it faithfully and devotedly and got married, how e=
xactly did it work?
 
If the mantra works to the fullest, the person experi=
ences the mantra or mantra devata. This experience changes depending on the=
 mantra and mantra devata, but this is an absolutely tremendous experience =
when and if it happens. However, this does not happen to most people, as th=
ey are not ready. If such a complete experience of a mantra were the goal, =
various dictums of mantra shastra, a precise science, would be relevant.
 
=
Instead, if the person simply uses the mantra as a tool for begging the com=
passionate Lord to give the little thing he asked for (a child or marriage =
or a job etc), the Lord may give it when the karmik push behind the prayer =
exceeds the karmic obstacles. It is not the precision of mantra shastra tha=
t works, but the devotion, faith, surrender and desire of the astrologer an=
d the person doing the mantra, creating the karmik push behind the mantra. =
The force of devotion, faith, surrender and desire in BOTH the persons are =
important contributing factors.
 
I suggest that it is the latter that happ=
ens in most of the "tried and tested remedies" given by astrologers and rel=
igious people for ages. The guidelines they used are very few and the desir=
e to help, devotion and faith are primary, while the actual mantra is secon=
dary. That is why it does not matter that they are inconsistent and non-uni=
form in the mantras given.
 
I loosely used the terms commanding vs begging=
 for the above two approaches and said that most people are beggars.
 
Peop=
le are mixing up knowledge meant for the former approach with the latter ap=
proach and also adding a lot of further complicated new astrology rules to =
the subject rather than sticking to "tried and tested remedies for average =
man" used by many for ages. I am not the one mixing up, but they. I am actu=
ally suggesting to take a step back and appreciate how astrologers have suc=
cessfully given "tried and tested remedies for average man" for ages and no=
t complicate things now unnecessarily. The complications being introduced n=
ow distract us from the main problem rather than solving it. What is our ma=
in problem in astrological remedies today?
 
Astrologers are increasingly b=
ecoming more egoistic, less spiritually developed and less pure-hearted now=
, compared to the simple, pure-hearted and saintly astrologers of old days.=
 Faith and devotion in general populace are also going down. So the effecti=
veness of remedies is going down compared to centuries or even decades back=
 and people are slowly losing faith even more. For this reason, what we nee=
d to emphasize is *faith and devotion*, and *not* complicated new technical=
ities WITHOUT WHICH many astrologers have been giving "tried and tested rem=
edies for average man" for ages!
 
*        *        *
 
I think my main po=
int finally came out the way I wanted. I think I have fulfilled my dharma w=
ith this topic and can now move on. Adios.
 
BTW, regarding religious psych=
ology part at the end: This was just ONE analogy. My writings on spirituali=
ty on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup are filled with tens of analogies. I use anal=
ogies heavily. You can do a better psycho-analysis if you study all of them=
, rather than a one-off analogy!

Narasimha

what I say. Is it simply the term idol worship? An idol is a *material* rep=

in temples.. the majority dont have a clue of Advaita Vedanta, if that's wh=

from my point of view. Exactly as you say, *most* human beings need materia=
l symbols to focus their faith, and many Hindus choose idols, and Christian=
s use christ-on-a-cross, and Muslims have the koran, and Sikhs keep the gur=

completely orthogonal to yours (as I said I agree with all your points). Th=
at is this: I think that as one spiritually progresses, their need for symb=

sense of submission to, and their awareness of, their true Self increases. =
But that doesnt mean that all these facts that Sanjayji, Michal, Zoran etc =
present are wrong for *the average person*. My view is that Narasimhaji is =
mixing up the results of his own personal spiritual progress with the tried=
 and tested remedies *for the average man* given by Jyotishis. Put differen=
tly, an average ego-obsessed person does probably need to do all the right =
things on all the right dates and times to cultivate the beginnings of a se=
nse of submission. And as that sense grows, he can afford to relax the rule=
s. So Jyotishis should give remedies for the person at *his/her* level of s=
piritual progress, not *theirs*.

<DIV><FONT size=3D2>> In essence, I dont =
see where we disagree? You seem to be 
exactly echoing what I say. Is it si=
mply the term idol worship? An idol is a 
*material* representation of a de=
ity with some sense of sacredness attached to 
that material representation=
. Of course most Hindus do that (why else are idols 
kept in temples.. the =
majority dont have a clue of Advaita Vedanta, if that's 
where you're going=
 with this discussion). And there is nothing wrong with it 
from my point o=
f view. Exactly as you say, *most* human beings need material 
symbols to f=
ocus their faith, and many Hindus choose idols, and Christians use 
christ-=
on-a-cross, and Muslims have the koran, and Sikhs keep the 
guru-granth-sah=
ib on a pillow in the gurudwara etc etc. And they all have their 
sacred pl=
aces of worship (all of them are material 
representations..).Psychological=
ly speaking, they *all* unconsciously project 
the power of the Self/Atma, =
which they see as God (or a deity), into different 
material symbols. Nothi=
ng wrong with that, IMHO. Did you by chance mistake my 
presenting Abraham'=
s attitude as my own? </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>> </FONT></DIV>
=
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>> Getting back to my real point, which is completely=
 
orthogonal to yours (as I said I agree with all your points). That is thi=
s: I 
think that as one spiritually progresses, their need for symbols and =
doing 
specific rituals on certain dates etc decreases as their own sense o=
f submission 
to, and their awareness of, their true Self increases. But th=
at doesnt mean that 
all these facts that Sanjayji, Michal, Zoran etc prese=
nt are wrong for *the 
average person*. My view is that Narasimhaji is mixi=
ng up the results of his own 
personal spiritual progress with the tried an=
d tested remedies *for the average 
man* given by Jyotishis. Put differentl=
y, an average ego-obsessed person does 
probably need to do all the right t=
hings on all the right dates and times to 
cultivate the beginnings of a se=
nse of submission. And as that sense grows, he 
can afford to relax the rul=
es. So Jyotishis should give remedies for the person 
at *his/her* level of=
 spiritual progress, not *theirs*.</FONT></DIV>
