Respected Sir,

So far I have been performing homam with great success and =
have seen lots of positive changes in me. 
But yesterday during homam when =
I was meditating a glimpse of a ghost trailor which came in tv the other ni=
ght suddenly flashed my mind. It scared me. I immediately reverted my thoug=
hts to god. But my mind was very disturbed after that. Can you attract nega=
tive energy like this? Will it have any bad effect? Thanks sir for all the =
guidance you have been giving I have been following them with great sinceri=
ty.

Sudha
