Namaste,

Very good. With practices, mistakes will go away. Also, th=
e beneficial 
results will increase.

I believe Ganesha and Krishna are the=
 most suitable for you.

Regarding mantra, I suggest letting the Swami who =
gives you mantra diksha 
decide which mantra to give you and just follow hi=
s advice.

BTW, it is "Om Namo Naaraayanaaya" and not "Om Namo
Naaraayana".=


Best regards,
Narasimha
