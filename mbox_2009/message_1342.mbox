Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.

Thank you for so patiently and eloquently answe=
ring all of my 
questions. As per your suggestion I have moved the Puja roo=
m out of 
my basement.

If you have a free moment I do have a technical que=
stion for you:

Does the injunction not to cross the Meru bead when doing J=
apa apply 
to just one "session" ? Say a person does 3 malas of a certain m=
antra 
every day. After the first round the person must turn back and so on=
. 
I understand this. But does one have to remember on which side of the 
m=
ala he finished so he can start on that side of the mala on the next 
day? =


If yes, what is the best way of remembering? I myself attach a paper 
cli=
p on the side I finish with so I know to start on that side the 
very next =
day or for a different session on the same day. 

I hope I am being at leas=
t somewhat clear.

Thank you.
