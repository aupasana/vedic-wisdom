 Letter 1

21st November, 1945

The day before yesterday being full moon, t=
he usual Deepotsava (festival of
lights) was celebrated on a grand scale.

=
This morning Sri Arunachaleswarar started for giri pradakshina (going round=

the hill) with the usual routinue and devotees and accompaniment of music.=

By the time the procession reached the Ashram gate, Sri Niranjanananda Swa=
mi
(the Sarvadhikari) came out with Ashram devotees, offered coconuts and
c=
amphor to Sri Arunachaleswarar, and paid homage when the procession was
sto=
pped and the priests performed arati (waving of the lights) to the God.
Jus=
t then Sri Bhagavan happened to be going towards the Gosala (cowshed) and
s=
eeing the grandeur he sat down on the pial near the tap by the side of the
=
book depot. The arati plate offered to Arunachaleswarar was brought to
Bhag=
avan by Ashram devotees and Sri Bhagavan took a little Vibhuti (holy
ashes)=
 and applied it to his forehead, saying in an undertone =E2=80=9CAppakku
Pi=
llai Adakkam=E2=80=9D (The son is beholden to the father). His voice seemed=
 choked
with emotion as he spoke. The expression on his face proved the anc=
ient
saying =E2=80=9Cbhakti poornathaya Jnanam=E2=80=9D (the culmination of=
 devotion is
knowledge).

Sri Bhagavan is Lord Siva=E2=80=99s son.

Sri Gan=
apati Muni=E2=80=99s saying that he is Skanda incarnate, was confirmed. It
=
struck us that Bhagavan was teaching us that since all creatures are the
ch=
ildren of Ishwara, even a Jnani should be beholden to Ishwara.
