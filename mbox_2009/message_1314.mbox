Namaste,
 
The only specific name mentioned was Ujjain. Others were not men=
tioned specifically.
 
As I said, these things require resources. But if th=
e Mother really wants, it will happen. She told to teach simple homam proce=
dures and we were gifted several books on homam by that temple priest on th=
e very next day, without even asking. Just as She said, everything has been=
 nicely arranged so far. Regarding these centres of Chandi homam also, I am=
 confident that She will show the direction when time comes. Until then, I =
will keep doing my individual sadhana, teach various homam procedures and a=
nswer queries from interested sadhakas to the best of my ability. What need=
s to happen will happen when the time comes.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          No, we have not yet acted on tha=

          B=

          It requires resources tha=

                    Namaste friends,

           =
         Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets fro=
m an 
                    interview posted on her website. Please see below=
.

                    It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Par=
amahamsa as her guru. It 
                    is interesting that Ramakrish=
na told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
                    show wh=
at is truth" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
      =
              is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she=
 appeared to 
                    him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.=


                    She told him that many people are and will be born wh=
o will perform a short 
                    fire ritual on a regular basis,=
 establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
                    world and =
also make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. 
         =
           Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along s=
imilar 
                    lines.

                    My guru was also to=
ld by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
                  =
  should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 time=
s a 
                    day. These places do not need to be near any templ=
es or famous places and 
                    can be anywhere. The ritual ne=
ed not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
                    need to =
offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
         =
           offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyd=
ay. When a 
                    few such centres are established, it will a=
pparently lead to a chain of 
                    events that will help re-=
establish sanatana dharma.

                    Though not 3 times a day, t=
hese people have done a Chandi homam everyday for 
                    3 ye=
ars in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
   =
                 It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates ener=
gy and brings 
                    deities to a place. While several ancien=
t temples are without any divine 
                    presence these days, =
new places of divine presence may be created by pure 
                    s=
ouls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.

   =
                 As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi h=
omam during which 
                    Mother appeared and gave instruction=
s to my guru on spreading homam was 
                    taken on Ramakrish=
na' s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within 
              =
      a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth annive=
rsary. 
                    All of this was a coincidence and we were unawa=
re of this significance when 
                    we decided the muhurta. I=
t is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
                    mention =
fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are 
          =
          similar to the words of Mother.

                    Best regards=

><BR>Shree Maa was referred to here. 
                    Someone sent me a=
 few snippets from an <BR>interview posted 
                    on her webs=
ite. Please see below.<BR><BR>It is interesting 
                    that s=
he considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
                    <=
BR>is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do 
               =
     fire ceremonies and <BR>show what is truth" and "at that 
            =
        time the whole world will be peace". This <BR>is similar to 
      =
              what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
=
                    <BR>him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.<BR><BR>Sh=
e 
                    told him that many people are and will be born who w=
ill 
                    perform a short <BR>fire ritual on a regular basis=
, 
                    establish sanatana dharma and peace in the <BR>world=
 and 
                    also make quick spiritual progress individually i=
n that 
                    process. <BR>Shree Maa's statement about what R=
amakrishna 
                    told her is along similar <BR>lines.<BR><BR=
>My guru was also 
                    told by Mother that a few centres of=
 regular Chandi homam 
                    <BR>should be established around=
 the world, where Chandi 
                    homam is done 3 times a <BR>d=
ay. These places do not need to 
                    be near any temples or=
 famous places and <BR>can be 
                    anywhere. The ritual nee=
d not be elaborate. For example, 
                    there is no <BR>need =
to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A 
                    simple ritual with=
 bare minimum <BR>offerings is enough, but 
                    it needs to=
 be performed 3 times everyday. When a <BR>few 
                    such ce=
ntres are established, it will apparently lead to a 
                    ch=
ain of <BR>events that will help re-establish sanatana 
                   =
 dharma.<BR><BR>Though not 3 times a day, these people have 
              =
      done a Chandi homam everyday for <BR>3 years in the same 
           =
         place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
          =
          <BR>It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates 
      =
              energy and brings <BR>deities to a place. While several 
    =
                ancient temples are without any divine <BR>presence these 
=
                    days, new places of divine presence may be created by p=
ure 
                    <BR>souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establis=
hing 
                    dharma in the world.<BR><BR>As I mentioned earlie=
r, the 
                    sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which=
 <BR>Mother 
                    appeared and gave instructions to my guru =
on spreading homam 
                    was <BR>taken on Ramakrishna' s bir=

the birth anniversary. <BR>All 
                    of this was a coinciden=
ce and we were unaware of this 
                    significance when <BR>w=

Ramakrishna did <BR>mention fire
