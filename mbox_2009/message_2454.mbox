Dear Narasimha, pranaams

Today Pitrupaksha started and I did the supershort tarpanam procedure after
doing the sandhya vandanam. Something interesting happened today!

Before starting the tarpanam, I prayed that I may be given some positive
signal. Immediately after I completed the tarpanam procedure, my wife came
and asked me about the contents of some packet which was lying for a long
time inside the shelf. It contained some darbha grass and a small packet of
rice which was the akshatas from a previously performed 'thevasam' or
sraddha puja in memory of my father. I took it as a signal that my father
had come today and blessed us in thought. It also is noteworthy that my
father's day of death was the day after poornima ie., today.

best regards
Hari

Dear Narasimha, pranaams

Tomorrow Pitrupaksha starts. I have some questions regarding tarpana:

1. Is the recommended order of performing as sandhya vandanam --> homam -->
tarpanam?

2. Can I perform tarpanam on all the days in pitrupaksha? Or do the
restrictions outlined in your manual apply even during pitrupaksha?

best regards
Hari
