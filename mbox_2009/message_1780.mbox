Dear Shankar,

This is what I did:

1. In Wallmart, bought a taurpolin shee=
t (blue color - in walmart, if you look for tent equipment you may find it)=
 (will be around $15). You can also use any bedsheet instead. The purpuse i=
s keep the carpet away from getting any spilling!
2. 4 Bricks (from home de=
pot) (2 are actually sufficient - these are to keep the homa kundam on.
3. =
Windows Exhaust Fan (will be around $30)
In my apartment, the fire/smoke al=
arm was located in the center of the house. I used to closed the door of ch=
ild bedroom and do homam in it.

If you use ghee in low amount (dropping 1 =
or 2 drops at a time and useing ghee only to keep the fire up - otherwise u=
sing tila etc.), the smoke is negligible. Also, before starting the homam, =
remove any burnt out ashes from the homakundam as they will generate smoke.=


While doing the homam, the smoke is negligible. At the end, I used to kee=
p the homa kundam in the window (I used to wait will the fire goes off) so =
that the smoke is sent out quickly. Otherwise you can take it to kitchen.

=
If you can separate the homa kundam from the sensors with a door, you have =
nothing to be worried.

Best regards,
Vijay

In the Mahagapathi homam video at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/gana=
pathi.htm, you can see couple of concrete bricks underneath the hawan kund =
that were put on the floor. Wooden plank with aluminium foil helps in clean=
