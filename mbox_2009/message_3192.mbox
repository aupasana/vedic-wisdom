Dear Anup,
=A0
You can read the mails below. Ravi has mentioned a nice tec=
hnique of setting a 40 days period of regular practise. Normally for anyone=
 who is not well verses in Sanskrit, the first few Chandi Paths can be taxi=
ng, but that is only a matter of few days. Also, you can try reading it in =
your mother tongue as mentioned by Narayan in one mail below.
=A0
Hope you =
find the mails useful.
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi

Namaste Rajarshi,
=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When I started out my Chandi homas (elaborate procedure), i=
t used to take about 3 to 3 1/2 hrs and I could easily manage the fire with=
 coconut pieces (Each piece is a qurater of the whole coconut). Place 2 pie=
ces side by side and the third one touching the sides of these 2, giving it=
 a triangular shape if you look from top (white side facing up).
During hom=
am make sure you turn the pieces side-ways so that all the sides of a singl=
e piece catch fire. When white side is burnt enough, turn it over to bring =
the dark side up.
At the beginning of each chapter, add a new piece, pushin=
g the thoroughly burnt piece to the top side. So, at any time you should ha=
ve 2 pieces burning so that one supports the other in case of an emergency.=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 
=A0 =A0 =A0 It is very helpful if you can have the Chandipath=
 script in front of you while listening to the audio. Familiarize yourself =
with all the difficult words, underline the words that need extra care of p=
ronunciation. Then read aloud while listening to the audio and when you fee=
l comfortable, set a rule for yourself on 21 days or 40 days and start read=
ing daily. Very soon, the total time will drastically reduce and you can st=
art the homa. Try to bring down the total duration at an affordable level a=
nd at the same time to a comfortable level. 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 When you do ho=
ma, use your left thumb to track the verse you are on. It will help initial=
ly. Also, if you are constrained by time, you can just follow what Narasimh=
a does=A0 as mentioned in an earlier post to Utpal. In addition to what Nar=
asimha does, I read Ganapathi Atharvaseersham, Kavacha and Devi Suktam an a=
ddition of about 10 minutes.
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 All the best.

Ravi

Hi,
=A0
This is indeed very interesting.=A0I=
 have one more question for you Narayanji. Do you do homa with wood or coco=

Did you play =

Namaste Rajarshi ji & Friends,

Thats nice. All the best!

One more t=
hing, I don't know to read tamil/malayalam (mother tongue) script, and very=
 shaky with Devanagari script and hence it's a chore for me. I am sure most=
 members are well versed with their mother tongue and will be able to read =
it fluently and in a shorter time than mine.
