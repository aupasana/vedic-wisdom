Dear Narasimhaji,
 Thank you very much for your reply. I am still not satis=
fied with 
the answer though, especially since I am sure I can get a lot mo=
re 
out of you :-)

See, the explanation that "repetitive chanting calms/an=
chors the 
mind" is only a "placebo" of an answer. It does not do any justi=
ce 
to the obviously highly nuanced mantra shastra. If all repetitive 
chan=
ting were equal, mantra shastra would be 1/2 a page of text, not 
more. So =
this explanation does nothing more than appease the 
atheistic scientific m=
ind, one that is unwilling to consider (let 
alone accept) the non-material=
 part of the universe.

I am looking for a deeper answer that addresses the=
 above concerns. 
Please bear with me in reading the following paragraph in=
 its 
entirety before replying - I know I am not presenting new 
informatio=
n to you, but merely presenting things as I know them, so 
you may reply/co=
rrect my thinking as appropriate:  More 
specifically, when I read Vivekacu=
damani, I am led to believe that 
the manifested universe is all and only t=
he quintuplicated tattwas. 
The gross human being is no different (i.e. is =
also quintuplicated 
tattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deepe=
r non-material 
universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of t=
he 
material universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other 
th=
ings, the antahakarana, which has the 
reflecting/considering/theorizing mi=
nd that we are all so familiar 
with. It experiences the quintuplicated uni=
verse, yet is directly 
part of the unquintuplicated universe! At an even d=
eeper level, even 
this subtle body is a manifestation of the causal body -=
 mahat, 
which consists of the three gunas. The manifesting/enlivening agen=
t, 
so to speak, is the non-dual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated 
conscio=
usness.

Now, in the above scheme of things, how do mantra and diety figure=
? 
Spoken/chanted/heard mantra is nothing more than an "energic" 
activity =
of the most external part of the universe i.e. the 
quintuplicated tattwa u=
niverse. Clearly this energic activity by 
itself, *if* limited to the quin=
tuplicated universe, is useless. So, 
clearly, we must accept that if mantr=
a is to have ANY enlightening 
effect, mantra must resonate in the mind its=
elf, which is part of 
the antahakarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is N=
ON-material, 
what does resonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer t=
alking 
about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material menta=
l 
energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.

It is this non-mat=
erial mental energy that I wish to understand when 
I ask about mantras and=
 beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it 
tattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara,=
 manas, karma, what? Why do specific 
harmonics of it correspond to specifi=
c dieties? What exactly *is* a 
diety in terms of the above terminology? Wh=
at is the cause-effect 
relationship between harmonics of this energy and t=
he disintegration 
of the subtle and causal bodies.

Hope you appreciate th=
e direction/thrust of my querying..

Sincerely,

Sundeep
