Namaste Mitesh,

it was a good notes from you. i enjoyed reading your frank=
 thoughts.

Namaste Vinitaji,

>Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spon=
taneously
>towards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it >
>m=
entally.

In my opinion, if you have decided to perform Ganapati Homam, the=
n no need to get confused about Mantra Selection during Homam. for Ganapati=
 Homam, Narasimha has suggested to do 3 specific Mantars/Stotra.
Bija Mantr=
a, Vedic Mantra and Atharvashirsha (pl. Refer the manual)- over and above i=
t is perfectly fine to offer Aahutis with 'Mritunja Mahamantra or Gayatri M=
antra or soime other nantra'. I used to offer initially Mritunjaya and Gaya=
tri Mantra Aahuti during Ganapati Homam but now since a couple of months, i=
 have discontinued that and only stick to the 3 suggested above.

If one pe=
rforms the Homam, over period of time the deity will inspire saadhaka with =
right mantra and attitude. it is best to live with confusions and pray Maha=
Ganapati to do anything and everything including removal of doubts. this is=
 offcourse my attitude and people need not agree.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

 the different "quality" of mantras. The above mantra is supposed to be a "=
