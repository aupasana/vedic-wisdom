  Dear Friends,

 
>What is SPIRITUAL PERFECTION?
> I wish to share  some  thoughts on Spiritual Perfection.
> 
>We know that the goal to be reached viz., the Sadhya, The Truth  or Supreme Being  is  already Perfect by nature. Only the means for reaching that Goal viz., sadhana is imperfect. All actions, due to their very nature, are imperfect. There appears to be a paradox here; for the Goal is perfect, whereas the means,sadhana to attain that Goal is imperfect?  How to resolve this paradox?
> 
>Let us examine the nature of ignorance,Avidya  and the Goal, the Self.  Whatever sadhana we  have
> undertaken does not make the Self  more Perfect as the Self is already SATCHITANANDA, The Perfect. Sadhana  helps to  purify the mind  and prepares it for the revelation of the Atman that is already there in all its  perfection.  Let us take a few examples.
> 
>Ignorance or Avidya is a veil. It is like a dust on a mirror. When we dust off the dirt from the mirror`s surface( through Sadhana) the essential nature of the clear mirror  is revealed. Dusting per se   did not  endow the reflective capacity to the mirror.  The reflective capacity is the very nature(dharma) of the mirror. To cite another example, ignorance is like clouds  covering the rays of the Sun.  The Sun is always there shining , but when we see darkness we think the Sun is not there. The pure Atman or Self is always there. Only
> ignorance is hiding
> It.
> 
>Correct understanding and single-pointedness of effort  are necessary in order to achieve any end. More than this, true devotion is required for attaining Spiritual perfection.  Devotion is Love at the Supreme level for the work undertaken, for  a higher ideal. Devotion is the key to spiritual Sadhana.  With this attitude of reverent devotion, a  perfect sadhak  carries his work as  KARMA YOGA with all fruits of action dedicated to the lord of his heart. When the results come he gladly  and humbly accepts them  in an attitude of prasada -buddhi, ie., taking all results as prasadams or blessing  from the  Lord.  To my mind, surrender to Lord is the culmination of Spiritual perfection after one has gone through the process of decontamination viz., Sadhana.
