Dear Hari,
 
Never hesitate to ask or say anything that may seem impertinen=
t.
 
*        *        *
 
When a mantra is spoken, sound is produced at 4 =
levels. The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sound at the physical lev=
el. When you say something by moving the physical body parts (lips etc), th=
eir movement vibrates the air particles and those vibrations vibrate the ph=
ysical body parts in the ears of listeners and people around you can "liste=
n".
 
At the same time, the subtle thoughts in the mind accompanying the ch=
anting of the mantra result in movement in parts of your "subtle body", whi=
ch vibrate the subtle space around you and those cause some vibrations in t=
he subtle bodies of people around you.
 
In this way, sound (or vibration) =
is produced at 4 levels. The subtler the level, the longer the signal can c=
arry without decaying.
 
*        *        *
 
If one has some shakti accum=
ulated with a specific mantra, one's chanting of that mantra is infused wit=
h that shakti.
 
The energy infused when one chants a mantra is carried mai=
nly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy carried at the physical leve=
l (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to the energy carried in the s=
ubtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound contains the key to the su=
btler levels for most people.
 
I can explain this using an analogy. One ma=
y have a powerful concept or idea in mind that one is thinking of. Most oth=
er people cannot read one's mind and cannot access that concept or idea. Ho=
wever, if one expresses the idea in words, people will be able to access th=
at idea. Most of the power is in the idea and not in the exact words used. =
However, the written/spoken words that are tangible to others act as a key =
to one's thoughts. World can now access the power of one's idea!
 
Similarl=
y, the exact letters or words of a mantra are not really alive with energy.=
 But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one's chanting of the mantra i=
s infused with some power. Other people cannot access that power normally. =
But, once one says the mantra in an audible form (just like expressing the =
idea in tangible words above), the power in one's chanting of the mantra is=
 accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not really in th=
e audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key to the inaudible =
sound and world can now access the power of one's chanting (just as the wri=
tten words act as a key to one's idea and the world can now access the powe=
r of one's idea).
 
When you chant a mantra silently, you are hiding your s=
hakti with the mantra from the world. When you chant a mantra loud, you are=
 sharing your shakti with the mantra with the world. Some of it can be wast=
ed and some of it can be tapped by someone.
 
*        *        *
 
If leav=
es, flowers and fruits are plucked from a small plant, it will not grow and=
 it will die. Similarly, one's shakti with a mantra will not grow if one ke=
eps saying that mantra loud now and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra si=
lently, while maintaining some yama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate =
shakti with it.
 
If you do not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra=
, that is fine too. That is NOT an impediment to self-purification and self=
-realization. However, certain tasks in this dual world require an accumula=
tion of enough shakti with a mantra. If one's guru wants one to do somethin=
g in future and asks one to accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one h=
as to do it.
 
*        *        *
 
Manish's guru was a realized man. His =
name was Nakhate Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed =
by a darshan of Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of=
 21 years. He remained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the=
 dual world to perform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.
 
Ev=
en a realized man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example,=
 when he gave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite=
 old-fashioned. He did not say the mantra in Manish's ear. Instead, he aske=
d Manish to sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish's tem=
ples. He asked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantr=
a in Devanagari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw a=
nd did sadhana with that mantra.
 
*        *        *
 
These methods are =
used for a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:
=
 
(1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, because=
 there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately is=
 unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.
(=
2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily, o=
ne can waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be b=
etter if you teach one how to work hard and make money.
 
Sharing various t=
houghts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana is one thin=
g and sharing one's accumulated shakti with a mantra with people another.
 =

*        *        *
 
As I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want to mention a =
small story about him.
 
When Nakhate Maharaj left this world, his sishyas =
had an interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditating at that time. He=
 suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. He opened his eyes and sa=
w that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him physically. He held his=
 palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as if saying good bye=
. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India later, he found out that Na=
khate Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. He also found out th=
at his other sishyas too had the same experience in different parts of the =
world around the same time.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams
 =
  
  Please forgive me if I am seen to be impertinent in my question based =
on the lines in bold below.
   
  Why must the Guru upadesa be kept secret =
and not shared with anyone who might benefit? More the so if it is a prasid=
dha mantra? Think of Ramanujacharya, who after receiving the astakshari fro=
m his Guru, shouted the mantra from the rooftop to all and thus the world w=
as benefited. The same way, have we not benefited when the rishis generousl=
y shared their knowledge of Brahman?
   
  I can understand it if the mantr=
a/prayer is customized for an individual according to the capacity of the p=
erson.
   
  best regards
  Hari

  =EF=BB=BFNamaste,

  It is wha=
t you wrote, but with some minor correction. I can record other mantras in =
my voice and share with all, but instructed to not give Savitur Gayatri man=
tra in my voice to anyone. It is my spiritual food. Most of my spiritual ex=
periences came with this mantra and I need this mantra for more things in f=
uture. So I keep it to myself and do not share it with all.

  But many peo=
ple in your city should be able to teach you this mantra with correct pronu=
nciation. By the way, I think you live in Chennai. If so, please try to mee=
t Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty Street near Central=
 station. He belongs to a rare class of priests who are fast becoming extin=
ct in this commercial age. If possible, meet him and take his blessings.

 =
 My intuition tells me that you are a man made for karma yoga rather than m=
editation and veda mantras. Surrender to your chosen deity, see that deity =
in all people and serve people around you. See god in all people. If possib=
le, think of starting a small movement in the slums of Chennai (or wherever=
 you live). Go, serve people there, help them to the best of your ability a=
nd teach them about god. After helping them materially first, then teach th=
em to chant god's name when they have a few minutes of time. In my opinion,=
 this is the right path for you.

  Actions performed with ego, pride and a=
ttachment bind one. Actions without ego, pride and attachment liberate one.=
 Please perform big acts of social service and yet without any pride or att=
achment. Do not be upset with a few failures in the beginning (upset comes =
with attachment. A detached person is not upset if his sincere actions do n=
ot give the intended result) and keep trying calmly. Sincere and detached a=
ction never fails in the long run. Start slowly.

  Best regards,
  Narasim=

 namaste & 
  pranaams<BR> <BR>Please forgive me if I am seen to b=
e impertinent in my 
  question based on the lines in bold below.<BR> =
<BR>Why must the Guru 
  upadesa be kept secret and not shared with anyone =
who might benefit? More the 
  so if it is a prasiddha mantra? Think of Ram=
anujacharya, who after receiving 
  the astakshari from his Guru, shouted t=
he mantra from the rooftop to all and 
  thus the world was benefited. The =
same way, have we not benefited when the 
  rishis generously shared their =
knowledge of Brahman?<BR> <BR>I can 
  understand it if the mantra/pra=
yer is customized for an individual according 
  to the capacity of the per=
son.<BR> <BR>best

  k=

  deity, see that deity in all people and serve people around you. See go=

  all people. If possible, think of starting a small movement in the =
slums of 
  Chennai (or wherever you live). Go, serve people there, help th=
em to the best 
  of your ability and teach them about god. After helping t=
hem materially first, 
  then teach them to chant god's name when they have=
 a few minutes of time. In 
  my opinion, this is the right path for you.</=
