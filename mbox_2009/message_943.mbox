Namaste Narasimhaji

I was readi=
ng up on the old mail about how your started doign Chandi 
Homa. You mentio=
ned that you always considered Ma Lakshmi as you 
Istha Devata.

Now what I=
 was wondering about it that, is it possible that for a 
person to get clos=
er to
 his/her Istha, he/she may have to under go 
serious sadhana of some =
other deity?

Like in your case you have done so many homas for Ma Chandi, =
so does 
it mean Ma Chandi is your Istha devata? 

Or does it mean Ma Laksh=
mi wanted you to do these sadhanas so that 
you can progress faster, maybe =
you had done a lot of sadhana for Ma 
Chandi in previous lives?

Kindly tel=
l us your views on this.

-Regards
 Rajarshi
