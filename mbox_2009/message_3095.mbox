Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
Even I have heard that there were Sufis=C2=A0=C2=A0who w=
ere devoted to Krishna. Wajid Ali Shah - the nawab of Oudh was one such per=
son. Vimalananda says he was a Kinnara who had incarnated on this plane. Qu=
ite possible. He used to go mad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh da=
nce of Gopis for Krishna. Although he used to do his five times=C2=A0Namaz =
as well. There were other such Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to K=
rishna.
=C2=A0
That is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men=
 are God, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We say that =
everything is of Allah (God).
=C2=A0
Trust Dr Naik when he is speaking on t=
he Koran. Do not trust him when he speaks on anything else. He does know hi=
s Koran well.
=C2=A0
Look at this logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be=
 Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If that perfected man could not have a d=
irected communion with Allah ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril i=
n Arabic) as in intermediary,=C2=A0why should any=C2=A0other muslim ever ha=
ve a direct connection with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.
=C2=
=A0
There is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. 
=
=C2=A0
Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fa=
llen by ego. The entities which live by fire as per Islam are called the Ji=
nns. They are another class who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from f=
ire. They supposedly carry information from earth to the heavens and use fi=
re as a tool for the same.
=C2=A0
Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult =
practitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I don't know what is the exa=
ct correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I =
know people who do actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Mayb=
e they are something like spirits or beings of some astral plane. 
=C2=A0
H=
owever, one who does Homa need for a=C2=A0 deity need not worry about these=
 in the least. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothi=
ng else will dare interfere.
=C2=A0
But the real reason why most muslims ha=
ve an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muha=
mmed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a s=
ymbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs will be thrown by =
Allah into a huge fire.
=C2=A0
sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zak=
ir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different directions or actually they=
 try to make it such that they never meet.
=C2=A0
Hmm, I would beg to disag=
ree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies =
and use half truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes co=
rrectly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideol=
ogy - specially Hindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2=A0 An exp=
lanation for this maybe digressing and long.
=C2=A0
But generally, if I wer=
e born in a muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day =
in and day out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhamme=
d as the perfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I wou=
ld consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamen=
tal that unless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there=
 cannot be a reconciliation.
=C2=A0
Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing =
the koran for 9 years. At the end of the nine years he started his temple d=
emolishion campaign.


It is no wonder that more than 90 percent of muslim =
youth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of Allah=
 to the Ummah and the greatest 'scholar' of Islam and 'comparitive religion=
s' alive on earth. I am speaking from personal interaction. 
=C2=A0
At some=
 point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I don't. I find them to b=
e a victim more than any one, and a victim who is not even aware of the fac=
t that he is a victim! A victim not of USA=C2=A0 or Zionists or Hindus or a=
nyone. A victim of the idea called Islam.
=C2=A0
The above statement may se=
em controversial, but it is not a casual remark.
=C2=A0

Dear Rajarshi,

Thank you f=
or these informations on Sufis. But one information still needed about thei=
r Krishna Bhakti. were there any saints among Sufis who actually sang Bhaja=
ns in praise of Krishna?

***
>Communion with God is an idea impossible is =
the Islam of Muhammed. >The creator is always seperate from the creation.Pe=
riod. Anything >else is Kufr

That is a right statement.
That is what Dr. Z=
akir highlighted. You say tree is God, men are God, hills are God, Sun, moo=
n and everything is God while We say that everything is of Allah (God).

**=
*
a different Note:

one intresting point - There is one idea in Islam that=
 *Shayatan* was created from the fire.

We everyday do Fire worship ritual!=


Incidently one of my very good friends, who is Muslim is coming to my hom=
e with Family and will stay with me for a week. he'll see me doing Homam ev=
eryday. He and his wife knows about it. infact i've done many Chadi Paath r=
ecitations at his home and even my Maha Lakshmi vratam if it happened to be=
 a friday. Whenever i visit their home, his wife sees to it that there is n=
o Non veg food brought in his home.
He'll offer his Namaz ritual at my home=
. so Homam and Namaz will go parallelly. This parallel of different rituals=
 has a meeting point in both of our hearts. sadly in the view of the people=
 like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different directions or =
actually they try to make it such that they never meet.

Best Regards,

Utp=

 Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not =

 no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God commu=

ncidently one of my very good friends, who is Muslim is coming to my home w=

day. He and his wife knows about it. infact i've
 done many Chadi Paath rec=

 friday. Whenever i visit their home, his wife sees to it that there is no =
Non veg food brought in his home.<BR>He'll offer his Namaz ritual at my hom=

 actually they try to make it such that they never meet.<BR><BR>Best Regard=

quite different from traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite dis=

 - IMHO - t=

my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.<BR>>  <BR>&g=
t; Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The c=
reator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. =
Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpr=
etation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic =
garb. <BR>>  <BR>>  <BR>> The person who changed the lif=
e of Rumi was also another Sufi called  Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda m=
entions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild ra=
ise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demons=
trate. Shams went to a dead body and said, "In the name of Allah, wake up!"=
. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Fina=

 the dead body woke up. Immediate t=

R>> Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for procla=
iming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This statement is also=
 considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. <BR>>  <BR>> Auliya N=
izamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India. It is sai=

re Shivaji was born.<BR>>  <BR>> Generally, except for the famou=
s Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint=
. <BR>>  <BR>> Though Sufis always showed a different more subje=

 I do not blame them. An honest
 reading of the Koran and the hadiths with =
tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort o=
f God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won't digress into my views of =
what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, tradit=
