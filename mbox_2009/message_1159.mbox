Hi 

I have query on Kemadruma Yoga.  While I am reading a particular 
horo=
scope I see that Kemadruma Yoga is cancelled due to aspects of 
Jupiter on =
moon and thus giving Gajakesari yoga. Is my reading right.

The details are=
 

Lagna   20 Li 41' 44 55"
Moon    6 Cp 57' 43 01"
Jupiter 20 Cn 16' 29 25=
"

Also note that there are no planets in the second house and in the 
12th=
 house from moon.

Regards
Gary
