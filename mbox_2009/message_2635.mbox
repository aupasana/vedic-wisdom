Namaste,
=A0
Dear Mohana Ranganji,
=A0
I was a bit surprised when I read yo=
ur reply that our charts can also say who our Ishta Devata is
? I am a arde=
nt devotee of Maa Kaali and she has been the source of my strength in my li=
fe.
=A0
Now a doubt has been created in my mind and I treat doubt as a canc=
er which needs to be eradicated . Hence I seek your advice to know who is m=
y Ishta Devata ? Am I worshipping the right Devata to maximise Her Grace on=
 me. My birth details are DOB : 26th March'64, TOB : 8.30 AM, POB: Madras.
=
=A0
>From my Natal Chart I notice that my Lagna Lord is Mars and Venus is AK=
 who occupies Mesha(lagna) along with Jupiter. In D9, I notice that Venus i=
s with=A0Saturn in=A0Dhanu.=A0
=A0
Being a beginner who has just started to=
 learn astrology from the basics, you detailed reply will enable me to anal=
yse and find the Ishta Devata for the other sample horroscope used for my s=
tudies based on the way you analyze my chart.
=A0
Thanks for your time and =
help in advance.
=A0
Jai Maa Kaali

Warm Regards,=A0

Om Namo Narayanaya

Dear Biswaj=
itji,

You are right. Your Lagna lord is also AK ie planet Mercury.
AK is i=
n Kanya rasi in D9, again in own house and exalted. As per the Sages and SJ=
C , it is seen that planet Venus is posited in Simha the 12th from AK amsa.=


Hence Goddess Mahalakshmi is your Ishta DEvata(ID.

May God bless you

gards,
