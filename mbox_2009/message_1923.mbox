I ful=
ly appreciate your explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama w=
as capable of manipulating realm of Maya (Miracle worker) like Lord Krishna=
 BUT the role assumed by him in that incarnation was of that 'Maryaada Purs=
hottam' and that is why he demonstrated 'Maryaada' in every aspect of life.=
he abided himself by the general rules of society. But i do not think that =
he had not Mastered the Duality. where as Krishna didn't bound himself in a=
ny boundry whatsoever.

***
Is it fruitful/useful in any ways to extend phi=
losophies like comparing Krishna & Kali, Rama and Tara or Matangi. somehow =
i don't feel like reading and getting in to exercise of reading and imagine=
 such concepts. no offense to any body but it is my question to myself. Nar=
asimha garu ! why i am not inclined to such things.

apologise if my thinki=
ng is wrong here.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
