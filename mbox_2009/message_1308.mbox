Namaste

Agreed all clean places are not equal, however there is no awarene=
ss 
in general to find and ascertain the equality or inequiality of any 
pl=
ace. Our awareness is at having a clean place physically.

Good Vibrations =
are always good and bad Vibrations are not good.
Even Bad vibrations turn i=
nto good vibrations in a short period of 
time if one sincerely meditates i=
n a place and does some doop of 
guglu etc to start with.

Also we are doin=
g all these to be a better person, and based on ones 
sanchit sanskars one =
may encounter a place with some bad vibrations 
but that has to clear up as=
 soon as those sanskars have done 
delivered that part, honestly this bad v=
ibrations can happen anywhere 
in the most optimum pooja location too.

How=
ever in general 99.99% cannot distinguish or feel vibrations.
We cannot and=
 should not scare people like this.

What is most important is that as one =
meditates or does pooja in the 
same place, it starts to create good vibrat=
ions and the place becomes 
a better place.

How can you relate tamasic vib=
artions to a basement?
This basis is without any merit what so ever.
Withou=
t a solid basis I find this as more "quakish".

Probability wise a basement=
 has the same probability to have bad 
vibration as any other place on this=
 earth or take for instance a bed 
room or a living room.

Generally baseme=
nts are quite and less disturbance and so are 
considered good.

Narasimha =
on this one I respectfully disagree with you unless you 
provide very compe=
lling explaination and also you can refer some 
document.

There is a sayin=
g "a dancer does not know how to dance blames on the 
floor being crooked".=
 The surrounding is an excuse, if one does pooja 
sincerely from heart with=
 noble expectations than one overcomes all 
impediments, what is there in b=
ad vibrations or a tamasic place, both 
of them will run away.

Best Regard=
