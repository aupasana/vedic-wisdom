Dear Rajarishi, namaste

A salt doll went to the ocean to measure its depth=
 and tell the same to its
fellow salt doll comrades. But the moment it ente=
red the ocean, it dissolved
and now how was it to tell the depth of the oce=
an to its comrades? -
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa

Those who experienced self-r=
ealization find it hard to describe about their
experiences in pretty much =
the same way that a person finds it hard to
describe the taste of sugar to =
another person who has never taken sugar,

I hope this helps. Narasimha gav=
e a reply to my question on nirvikalpa and
sahaja samadhi. I trust you read=
 that mail.

best regards
Hari
