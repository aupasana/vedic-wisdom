Namaste & Sadar Pranam to all enlightened souls of the group,
=A0
First of =
all I have to thank Utpalji to guide us to the link --> Msg # 382.
=A0
I am=
=A0a new comer to this group who is in search of oneself and is lost in the=
 crowd searching for peace. My quest & search for peace continues and hope =
this journey doesn't take too long till I find a Guru who could guide me an=
d channelize my energy for the betterment of people around me.
=A0
I was ta=
ken aback when I read Rajarshiji's mail about the confusion prevailing in h=
is mind about Guru. Because what Rajarshiji said was about 20 - 25% of my c=
onfused state and how come he is saying all that I had been asking myself f=
or the last couple of years. I am still searching for the answers as my jou=
rney continues until I stumbled and fell into this wonderful group where I =
am able to get=A0a few answers for the questions which were burning inside =
me to be quenched with convincing replies.
=A0
I followed the thread and li=
ked the way Utpalji replied and directing us to the message #382 which Shri=
 PVRji has aptly said - "Wait" till you get your Guru and in the meanwhile =
keep cleansing yourself. In this wait & journey of life what I have learnt =
is "patience" and Mother Nature has been very kind=A0teaching me so many le=
ssons.
=A0
For me, GURU will be person who will Guide Us to Reach=A0HIM (ou=
r Creator) who is=A0Ubquitous. I sincerly look forward for more enlightenin=
g exchanges from our beloved PVRji.
=A0
Jai MAA KAALI=A0.

Namaste Rajarashi,

Narasimha is contemporary to us and a professional wi=
th family life. Involved in many Astrlogical clashes. that is why it is qui=
te possible that some or many may not understand his spiritual greatness. o=
ne thing i can say with 100% confidence that he is no ordinary soul and i a=
m really really blessed to be his shishya! it was a punyodaya in my life wh=
en i was inspired to accept him as my guru on a Janmaashtami day. i hope i =
live up to his expectations and stature. as you rightly said, his writings =
will inspire the spiritualist of coming generations and i add astrlogers as=
 well.

Durgaashtami has already started and lets perform a heartmelting Ch=
andi Homam !!!

Best Regards,

Utpal
