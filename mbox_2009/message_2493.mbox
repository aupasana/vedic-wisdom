 The difference between dreams and the wakeful state lies in the fact that
=
in the waking state the dream is determined to be false, whereas in the
dre=
am the waking state is not so determined. Therefore the waking state is
uni=
versally taken to be real. But this is wrong. For do you not experience
the=
 same extent of permanency and purposefulness in dreams as in the wakeful
s=
tate?

Wakeful consciousness does not intervene in dreams nor does
dream-co=
nsciousness intervene in the wakeful state, while the two factors =97
endur=
ing nature and purposefulness =97 are common to both.

Examine your past dr=
eams and past waking experiences in the light of these
facts and see for yo=
urself.

Again, note the appearance of reality in magical phenomena and the=
 seemingly
purposeful actions of magical creations. Does reality rest on th=
e slender
basis of such appearances?

The confusion is due to want of discr=
imination between the real and the
unreal among ignorant folk. Ignorantly i=
ndeed do they say that the wakeful
universe is real.

The existence of Real=
ity is self-evident and does not require other aids to
reveal it. Unreality=
 is the contrary.

If you say, however, that a thing is real until and unle=
ss its existence is
contradicted, consider the example of a coil of rope be=
ing mistaken for a
snake. The fancied snake would according to you be real =
in the interval
antecedent to correct knowledge, but that is absurd.

The m=
ost important of the qualifications is the desire for emancipation.
Nothing=
 can be achieved without it. Study of philosophy and discussion on
the subj=
ect with others are thoroughly useless, being no better than the
study of a=
rts. For the matter of that, one might as well hope for salvation
by a stud=
y of sculpture and the practice of that art. The study of
philosophy in the=
 absence of a longing for salvation, is like dressing up a
corpse.

The fru=
it of Self-realisation is the end of all misery here and hereafter
and abso=
lute fearlessness. That is called Emancipation.


[Note: There is an end of=
 misery in sleep; but the potentiality of misery is
not ended. Realisation =
destroys the cause of misery and sets the man free
forever.]

What is perce=
ived in the world as being apart from the Self is also clearly
seen to be p=
erishable. What is perishable must certainly involve fear of
loss.

What is=
 the use of hundreds of efforts in the absence of a real and
unswerving des=
ire for emancipation? That is the sole requisite and nothing
else.

The int=
ellect is ordinarily befouled by evil propensities and so nothing
good flou=
rishes there. Consequently,people are boiled in the seething
cauldron of bi=
rths and deaths. Of these evil propensities, the first is want
of faith in =
the revelations made by the Guru and in the sastras; the second
is addictio=
n to desires; and the third is dullness (i.e., inability to
understand the =
revealed truth). This is a brief statement of them.

Of these, want of fait=
h is betrayed by one=92s doubts regarding the truth of
the statements and b=
y failure to understand them. The doubt arises whether
there is moksha; and=
 later misunderstanding leads to its denial. These two
are sure obstacles t=
o any sincere efforts being made for realisation.

The second propensity, n=
amely desire,prevents the intellect from following
the right pursuit.For th=
e mind engrossed in desire cannot engage in a
spiritual pursuit. The abstra=
ction of a lover is well known to all; he can
hear or see nothing in front =
of him. Anything said in his hearing is as good
as not said. Desire must th=
erefore be first overcome before aspiring for
spiritual attainment. That ca=
n be done only by dispassion. This propensity
is manifold, being in the for=
ms of love, anger,greed, pride, jealousy, etc. The
worst of them is pursuit=
 of pleasure which, if destroyed, destroys all else.
Pleasure may be subtle=
 or gross. Neither of these must be indulged in, even
in thought. As soon a=
s the thought of pleasure arises, it must be dismissed
by the willpower dev=
eloped by dispassion.

There is no accomplishment equal to Self-realisation=
,which is alone capable
of ending all misery, because it is the state of et=
ernal Bliss.

He who is, from his own experience, capable of appreciating t=
he states of
other Jnanis, including the best among them, is certainly a pe=
rfect Sage. He
who is not influenced by happiness or misery, by pleasure or=
 pain,by
desires, doubts or fear, is a perfect Sage. He who realises pleasu=
re, pain
and every other phenomenon to be in and of the Self, is a perfect =
Sage. He
who feels himself pervading all =97 be they ignorant or emancipate=
d =97 is a
perfect Sage. He who, knowing the trammels of bondage, does not =
seek release
from them and remains in peace, is a perfect Sage.

An intense=
 devotee, though endowed with only a little discipline of other
kinds (e.g.=
, dispassion), can readily understand the truth though only
theoretically, =
and expound it to others. Such exposition helps him to imbue
those ideas an=
d so he absorbs the truth. This ultimately leads him to
identify all indivi=
duals with Siva and he is no longer affected by pleasure
or pain. All-round=
 identification with Siva makes him the best of Jnanis and
a Jivanmukta (em=
ancipated here and now). Therefore bhakti yoga (the way of
devotion) is the=
 best of all and excels all else.

Investigation cuts at the root of ignora=
nce.Dispassion develops
investigation. Disgust for the pleasures of life ge=
nerates dispassion
towards them.

Investigation is analysis conducted withi=
n oneself, discriminating the
non-self from the Self, stimulated by a stern=
, strong and sincere desire to
realise the Self. Dispassion is non-attachme=
nt to surroundings. This results
if the misery consequent on attachment is =
kept in mind.

Fear holds a man possessed of enormous wealth; misery, of a =
large family;
and poverty, of insatiable desires.

The man with no attachme=
nts is free from fear; the one with controlled mind
is free from misery;the=
 Self-realised man is never needy.


Just as an actor is not really affecte=
d by the passions which he displays on
the stage, so also this Jnani, alway=
s aware of his perfection, is not
affected by the seeming pleasures and pai=
ns which he regards as a mere
illusion, like the horns of a hare.

The high=
est Jnani makes no difference between samadhi and worldly
transactions. He =
never finds anything apart from the Self and so there is no
lapse for him.
=

The state of the Jnani is said to be identical with that of Siva. There is=

not the least difference between them. Therefore karma cannot besmear a
Jn=
ani.
