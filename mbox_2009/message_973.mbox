Dear ALL,


*Vedic Sanskars : Influence Chromosomes -1** *

As per the re=
search findings of the modern sciences, the current civilized
and developed=
 state of man is a result of a long series of evolutionary
changes. This ha=
s taken about 400 to 500 thousand years for the ascent of
human race to the=
 present state and women have made significant
contributions in civilizing =
the primeval humans. This important role played
by women is getting clearer=
 and better established by the discoveries in the
field of human genomics.
=

It is a well-known scientific fact that offsprings acquire good and bad
qu=
alities of their ancestors through the chromosomes. The language of genes
w=
ritten in the chromosomes of the cells of the offspring determines his/her
=
form, color, body structure and other attributes and characteristics. The
c=
ells in human body have 46 chromosomes. Among these, 23 chromosomes come
fr=
om the mother and the other 23 come from the father. On one side these
chro=
mosomes display the specific qualities and attributes of the offspring,
and=
 on the other side they also determine whether or not the offspring would
b=
e afflicted by any of the 2000 diseases that have been considered as
geneti=
c. These include several kinds of cancers and other fatal ailments.

The cr=
eator of this world has written specific messages in the chemical
language =
of chromosomes. About 32.5 million letters of these genetic codes
have been=
 read and the human genome (compendium of genes) has been made
available on=
 the Internet. However, only about 40 thousand genes of these
have been ide=
ntified till date. It is still not known what kinds of roles
most of these =
genes play in the human body. Till date about 95 percent of
the genome is u=
ncharacterized and because of the redundancy of its sequence
across the hum=
an population, many researchers consider that they are not of
any significa=
nt use in Nature's molecular machinery.

But thinkers and scientists who lo=
ok at the aspects of human consciousness with
equanimity do not agree with =
this view. The wise men who have faith in
synergy of science and spirituali=
ty believe that extrasensory capabilities
and the secrets of spiritual powe=
rs may be hidden within these 95 percent
unknown DNAs (Deoxyribose Nucleic =
Acid). It is known that DNA is that super
chemical which forms a letter of =
the genomic language by picking up any
three of the four nucleotides =96 Ad=
enine (A), Thiamine (T), Guanine (G), and
Cytosine (C). Definite sequences =
of these letters constitute a word in the
form of 20 amino acids. A gene is=
 that sentence which translates into some
form of protein or the other. For=
 this reason after human genomics, research
is now being carried out on hum=
an proteomics in which Indian scientists are
also participating.

Among the=
 23 pairs of chromosomes in human body, X- and Y-chromosomes are
included w=
hich determine sex. If the foetus receives one X and one Y
chromosome, it t=
akes the form and shape of a boy and if both the chromosomes
are X then the=
 foetus takes the form of a girl. Woman always has X-X
chromosomes so she c=
ontributes X chromosomes only and Y chromosome exists in
man's body only. S=
o man plays a decisive role in determining whether the
offspring would be a=
 boy or a girl.

It has now been established by scientific research that th=
e diversified
quality of creativity that exists in human race has its origi=
n in woman.
According to this, the source of creativity in human beings is =
the X
chromosome, which is the mother's contribution. How did it happen tha=
t
boundless human capabilities of art and science got tied up in the X
chro=
mosome? This might have something to do with the natural power of
creation =
gifted to the women and the inference, drawn by evolutionary
statisticians =
that most of the bright and talented men and women choose only
compatible c=
ounterparts so the genetic recombination in the mating process
would have l=
ed to compounded accumulation of these qualities within the X
chromosome. I=
n fact, all men and women have X chromosomes. Women have two
and men have o=
ne X chromosome, meaning that within each person infinite
capabilities of c=
reativity exist, but these blossom up only when they are
nurtured with good=
 education, virtuous sanskara (deep mental impressions)
and conducive envir=
onment.
IN any case the hypothesis appears valid that if women had not accu=
mulated
the genes of creativity within their X chromosomes, human beings wo=
uld still
be jumping around in jungles like monkeys and the glorious flower=
s of
civilization and culture would never have blossomed in human life. In =
view
of the recent finding of a direct relationship between mental disorder=
s and
the X chromosome it appears that most of the mental disorders are als=
o
transmitted by the mother into her offspring via her X chromosome. A
rese=
arch hypothesis was proposed 30 years back by Dr. Robert Lehrke at the
Brai=
nerd State Hospital located in Brainerd, Minnesota, USA, that several
genes=
 that are related to human intellect are located within the X
chromosome.

=
Noted geneticists Dr Horst Hameister and U. Zechner from Germany have
confi=
rmed the above hypothesis by their research work and have published
their r=
esults in the 17th edition of 'Trends in Genetics'. According to
them, for =
the developed state the human mind is in today, humanity is
indebted to tho=
se great X chromosome bearing women who chose intelligent,
handsome and bra=
ve men not for their outward appearance and strength but for
their virtues,=
 knowledge and intelligence. If they had kept on choosing
stupid but handso=
me men or unintelligent bodybuilders then humans would not
have been able t=
o post so many records in the areas of knowledge and science
which they con=
tinue to do now. In their research conclusions they write that
those genes =
whose abnormal condition creates mental disorders, their normal
(homologous=
 to those in the healthy people) form would be responsible for
the normal s=
tate of human mind too.

This group of researchers, after extensive churnin=
g of the genomic database
from the Internet, has found 958 genes, which are=
 related to mental
disorders, and 202 of these were related to the X chromo=
some. Though this
amounts to just 4 percent of all the human genome, the la=
rgest number of
genes related to mental disorders and physical abnormalitie=
s were found on
the X chromosomes only. The genes responsible for these abn=
ormalities were
found 2.5 times more on the X chromosomes as compared to an=
y other
chromosomes. At the same time all these genes were not in their ori=
ginal
form (as in people with healthy minds) but in an altered or mutated f=
orm.
However if they were in their original form they would have produced a=

normal child. Even if these kinds of genes are distributed over all 23
chr=
omosomes, the genes related to mental ailments are present almost 31
times =
more on the X chromosome.

Thus the secrets of the future of a child are la=
rgely hidden in the genes
and womb of its mother. To ensure that the state =
of the genes on X
chromosomes is fertile for the best characteristics (trai=
ts) it is necessary
that desirable food and lifestyle, sanskara and ambienc=
e be provided to the
'would be mothers'. Of the sixteen Vedic Sacraments (S=
hodas Sanskars1)
propounded by the rishis, the Punsavan and Jatkarma Sanska=
rs for the
expectant mothers are meant for this very purpose. These are dev=
ised with
the sublime scientific view of conditioning the genetic environme=
nt.

The Shodas Sanskaras are excellent experiments on sadhana and mantra- =
and
yagya- therapy; the rituals and teachings implied by them are also aime=
d at
creating appropriate ambience and effectuate psychological conditionin=
g of
the persons whose sanskara is being performed. The Charu (an Ayurvedic=

preparation with milk + special kinds of herbs) cooked in yagya fire and
'=
treated' with mantras during the Punsavan and Jatkarma Samskars is also
req=
uired to be drunk by the mother afterwards. This is assumed to have
soothin=
g effects on the growing brain and overall health of the foetus.
According =
to the experts of the deep knowledge of Himalayan herbs/plant
medicines and=
 yagya therapy, some special charus, medicinal woods and plant
medicines al=
so have potentials to rectify genetic aberrations. Thoughtful
men and women=
 who aspire for children who would grow up into ideal citizens
must underst=
and this fact and must not delay or procrastinate in adopting
the life styl=
es propounded by the ancient Indian sages.
