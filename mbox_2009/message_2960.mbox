namaste,

>  Anuvaka 11 ends actually at the following sukta (11-11), this can be
verified when compared with Krishna Yajurveda 4-5-27

This is correct. The rudra-prashna ends with " ... jambhe dadhAmi ". What
usually follows is a collection of mantras on Rudra -- some from the
Rg-veda, and others from the Yajur veda. Usually, the pATha is almost
identical (with difference only in some short fragments).

The bodhAyaNa sheSha sUtra-s list different mantras that are recited after
the rudra-prashna as part of rudrAbhiSheka. Even they are so influenced by
the "standard pATha", that they simply add their mantras to this list.

All of the mantras are collectively known as "rudra-prArthana-mantra-s", or
something similar. In some traditions, abhiSheka is stopped, and
diipArAdhana is performed while these mantras are recited. I've looked at
the simple meaning for a few mantras in this collection, and they are quite
nice. It appears to me that someone has selected nice mantras on Rudra from
various places to be recited following the rudra-prashna, and, over time,
this has become standard practice.

bhavadiiyaH,
