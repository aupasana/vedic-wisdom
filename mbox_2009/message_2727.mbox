Devotee.: What are the means for gaining will-power?

Bhagavan:

Your idea =
of will-power is success insured.Will-power should be understood
to be the =
strength of mind which makes it capable for meeting success or
failure with=
 equanimity. It is not synonymous with certain success. Why
should one=92s =
attempts be always attended with success? Success develops
arrogance and th=
e man=92s spiritual progress is thus arrested. Failure on the
other hand is=
 beneficial, inasmuch as it opens the eyes of the man to his
limitations an=
d prepares him to surrender himself.Self-surrender is
synonymous with etern=
al happiness. Therefore one should try to gain the
equipoise of mind under =
all circumstances. That is will-power.

Again, success and failure are the =
results of prarabdha and not of
will-power. A man may be doing only good an=
d noble actions and yet prove a
failure. Another may do otherwise and yet b=
e uniformly successful. This does
not mean that the will-power is present i=
n the one and not in the other.
