Namaste,

There is a practice during Navaratri of reading certain chapters of
Devi Mahatmyam on each day so that the entire Devi Mahatmyam is
chanted by the end of Navaratri (eg., Chapter 1 is recited on the
first day, Chapter 2-4 on the second day, Chapter 5 on the third day,
etc.). I was wondering if the Chandi Homam procedure can be adapted to
accommodate this, so that the homam is done each of the days but only
offering as ahutis the verses from the particular chapters to be
chanted that day. I thought it would be an alternative for those of us
who are not yet adept in doing the entire Chandi homam in one setting,
but I do not know whether it would be inappropriate or if the
preliminary or concluding portions of the homam would need to be
modified accordingly.

I would be grateful for any feedback.

Warm regards,
Aditi
