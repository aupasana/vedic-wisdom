Namaste,
 
There is confusion here.
 
In the saptashati text, add a swaahaa=
 whenever you encounter a number and make an offering, whether the number i=
s after a verse or after an "uvaacha" or after an "UchuH". There should be =
about 700 offerings in saptashati like this.
 
In addition, outside of the =
700 offerings, there are things like kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri soo=
ktam and devi sooktam. In kavacham, no offerings are made. In argala and ke=
elakam, only ghee is offered by adding swaahaa after each verse. I suggeste=
d reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa, because adding s=
waahaa at the end of a Vedic verse with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa m=
ay require a modifcation in the intonation or even the anuswara of the last=
 syllable of the Vedic verse to which you add swaahaa. That is why I sugges=
ted reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa.
 
For the 700 =
verses of saptashati, there is no issue in adding swaahaa.
 
Best regards,
=
Narasimha
