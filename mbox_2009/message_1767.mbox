Namaste,
Read this story, and wanted to share it with everybody.


Ananyash=
chintayanto maam ye janaah paryupaasate
teshaam nityaabhiyuktaanaam yogaksh=
emam vahaamyaham. Gita 9.22

For those constant yogis who worship with thou=
ghts centered only on Me, I Myself carry their yoga (necessities for susten=
ance) and (protect) their kshema (the necessities)।
Devotees who are =
always connected to God in their thoughts, have to be really special. We ca=
n understand that. But wait a minute here.. what is God saying? Is He promi=
sing to haul groceries on His own back and deliver them to His devotees? An=
d also, be their personal chowkidar?
God hauled groceries for Arjun Mishra.=
 That is the story I came to tell you today. His story is found in the Bhak=
tamaal grantha.

Pundit Arjun Mishra lived with his wife in Puri, Orissa. I=
 do not know his exact time, but after talking with some informed people, g=
ot the impression that they lived between 150-200 years ago. Puri is also k=
nown as the Purushottam kshetra ( Land of Lord Purushottama Jagannatha ). T=
he famous Jagannatha temple is here. The ancient history of this holy place=
 is described in the Skanda Puran (Vishnu Khanda-Purushottam Mahatmyam).

N=
ow, back to the story=85 Arjun Mishra and his wife did not have much materi=
al wealth. In fact, they were poorer than most poor. Like other Brahmins in=
 those days, he never showed any interest in making money. His life was for=
 studying the Gita and the Bhagavata. He was a great devotee and saw the wo=
rld as Krishna-maya. That means, he saw Sri Krishna everywhere and in every=
body, pervading the universe. The world is seen that way by the exalted dev=
otees.

As you can imagine, such devotees are entirely unselfish. Arjun Mis=
hra wanted to find a way to share his most valued wealth: his learning and =
his Spiritual experiences. What should he do?

"Well, the jagadgurus wrote =
commentaries on the Gita" thought Arjun Mishra, "I might just do that as we=
ll=85.I would certainly love to discuss those verses where I can mention my=
 own Spiritual experiences."

He was thinking about this verse
yena bhutaan=
i asheshhena drakshyasi aatmani atho mayi. 4.35
By which (Spiritual knowled=
ge) you will (initially) see all beings in your Atman and then (see all) in=
 Me.

And this verse,
Vidya vinaya sampanne braahmane gavi hastini
shuni ch=
a eva shvapaake cha panditaah samadarshanah. 5.18
The pundits see a wise an=
d humble Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater to be equal (in=
 Spirit).

And these verses,
Samam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam parameshva=
ram. 13.27
The Parameshwar is equally present in all beings.

Yadaa bhuta p=
rithagbhaavam ekastham anupashyati
Tata eva cha vistaaram brahma sampadyate=
 tadaa. 13.30
When (someone) sees the beings of all different characteristi=
cs to be one (in Spirit) and sees them to be expanded from That, then (that=
 person) attains the Brahman.

Such Spititual vision of the world has been =
called sama-darshan (equal vision) in the Gita. Sri Krishna said that these=
 exalted devotees obtain paraa-bhakti (unwavering devotion) (18. 54). Arjun=
 Mishra was ready for it. Still, he had some lingering doubts.

"But=85 do =
I really know enough to write about the whole Gita?" he wondered. "Well, le=
t's look at it this way=85Arjuna heard the Gita from Sri Krishna Himself an=
d saw His vishwarupa; yet sage Suta did not consider him a boddhaa (knower)=
 of the Gita, just someone who knows "kinchit phalam" (a bit of the benefit=
s).

krishno janati vai samyak, kincit kunti-sutah phalam. Gita Mahatmya 3 =
(Vaishnava tantra saara).

Sri Krishna certainly knows (the Gita), the son =
of Kunti (Arjuna) knows a bit of its benefits.

And again, acharya Madhva i=
nitially thought that he could say about his commentary of the Gita that hi=
s goal was to, "bakshyaami shaktitah" (describe as far as I can), but later=
, he changed it to "bakshyaami leshatah" (describe, only be a tiny part of =
the teachings)."

Indeed, nobody can be wise enough to discuss every messag=
e in the words of God. Those thoughts humbled Arjun Mishra very much. But t=
hen, he wanted to write the commentary. So he reasoned, "if I get stuck, I =
will ask Sri Krishna to help me out with the meaning and wait. I am not goi=
ng to rationalize, but just wait for Sri Krishna. May be Sri Krishna will h=
ave mercy on me, and teach me personally! Nothing can be more wonderful."
H=
e was doing fine with writing the commentary until he came to verse 9.22 (t=
hat's the verse in the beginning of this story). A doubt came to his mind. =
Vahaamyaham? Can it really be true? God lugging provisions on His own back?=
 How can that be? He believed in God's words in the Gita, but just couldn't=
 accept that God can also be the porter for His devotees.

He had promised =
to himself that he will not rationalize, but that's exactly what he started=
 doing. He reasoned, "May be God means that He will arrange the delivery by=
 someone else."

Thinking so, he drew a line through the word vahaamyaham i=
n his commentary with red ink. Isn't it interesting how we want God to conf=
orm to our model of Him? But the devotee in Arjun Mishra took over soon. He=
 remembered his vow about not rationalizing. He suddenly became very disapp=
ointed with himself. He stopped writing and got up, with a sad heart that h=
e just broke his vow. What could he do? After a while, he got back some of =
his composure and said a prayer to Sri Krishna in all humility, "Please tea=
ch me, O Madhava! I am ignorant and foolish and I do not know what you mean=
 by vahaamyaham. Please teach me, and guide me so the commentary can be com=
pleted. You give so much help to Your devotees. I know I am only a poor und=
eserving devotee, but please have mercy on me and help me."

It was already=
 mid-morning. His wife came to see him and said, "We have no food today. Yo=
u have been writing since morning. Please go to beg for alms, otherwise we =
will have to go hungry."

Arjun Mishra went out for the alms. In those days=
, people considered it an honor to give food grains and vegetables to Brahm=
ins like him. Their begging is called maadhukari. Arjun Mishra was distraug=
ht from the morning, so he thought that he would go to take a dip in the ho=
ly Rohini kunda first. He set out from home, the kunda was a little distanc=
e away.

As he was walking towards the kunda, he remembered the story of th=
e old crow in the Skanda puran. When the crow realized that death was near,=
 it flew to the Rohini Kunda and took a bath in the water and then looked d=
evotedly at Lord Jagannatha on the temple alter. Soon afterwards, it died a=
nd became free from life. Arjun Mishra thought that taking a dip in such a =
holy water will help him as well.

While he was gone, two young boys arrive=
d at the Mishra home with big sacks on their backs, huffing and puffing fro=
m the load. They looked miserable and were crying loudly. Arjun Mishra's wi=
fe was sitting on the verandah, looking out for her husband. When she saw t=
he boys, she came down the steps running, very concerned. She was an extrem=
ely kind lady.

"What happened to you, my children? Why are you crying? I c=
annot understand who would hurt such young boys. Who is making you carry su=
ch heavy sacks? Where are you going?"

Saying so, she helped them unload th=
e sacks. Then she had the shock of her life. She discovered deep lateral sc=
ars of fresh injury on their backs. Blood was oozing out from their scars. =
"Oh! What kind of heartless person can beat small children in this manner?"=
 she exclaimed.

She picked the two boys up in her arms and brought them in=
side the house। She sat them down on wooden seats they had in the ver=
andah, and ran inside. There was no food in the house, so she brought two c=
ups of cold water for them. After drinking the water, the boys looked sligh=
tly more comfortable. They said to her, "Ma! Punditji beat us, and made us =
carry the grocery sacks. Those groceries are for you."

"My husband has bea=
ten you? But I have never known him to be angry। For what reason? Whe=
n did he beat you? What did he beat you with?" she almost collapsed in shoc=
k.

"We do not know why, Ma। But he beat us with a sharp stick of iro=
n" they said। "Just a little while ago।"

She could not wait fo=
r all the answers. She had to take care of their wounds first. She ran insi=
de again, and came back with a big pot of water and some bandage cloth. The=
y had a ghritakumari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ran to it and broke=
 a fat leaf. Then she mashed the leaf with her masala-grinding stone and co=
llected the expressed resin. She was now ready to dress their wounds. She c=
leaned their wounds, put a little of the ghritakumari extract and made a cl=
oth bandage. The ghritakumari resin soothed their wounds and the boys were =
feeling a lot better.

"Our friends are waiting for us for play. We want to=
 go, Ma" they said. Then they bowed before her and left.

Arjun Mishra's wi=
fe was happy that she could help them feel better. She also knew how little=
 boys are.. always short on patience. So, she hugged them and did not press=
 for more answers and let them go. Then her thoughts turned again to her hu=
sband. She just did not understand how her gentle husband could have hurt t=
hose boys. Anyway, she did not have time to think too much. She needed to s=
tart cooking. So she picked up the groceries and started cooking. Her husba=
nd should come back any time now.

Arjun Mishra had taken the vow of three-=
house maadhukari. He would only go to three houses and accept one handful o=
f rice and some vegetables from each house. It had rained heavily the night=
 before and it rained all morning. The three houses he went to, were all fl=
ooded. He called out, but nobody was home. People had left for higher groun=
d. So he came back home empty-handed. When he got home, he found his wife w=
as cooking something. He thought that somebody must have brought some food =
for them.

He announced, "My love, the rains have flooded a lot of houses. =
Nobody was there to give me alms today. But I see you are cooking, who brou=
ght us food?"

His wife was crying, "How could you beat those two little bo=
ys?"

"What do you mean? I beat two boys? I didn't beat any boys." He excla=
imed.

"You didn't beat them?" She said in disbelief.

"Why should I beat a=
nybody? You saw what I was doing since morning. I was writing about the Git=
a. Then I went to the Rohini kunda and took a bath. Then I went for maadhuk=
ari. From there, I came straight back home. I did not see any boys." He sai=
d in defense.

"You did beat them. They told me how you beat them with a sh=
arp stick of iron. They had scars across their backs, and were bleeding. I =
treated them with ghritakumari myself. " She said.

"I did not beat anybody=
. I didn't. Why should I lie to you?" he insisted.

"Making them carry thos=
e heavy sacks was bad enough. What did they do that you beat them with a sh=
arp iron stick?" She grumbled, clearly not believing her husband.

"I do no=
t know what you are talking about." Arjun Mishra retorted. He went inside t=
o the room where he was writing in the morning. He was about to sit down, b=
ut his wife followed him there.

"Come now and eat. I have much work to do.=
 I have to clean after you." She said.

"All right, I am coming. But I am v=
ery unhappy that you do not believe me." He said.
Arjun Mishra followed her=
 and sat down to eat. "I do not understand how the day is going. First, I g=
et stuck with a verse. Then I do not get any maadhukari. Then you say that =
I beat up two young boys." He mumbled. "Who brought us the food?"

"Those t=
wo boys, who else? You had sent them with the food, they told me." She said=
.

"I sent two boys with food? I did not do any such thing. Are you sure th=
ey brought the food for us?" He asked.

"They said your name. And said that=
 you made them carry the sacks of food and bring to me." She said, "Eat now=
. I have work to do."

"Whose children are they? Do you know them?" he aske=
d.

"No. I do not. They are not from our village." She said.

"Not from our=
 village? What did they look like?" he asked.

"They were cute little boys.=
 The younger one was dark and the older one was fair." She said.

Arjun Mis=
hra did not need any more clues. He immediately realized who the two boys w=
ere: they were Sri Krishna and Balarama. In the morning, he had doubted tha=
t Sri Krishna will personally carry provisions for his devotees. To show hi=
m that He does, He carried a sack of groceries on His back. He even made Sr=
i Balarama carry a second sack for them for another meal. And, he struck ou=
t the word vahaamyaham with red ink. That mark Sri Krishna carried as injur=
y.

Arjun Mishra could eat no more. He was chocking with emotion. He had pi=
cked up a morsel, but he put that on his head and sat there in silence. Tea=
rs streamed out from his eyes.

His wife was perplexed. "What happened?"

"=
My love, this is no mere food, this is prasad. Those boys were Sri Krishna =
and Balarama. You are so fortunate that you saw them. Eat some of the prasa=
d yourself and let's go out to fetch everybody in the village. This we shou=
ld share with everyone." He said excitedly.Then he explained to her what ha=
d happened since morning.

She ate some prasad excitedly. After that, they =
had a big celebration with the neighbors sharing the prasad. There were lot=
s of Harinam singing and ecstatic dancing. After everyone had gone home, Ar=
jun Mishra went to his writing room. He wrote: vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham, va=
haamyaham. He was convinced of God's promise to His devotees.

Arjun Mishra=
 wrote an excellent commentary of the Gita with real Spiritual insights. Hi=
s commentary is famous for the triple mention of vahaamyaham. The message o=
f this story is that we should never seek an imaginary relationship with Go=
d and trust God to personally help us, teach us and at the end, liberate us=
. If we do not have that confidence, we are not worthy of being called devo=
tees.
