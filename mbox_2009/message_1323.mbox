Namaste

The region around Ujjain is considered the heart of spiritaul indi=
a.
A lot of Mahatmaas in Sookma Sareer stay in that Malwa Region and 
river=
 Chambal.

Please pardon my spellings.

Amongst the famous Harisiddhi Mata =
Temple one of the Shakti Peets and 
ShivLinga Temples. Ujjain is also famou=
s for Raja Bharathat Hari cave.
Raja Barathari is considered as one of the =
9 Naths from the Nath 
Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he=
 went south to
Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of bl=
ood from 
Sati when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas too. A=
nd 
in the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lot of 
=
great Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there, 
starting=
 with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and then
Sheelnath Ma=
haraj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th 
century. Over and abo=
ve the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj 
Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami =
VishnuTirth Maharaj's Ashram located in 
the valley of the hill where Mothe=
r Chamunda temple is situated.

Mother in this temple manifested many times=
 and gave guidance and 
darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there=
 are others who 
benefited too.

They all stayed at the Temple in devas. It=
 is said even today many 
Mahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Chamunda =
Devi on a regular 
basis.

Best Regards
Mitesh
