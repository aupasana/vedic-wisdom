Dear PVR,
In general, auspicious periods like navratri are auspicious for s=
pritual sadhana beside many other work. Rightly pointed out that puja of 'M=
aata' is very beneficial to all. However, i believe that anybody persuing s=
adhana of any deity will also be very beneficial, as this period has someth=
ing special which is suitable for chanting, japa and meditation. Thus, bene=
fits accruing will be manifold. Right conduct during puja and japam is equa=
lly important,even more important. Restraint on food, speech, thinking, and=
 sex is extremely important to progress faster. Offcourse, divine grace is =
also required.But divine will helps endlessly those who want to persue divi=
ne end.

Regards,
sanjeev sharma
