Namaste Utpal

Very good post ...

There have always been some big proponen=
ts of Homan and Agni pooja.
Pandit Shree Ram Sharma of Gayatri parivaar sta=
rted it in a big way 
many decades ago. This is a fantastic movement, where=
 now they have 
done research on homan etc and the effects on the environme=
nt and 
body.

In Maharastra, followers of dattatreya had a simple agnihotr=
a process
of using cow dunk and ghee and cotton bud. I think this was Gajan=
an 
Maharaj, I may have the wrong name, but they are very authentic
Datta f=
ollowers and that lineage.

In the south also Swami Ganapati Sachidanandji =
again a Datta Avatar 
has been doing homans for many decades.

There may be=
 more involved in Homam for many decades too, I am sure 
many people can ad=
d to this list.

I wanted to do homan for a long time but I had no clue and=
 some 
months back I saw Narashima's manual and I did a few myself too.

Be=
st Regards
Mitesh
