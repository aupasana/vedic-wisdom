            There is a contraversy in this matter (calculations) is that so=
me one say  that the calculation is showing in lacks of years, and in other=
 one is showing in Thousnds, which is correct one? Don't keep us in dark an=

There is no definite meaning of Yuga. Yuga=
 means 2.
But it can even mean 5, 10 or a period of hundreds or even thousa=
nds
of years. Hence while dealing with yuga system, it is better to follow
=
the other tradition, which defines yugas according to how a country
is bein=
g ruled.
If the king rules the country according to Dharma 100%, then it is=

Satyayug. If he rules by 75% Dharma, it is Tretayug, if by 50% Dharma,
it =
is Dwaparyug and if he rules by only 25% Dharma, it is Kaliyug.
This surely=
 means that we are living in Kaliyug now because nobody 
will say that we a=
re being ruled by 100 or even 75% Dharma.
