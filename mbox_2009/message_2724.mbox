Dear Narasimhaji,

 What exactly is your proof that effacing of tattwas/cha=
kras must be pursued in serial order? The well known Pt. Gopi Krishna, who =
only meditated on Sahasrara (crown of his head) had the experience appended=
 below, please read if you havent seen it earlier. Also what is your proof =
that meditating on a chakra effaces it - this is not obvious - why might it=
 not intensify it while purifying it? Is there any definitive text on Kunda=
lini (Sat cakra nirupana is just too broad and symbolic for me)..

Regards,=


Sundeep

Gopi Krishna:
"Over a period of years, he developed the ability =
to sit for a period of hours in concentration without any discomfort. The f=
ollowing account which took place in 1937 describes his first Kundalini exp=
erience which occurred while he was visualizing "an imaginary Lotus in full=
 bloom, radiating light" at the crown of his head.

    Suddenly, with a ro=
ar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my br=
ain through the spinal cord.

    Entirely unprepared for such a developmen=
t, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining my self-control, keepi=
ng my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination grew brighter an=
d brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then =
felt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light.=
 It is impossible to describe the experience accurately. I felt the point o=
f consciousness that was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light.=
 It grew wider and wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the im=
mediate object of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distanc=
e until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness wi=
thout any outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any fee=
ling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light simult=
aneously conscious and aware at every point, spread out, as it were, in all=
 directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no longer my=
self, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small poi=
nt of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle of consci=
ousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state o=
f exultation and happiness impossible to describe.

, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 19=
92), pps. 6-7 "


>  
> When one thinks of "I", one perhaps thinks of a bod=
y that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physi=
cal aspect, one may think of "I" as someone who has certain qualities, cert=
ain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one=
 is, form one's self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness=
. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid*=
 in nature within one's cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. K=
undalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid*=
 or *fluid* in nature within one's cumulative idea of who one is is still r=
emaining. And so on.
>  
> Many people who talk about experiences of Kundal=
ini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus =
flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *n=
ot* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves =
Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions=
 of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each ele=
ment is effaced in one's cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as =
well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one elemen=
t (earth) from one's notion of self ("I"), even for a short duration of tim=
e, is not at all easy.
>  
> The order in which elements are effaced as one=
 progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kund=
alini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse orde=
r - ether, air, fire, water and earth.
