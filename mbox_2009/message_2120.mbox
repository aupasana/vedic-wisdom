Namaste,

clarifying a small mistake in my message - i *used to* turn it up=
side down in the past when i was placing the pieces with white portion up. =
now that is not needed most of the times.

int out one prime cause here. It has been observed that if you place coconu=
t pieces where white portion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then the=
re are all the chances that pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal=
 experience. so i can suggest few things as under:
