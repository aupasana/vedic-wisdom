Namaste Vijay,

Few things came to my mind after reading your message.

* Y=
our intentions were right. i.e. you wanted your son to stay focussed in the=
 Puja hence you moved the Shiva Linga

* If you lifted the Linga without ha=
ving any sense of presence of Shiva then i think your own faith of invokati=
on was lesser. This seems to be the case for many of us or Most of us. We i=
nvoke the deity in the Fire and Idol but then the prsence is forgotten.

* =
Same goes for reusing of Water for Abhisheka. it gives that we didn't care =
much for Shiva.

But It is your own good heart which immediately realised t=
he error and provocated the thought of doubt. it was such a strong feeling =
that you wrote to the list. that shows your concern about the whole issue.
=

In my opinion, both the points mentioned needs to be avoided hence forth. =
Though i feel Shiva is easy going and Bhole Baba who is reputed for not tak=
ing offense for such trivial issues.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
