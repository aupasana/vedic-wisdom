Sadhe Saati 
Pt. Anand Sagar Pathak
Saturn which have been criticised, ridi=
culed and condemned for ages for the suffering it bestows on mankind is mov=
ing ahead and is about to enter Cancer sign on 6th September 2004. 
What do=
es it mean? What lies ahead? This will be the common concern for everybody.=
 
Does this Saturn affect everybody in the same way or it will affect diffe=
rent person differently. The real analysis of life shows that the concerns =
for people are the same irrespective of their social status. The problems a=
re linked with family, relations family and social security. However, Let's=
 understand how this transit will affect different rashis. Here by rashis w=
e mean moon sign.
Normally, when we take Saturn there are two dreaded trans=
its of Saturn namely Sadhe Saati and Kantaka Shani (Dhaiya).
It is a known =
fact that Saturn remains in a sign for approximately 2 and half years Sadhe=
 Saati means 7 and half. This period starts when Saturn enters into the 12t=
h house from moon and ends when it leaves the second house from Moon. Kanta=
ka Shani starts when Saturn is placed in the 4th and the 8th house from the=
 Moon. Some astrologers include 10th house in the ambit of Dhaiya. 
Aries: =
This transit will start the period of Kantaka shani . There can be some dis=
turbance in the domestic life.There can be some shifts and change in reside=
nce as well. 
Taurus: This will end the period of Sadhe Saati on them this =
will bring in lots of relief to the natives having Taurus moon sign. This w=
ill slowly ease out there problems. 
Gemini: This will start the last phase=
 of Sadhe Saati for you. Though, there shall be some respite but still fina=
nces shall cause lots of concern. 
Cancer: Saturn is going to transit over =
your natal moon. There shall be increase in depression and mental tensions =
during this period. Some career related concern may crop up.
Leo: This will=
 start the period of Sadhe Saati for you. There shall be sudden increase in=
 your expenditure. For some this may mean some change in residence or forei=
gn travel. 
Virgo: There shall be gains for you. This is to prove that tran=
sit of Saturn is not always bad. There shall be lots of financial gains for=
 you as well. 
Libra: The period will bring some anxious moments for your p=
rofession. There can be some career related frustrations as well. There can=
 be some discomfort in your domestic setup as well. 
Scorpio: This will bri=
ng in lots of relief for you as the period of Astam Shani will finally be o=
ver for you. There shall be gains from authorities. Some of you may be cont=
emplating foreign travel as well.
Sagittarius: There can be some disturbanc=
e in your life during this period. You should take special care towards you=
r health during this period. Career may suffer during this period. 
Caprico=
rn: There is a possibility of marriage for eligible bachelors. Professional=
ly, your period will be smooth. However, you have to really sweat a lot to =
get good results.
Aquarius: This will bring in lots of respite for you. Thi=
s transit will give you an edge over opponents. You will be able to repay y=
our debts. Professionally, the time is favourable. However, health wise the=
 time is not all that conducive. 
Pisces: This will end the period of Kanta=
ka Shani for you. Overall, this is an improvement in your life in general. =
This also means that there shall be some relaxation coming in your way afte=
r a 


Kantaka Sani means Saturn behaving like a thorn in the leg and the p=
erson has to limp in all activities of life. Profession/Career is hampered =
and finances dwindle. The transit of Saturn in the 1st, 4th, 8th and 10th s=
igns either from Lagna, Arudha Lagna or the Moon sign cause Kantaka Sani to=
 operate. 
When it happens: 
1) With respect to Lagna, the person makes wro=
ng decisions and suffer due to that Lagna is our intelligence, our Dhi. 
2)=
 With respect to the AL, the career and finances are greatly affected becau=
se Arudha lagna is shoving how society perceiving us. It is like reaction t=
oward the world, how you surround with the world. 
3) From Chandra, the per=
son suffers physically and emotionally because Chandra is our Manas and als=
o represents the Sharira (body). 
When Shani is placed on Lagna, he is in M=
arana Karaka Sthana and it will destroy person's intelligence. When he tran=
sit forth house the cure will be denied because the fourth house is the hou=
se of healing. Shani in eight houses couses lot of transformation of the bo=
dy. It is good for the healt. During that time is horrible, but after is ve=
ry good. It is like in story about Kurma Avatara and the time when Devas ar=
e turning of the ocean. That is what's happend when Shani trasits eight hou=
se. Lot of poison will come up but Amrita will also came in the end. So whe=
n Shani is in eight house it couses all this problem in the body, and if th=
e body if not strong person could die during that time. From there he aspec=
ts second house cousing bad food come into the body and a person eating wro=
ngly and it is aspecitng fifth house, person is doing wrong mantras and he =
aspects the tenth house, that is what is Kantak Shani. It is when he aspect=
s tenth house. Then the persons Karma yoga is destroyed. That is why it is =
worst transit. It is damaging all these other places and damaging the Karma=
 yoga.
