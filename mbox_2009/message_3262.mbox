Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
I do not think that Saint like 'Tulasi Das' would ever b=
e so hard on women. 
The actual poem is like this:
|| Dhol Ganwaar Shudra P=
ashu Naari, Yah sab Taadan ke adhikari ||
Some years back, i read an explan=
ation that Tulasi Das ji meant "Pashu Naari" and NOT pashu and Naari. It me=
ans He feels appropriate to punish a Naari who is like pashu in her charact=
eristics.=C2=A0That really makes good sense atleast to me.
=C2=A0
I am no o=
ne to comment on an accepted saint like Sri Tulasidasji's spiritual level, =
but that sentence definitely looks like he clubbed "pashu" and "naari" in s=
ame category, not pashu-nari. The highlighting is done by you, not in the a=
ctual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic grammer to=
 remove confusion. He did not. At the level of text, it is indefensible. Al=
so, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari who are pashu, why not Nara=
s who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in=
 the world.=C2=A0This explanation=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a ba=
ck engineering job to bail out.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Regarding Rama self realizati=
on, I think I was unable to express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me =
try again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized ma=
n. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says =
is that, (his opinion)=C2=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be =
worshipped. He descended in order to lead by example. That is why the text =
is called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. On=
e of principles.=C2=A0 Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Ma=
habharata, which was not named "Krishna+ayana". One cannot follow Krishna's=
 path. 
=C2=A0
Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama=
, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshippe=
r and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama d=
id. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man=
, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a life.
=
An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the life of=
 a great man.
=C2=A0
Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one sh=
ould try to become like Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth t=
o be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a =
self realized=C2=A0saint of highest calibre, but his life's image is like=
=C2=A0one who=C2=A0lived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C2=A0men, fear=
less and uncompromising and principled. If every=C2=A0person would constant=
ly think that Vivekanada was a saint=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deit=
y or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C2=A0=
no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C2=A0emulate his =
way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C2=A0the image he proje=
cted was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. 
=
=C2=A0
=C2=A0On the other hand=C2=A0you will never hear anyone advising tha=
t one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C2=A0=C2=A0That is imposs=
ible. He=C2=A0 was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Simil=
ar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C2=A0Ramachandra incomparison to =
Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but one can never=C2=A0become K=
rishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama as a Go=
d to be worshipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.
=C2=A0

Hope I have put forth=C2=A0his idea clear.

About L=
ust in Tulasi das: It is well known that Tulasi Das=C2=A0was extremely atta=

 home for a day. However he left the sansaara=C2=A0in a Flash.=C2=A0 in a=

Utpal

s that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather th=
an worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He=
 could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right=
 from the place where he was=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the new=
s of Sita's abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard wa=
y of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more imp=
ortant to emulate Rama's ideas than to worship Rama.
> =C3=82=C2=A0

 considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of lang=
auges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author's paradise (si=

so, there is a line in there which equates women with animals or something =
similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had =
a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sent=
ence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped=
 as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there =
to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Kri=
shna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than=
 Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.

 school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than En=

<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>I am no one to comment on an accepted saint like Sri Tula=
sidasji's spiritual level, but that sentence definitely looks like he clubb=
ed "pashu" and "naari" in same category, not pashu-nari. The highlighting i=
s done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have=
 used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the level of t=
ext, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari =
who are pashu, why not Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of =
Pashu nature than Naaris in the world. This explanation  that you=
 found looks more like a back engineering job to bail out.</DIV>
<DIV> =
;</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Regarding Rama self realization, I think I w=
as unable to express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He i=
s not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he qu=
ite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his o=
pinion) God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He =
descended in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+=
ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles=
.  Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, whic=
h was not named "Krishna+ayana". One cannot follow Krishna's path. </DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to S=
ri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the wo=
rshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like=
 Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a no=
bel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a=
 life.</DIV>
<DIV>An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can =
follow the life of a great man.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Similarly, eve=
n today lot of people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda=
, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future=
. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized saint of highest=
 calibre, but his life's image is like one who lived like a lion =
among sheep of ordinary men, fearless and uncompromising and principle=
d. If every person would constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint&=
nbsp;who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spirituality =
or the blessing of a great guru, no one will ever make an attempt to b=
e inspired by him or emulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spirit=
ual giant, but the image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless =
KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> On =
the other hand you will never hear anyone advising that one should try=
 to lead a life like Ramarkishna.  That is impossible. He  w=
as God incarnate leading a charmed life. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri Ramachandra incomparis=
on to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but one can never be=
come Krishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama a=
s a God to be worshipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.</=

<BR>> 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a spir=
itual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82 - but his personal opinion
 =
is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather t=
han worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. H=
e could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, righ=
t from the place where he was=C3=82 located when he first heard the ne=
ws of Sita's abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard w=

BR>> 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodge=
podge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author's=
 paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics =
nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with animals =
or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because T=
ulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up
 co=
mposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama=
 is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri R=

re=C3=82 about his spiritual life=C3=82 that I know, let me say=
=C3=82 line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him =
about two years back. What first attracted me to=C3=82  towards him wa=

to=C3=82 honestly.=C3=82 If someone were to put a gun to his head=
 and ask him
 to just say a simple, harmless=C3=82 lie, like sun rises=
 in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too=
! He has actually never ever=C3=82 spoken even a single lie in his who=
le life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him=
 that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher. La=
ter someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the wo=
rld cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself t=
wo thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every d=
ay he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and<BR>> one hour re=
ading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=82 up volumes of Hind=
i and English literature.=C3=82 When I asked him why, he just said it =
is because he wanted to be=C3=82 equally adept at both the languages s=
o that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=
=C3=82 which is more
 comprehensive language! As I said, he has an unc=
ompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything.=
 By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different field=
s, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in mos=
t places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, San=
skrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetr=
y in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself=
 an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for rel=
igion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that =
blank space, he asked<BR>> my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the c=
lerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk=
 and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and =
writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&=
gt; So this gives a
 basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friend=
s, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&=
gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His=
 way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=82&nb=
sp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He s=
ays he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That =
was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in =
the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked th=
e priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just st=
ayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow =
felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He=
 remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&g=
t; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82 that he =
got visions etc of Krishna.
 He does not say much about these, infact most =
people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=
hi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=
ce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82  Only his wife and=
 close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he =
sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone aske=
d him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole uni=
verse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, th=
e animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller th=
an the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=
=C3=82 He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=82 Lord Rama to =
be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because =
he thinks it elevated Sri=C3=82 Rama to the<BR>> level of a God whe=
reas the aim of the orginal Valmiki
 Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an id=
eal man,=C3=82 not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man =
is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to becom=
e like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot =
become Krishna, but one=C3=82 can try to lead his life like Rama. I ha=
ve argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he doe=
s not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust =
most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.<BR>&=
gt; =C3=82 <BR>> Later he had once=C3=82 mentioned he knew the=
 relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His moth=
