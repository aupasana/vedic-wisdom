Respected Sir,
=A0
I was initially reluctant on asking that question on how=
 to put off the fire. But I am so glad I did. Thanks=A0Sir, for helping me =
get some very=A0important facts clear. I will meditate on god till the fire=
 keeps burning.=A0 
I would like to thank Narayan and Vijay also for taking=
 time and providing me with very useful tips and explaining every=A0details=
 of do's and dont's while performing the havan.=A0During summer I do have p=
lans of doing the homam outside. Hence Vijay, your next post as to how to p=
erform homam in open space also has answered lot of my questions. My next c=
oncern was would it be bad if the fire goes off in the middle but you have =
cleared that also very nice explanation indeed.=A0These tips would be very =
helpful for beginners like me.
=A0
Under all your kind guidance and god's b=
lessing hopefully=A0I should be able to perform my homam successfully. 
=A0=

With Best Regards,

Sudha,

Narayan has already replied, =
but I thought I will add my two cents:

1. Normally, fire alarm is not pres=
ent in every room. If so, sit in a room that does not have fire alarm, clos=
e the door, open the window and go on to do the homam. If you are getting s=
moke, you can consider dropping a towel near the closed door

2. Take small=
er pieces of dry coconus - may be 1.5 to 2 inc in size (take a dry coconut =
half and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. That will be small enough to keep the smok=
e level low.

3. After the homam is over and the burnt dry coconut pieces c=
ool down, remove them and try to keep the homakundam clean. The pieces even=
 though are burnt, will catch fire if you keep them in the homakundam, and =
they will generate higher levels of smoke. So, keep it clean.

4. Keep marm=
aya, and pelalu (these are like pop-corn but in a smaller size and devoid o=
f oil etc). They are very effective in burning with out much smoke

5. I pu=
rchased a window exhaust fab ($20-40 in Wallmart), and kept in my window. T=
he amount of smoke during the homam is not too much if you keep the ghee le=
vel and the size of dry coconut pieces small. How ever, after the fire goes=
 off, there will be some smoke. The exhaust will help in sending this out. =
How ever, you can move the homakundam out.

6. I purchased 2 bricks from Ho=
medeopt and kept my Homakundam on them so that carpet does not get the heat=


7. I also bought a terpentine (also found in Wallmart for about $15 in tr=
ekking related ile - it is used to make tents. I used to put it first and t=
hen bricks and then the homamkundam. This helped my ensure that carpent did=
 not get any strains.

8. Initially I was very skeptic about the fire alarm=
, but, the day I started (with window exhaust fan), I was relieved and neve=
r bothered again.

9. Narayan's tip about keeping the lights at night is go=
od. But, Candles are normal and if you keep the window blinders for the are=
a above the window exhaust, the light will not be so much for the out sider=
s and will be similar to a bright candle if your fire size is small.

10. R=
avi Poruri has a beautiful set up at home. I request Ravi to photo the arra=
ngement and put for the benefit of the public.

Best regards,
Vijay
