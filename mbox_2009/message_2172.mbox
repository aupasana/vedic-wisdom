dual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we se=

non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.

ne needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized conscious=

ich are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably halt=
ed. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization.=
 This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefits=
, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for spi=
ritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse i=
s much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any deit=
y during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.
