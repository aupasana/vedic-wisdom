Sri Narasimha Garu,
=A0
Namaskaram.
=A0
May i request you, if possible to k=
indly create Shirdi Sai Baba Homam or atleast give me some guidance on the =
steps to perform this homam.
=A0
I have been everyday doing Sri Mahaganapat=
hi homam for almost 10 months now. But i'm drawn more towards Sai Baba sinc=
e my childhood and everytime i read a mantra on any god my natural tendency=
 is to look for the form of Sai Baba in my mind. 
=A0
I remeber your advise=
 given earlier to me that its fine to think about any god we like even if w=
e perform a ritual with some other dieties's mantra, but it seems little ha=
rd to me and i'm just caught in perhaps some confusion. After readding Sri =
Manish Pundit's email on the mantra and the image it forms in our subtle bo=
dies, i thought to check with you if it is better to do Sai baba homama ins=
tead of ganapathi homam?
=A0
Also, I have read you research work on the Ish=
ta devata identification using D20. I have my AK (using Jaganath Ayanamsa) =
as =A0Mars, in D20 Ma is placed in Pi, with 12th house Aq having occupied b=
y Sa himself (within the longitudes as you ahve mentioned in yor work). Aq =
has Rashi drishti containing planets JU, VE, RA & KE. Can you kindly sugges=
t which homam would suit me better for my spiritual advancement.
=A0
Please=
 forgive me if you consider this astrology question is inappropriate in thi=
s forum.
=A0
Thank you
KK
=A0
P.S. I take this opportunity to greet all meb=
ers of this forum a Very Happy Navratri and paray the lord to bless all us =
with his grace.
