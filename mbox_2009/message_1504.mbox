 While we eagerly wait for a formal document on the potent Vishnu Sahasrana=
ma Homa Prayoga manual from Shri Narasimha, 
> I wonder why we cannot do it=
 based on  the text itself. Namely, the Sahasranama already has the Dhyana =
Sloka and other preliminaries which are by now very well known to most of u=
s. So isn't it a simple matter of using these, doing the prana prathistha o=
f Lord Narayana or Lord Krishna and then using each verse for one offering =
to the fire?

  Namaskaram, 
   As you said prana prathistah  of  "Narayan" for Homa ever=
y day, i didn't  read  anywhere, But  i know that starting  day of "Uttaray=
an" that is the next day of Makara Sankranti, 13th or 14th  of January of e=
very year, "The Narayana yagnam" is conducting by DR.Vedavyas, at Rajahmund=
ry, duddukuru venkateswara swamy temple past 45 years, i had listened that =
many mircles happened, i too tried to attend the yagna, but its not happene=
d, 
But i am doing HOMA or YAGNA every day morning and evening starts at 5A=
M and 5PM. That i feel my stomach is homa gund, and reading vishnu shasrana=
mas along with purva phittika and uttara phittika for the time of 29mint 30=
 sec. say exact 30mint, and i go to Dhyana with "Asthaksari mantra" as long=
 as i concentrate, cause i can not move my hands and lggs, and  i am a bedr=
idden, they are not in my control, only i can move my hand fingers. All i d=
o this on my bed only, i don't know its correct or not? If any thing wrong =
in this please let me know.
In my search of learning of Astrology i found G=
uru Narasimha ji, and i convinced his teachings of Astrology,
And i request=
 you to tell me about "Vishnu sahasra nama prayoga HOMA"

Thanking YOU all.=

Namaskaram Narasimha ji,
