Sir,

I have some questions pertaining to Shraddha Tithi.

1.Generally as =
per our Hindu Shastras, Tithi is to be counted from one
sunrise to next sun=
rise. There remains a big controversy in this
decision. Sometimes it happen=
s that Tithi is changed after few hours
from sunrise as per Sun Moon distan=
ce. I will give one example. My
mother expired in 1999 on Ashtami tithi as =
per calendar. This tithi was
upto 5-35 evening as per real calculation of S=
un Moon distance. My
mother expired at 23.25 hours at night on Ashtami tith=
i when actually
Navami tithi was started from 5.35 hours. Which day I shoul=
d fix for
Shraddha and death anniversary ? Ashtami or Navami ? ( I am doing=

Shraddham on Navami ).

2.Some say that Tithi of actual death moment shoul=
d be taken for
Shraddha day and one openion is that Day of funeral ceremony=
 should be
taken as Shraddha day. If one expires on Saptami late evening an=
d if
funeral is done on Ashtami morning, Ashtami should be taken as Shraddh=
a
Tithi. But I am not convinced with this second openion as sometimes
funer=
al is done after so many days, how this funeral day is acceptable?

Kindly =
give some light on these confusions.  Regards.

Ashwin Rawal
