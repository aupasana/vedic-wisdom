Namaste Friends,

wish you all a happy Raksha Bandhan - Naliyeri (Coconut) =
Purnima ! and also the Eclipse which round the orner.

quickly wish to poin=
t out that if a Coconut half used as Purnaahuti (Final offering symbolic of=
 ego) is placed like a CAP (white portion remains inside and not visible), =
it burns *very* brilliantly and the burning is *COMPLETE*. i am doing this =
for a week and observed that not only the purnaahuti ofering, it helps in c=
omplete burning of everything in the Havan Kunda.

jst thought of sharing w=
ith you all.

Best Regards,

Utpal
