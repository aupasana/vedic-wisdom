Namaste,
 
Swaahaa does not require fire or incense stick. Though swaahaa i=
s added to various mantras when offering them in fire, there are also some =
mantras that end in swaahaa by default. A simple internal japa of a mantra =
ending naturally in swaahaa is possible. Examples are "om sreem hreem kleem=
 glaum gam ganapataye varavarada sarvajanam me vashamaanaya swaahaa" and "k=
leem krishnaaya govindaaya gopijana vallabhaaya swaahaa".
 
Just try to sur=
render the ego to the deity.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Respected Narshimhaji,

  namaskara/pranam.

  Once again=
 you have given us knowledge regarding Mantra shastra. based on the simple =
explanation of the prefixes and suffixes it is now clear on basic significa=
nce of any mantra. Also I conclude from this that any mantra ending in "swa=
ha" should be always be done with a "deepak" and "incense stick" as a bare =
minimum offering to the deity (please correct me if I am mistaken)

            Namaste,

            Namah sim=
ply refers to bowing to a deity.

            Swaahaa is from the word su. =
It refers to hailing a deity and surrendering to the deity. It is used when=
 making offerings to various deities.

            Swadhaa is from the root=
 swad, which means to taste and fulfill a desire. It is used when making of=
ferings to pitris (ancestors), who have strong unfilfilled desires.

      =
      Vashat is from the root vash, which means to control and command. It =
is used when one wants to control the energy and channelize it.

          =
  Hum refers to creating a cover. It is used when seeking a protective cove=
r of some nature.

            Vaushat is also like vashat. It is used when=
 one wants control over one's vision and observation.

            Phat is =
the sound of leaving an arrow. It is used when seeking something specific a=
nd leaving a mantra towards the target like an arrow.

            Some man=
tras ending in phat also have a hum and end with "hum phat". It is used whe=
n one seeks to strike a target while protecting self.

            Mantras =
ending in Vashat and Phat should be used carefully. They are inappropriate =
for most people in this age.

            *        *        *

            =
BTW, do not write phat as fatt. The sound "f" (as in "fan") does NOT exist =
in Sanskrit. It came to Indian languages through the Arabic influence on Hi=
ndi and now many Indians get confused between ph and f. The sound ph in San=
skrit words such as phat and phala is pronounced as a strongly aspirated p.=
 It is not pronounced as f in fan.

            Best regards,

           Dear Narsimhaji,
              Certain Mantras are ending with N=
amah
              Certain ending with Swaha
              Certain with Vas=
hat, some with Vaushat, some with Hum and some with Fatt.
              Sir=
, I would like to know in details as to what is the real meaning of each wo=
rd.  What they indicate? When they should be uttered?
              It is g=
eneral belief that Swaha is used only for Homam. But it is not so as certai=
n Mantras are ending with Swaha.   e.g. --Aum Hram Hrim Hraum Sah Suryaya S=
waha.-- Even in Tarpanam we are using Swaha. - Aum Tarpayami Swaha, Gam Tar=
payami Swaha, Glaum Tarpayami Swaha and like. 
              Your valuable =
comments will enrich our knowledge.

2>BTW, do not write phat as fatt. The 
            sound "f" (as in "fan") =
does NOT exist in Sanskrit. It came to 
            Indian languages throug=
h the Arabic influence on Hindi and now many 
            Indians get confu=
sed between ph and f. The sound ph in Sanskrit 
            words such as p=
hat and phala is pronounced as a 
            strongly aspirated p. It=
 is not pronounced as f in 
            fan.</FONT></DIV>
