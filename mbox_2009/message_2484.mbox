Sri Narasimha garu & Narayan garu,
=A0
Namaskaram.
=A0
"Thus, allowing eve=
ryone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficie=
nt at best and disastrous at worst"
=A0
I was little taken aback by this st=
atement of your's,=A0because when is sit to do Homam, my mother and my 2 yr=
 old son would join me (90% of the times)=A0and i have encouraged them to o=
ffer some sesame seeds along with me in the Homam while i read the Atharvas=
eersham.
=A0
I was always under the thought process that, i'm doing Homam a=
nd they=A0are sitting with me and doing some seva to god along with me. But=
 after reading your e-mail=A0i'm in doubt whether should i ask them to stop=
 offering in the fire? 
=A0
It is clear from your earlier e-mail about the =
answer, but somehow i'm not very comfortable with that statement as my thou=
ght process is still like, God has come to my place and everyone of us are =
serving him (as you have put that like in case of an Idol).=A0Just wanted t=
o just double check with you.
=A0
As an alternative, can they offer some fl=
owers and some Sandal paste/Turmeric etc to the Idol that we place along wi=
th the Homam instead of offering anything in the fire? or does they (mother=
 oly :) ) has to perform the ritual independently all by herself and do not=
 offer anything while i perform my ritual.
=A0
Please clarify.
=A0
Thanks a=
nd Regards
KK

Namaste,

(1) Namboodiris are (or atleast used to be) adepts=
 in fire worship. What this namboodiri did is the correct way.

Visualize t=
he external fire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it=
 will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong =
your identification is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone hand=
les that external fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submit=
ted by that person to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of=
 karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like=
 husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on =
karmas from the entire world if you are ready and willing to face their con=
sequences, but a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the k=
armas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one's ego becomes very s=
ubtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequence=
s. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small=
 plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very
 big, it can give=
 flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, ke=
ep working to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental =
conditioning) caused by them.

But some people use fire in the same way an =
idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle th=
e fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one's i=
nternal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. How=
ever, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not understand much =
about fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire =
is practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as m=
uch as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offeri=
ngs into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.

The =
best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you mak=
e offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (b=
hootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a str=
ong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will b=
ecome strong and burn various vaasanas.

(2) There are different methods fo=
r beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usuall=
y standard. Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or =
what you are more attracted to.

As I said many times, these nyaasas are ju=
st formality for most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part ha=
s a higher significance than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a=
 specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after =
one makes sufficient progress in purifying one's subtle perception. So ther=
e is no point in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you=
 that this will not block you.

(3) They should be shown in the video. If y=
ou cannot get them, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra.=
 It will not block you.

Best regards,
Narasimha
