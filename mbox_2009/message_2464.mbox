I would also like to add that I was able to reduce the time by practicing i=
t regularly and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaush=
ik's Durga Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has a=
 great voice, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can pause and r=
epeat it. I tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast for=
 my liking.
