they have the sudarsana kriya which is a breathing exercise to clean the nadis i think
i paid rs 600 and learnt it 
they are keeping it secret ?
after sudarana kriya they ask to lie idle but does it lead to yoga nithra? (find yourself)
anyway it purifies nadies and removes some deadlocks (my intution tells but check yourself)
it may also cure some diseases (AOL claim it cures even cancer) as it does some mystical circulation of prana from my personal experience
so to learn sudarsana kriya you can join them it is worth it
I do lot of hatha yoga and inspite of that
I had a strange disease and i did a homam to ask god to guide me to find a way out
the next week my wife forced me to join this course and i am beginning to feel better
so it is worth it
thanks
