Dear Utpal and others,
=C2=A0
This discussion about debates etc reminds me =
of an incident I had read about in the life of Sri Ramakrishna.
=C2=A0
Ther=
e was a tantrik scholar of great repute in Calcutta named Gauri. The brahma=
ni - who was Thakur's guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussion o=
n the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous debate=
r and a sadhaka=C2=A0who never lost any debate. 
Plus Thakur used to say th=
at Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa of Ma Kali by st=
retching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C2=A0arm, lighting it a=
nd then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa would last for an h=
our or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still all this while.=
 
=C2=A0
He had a certain siddhi in the use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtu=
e of which one could never win in a debate=C2=A0against him. Plus he had a =
deep, resounding voice which Ramakrishna described as the "rumbling of clou=
ds".
=C2=A0
When Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw th=
e Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that tim=
e was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna starte=
d saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that G=
auri could hear. Gauri, on being thus challanged=C2=A0started shouting the =
mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given h=
im a divine voice and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He=
 roared again=C2=A0but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri r=
ealized he has lost his voice. And his siddhi too! 
=C2=A0
At first he was =
furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. Fin=
ally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of whose power do =
Avatars come down on earth. 
=C2=A0
Later one day Gauri came to Ramakrishna=
 asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. He quit debating and went away fr=
om that place, promising that he would not return untill he realized the Se=
lf. Thakur also blessed him according.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
That is the effect of =
Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a village in west bengal, who p=
robably could not even sign his own name.

Dear Kishnendu,

I beg pardon for my reply to your message addressed to Siv=
a.

> One more thing friend spirituality is not a subject of debate or >dis=
cussion but OF REALISATION as i feel.

It is not inappropriate to debate an=
d discuss even in the matter of Spirituality occasionally. Realization may =
be the final thing but on the way, the journey is invariably subjected to m=
any such things like intellectual debate, discussions, various sadhanaas et=
c... Adi Shankaracharya and Swami Vivekananda, for instance, debated a lot =
on the subject.

>If you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONLY=
 and ONLY >your GURU.

That unshakable and blind faith without complete und=
erstanding of GURU's motives or anybody or any book or anything is NO FAITH=
 really but source of the mass production of Fanatics. The real faith also =
needs to be earned after a lot of struggle.

Swami Vivekananda has said in =
one of his works which means that in every sect, immature Bhaktas are the r=
eal recruit which can be easily molded in to the fanaticism.

I know one su=
ch Fanatic. He said that so and so person was saved in the Mumbai Train Bla=
st even when he was in the same train because he was a devotee of Art of Li=
ving. The others died......

I know another fanatic who says that Krishna i=
s the only supreme God and if somebody is praying to Shiva, he is ignorant =
and fool. He must pray directly to the supreme God and not the lesser Gods.=
....

Another class of Fanatics believes in total that all the others who d=
on't believe in Islam will go to hell....and same class in another faith be=
lieves that Jesus is the ONLY savior. 

And the Joke is that they are all s=
o called Faithful (Actually it's an abuse to the real meaning of Faith).

B=
est Regards,

Utpal

Let me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a f=
ully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of=
 guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having t=
o be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I mysel=
f had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other =
ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master i=
s essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri's elaborate=
 and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to gui=
de disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be es=
tablished.

<table cellspacing=3D"0" cellpadding=3D"0" border=3D"0" ><tr><td valign=3D"=
top" style=3D"font: inherit;"><DIV>Dear Utpal and others,</DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>This discussion about debates etc reminds me of an incident I h=
ad read about in the life of Sri Ramakrishna.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
There was a tantrik scholar of great repute in Calcutta named Gauri. The br=
ahmani - who was Thakur's guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussi=
on on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous de=
bater and a sadhaka who never lost any debate. </DIV>
<DIV>Plus Thakur=
 used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa o=
f Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare arm=
, lighting it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa woul=
d last for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still =
all this while. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>He had a certain siddhi in th=
e use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a de=
bate against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakrish=
na described as the "rumbling of clouds".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>When=
 Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, h=
e started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out=
 of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that sp=
ecific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear.=
 Gauri, on being thus challanged started shouting the mantra even loud=
ed. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given him a divine voic=
e and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again&nb=
sp;but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has l=
ost his voice. And his siddhi too! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>At first h=
e was furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishn=
a. Finally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of whose pow=
er do Avatars come down on earth. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Later one d=
ay Gauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. He qu=
it debating and went away from that place, promising that he would not retu=
rn untill he realized the Self. Thakur also blessed him according.</DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>That is the effect of Ramakrishna, w=
ho was born and brought up in a village in west bengal, who probably could =
not even sign his own name.</DIV>

where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus) come for discour=

 is such an obvious contrast.<BR>> > after that first lecture, i watc=

 spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fanatic =
and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate at th=
e same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated on t=
he issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him tha=
t does he really believe that other religions and faith are also true. I mu=

 The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To h=
im Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realizat=
ion of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else=
. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. O=
therwise he would say some polite words and let it pass, however big the oc=
casion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting were =
answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourse=
s year ago!<BR>> > > > > <BR>> > > > > One ma=
y ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of t=
he meeting was something like "Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam". IMHO,=
 Sri Sri did justice to the topic by "BEING" an embodiment of the very thin=
g that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were

 A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen.

a great privilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living=

w when Sri Sri choses to accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he does n=

of the religion - Hinduism. And when he fails miserably on stage, it become=
