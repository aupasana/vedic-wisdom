Namaste


I have a basic doubt about the Gayatri Mantra.

In some cases I f=
ind the Gayatri Mantra starting from "Om Tat savitur..." and in some cases =
it starts with "Om Bhur Bhuvah Swah..".

What is the difference between the=
 two? Which one of the two should be chanted normally?

Also, does the Gaya=
tri mantra end with OM? 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
