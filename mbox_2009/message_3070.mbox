 Devotee: "How can one recognize a holy man?"

Rama Krishna: "He who has su=
rrendered his body, mind, and innermost self to
God is surely a holy man. H=
e who has renounced 'woman and gold' is surely a
holy man. He is a holy man=
 who does not regard woman with the eyes of a
worldly person. He never forg=
ets to look upon a woman as his mother, and to
offer her his worship if he =
happens to be near her.

The holy man constantly thinks of God and does not=
 indulge in any talk
except about spiritual things. Furthermore, he serves =
all beings, knowing
that God resides in everybody's heart. These, in genera=
l, are the signs of a
holy man."
