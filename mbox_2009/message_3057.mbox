Dear Narsimha-ji and others,
 
I have a query regarding the Pitra Tarpana t=
hat I have been performing everyday for more than a month now. I do this ev=
eryday around 10-15 minutes after sunrise time (with a lot of sincerity and=
 involving my thoughts/mind - but unfortunately not(yet!) with the proper m=
antras etc). And I admit, I DO feel more at peace (and blessed) than I felt=
 before.

I stand in the balcony, facing south, and pour the water(+the bla=
ck sesame seeds) in a small structure filled with mud/sand, and has a plant=
 growing in it. Few minutes after I am done (sometimes immediately), a pair=
 of doves(not white, but grey like pigeons) land on that spot and start eat=
ing the black sesame seeds. I have a feeling that only one of the two doves=
 is eating the black sesame seeds regularly, while the other one is a silen=
t companion at most times. However, my question is that sometimes I begin t=
o wonder if this 'bird-eating-the-offering' is the 'right' phenomenon? What=
 could it possibly symbolise? 

I do not wish to discuss astrology, but som=
ehow my second query is associated with it. My sincere apologies if this is=
 inapt. Someone recently told me that because I have a gandanta moola(kumbh=
a rasi) dosha in my chart - homam/tarpana etc would not yield ANY results -=
 even though a proper shanti homam was performed 27 days after my birth. I =
dont think I am discouraged and would stop the homam/tarpana - but if you c=
ould help remove this 'very-slightly-disturbing-thought' that I have in my =
mind, I would really really be obliged. 

Thanking you for your guidance an=
d support !

Kind regards
Sharad
