This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like waking up *within=
* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja sa=
madhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake.

Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 These states seem to be due to Nirgun Brahman. Personally I be=
lieve there are other states of similar nature due to Sagun Brahman. And th=
ere is Deep Grace and Love and Beauty and Fragrance to name a few, are invo=
lved here. It is difficult for me to give them any name so I will describe =
them in brief.

When Divine Father appears in a normal waking state and phy=
sical eyes perceive Him, one goes in to a mindless bewilderment of astonish=
ment and deep happiness.

When Divine Mother appears and the Light from Her=
 Aura has penetrated ones head /skull, senses become totally numb. Yet one =
is fully awake with physical. eyes open. If She would allow=A0 more Light, =
one would faint but She stops it before it happens.
And these states can no=
t be easily describe in words although there are subject and object.=A0 Nir=
verkalpa cannot be described. I do not know how savikalpa or sahaja feels l=
ike, so I cannot compare them.

Is it sill a dream??=A0 Yes, because one is=
 somehow going about his daily business as usual. Pain and arguments and ot=
her tension of life.

Is it still a dream?? No, because certain things have=
 changed completely. DivineBeloveds and their Bliss are EverPresent.

Some =
lucky person from this group went to several Temples in Assam and Calcutta =
recently. Notice the bliss and joy flowing from her letter. How much happy =
she felt at=A0 Temples when she was in presence of Divine Mother.This bliss=
ful state is nothing less than a samadhi.Afterall Divine Mother is Sagun Br=
ahman.

I do not know her.Otherwise I could have sent her a cheque for some=
 money for purchase of fresh
 Dhoop and asked her to light them at temples =
which she visited for this group. Most of people here are walking conscious=
ely on spiritual path. As the fragrance would have reached Mother , Her shi=
mmering grace could have filled us with Her Love. 

Thanks,
LaxmiNarayan
