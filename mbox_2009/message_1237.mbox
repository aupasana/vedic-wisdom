I would like to caution ourselves from getting into arguments whether 
or n=
ot Sanskrit is mother of all languages. One Arabic professor 
making such c=
laim does not add much credibility to the argument unless 
he has some comp=
elling reasons to make such statement.

With in India, we find so called sc=
holars arguing that Sanskrit came 
from other languages. You go south and w=
ill find quite a few Tamilians 
claim Sanskrit is not moth of Tamil.

I wou=
ld definitely be interested to see why the Arabic professor felt 
what he f=
elt; how ever, the more important and basic question Utpal 
had is: Why is =
the knowledge written down in such disputable manner. 
Why it is not writte=
n in simple words.

Utpal, your observation is true. For a long time the kn=
owledge is 
passed on orally and there are quite a few corruptions in the 
=
scriptures as we have today.

Some of the scriptures have redundancy built =
in to ensure the 
corruptions are checked to a large extension.

Coming to =
the different meanings, it could be on purpose to some 
extent to ensure on=
ly the individuals with correct attitude has the 
intution to understand it=
. This could have been brought in by the 
people who passed on the knowledg=
e as they were seeing India getting 
invaded. They carriers of knowledge ma=
y have purposefully created the 
ambiguities.

Best regards,
Vijay
