Dear Narasimha

Namaste

Yes I am little disappointed, I did not expect thi=
s from you. I feel 
that when we put things out on internet, they should be=
 backed up 
with appropriate reference and should try to stick to our scrip=
tures, 
as there is lot of depth. We can interpret them as per our abilitie=
s 
and state that too.

For one when information posted on internet, we don=
ot know when, how 
and who will use the information. This leads to a lot of=
 
bastardization and eventually lead to wrong practices for the wrong 
reas=
on. We practice many even today without understanding or if we 
need.

Why =
coin new fancy names and definitions as there may already be 
appropriate n=
ames and definitions in our scripture.

You always question Pt Sanjay Rath =
and ask for source parampara or 
himself or other, I appreciate that.

I ho=
pe you take this in a positive way. There a lot of good things 
that you ha=
ve done and are trying to do, please keep it up and as 
time goes on, you n=
eed to be more vigilant and careful.

I recommend take some time to get you=
r references straight and then 
share as that would also improve the qualit=
y greatly. If you donot 
have time, give pointers to others to research and=
 come up. 
Collabrating is always good.

Why do you want to share something=
 and tell please accept it with a 
pinch of salt, types of agni, we definat=
ely should have definition in 
black and white.

Best Regards
Mitesh
