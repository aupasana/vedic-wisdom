Namaste friends,

e allows one.
=A0
Ramakrishna is a master of explaining the toughest of phi=
losophical points using the simplest of analogies. His analogies are usuall=
y quite apt and brilliant.
=A0
Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of pa=
st actions) is like a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope restricts t=
he movement of the goat, but does not determine where the goat goes and wha=
t it does! That is upto the goat's free will.
=A0
A thirsty goat may look a=
t a river nearby and despair as it cannot reach the river due to the rope. =
It may try and struggle continually, without reaching the river. Another th=
irsty goat may realize that it cannot reach the river, accept that, look ar=
ound, find a small bucket of water behind it within reach if it negotiates =
with the rope and the obstacles. It may turn back, go, drink that water in =
the bucket and be happy.
=A0
While the destiny as frozen at the time of bir=
th (and as reflected in the horoscope) is like the rope tying the goat and=
=A0the surroundings of the goat, the actions of free will after birth are l=
ike the actions of the goat - how it accepts and negotiates the rope and it=
s surroundings to get what it wants.
=A0

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Today's actions (karma) are tomorrow's destiny (karma). =
Some of today's actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today'=
s actions may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me ex=
tend Ramakrishna' s analogy to explain it.
=A0
A goat tied to a tree with a=
 rope may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope may =
get shorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach earl=
ier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten the des=
tiny, make things worse and reduce one's options.
=A0

It may go around the=
 tree a few times in another direction and the rope may get longer. It may =
now be able to reach places it was unable to reach earlier. Similarly, some=
 good acts of free will in this life may improve the destiny and make more =
things possible.
=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0

On=
e's mind is conditioned based on one's destiny. One's surroundings and life=
 situations faced by one are influenced by one's destinty. One will be pull=
ed in certain directions. One may feel attraction for=A0another person. Ano=
ther person may hate one an, abuse one and throw obstacles. One may not hav=
e enough money to live happily. One may be adored by millions of people. An=
d so on. One faces different life situations at different times and=A0in di=
fferent matters.
=A0
However, destiny only shows how one (and one's mind) i=
s pulled in various directions and what life situations one finds oneself i=
n. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and one's circumstances, one can=
 still choose between different actions. The actions taken by one are not f=
ixed based on the horoscope. For example, one person may abuse one badly an=
d one may feel great anger towards that person, all on account of a previou=
s karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one can either succumb to the temp=
tation and fight back or just ignore and move on.
=A0
Destiny places you in=
 different situations. What you do in those situations is based on how you =
use your free will. In some cases, free will has a lot of wiggle room and m=
any options and, in some cases, it has fewer options. But, usually, you do =
have several options that may or may not be obvious and the action you fina=
lly choose shapes your destiny in a future birth.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Please note that the Sanskrit word for des=
tiny is karma and the Sanskrit word for action is also karma. Basically, ac=
tions of today become destiny of tomorrow. You will get reaction in future =
to your current actions and destiny is the sum total of those actions that =
will come back to you.
=A0
Each action of yours that impacts other beings a=
nd objects of this universe will go towards forming your destiny for future=
. (Here please note that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotio=
ns you feel towards someone else and do not necessary express outwardly=A0w=
ill also impact that person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an actio=
n.)
=A0
Horoscope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically o=
r mentally to other beings, until the current birth, which are to give thei=
r reactions in this life. This is also known as destiny.
=A0
It does not fi=
x what you do in various situations in your current life. You have the abil=
ity to make different choices at important crossroads. The choices you make=
 are your karma (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They may =
either impact your current life itself, or become part of the destiny (as r=
eflected in the horoscope) in the next life.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Anybody who tells you that so and so houses sho=
w acts of free will does not understand what=A0free will is. Horoscope is t=
he frozen list of past karmas that form one's destiny for this life. It is =
like the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are like how the goat negot=
iates the rope and moves around within the possible area=A0to do its stuff.=
 That is in the hands of the goat.
=A0
The scope and options available to f=
ree will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the exact acts of free wi=
ll are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate things further, how =
exactly free will has been used until now in this life=A0(which cannot be s=
een from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and options available to=
 free will at this time. The exertion of free will until now may have modif=
ied the destiny.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I =
am not downplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi predic=
tion, the prediction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009 and enjo=
y some kind of power was made using astrology. When someone is already a=A0=
candidate, even a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/2 or 1/3 =
probability. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a prediction on on=
e's political entry in a specific timeframe has a very low probability. Suc=
h a low probability prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology came true=
. Moreover, we have all seen many cases where astrology worked spectacularl=
y. I am not saying astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we do not at=
tempt to understand its shortcomings.
=A0
When someone's free will works in=
 a predictable way, i.e. when one's free will has very few options and/or o=
ne reacts to life situations thrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, =
job of an astrologer is easier. But, when free will has a wide range of opt=
ions and/or one used the free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny =
as reflected by horoscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actio=
ns may make an astrologer fail.
=A0

Narasimha
