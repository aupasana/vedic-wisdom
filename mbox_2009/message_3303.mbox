Dear Rajarshi,

I was sad not due to any personal reason. you haven't said =
anything to offend me on personal level but i expected you to take this is =
issue more seriously and not with a attitude of dry critics like today's TV=
/Print media reporters & critics.

Its very easy if you see with common *wo=
rldly wisdom* to declare that Tulasi Das asked to Punish/Beat Woman, Shudra=
 and Ganwar. But You have given me feeling that you are a voracious reader.=
 A spiritual young man (which is so rare) and capable of debating such issu=
es. I have read somewhere that you have organised some debates also.

There=
 may be thousands who have criticied Tulasi Das for this verse. abused him =
but i dont jump guns at him. I also provide you enough reasons to atleast c=
onsider. 'Par Stri Matu Saman' was enough to rethink but you Ignored that j=
ust by saying that Its intresting. 

I again gave you something to think an=
d that is Ramakrishna and Dhirubahi Ambani can never be cosidered Ganwar.

=
I tell you something more  - The closest english words which can describe G=
anwar are Fool, Idiot, Ruffian !

I shoudl also give you another poit to th=
ink - If Tulasi das says-
Shudra (Popularly and falsely taken as B.C. ETC..=
.), Woman and Ganwar (Falsely and populerly considered as Unlettered) and A=
nimals are worthy of punishment then who else is balanced on earth.

If Rea=
lly Tulasidas had such things in his mind while writing then Lord Rama can =
not even appear in his dream and Lord Hanumaan will be keeping away from hi=
m at Infinite distance.

I'll write a followup message today or tomorrow.

=
I do not consider your apology becuase i am not offended though my message =
was sharp but that is how i am.

Let us debate this important issue once an=
d for all for the sake of Tulasi das.

Warm Regards,

Your brother in Spiri=
tual Journey.

Utpal

=A0we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication happens i=
n three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the words=
, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is 'unknown' or su=

IMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it=

What he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0God did not d=
escend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in order to lead=
 by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordi=

 Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become l=
ike Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanada=

 personal opinion is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by=
 Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all=

=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita'=

oying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more important to =
emulate Rama's ideas than to worship Rama.

from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author's paradise (since many rules of composi=

=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive=
 language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to fi=
nding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematic=
s. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to journali=
sm. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently,=
 English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he i=
s learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he wa=

y, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to of=
fice passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=83=C6'=C3=A2=E2=
=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a stra=
nge urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went =
inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next w=
hen he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of=
 how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went =
into the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time witho=
ut any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my frie=
nd had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in de=
ep sleep.

Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know him =
also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not=
 moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same position=
 for 3 days continuously.=C3=83=C6'=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=
=82=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I bel=
ieve nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of=
 Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said i=
t feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon,=
 the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the w=

=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is=
 someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become =
like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot be=

=C2=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this,=
 but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human g=
uru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needle=
ss to say, he is not an atheist any more.
