1. I can answer the first query regarding milk. If a=C2=A0 calf is allowed =
to drink lots of milk from its mother=C2=A0 it is not good for the baby's h=
ealth and for the mother storing so much milk in her body is harmful. Hence=
 the milk has to be removed or the cow and the calf's health will be in dan=
ger or to say they can die. This was told by my mother who had nurtured a c=
ow in the village back then. These days I don't consider milk to be auspici=
ous as animals are given hormones etc to extract more milk.

2. Regarding s=
ilk its a good question I would want to know about it too.

3. My personal =
understanding: There's no need to chant prayers in sanskrit but the intonat=
ions and vibrations coming from the mantras is what counts and makes it mor=
e effective.=C2=A0 God can understand any language afterall he is the creat=
or. Christians
 say their prayers in English. You have to learn sanskrit to=
 understand the prayers alternatively if you surf the internet many of the =
day to day mantras are given with meaning.

Sudha=C2=A0

      Namaskara!



I have some very basic questions an=
d was not convinced by answers that are usually given.



1. How can milk b=
e considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being and is worshi=
ped as `Kamadenu'. But in actual sense we are extracting milk and preventin=
g the calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a youn=
g calf from having milk from its mother?



2. How can silk cloth be consid=
ered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by killing thousand's of cocoon. =
Using a product which is obtained by killing so many living beings and we b=
eing a cause for such an action...Are we not doing sin?



3. I tell my dai=
ly prayers but I have not learnt Sanskrit and don't understand the meaning =
of many prayers that I say everyday. Why is it necessary to say the slokas =
in Sanskrit and not other language??

Will our Supreme Lord not understand =
other languages ?? or is it just bcos Sanskrit has been used from the very =
early times it is still in practice..
