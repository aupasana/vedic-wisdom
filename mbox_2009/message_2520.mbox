Namaste,

Some testing does occur with spiritual purification. By making you face the 
results of some karmas, fully or partially, god can test you. Try to keep 
your love, devotion and surrender to your deity through the tests. With a 
deity like Mahalakshmi, very rigorous testing that you cannot withstand is 
unlikely.

As far as possible, one should try not to be distracted by these things and 
keep the focus of the mind on the deity when engaging in the ritual.

Regarding feeling the presence of the deity, it is good. However, make sure 
it does not increase ego and pride.

Best regards,
Narasimha
