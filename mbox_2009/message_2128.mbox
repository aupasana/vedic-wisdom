Namaste

Do we have to throw the darbha once we have used it or we can use =
it again and again?

Thanks

However, just curious as to the larger significance of rejecting the dharba=
 (or sprinkling water over the left shoulder after purification of all the =
items in other traditions) towards the SW direction.

u can use a small piece of dharbha for doing so and put it in the reject bo=
wl which is usually kept in the south east direction. Can you confirm if th=
at priest wasn't facing North, in which case the left shoulder would be Sou=
theast or Nirritti direction.
