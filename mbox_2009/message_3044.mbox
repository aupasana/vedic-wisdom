 A devotee asked me, =93Anger and resentment may not be visible outside but=

may be latent. Is there any harm in it?=94 I then remembered an incident t=
hat
happened in Bhagavan=92s presence in 1944-45.

A lady devotee from Andh=
ra Pradesh came to the Ashram and stayed for some
time. Her devotion was of=
 a peculiar nature. Her conception of Bhagavan was
that he was Lord Sri Kri=
shna and she was a Gopika (shepherdess).

The devotees here however felt th=
at such a concept had no place here as
Bhagavan was a brahmachari from birt=
h and a Jivanmukta. But then she would
not keep her view to herself but pub=
licised it and even wrote to Bhagavan
accordingly.

Bhagavan was as usual i=
ndifferent to such writings. He however gave me those
papers to read.He rem=
ained untouched by all such trivialities but I could
not keep quiet after s=
eeing such atrocious writings. So I quietly rebuked
the lady.

She flared u=
p and began writing all sorts of nasty things about me. On
seeing them Bhag=
avan said laughingly, =93Here are the papers from her. All
about you only,=
=94 and handed over the papers to me.

I was completely upset, but what to =
do? At last one day with tears in my
eyes I told Bhagavan, =93I cannot read=
 such letters any longer and keep quiet.
Let her damn herself. Please do no=
t give me her letters any more.=94 =93All
right. I won=92t given them,=94 s=
aid Bhagavan and stopped giving me her letters.

Some days later, that lady=
 began tearing her clothes and started running
about in the streets shoutin=
g, perhaps because of mental imbalance or
deliberately.

When Bhagavan came=
 to know of it he remarked, =93Somebody must take pity on
her and do someth=
ing, otherwise how can she get on?=94 Taking it as an order,
I spoke to a f=
ew of the well-to-do Andhra devotees and with their help sent
a telegram to=
 her husband
and also arranged a person to look after her until the arrival=
 of her
husband. In a few days her husband came and took her away.

Sometim=
e later she sent registered notices to four or five of us saying we
had out=
 of envy at her attaining siddhi (deliverance) dubbed her as a mad
person a=
nd that she
would file a suit against us for defamation. She followed it up=
 with a visit
to the Ashram with her lawyer.

When Bhagavan explained to hi=
m all that had happened, the lawyer spoke
apologetically to us all and scol=
ded her saying, =93What nonsense! Enough.
Enough of it,=94 and left. Realis=
ing she could not bluff any more, she also
left for her native place in
And=
hra Pradesh.

Subsequently, sometime in November 1949, I received a letter =
from her
enquiring about Bhagavan=92s health, as she had received alarming =
reports
about his health.

She wrote,=93I have heard that Bhagavan=92s heal=
th is not satisfactory. Please
let me know how he is now. I had earlier wri=
tten to you abusive letters.

I am sorry for what I had done. You are reall=
y Bhagavan=92s child. Please
excuse me and favour me with an immediate repl=
y. I have given below my
address.=94

I informed Bhagavan about the letter.=
 He simply said, =93Is it so?=94 and kept
quiet for about three days. Durin=
g those days the usual graciousness in his
look was absent whenever I prost=
rated before him; instead he used to turn
his face away from me.

It then o=
ccurred to me that the cause of his displeasure was perhaps because
of the =
internal impurity of my mind in still harbouring ill-will towards
that lady=
 and
not replying to her.

I therefore bought a postcard immediately and wr=
ote to her. =93There is
nothing particular now to worry about Bhagavan=92s =
health.

I will write again in case there is any cause for anxiety.=94 I po=
sted the
card and
came to Bhagavan. When I got up after prostrating before =
him, he looked at
me graciously. I told him that I had just posted a reply =
to that Andhra
lady.

In a pleasant tone, he remarked, =93Yes, yes,=94 and =
calling Rangaswamy,
Satyanandam
and other attendants that were there said, =
=93Look. She has written a letter
to that Telugu lady. It seems that the la=
dy had stated in her letter to
Nagamma, I had abused you some time back but=
 now I have realised my
mistake.

Please excuse me and let me know about Bh=
agavan=92s health.=92 Nagamma has just
sent her a reply. So that lady has n=
ow expressed her regret.=94 He thereafter
turned towards me with a benign a=
nd benevolent look.

I was extremely happy and pleased. So this is the resu=
lt of living at the
feet of the Guru =97 all the impurities of the mind get=
 washed away thus.

Narrating this incident I told that lady devotee from A=
ndhra Pradesh that
renunciation can never be real if anger and resentment r=
emain in the mind.

That lady wondered if such impure thoughts occur even i=
n the presence of
Bhagavan
and if he would treat such people with sympathy =
and tolerance.

The saying that Mahatmas are Patitapavanas (saviours of fal=
len people) has
been illustrated in Bhagavan=92s presence.

Though the lady=
 had behaved senselessly,Bhagavan always had compassion for
her, and he mad=
e me understand in his inimitable way that I should not
harbour any ill wil=
l towards her; he kept up a cool attitude towards me
until my anger and res=
entment towards that lady were given up. What are we
to say about his great=
 compassion!
