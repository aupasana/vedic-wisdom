      Dear Jitendra,



Narasimha has al=
ready given the answer in second para of his email. I am reproducing the sa=
me slightly below.



In general, every email group has a home page. For ex=
ample, this egroup has the home page at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=
ic- wisdom/



When you ready the decription of the group, you will general=
ly understand the basic purpose of the group. Request you to take out time =
and read the group description and validate your intended mail against the =
purpose of the group.



I wish you had time to read through Narasimha's em=
ail in full. Afterall, his email is much shorter than the one I am typing n=
ow!



Here is the part you may have overlooked:

This list is devoted to d=
iscussions on spirituality and spiritual sadhana for self realization. Peop=
le's material problems are quite important to them, but this list is NOT th=
e forum to address them. Please stick to the charter of this list.



Best =
regards,

Vijay
