Namaste Manishji,

In fact it is better as the vibration of the mantras and=
 the fire would also be beneficial to the fetus and the mother. Ensure the =
prasadam is consumed by the pregnant lady as she also nourishes the fetus. =


The devas/devis whom we propitiate and seek blessings from are all ethere=
al beings in subtle forms, and as such they eat/accept prasadams/naivedyam/=
offerings through the sense of smell, which is of a very superior order. He=
nce, it is better to avoid:

1. Smelling the naivedyam/offerings before off=
ering to the devas/devis, as this would 
    tantamount to offering soiled =
food. Would you accept soiled food from your host?
    The same rules appli=
es to the divine beings too.

2. Women in their periods (mentruating) emana=
te a smell which may not be detected
    by human beings olfactory senses, =
however, the devis/devas can detect it instantly, 
    and are repelled by =
it. Its like you are being invited to dinner at your friends place and
    =
garbage and foul smell permeate the house, would you feel respected or even=
 
    comfortable in such an ambience? No. The same is the thing with divin=
e beings.

3. Some basic cleanliness procedure like bathing has to be obser=
ved. Even 
    Aghoris/tantriks who do sadhana in smashan (crematorium) obs=
ervere basic
    cleanliness procedure before starting their ritual.

Hope =
this helps.
Regards
Narayan
