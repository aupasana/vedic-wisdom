Namaste Smt Sudha,
If you leave it as is, after 5-15 minutes it would autom=
atically die
off. You don't have to explicitly try to extinguish it.
Doing =
homam in US or other cold countries, can be tricky. Firstly I
suggest using=
 copra as it doesn't produce much smoke. Secondly, after
you're comfortable=
 with the homam content and fire management, you will
be able to optimize o=
n the copra usage and reduce the smoke further.
Using camphor can also prod=
uce much smoke, so use it sparingly. Ensure,
you raise the window's a bit, =
so that there's circulation in the house.
However, please ensure that wind =
is not blowing in the direction of
smoke alarm, as this would cause it to r=
aise the alarm. For example,
once I performed Ganesha Homam with windows cl=
ose as it was very cold
outside, by the end of it the room got stuffier, an=
d when I opened the
windows a bit in both the rooms, the wind caused all th=
e smoke in one
direction, passing the smoke alarm causing it to go off!
Onc=
e the homam is over, you can go ahead and place the kundam in the
balcony, =
provided there's no fire in it. So, please wait the fire to die
and then mo=
ve it outside, as we don't want to attract any attention.
People in western=
 continent are not aware of fire rituals, and can freak
out on seeing fire.=
 So. when you perform homam in the night, please
ensure some light is on, o=
therwise if the lights are off, then one can
see the flames from outside th=
e apartment, causing some people to call
the fire department. We certainly =
dont want to get into such a
situation!
Too much of clarified butter (ghee)=
 can also cause too much smoke. The
ghee has to be poured the right amount.=
 It would also help, if you could
clean up the homa kundam so that you star=
t empty. This also reduces
smoke. Also proficiency in estimating the amount=
 of ghee for a size of
copra to keep the fire going (including turning at t=
he right moment) all
helps reducing the residual smoke effect.
So, with mor=
e practice you will get a better idea on all the above
parameters. Others m=
ay add their experience. If you have any more
questions, please feel free t=
o ask.
Finally, I would like to mention, that the smoke from the homa kunda=
m is
very therapeutic in nature and offers a lot of benefits. See my other
=
mail on it.
Hope this helps.RegardsNarayan
