OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya

Dear All,

This ia my first posting in this =
forum.

Am writing in as am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol=
 which we found during puja in our home. This idol has its trunk to the rig=
ht side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recently=
 came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the right=
 is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we ha=
ve honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchased b=
y my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it since=
 then. 

I feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would wors=
hip it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are feeling =
hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have advi=
ce as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doing th=
e same.

Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a q=
uery.

Thanks,
Ramesh M
