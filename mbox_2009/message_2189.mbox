Dear Narayanji
=A0
Thanks for the reply. As you said, the words are really =
difficult to pronounce. Is the audio of Sri Prakash Kaushik avaible in stor=
es, or where can I get it from?
=A0
And the strangest thing I find is that,=
 the Chandi I have is a version I had bought from the Ramakrishna Mission, =
in Bengali, my mother tongue. This publication of Chandi is very popular in=
 west bengal, unlike the Gita Press publication. And when I bought a Gita=
=A0Press Chandi and compared it recently, I found that there are words and =
places (sandhis) which are different in the two!
=A0
Anyway kindly tell me =
where I can find this mp3.
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi

The upsurge (of c=
onsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste,

I would als=
o like to add that I was able to reduce the time by practicing it regularly=
 and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaushik's Durga =
Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has a great voic=
e, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can pause and repeat it. I=
 tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast for my liking.=


It is important for beginners, to know how to chant in a rhythm, the sand=
hi's and especially some complicated words.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Nara=
yan
