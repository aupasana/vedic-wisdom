Dear Ajit,

I will leave it more learned people to answer your specific que=
stions 
about having some literary references that establish supremacy of 
=
homam.

How ever, I wanted to share my experiance/thoughts:
In my child hoo=
d, I used to stand facing morning Sun (with my eyes 
closed) and used to me=
ntally recite any slokas.

With the brightness the Sun showed (even with my=
 eyes closed), my mind 
did not wander. It had single most focus. Wondering=
 and admiring the 
brightness.

I experience the same kind of focus when I =
sit in front of a bright 
light or Fire.

So, I do see and believe, it help=
s me focus my mind to a large extent. 
The fire offers bright light, and he=
at. When the fire is bigger, the 
brightness and the patterns it shows to t=
he closed eyes are more 
enchanting and impressive. So, the other thoughts =
go out of our mind.

Best regards,
Vijay
