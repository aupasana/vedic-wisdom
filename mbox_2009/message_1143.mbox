Namste Murahari,

Firstly, if Lord Krishna asked us put country before us, =
we shall do 
so!

How ever, thinking further, the purpose of spiritual sadh=
ana is to 
overcome the feeling I/MY. MY COUNTRY is also a feeling pertaini=
ng to 
our limited personification.

The sanatana dharam talks about vasudh=
aika kuTumbam. The entire 
universe is a single family. The countries are f=
ormed by the mere 
boundaries drawn by our political leaders.

We seem to h=
ave so much affinity to our respective countries. Perhaps, 
having affinity=
 towards country is better than having affinity towards 
ourselves.

If you=
 are in middle of some work, and your kids called for help, if 
you know so=
me one else in house will attend them, it may be 
appropriate to continue w=
hat you are doing! How ever, if there is no 
one else in the house to help =
your kids, then it is your duty to help 
them. So, in the first insident th=
e guru X had the knowledge that free 
dome will come as other capable peopl=
e are already striving for it.

Each person will have his specific role to =
play in the jagannatakam!

Best regards,
Vijay
