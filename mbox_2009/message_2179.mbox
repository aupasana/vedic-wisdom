 Dear ALL,

Namaste

*Human Consciousness: Permanent Center of Our Soul*
**=


An atom is the subtle form of the cosmos. Its central portion represents =
the
sun of our universe. Electrons revolve around the nucleus (sun) just as=

planets revolve around the sun of our solar system. Just as infinite space=

exist outside the periphery of the solar system so too there is a lot of
s=
pace present in the atom. Between various solar systems of the cosmos there=

exists ample and optimum space separating each of them. Similarly there ar=
e
varied differences in the central region of all atoms. Although externall=
y
they appear to be identical internally differences are noted. For example=
,
in Uranium there are 92 electrons whereas in Carbon there are only 6
elec=
trons.

Every human being can be akin to an entire cosmos. His soul is like=
 the sun
in whose vicinity atoms and planets revolve. Atoms, bacteria, viru=
ses etc
that are found in the human body are known to emit a special kind o=
f
electricity. It is because of the influence of this electricity that orga=
ns
like the brain etc function aptly. It is that very medium through which
=
consciousness can manifest in inert nature. Ordinarily movements of various=

types are seen in atoms. They lack the capacity to think or experience
any=
thing. But human electricity called Prana (life/vital force)
consciousness =
in inert group of atoms is known to manifest the capacity of
thinking and t=
hus life comes into existence.

Around the Polar region of planet earth mag=
netic storms are known to erupt.
They emit unsteady light which is called A=
urora Borealis. Polar region in
turn attract radiations, light and other in=
fluences from other planets to
our globe. Further certain special influence=
s of Earth are transported to
other planets of the universe. Polar region o=
f the earth is said to be the
point of contact with the rest of the cosmos.=
 Our earth=92s present existence
is dependent on inter planetary radiations=
 which pass through the Polar
region. Apart from this, the present position=
ing of other planets are as
they are as a result of various incessant radia=
tions active in the earth=92s
Polar region. If at all due to some reason th=
is relationship of give and
take comes to a grinding halt such a dire influ=
ence will manifest that life
on our globe will cease to sustain and exist. =
Together with this a change in
the hierarchy and positioning of planets wil=
l lead to chaos in the present
day activities of the solar system. A little=
 movement in a small area
contributes quite gigantically to the revolving a=
ctivity of the earth and
other planets. The more we ponder over this fact t=
he more its mystery will
unfold lucidly.

Man=92s inner consciousness too i=
s similarly a focused area of Divine Energy.
Within it there are infinite k=
nown and unknown potentialities like desire
power, emotional power, power o=
f resolve, attraction power, repulsion power
etc. If these are activated op=
timally, if we can learn to make apt use of
them we can experience the mani=
festation of all cosmic powers. Man=92s
consciousness is infinite like the =
gigantic space of the solar system.
Whatever exists in it is more powerful =
than inter planetary space. Alas but
despite all this it is mind boggling t=
hat we are totally unaware of this
divine treasure house indwelling in our =
inner being. If some how or the
other we are capable enough of establishing=
 a bond with the root source of
infinite energy which is akin to a gigantic=
 ocean an individual can become
an infinite storehouse of Divine Energy. As=
 a result what previously seemed
impossible can now be made possible via th=
is infinite ocean of energy. Sun
or Savita is the personal god or icon of a=
ll human beings. The goal of all
should be to merge with this icon.

How is=
 this possible to attain? The answer is given by Solar Sciences.
