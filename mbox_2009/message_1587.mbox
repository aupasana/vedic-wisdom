Dear Krishna ji,

I think veda is much more ancient then Sainbaba's incarna=
tion as *Sain Baba* hence there may not be any mantra in Veda.
however, the=
 mantra you are doing seems to be correct one as you are reciting the same =
mantra always. It is prefered to offer the mantra in Homa which one normall=
y recites.

warm regards,

Utpal
