Namaste,

nice explanation! you inspired me to look in to the story further=
 and i was
thinking about the same during my Chandi Paath.

>After a while =
the third robber returned and said to the man: "Ah, I >am sorry.
Are you hu=
rt?

This also means that, no matter how badly a person is robbed by Rajas =
and Tamas,
Sooner or later (ultimately) Satwa will come back to him, free h=
im from the
bondage of Rajas and Tamas and show him the path of liberation =
from the world of
Maya.

so moral of the story is - "do not loose the heart=
 even if you (i) are the biggest sinner in the world. just cry to HER untir=
ingly and satwa will come running" !!!

Best Regards,

Utpal

As a simple example, laziness in the matter of spiritual progress (i.e. tam=
as) can be replaced with doing several rituals and reading books passionate=
ly (rajas). It is difficult to transition from tamas to sattwa straight awa=
y. As one engages in rituals, reading books and contemplation, slowly the p=
assion (rajas) is replaced by steadiness and equanimity (sattwa). When satt=
wa becomes predominant in one's personality and rajas and tamas become negl=
igible, one starts to make tremendous progress. But, until that happens, ra=
jas is useful to have!

 when three robbers fell upon him and robbed him of all his possessions. On=
e of the robbers said, "What's the use of keeping this man alive?" So sayin=
g, he was about to kill him with his sword, when the second robber interrup=
ted him, saying: 'Oh, no! What is the use of killing him? Tie his hand and =
foot and leave him here." The robbers bound his hands and feet and went awa=
y. After a while the third robber returned and said to the man: "Ah, I am s=
orry. Are you hurt? I will release you from your bonds." After setting the =
man free, the thief said: "Come with me. I will take you to the public high=
 way." After a long time they reached the road. At this the man said: "Sir,=
 you have been very good to me. Come with me to my house." "Oh,no!" the rob=
ber replied. "I can't go there. The police will know it."
