 *What is the meaning and the benefits of 'Namaskar'?*


*Origin and the me=
aning of the word 'Namaskar'
*
The word 'Namaskar' is derived from the root=
 'namaha', which means paying
obeisance (Namaskar) or salutation.


>From Sc=
ience of Justice - 'Namaha' is a physical action expressing that 'you
are s=
uperior to me in all qualities and in every way'.

*Worldly Benefits
*- By =
doing Namaskar to a deity or a Saint, unknowingly their virtues and
capabil=
ities are impressed upon our minds. Consequently we start emulating
them, t=
hus changing ourselves for the better.

*Spiritual Benefits
*- Increase in =
humility and reduction of ego / Enhancement in the spiritual
emotion of sur=
render and gratitude / Gaining the Sattva component and faster
spiritual pr=
ogress
We receive the highest amount of Sattva component from the posture (=
mudra)
of Namaskar.
By  doing Namaskar to Deities or Saints we receive subt=
le frequencies
emitted by them, e.g. frequencies of Sattva or Bliss.


*Why=
 is it not appropriate to Shake Hands?*


*Avoid a Hand Shake:* It tranfers=
 undesirable raja-tama components! In
short, in a handshake, the raja-tama =
components in one person will get
transferred to the other person, thereby =
lowering his sattvikta (Purity
levels). While practicing Spirituality, our =
objective is to perform acts
which increase our sattvikta.
If at all they d=
o Namaskar by joining their palms, it is done just as a
formality. As the a=
ct is not based on faith, the benefit derived from it is
minimal. Along wit=
h faith it is essential that every religious act be
correctly performed acc=
ording to the Science of Spirituality, so that it
gives complete benefit. I=
n this series, as with the others,  along with
information on various metho=
ds of doing Namaskar, the Science in them is
also explained. Understanding =
the Science will help in strengthening faith
in the act. Such an act correc=
tly performed with faith, will yield
corresponding benefits.


*How does on=
e do Namaskar to an individual of the same age group?*

When meeting someon=
e of the same age-groupdo Namaskar by joining the fingers
and placing tips =
of the thumbs on the Anahat chakra (at the centre of the
chest). This type =
of Namaskarincreases the spiritual emotion of humility in
the embodied soul=
. Sattva frequencies from the universe are attracted by the
fingers (which =
act as an antenna) and are then transmitted to the entire
body through the =
thumbs which have awakened the Anahat chakra. This
activates the soul energ=
y of the embodied soul. In addition, by doing
Namaskar in this manner to ea=
ch other, frequencies of blessings are also
transmitted.


*What is correct=
 method & science of doing Namaskar to God?*


*A.* 'While paying obeisance=
 to God, bring the palms together.
*1.* The fingers should be held loose (n=
ot straight and rigid) while joining
the hands or palms.
*2.* The fingers s=
hould be kept close to each other without leaving any
space between them.
*=
3.* The fingers should be kept away from the thumbs.
*4.* The inner portion=
 of the palms should not touch each other and there
should be some space be=
tween them.

*Note:* The stage of awakening of spiritual emotion (Bhav) is =
important to
the seeker at the primary level. Hence, for awakening spiritua=
l emotion
(Bhav), he should keep space in between the joined hands, whereas=
 a seeker
who is at the advanced level should refrain from leaving such spa=
ce in
between the palms to awaken the unexpressed spiritual emotion (Bhav).=


*B.* After joining the hands one should bow and bring the head forward..
=

*C.* While tilting the headforward, one should place the thumbs at the
mid=
-brow region, i.e. at the point between the eyebrows and try to
concentrate=
 on the feet of the Deity.

*D.* After that, instead of bringing the folded=
 hands down immediately, they
should be placed on the mid-chest region for =
a minute in such way that the
wrists touch the chest; then only  should the=
 hands be brought down.

*Underlying Science in this action*


*A.* The fin=
gers should not be stiff while bringing the palms together
because this wil=
l lead to a decrease in Sattva component from the vital and
mental sheaths =
and thus increase the raja component in them. By keeping the
fingers relaxe=
d, the subtlest Sattva component will get activated. With the
strength of t=
his energy, embodied souls are able to fight powerful
distressing energies.=


*B.* In the Namaskar posture, the joined fingers act as an antenna to
ass=
imilate the Chaitanya (Divine consciousness) or the Energy transmitted by
a=
 Deity. While joining the palms, the fingers must touch each other because
=
leaving space between the fingers will result in accumulation of energy in
=
that space. This energy will be immediately transmitted in various
directio=
ns;  therefore the seeker's body will lose the benefit of this
potent energ=
y.

*C.* About the space to be maintained between the palms:
For a seeker a=
t the primary level, it is advisable to leave space between
the palms; it i=
s not necessary for a seeker at an advanced level to leave
space between th=
e palms.

*D.* After joining the palms, bow a little. This posture puts pre=
ssure on
the navel and activates the five vital energies situated there. Ac=
tivation
of these vital energies in the body makes it sensitive to acceptin=
g sattvik
frequencies. This later awakens the 'Atma shakti'  (i.e. soul ene=
rgy of an
embodied soul). And later, Bhav is awakened. This enables the bod=
y to accept
in large measures the Chaitanya emitted by the Deity.

*E.* Tou=
ch the thumbs to the mid-brow region. (Please see images above..)
This post=
ure awakens the Bhav of surrender in an embodied soul, and  in turn
activat=
es the appropriate subtle frequencies of Deities from the Universe.
They en=
ter through the =92Adnya chakra=92 (Sixth of the 7 chakras in the
Kundalini=
) of the embodied soul and settle in the space parallel to it at
the back i=
nterior of the head. In this space the openings to all the three
channels c=
onverge; namely, the Moon, the Central and the Sun channels. Due
to the mov=
ement of these subtler frequencies in this space, the Central
Channel is ac=
tivated. Consequently it facilitates the speedy transmission of
these frequ=
encies throughout the body, leading to purification of both the
gross and s=
ubtle bodies at the same time.

*F.* After doing Namaskar, to completely im=
bibe the Chaitanya of the Deity
(that has entered the hands by now), instea=
d of bringing the folded hands
down immediately, place them on the mid-ches=
t region in such a way that the
wrists touch the chest.

The 'Anahat chakra=
' is located at the centre of the chest. Akin to the Adnya
chakra, the acti=
vity of the Anahat chakra is also to absorb the Sattva
frequencies. By touc=
hing the wrists to the chest, the Anahat chakra is
activated and it helps i=
n absorbing more of the Sattva component.


*Effect of this Posture*

By do=
ing Namaskar in this manner, the Deity's Chaitanya is absorbed to a
greater=
 extent by the body, as compared to other methods of doing Namaskar.
This g=
ives maximum distress to negative energies. The negative energies that
have=
 manifested in a person are unable to touch their thumbs at the mid-brow
re=
gion in Namaskar. (The negative energies are subtle. But at times they
ente=
r an individual's body and manifest it. - Editor)'

*Q. What is the reason =
for not wrapping a cloth around the neck while
performing circumambulation,=
 doing Namaskar, ritualistic worship,
sacrificial fires, chanting and while=
 visiting Guru and deities?*

A. When a cloth is wrapped around the neck, i=
t does not activate the
Vishuddha chakra (in the throat region) and hence a=
n individual gets less
benefit of the Sattva component.


*Why should one a=
lways do Namaskar to elders?*



*Meaning:* When an elderly person arrives,=
 the vital energy of the young
person starts rising and when he gets up and=
 does Namaskar, it returns to
normal. - Manusmruti 2.120; Mahabharat, Udhyo=
g, Chapter (Section) 38.1, Sr.
no. 104, 64-65

*Explanation:* 'As the sojou=
rn of the elderly person is gradually towards
the southern direction, that =
is, towards the region of Lord Yama (towards
death), his body starts emitti=
ng raja and tama frequencies on a high scale.
When such an elderly person c=
omes in the vicinity of any younger individual,
these frequencies start aff=
ecting the younger person. A subtle magnetic
field is created between the t=
wo. Consequently, the vital energy of the
younger person is pulled upward. =
This way the younger person can suffer due
to sudden momentum to his vital =
energy. When this younger person
doesNamaskar to the elderly person, some a=
mount of the Central channel of
his Kundalini system is activated and the S=
attva component in it starts
increasing. Consequently the raja and tama com=
ponents in him are influenced
by the Sattva component and the vital energy =
comes back to normal state.
Hence on arrival of an elderly person, it is cu=
stomary for the younger
individuals
 to do Namaskar to them.'


Doing Namas=
kar to Elders.

*When travelling, prior to the commencement of a journey an=
d upon returning,
why should one do Namaskar to elders in the family?
*
'Na=
maskar to the elders in the family is one way of surrendering to the God
pr=
inciple in them. When an embodied soul bows in Namaskar to an elder by
surr=
endering to the God principle in him, at that time a sense of compassion
is=
 created in his body. This compassion percolates right upto his subtle
body=
. At that time, energy of his mind is activated and in turn activates
the f=
ive vital energies, which are located at the seat of the Manipur chakra
(si=
tuated in the Naval region). Transmission of these five vital energies
all =
over the body then awakens the soul energy. With the strength of the
soul e=
nergy, the Central channel gets activated and converts the expressed
energy=
 of spiritual emotion to the unexpressed energy of spiritual emotion.
With =
the help of this unexpressed energy of spiritual emotion, the embodied
soul=
, through the medium of elders, gains the required Deity's principle
from t=
he Universe. For this purpose, while leaving the house on a
 journey, the e=
mbodied soul should do Namaskar to elders and with the
strength of Sattva f=
requencies has to protect himself from distressing
frequencies in the atmos=
phere. Similarly, returning from a journey, one
should immediately do Namas=
kar to elders and awaken the God principle in
them, which would disintegrat=
e the raja-tama particles from the air around
him, which might have been br=
ought along.


*What is the correct method of doing Namaskar to Saints?*

*=
1. The portion of head, which should be placed at the feet :*

We can imbib=
e maximum Chaitanya through the Brahmarandhra (the seventh
chakra of the Ku=
ndalini system located in the crown of our head). Since it
(Brahmarandhra) =
cannot be placed at a Saints's feet, the part of head
beginning above the f=
orehead is to be placed at the feet of Saints. Due to
this, maximum Chaitan=
ya emanating from Their feet can enter into the one
doing Namaskar.

*2. Th=
e exact spot to place one's head on a Saint's feet:*

The big toes of Saint=
s emit maximum Chaitanya; hence we should place our
head on the big toe, th=
an on their foot. If we are in a position to touch
both the toes, then plac=
e the head on the right big toe.

*3. The position of hands when placing th=
e head on a Saint's feet:*

*a.* Some interlock their hands behind their ba=
cks at the waist and do
Namaskar. If we are in a position to touch both the=
ir toes, then we should
place the hands one on each foot and the head shoul=
d be placed on the big
toe of the right foot. If we are in a position to to=
uch one of Their toes,
then place both the hands on it and keep the head on=
 the big toe.

*b.* Some do Namaskar by placing hands on the ground. This i=
s also wrong
because if the hands are placed on the ground then the Chaitan=
ya emanating
from the Saint's feet are absorbed by one and then returns to =
the earth
through the hands of the one doing Namaskar. Thus the person does=
 not
benefit from it.

*c.* Some cross their hands and place them on the fe=
et of Saints, that is,
their right hand on the right foot of the Saint and =
their left hand on the
left foot of the Saint while doingNamaskar. This is =
a crude imitation of the
manner in which Christians place their crossed han=
ds on their chest.
Instead, our right hand should be placed on the left foo=
t of the Saint and
our left hand on the right foot of the Saint. This is co=
nvenient also.
However, if a Guru has started some procedure in a particula=
r sect, then the
hands are to be placed in that manner only.

d. The hands =
are to be positioned in such a way that the palms are placed on
the feet..
=


*How to do Namaskar to the wooden footwear (paduka) of Saints?*


Namaska=
r to the wooden footwear (paduka) of Saints

'The left paduka symbolises Lo=
rd Shiva and the right symbolises Divine
Energy. The left paduka is the unm=
anifest saviour energy and the right is
the unmanifest destroyer energy of =
the Supreme God. The saviour or destroyer
energy of the Supreme God emanate=
s from the 'pegs' of the paduka as per the
need. When we do Namaskar by pla=
cing our head on the 'pegs' of the paduka,
some may experience distress due=
 to the inability to tolerate the manifest
energy emitting from it. Hence, =
while doing Namaskar to the paduka, instead
of the pegs, place the head on =
the foremost part i.e. the place where the
Saints place their toes.'


*Sho=
uld one do Namaskar to a dead body?
*
*Q. If this be so, should we do Namas=
kar to the dead bodies in Kaliyuga only
as a custom? If it is a custom, can=
 we discontinue it?
*
A. One can maintain respect for the dead person by do=
ing Namaskar and in
addition set an ideal with regards to respecting elders=
. In Kaliyuga, from
this one will benefit at an emotional level and not at =
a spiritual level.
However, one should not discontinue this custom; instead=
 one could learn how
to get spiritual benefit from it. Due to the deteriora=
tion of the Sattva
component in embodied souls, this practice has become a =
mere custom in
Kaliyuga.

However, as per the saying, 'God exists where the=
re is spiritual emotion',
while doing Namaskar to a dead body if we have a =
spiritual emotion that we
are doing Namaskar  to the God principle in it, t=
hen the God principle in
the dead body awakens and we receive God's blessin=
gs. This happens because
the God principle is immortal and has no limitatio=
ns that a physical body
has.


*Q. It is said that one should not do Namask=
ar to a sleeping person. In
Kaliyuga if one does Namaskar by touching the d=
ead body, then are the
chances of getting distress from negative energies n=
ot higher?
*
A. Yes it is; but while doing Namaskar it is important that th=
e action be
performed with correct spiritual emotion. Since Namaskar is don=
e to the God
principle in the dead body instead of activating raja, tama co=
mponents, it
activates the Godly principle in the dead body and bestows Sat=
tva
corresponding to the degree of spiritual emotion.'


*'One hand' touch =
to the Temple Steps
*
*Action: Touch the step with the fingers of the right=
 hand and move the same
hand over the head.
*
*Science:* 'The area around t=
he temple is charged with frequencies of
Deities which leads to an increase=
 in the Sattva component. The presence of
Divine consciousness in the area =
charges even the stairs in a temple.
'Climbing' steps is one of the activit=
ies, which increases the raja
component in the body. Hence, the raja compon=
ent is already activated in the
body of an embodied soul so by touching the=
 steps with the fingers of the
right hand, the Sattva component and peace f=
rom the charged premise, get
transmitted to the body through the right hand=
. In addition, from this
action, the activated raja component in the body c=
an be controlled through
the medium of the surya nadi (Sun channel). This m=
eans that, for a moment,
the activities of the Sun channel can be stopped. =
>From this process, the
embodied soul learns to enhance the Sattva component=
 through raja dominant
actions. Therefore, it is very essential to perform =
the appropriate sattvik
actions at
 each corresponding level, hence the met=
hod of touching the steps with
fingers of the right hand and then moving th=
e fingers or palm over the head.
Even the dust present on the steps is char=
ged with Chaitanya and so we must
respect it and derive spiritual benefit f=
rom it. If the embodied soul
harbours the spiritual emotion that 'the Chait=
anya from the steps be
transmitted all over my body from the dust on my han=
d', then it will give
increasing benefit to the embodied soul. In addition =
if the ego of the
embodied soul is less at that time then it gives even mor=
e benefit. When any
action is performed devoid of ego or 'I'ness it is trea=
ted as a 'non-action'
(akarma-karma).'



*Do's and Dont's while doing Nama=
skar
*
*Q. Why should the eyes be closed while doing Namaskar?
*
 'Joining =
hands while bowing the head amounts to saluting God or the
divinity in the =
person in front. The eyes are closed while doing Namaskar to
God or any res=
pected person, to enable one to have the vision of God within
us.'

*Q. Why=
 should the footwear be taken off while doing Namaskar?
*
While sitting, pa=
rtaking meals, sleeping, wishing and doing Namaskar to
Gurus and other elde=
rly people, footwear should not be worn. - Gautamsmruti
9.

1. Footwear inc=
reases the raja-tama components in a person.

2. Paying obeisance (Namaskar=
) with high raja-tama components will not help
in activating the Kundalini =
(centre in the spiritual energy system).

3. The ability to absorb the satt=
va component too is reduced, due to an
increase in the raja-tama components=
, leading to little benefit from a
Namaskar.

4. Doing Namaskar to a Deity,=
 with footwear on, may also invite the wrath of
the Deity.=92

*Q. Why is i=
t not advisable to hold any object while doing Namaskar?
*
1. While doing N=
amaskar if an object is held in the hands, usually the
fingers and their ti=
ps are in a curled position and not straight. As a
result, the sattva compo=
nent received is unable to enter the tips of the
fingers.

2. The sattva co=
mponent emitted towards the seeker, strikes the object held
and bounces bac=
k. Also, at times, instead of the person absorbing the sattva
component, th=
e object may absorb it.

3. If the object in the hand is raja or tama predo=
minant, and if it is
touched to the forehead or chest while doing Namaskar,=
 then the raja-tama
components from it mayenter the body of the one who is =
doing Namaskar.

*Q. While doing Namaskar, why are men not supposed to cove=
r their head,
whereas women are advised to cover their head?
*
 One should =
not do Namaskar with footwear on, covering the head or holding
any objects.=
 (But women should cover their head with their saris and only
then do Namas=
kar) - Apastamb Dharmasutra 1.4.14.19

While doing Namaskar the Kundalini g=
ets activated at the chakra which is
touched by the folded hands. This lead=
s to the absorption of the Sattva
component in greater proportion in the bo=
dy. Sometimes due to the activation
of the Kundalini, Sattva component star=
ts entering the body through the
head. But at times the distressing energie=
s try to take advantage of this
and mix black energy with the Sattva compon=
ent. The potential to activate
the Kundalini is higher in men as compared t=
o women. Hence they are hardly
affected by this negative energy. Contrary t=
o this, as women are more
vulnerable, they get affected by distressing ener=
gies to a greater extent
and thus they can experience distress. That is why=
, when doing Namaskar,
women are advised to cover their head with the ends =
of their sari. This
creates a barrier between the head and the distressing =
energies and prevents
themfrom penetrating the body of the woman. However, =
to some extent this
also blocks
 benevolent frequencies from entering the w=
omen. (Benevolent frequencies are
subtler than negative frequencies; hence =
they enter a woman to some extent
even though the sari covers her head.) Ho=
wever, the proper posture of
Namaskar gives maximum Sattva component to an =
individual and hence women too
get required benefits. This shows how God ta=
kes care of every devotee. Doing
Namaskar without these restrictions is equ=
ally effective if the devotee does
it with spiritual emotion.

we should place our head on the big toe, than on their foot. If we are in a=

This is also wrong because if the hands are placed on the ground then the C=

</b><br>A. One can maintain respect for the=

 respecting elders. In Kaliyuga, from this one will benefit at an emotional=
 level and not at a spiritual level. However, one should not discontinue th=

<br>However, as per the sayi=
ng, 'God exists where there is spiritual emotion', while doing Nama=
skar to a dead body if we have a spiritual emotion that we are doing Namask=

n the body of an embodied soul so by touching the steps with the fingers of=
 the right hand, the Sattva component and peace from the charged premise, g=
et transmitted to the body through the right hand. In addition, from this a=
ction, the activated raja component in the body can be controlled through t=
he medium of the surya nadi (Sun channel). This means that, for a moment, t=
he activities of the Sun channel can be stopped. From this process, the emb=
odied soul learns to enhance the Sattva component through raja dominant act=
ions. Therefore, it is very essential to perform the appropriate sattvik ac=
tions at<br>
=A0each corresponding level, hence the method of touching the =
steps with fingers of the right hand and then moving the fingers or palm ov=

will give increasing benefit to the embodied soul. In addition if the ego o=

d the footwear be taken off while doing Namaskar?<br></b><br>While sitting,=
 partaking meals, sleeping, wishing and doing Namaskar to Gurus and other e=
lderly people, footwear should not be worn. - Gautamsmruti 9.<br>
<br>1. Fo=
otwear increases the raja-tama components in a person.<br><br>2. Paying obe=
isance (Namaskar) with high raja-tama components will not help in activatin=
g the Kundalini (centre in the spiritual energy system).<br><br>
3. The abi=
lity to absorb the sattva component too is reduced, due to an increase in t=
he raja-tama components, leading to little benefit from a Namaskar.<br><br>=
4. Doing Namaskar to a Deity, with footwear on, may also invite the wrath o=
f the Deity.=92<br>
<br><b>Q. Why is it not advisable to hold any object wh=
ile doing Namaskar?<br></b><br>1. While doing Namaskar if an object is held=
 in the hands, usually the fingers and their tips are in a curled position =
and not straight. As a result, the sattva component received is unable to e=
nter the tips of the fingers.<br>

ds the seeker, strikes the object held and bounces back. Also, at times, in=

t.<br><br>3. If the object in the hand is raja or tama predominant, and if =
it is touched to the forehead or chest while doing Namaskar, then the raja-=
tama components from it mayenter the body of the one who is doing Namaskar.=
<br>
<br><b>Q. While doing Namaskar, why are men not supposed to cover thei=
r head, whereas women are advised to cover their head?<br></b><br>=A0One sh=
ould not do Namaskar with footwear on, covering the head or holding any obj=
ects. (But women should cover their head with their saris and only then do =
Namaskar) - Apastamb Dharmasutra 1.4.14.19<br>
<br>While doing Namaskar the=
 Kundalini gets activated at the chakra which is touched by the folded hand=
s. This leads to the absorption of the Sattva component in greater proporti=
on in the body. Sometimes due to the activation of the Kundalini, Sattva co=
mponent starts entering the body through the head. But at times the distres=
sing energies try to take advantage of this and mix black energy with the S=
attva component. The potential to activate the Kundalini is higher in men a=
s compared to women. Hence they are hardly affected by this negative energy=
. Contrary to this, as women are more vulnerable, they get affected by dist=
ressing energies to a greater extent and thus they can experience distress.=
 That is why, when doing Namaskar, women are advised to cover their head wi=
th the ends of their sari. This creates a barrier between the head and the =
distressing energies and prevents themfrom penetrating the body of the woma=
n. However, to some extent this also blocks<br>
=A0benevolent frequencies f=
rom entering the women. (Benevolent frequencies are subtler than negative f=
requencies; hence they enter a woman to some extent even though the sari co=
vers her head.) However, the proper posture of Namaskar gives maximum Sattv=
a component to an individual and hence women too get required benefits. Thi=
s shows how God takes care of every devotee. Doing Namaskar without these r=
estrictions is equally effective if the devotee does it with spiritual emot=
ion.<br>
