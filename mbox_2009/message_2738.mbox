Namaskar Rajarshi,

   Thanks for your contribution - all =
you have done is to prove what is already known.

> Therefore, Ahamkara exi=
sts even in beyond the death for a normal 
> human being. Therewfore, Ahamk=
ara is present in the astral/casual 
> plane as well.

1. Do you realize wh=
at is being talked about and what you have ended up proving ? Wherein did I=
 deny that Ahamkara is not present in Astral/Causal bodies ?

   Ahamkara i=
s an idea in Causal-body, so it is present all the time till the soul is fr=
eed of the three body containers.
 
2. OTOH, What I have stated, with refer=
ence to Patanjali Sutras, is that Ahamkara is "SUPPRESSED" in Astral and Ca=
usal bodies. Meaning 

"Ahamkara isn't the dominant cause of I-ness in Astr=
al/Causal bodies"

  And as a result wouldn't contribute to the acquisition=
 of Astral/Causal Karma.

   Why is Ahamkara not dominant in Astral/Causal =
bodies ?
   The reason I have already given in the first mail in sufficient=
 detail.

   IF THE AHAMKARA IS NOT SUPPRESSED AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, THE PE=
RSON WILL KEEP CARRYING THE SAME EARTHLY IDENTITY TO THE ASTRAL PLANES, AND=
 BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL RECLAIM HIS LOST =
TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CONFLICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE BEYOND ANYBODY=
'S CONTROL. 
    THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS=
 OF MANAS, while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.

  Pleas=
e read more of "Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda", he has mentioned about all =
these things (what happens to a soul at death and so on) in such a simplist=
ic manner in his Gita commentaries, that even a layman can understand it.

=
Regards,
Nitish
