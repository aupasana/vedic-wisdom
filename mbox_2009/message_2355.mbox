Deva Tarpanam is done daily by performing  what is known as Brahma yagjam after completing  Madhyanhikam.  Any homam other than Shraddha Homam can be done thereafter. On Shraddha day Pitru Homam will precede tarpanam. This is as per prescribed procedure.

Namaste Krishna Kanth,

I think it is advisable to do the homam first and then follow it up with the Tarpanam. I guess performing the super-short version is fine. That's what I did.

Narayan
