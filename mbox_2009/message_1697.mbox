Namaste All:

India has many many places which are very high with
spritual=
 vibrations, conducive for spiritual growth.
For example, I have heard that=
 many realized souls still live on the hill of Arunachala in Tamil Nadu. Si=
milarly, the holy town of Mantralaya in Andhra Pradesh is very prasidhdha f=
or spiritual growth as well. I think I saw an email from Sri Narasimha on a=
 Hanuman temple
in Gujarat.

We all know about famous temples like Tirupati=
 or Vaishno Devi,
but I am sure there are many forests, towns, etc where ma=
ny 
realized souls still visit or live and which are known to few
but not t=
o others.
I would like to use the collective wisdom of you all to compile
a=
 list of such from what you know first hand or from other folks.
I think su=
ch a list will be useful if anyone wants to plan
a spiritual tour of India.=
 

Please do share your knowledge if you are aware of any.

Regards.
