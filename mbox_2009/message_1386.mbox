ster this. 
 
Some may be fascinated by the texture, color and volume of th=
e chaff and miss the grain.
 
Most people who talk about mantra shastra foc=
us on the chaff and not on the grain.

I me=
ntioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mantras and tech=
nicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar wh=
o will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras an=
d all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen te=
chnicalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god. Th=
at is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works=
 slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.
 
Also, comma=
nding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, w=
hich can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually an=
d suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as god=
s is possible only for a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely s=
mall ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achieve=
ment. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in com=
pletely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat =
something from the previous mail to clarify:
 
The universe has many lokas =
(planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite=
 karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite=
 possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill=
 it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mi=
nd constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of=
 self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of e=
nergy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes =
corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic int=
eractions between various objects.
 
Each set of "karmic interactions betwe=
en various objects" is a "result". Various mantras are for various "results=
". One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a spec=
ific result from it as "commanding a result" from god. Whether you like the=
 term or not, it is essentially that.
 
*        *        *
 
But the botto=
mline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command s=
pecific results from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but=
 acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set b=
y Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by r=
ishis are meant for such sadhakas.
 
Those are hardly of use to so many peo=
ple out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot=
 command specific results from god (because of their heavy attachment to th=
e result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), e=
ven if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated=
 rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalitie=
s, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at God's door.
 
Jus=
t pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worr=
ying about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to =
the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, =
take whatever and whenever he gives.
 
Keep praying every day or every seco=
nd when you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all=
 of your actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell your=
self that it is his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the=
 time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing =
of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra,=
 right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge com=
ing from questionable sources!).
 
*        *        *
 
There may be a mou=
ntain with thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead =
to a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a different =
scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a speci=
fic path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is us=
eless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego=
). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy=
, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person wit=
h very little ego).
 
Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can=
 actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the moun=
tain and traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrol=
ogers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take cus=
tomized mantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a resul=
t quickly by doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. The =
power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obt=
ained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra=
 is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view show=
s a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have =
to survive the climb along the long path.
 
We need to emphasize the attitu=
de and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choi=
ce of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great sp=
iritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pick=
ing the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized havin=
g the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persist=
ence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and usefu=
l than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impres=
s god.

You can do anyday. Parasara does not=
 mention any day for doing homam to a graha.
 
In fact, if one wants, one c=

If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine.=
 But saying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers becau=

Parasara's definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighbori=
ng areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of fire and water elem=
ents. "I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta" is a wrong approac=
h. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars,=
 a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *t=
ransition* in a contiguous space.
 
In your example of upapada lord's tithi=
, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition.

Dear Sanjay,

> Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, =
I am dropping that

I do have a definition of gandanta, which is Parasara's=
 definition in BPHS.

Since some of you are extrapolating it based on the f=
ire embodied in UL and water embodied in tithis, the onus is on you to outl=
ine and justify your definition. I got into this thread because statements =
were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can caus=
e "insult to Vishnu", "serious doshas" and "danger to spouse", based on the=
se far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.

> Which is perfectly in line wi=
th everything I have learnt.

Well, you once taught that houses represent S=
un/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meanin=
gful. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a hous=
e, with Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is re=
ally in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).

BTW, I specific=
ally asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your own thinki=
ng or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context).=
 Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately and recently p=
ublicly, you did not respond.

First of all, Para=
sara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis based on an=
y arudhas or houses in a chart.

For doshas in birth chart or to get relief=
 from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of planets, he suggeste=
d various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform them. His sec=
tion on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not dismissing tho=
se remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly preparing ma=
nuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.

Parasara did *not=
* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homa=
s). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola =
dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. B=
ut the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.

Thus, the p=
rinciples I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.

Second, I said what I =
said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated principles that are =
not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people that performing=
 austerities such as fasting on certain days cause "danger to spouse" or "s=
erious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu", based on horoscope. I find these prin=

 that doing it on a "wrong day" does not cause danger as being suggested.

Third, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping various deities on var=

ity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is b=
ased on the deity and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give a=
n analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a =
specific day, a beggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedul=
e and mood of the giver is more important.

Choosing the day of a remedy ba=
sed on the deity is more important and the variations based on individual h=
oroscope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variat=
ions. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are ac=
tually well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question=
 over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable or=
igin and scaring people on that basis.

I did =
not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is l=
imited and we should take our limitations into consideration.

The universe=
 has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. Th=
ere are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, th=
ere are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control th=
e mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverbe=
rating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfe=
ct absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes =
by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) =
and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and correspo=
nding karmic interactions between various objects.

However, this variety o=
f mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not have s=
uch perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It =
is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence =
control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today=
. Most people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not work f=
or them as they are supposed to.

*        *        *

Just repeating a com=
bination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that =
certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. Tha=
t is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and anot=
her may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption=
 of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and=
 it is much more difficult than one may think.

*        *        *

A high=
ly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to command the king a=
nd get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging =
the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sure).

Similarly,=
 most people are better off begging god for what they want rather than tryi=
ng to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar does not nee=
d a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility =
and helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what help a begga=
r succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this=
 age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at =
god's door.

What people today need for material and spiritual progress thr=
ough remedial measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a be=
tter choice of tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, t=
ithi etc to command a specific result from god.

It is worth noting that so=
 many great spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not =
emphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they em=
phasized having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, pat=
ience, persistence, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more importan=
t and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc=
 and impress god.

*        *        *

One more thing. We have many mantra=
s given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to p=
ick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do =
not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming =
from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection=
. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irrespect=
ive of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th =
lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt=
 control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's astrolog=
ers, way beyond the scope of Parasara's guidelines.

If one has a sadguru, =
I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology =
theoretician.

If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pi=
ck any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) inst=
ead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is t=
he key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god's door. Choic=
e of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in being a=
 really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great scho=
lars.

Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari,=
 navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipa=
th, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make pr=
ogress if one develops the right attitude. Without the right attitude, even=
 an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.

*        *        *

I hope=
 this sufficiently clarifies my stand. I discuss these matters related to s=
piritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. Some writings are sam=
pled at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/writings.htm.

  Dear Narasimha,

  Since you do not have any=
 real definition of Gandanta, I am dropping that and continue with my belie=
f of the junction between Agni and Jala rasi as the case of gandanta and th=
e loka junctions. Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.=


  Two statements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and M=
antra Shastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out her=
e -

  1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as=
 the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results m=
aybe a bit delayed but will be there.
  2. Statement 2: *reciting any praye=
r* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy

  Is th=
is what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?

  Statement 1 is an a=
rrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no relevance as =
the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done on speci=
fic days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like anothe=
r astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like this coerced =
me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled but s=
uch pretexts to knowledge.

  Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire m=
antra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wastin=
g time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands of=
 mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is =
like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I t=
hink I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings=
 of the vedic seers.

  I think there is something wrong in the way you are=
 saying what you want to say. Please rethink and correct your statements fo=
r the sake of good record in this list.

  With Warm Regards
  Sanjay Rath

 worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the kar=
aka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by =
water element and fasting on UL lord's tithi brings the element of water (p=
rosperity and well-being) to one's marriage (UL)? One could even say that f=
asting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire=
 element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes "gandanta"!
 =
 > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Nar=
asimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother G=
ouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are=
 created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tith=
i lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.
  >>>>>> End quo=
te >>>>>>

  [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented =
by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).

  Thus, 12th house=
 is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya.=
 Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (=
and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associat=
ed with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod =
method in dasa judgment.

  Thus, it is actually more logical to say that 1=
2th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord im=
bibe the jala tattva of Moon.

  Is the above "*more correct* answer" based=
 on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?

  >>>>>> End quote >>>>>=

  [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expend s=
ome energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra. B=
ut the bottomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either with=
out or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope w=
e agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily restrained =
in effectiveness.

  <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<<

  [Narasimha] Puttin=
g a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. But the questi=
on is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in wat=
er, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.

  My point is that the=
 examples given have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.

=
  One can be creative and come up with a lot of theories. For example, one =
can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva =
(then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) =
and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water a=
nd fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moo=
n and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.

  It is not enough to show=
 some fire and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will =
engage in illogical extrapolations.

  <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
  > Three=

PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels =

  >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

  [Na=

 observe as things seem to come and go and do what they see as their dharma=
 with the things they seem to have.

  Just a factual correction though: I =
never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spiritual master=
 entered my life, my interest in other things went down (though I continued=
 to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I sa=
id that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gave me a tas=
k later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasara independently, med=
itate on them and share my interpretations with the world. He said I was ve=
ry passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the =
same now but dispassionately and without an attachment. He felt that I stil=
l have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unatta=
ched karma. His word is everything for me.

  What I told you recently is n=
ot that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said above.

  However, if your ju=
dgment is correct and if Jyotish is indeed "leaving" me, I am sure my spiri=
tual guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.

<<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
  > I can categorically declare one thing with u=
tmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or d=

ahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like=
 it!
  > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you seem to=
 be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not much=
 relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficial. F=

 choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the sam=
e) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days,=
 or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did =
not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are w=
rong, so I agree that what you say is right.

  >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

  =
[Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.

  Is all that is being taught an=
d practiced now strictly from "Puranas and other teachings of the seers"?

=
  I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is some =
difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.

  To make khoa, whet=
her one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow=
 or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it is second=
ary. To say that "danger" and "serious doshas" (see the quoted mails for su=
ch claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong ch=
oice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross exaggeration.

=
  The main thing is that you need milk and sugar. If one is confused by end=
less claims of khoa making consultants and ends up not making khoa at all, =
that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick some milk or the othe=
r, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but =
the job will be done.

  I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humb=
ly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fas=
ting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause "danger" and "ser=
ious doshas". No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and =
dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not h=
elp our cause!

  Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell it or ov=
erplay the importance...

  <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
  > Gem stones may h=
arm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vr=
ata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your body can take fast=
ing, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too many calculations.
 =

  > [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a =
baby or one who cannot conceive and this is kept for some period before the=
 appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you=
 are mistaking abstinence from physical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so=
 different.

  >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

  [Narasimha] Of course, brahmachar=
ya is much more, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy i=
s a good enough austerity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of tim=

 meditation and homam.

one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a =
vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and =
meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take=
 a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a few mon=
ths or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the=
 duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there=
 is nothing like it!
  > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but =
then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seer=
s is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritual=
ly beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL=
 days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all t=
ithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and the=
n in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or mayb=
e (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cann=
ot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.

  > If yo=
u keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make positive progress towards achi=
eving your purpose and definitely not go backwards, irrespective of what is=
 said by technical calculations based on our half-baked Jyotish knowledge.

  > My friends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, bu=
t do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord im=
portant? So many planets may have so many kinds of influence on UL in a cha=
rt. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage. There may be various=
 influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lord=
's weekday missing some important factors? Quite possible!
  > 
  > [Sanjay=
 Rath:] That is a very nasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives=
 (*imperfect, corrupted*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use na=
sty statements? Can=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you say things nicely?

 =
 > Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told=
 me two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it =
is getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyo=
tish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different=
 levels of their understanding and intelligence.

  > If you have the =
time to listen to the Jaimini Lectures at http://sohamsa.com/js/ do so as i=
t will show you the depths of this knowledge you cannot imagine exists in j=
yotish. The derivation of the chnhandas and what not all. Thumb rules are m=
eant for beginners. The day you decided to give up jyotish, you got stuck i=
n the thumb rules but then its ok with me. I always wished you the best in =
whatever you do.
  > 
  > But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection,=
 if a thumb rule allows you to pick an austerity with confidence and create=
 the mental feeling that you are doing the best possible thing for your sit=
uation, it is good. After all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity t=
o burn the blocking karma, with a positive frame of mind about what you are=
 doing.
  > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] No Narasimha, very happy marriages can happ=
en, without austerities as well.

complicated technicalities evolving from the thumb rule are creating doubts=
 and confusion in the minds of people as they consider an austerity, that i=
s useless and totally missing the point.

t to heavy theorization based on very shaky grounds. I suggest going back t=
o the basics, thinking clearly and keeping things simple.
  > 
  > [Sanjay =
Rath:] Human brains work differently in seeking the truth and means to reme=
dy the errors. Life is too complicated to keep everything simple. For examp=
le, a heavily cursed Venus can block everything and UL fast may not be able=
 to solve the problem. Now would you say that heavy thoerization and compli=
cation is happening and we should ignore the other factors completely?
  > =

  > Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like praye=
rs, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If yo=
ur body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too=
 many calculations.
  > 
  > [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someon=
e planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive and this is kept for s=
ome period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for m=
arriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from physical union as Brahm=
acharya. Oh no its so different.
