Pujya Ashwinji,
I fully support your narration.I have read newspaper column=
 accounts and heard from elders about Sri Sri Ashwatthaamaa roaming in fore=
sts spread on River Narmadaji's(or Revaji as called by many people ) flow p=
ath. As you have mentioned several pious beings have encountered Sri Sri As=
hwatthaamaa in the month of Shraawana in monsoon.The description I have hea=
rd about him is a very very tall man with impressive beard and exuding so m=
uch of Teja that ordinary mortals can not look at the face.Many elders who =
do " Reva parikramaa" have seen him from some distance.Occassional mention =
of Bhagwaan Parashuraama being sighted in this region of BHARUCH & RAJPIPAL=
A districts are there.Incidentally, BHARUCH name is the corrupted from the =
Sanskrit Bhrugu Kachha and these area is regarded as Rishi Bhumi and known =
Tapovana of divine eminences like Maharshi Bhrugu,Jamadagni,Mahavidushi Anu=
suyaaji and Parashuraama is spread in 100 Kilometers radius with Bharuch as=
 the
 centre point.No wonder that even Saints like KABIRJI have tread this =
region for seeking spiritual enhancement.There are many folk-lores surround=
ing this reagion but I am stopping here.

To honour your call for a brief=
 introduction :
Amit Yagneshkumar Trivedi is a mortal seeker holding Master=
s in=A0 Chemistry,Management and Mass Communications with a Ph.D.in Medicin=
al Chemistry.Professionally involved in Research & Development of Drugs and=

Dear Sir,

pious by heart. They both talked in Sanskrit only.=A0 Ashwasthama first tol=

=A0from my forehead Scar which is never to be cured as Lord Krishna has cur=

This is a fact and not immaginory story as the person who told me h=

Ujjain was once the capital of great king V=
