Dear Rajesh,

Good question!

You may be very true when you said Freewill m=
ay not be what we think freewill to be.

I remembered some dialogues of Ora=
cle in Matrix reloaded. (She says, you already made a choice. It is just th=
at you need to realise your choice).

Our problem is that we try to assume =
only one of the contradicting things are possible.

Looking at analogy pres=
ented by Narasimha, future may indeed may have happened. How ever, who said=
 there can only be one future?
There may be multiple versions of the same m=
ovie (one for US, one for India, one for Tamil, one for Telugu etc.). Our f=
reewill may let us decide which movie you are going to see.

A learned pers=
on may know what will happen if you use our free will in a specific know.

=
The eventual question now is can a saintly person foresee with confidence o=
f how I will excersize my freewill (he can perhaps foresee what will happen=
 if I choose to excersize my freewill in a particular way. But, does he alr=
eady know how I will excersize it)?

Best regards,
Vijay

once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshi=
na Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after=
 poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite diffe=
rent from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel=
 satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in word=
s as "I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave" filled=
 my entire consciousnss.

e garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaal=
i idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the p=

 time did I feel that intense shakti.

 meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all the different h=

master's property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the=
 best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not pos=
sess or what is out of one's control.
