Hare Krishna
Dear Murahariv,
It is my understanding that for each class of men
there are(were) different standards, regulations for
each.
Kings and such were allowed to have multiple wives .
For one, because they were able to adequately provide
for them.
In Srimad Bhagavatam, many kings, also took
vanaprastha and went to the forest to practice
spiritual penance and austerities, and prepared for
leaving their bodies.
There is a nice story about the different ashrams in
life, in Srimad Bhagavatam see the one on King Yayati.
Also King Rahugana,Prataparudra(sp?),and many more.
Best wishes
Lakshmi
