Namasthe Narasimha garu

I have observed that only two deities have their Lower Right Hands (out of
the four), bent downwards. For all other deities/avataras, the lower right
hand is upwards.
These are Balaji(Venkateswara) and Chottanikkara Bhagavati. I may be wrong
in saying only these dieties.
Please calrify the meaning of this. And also is there a connection between
these two dieties.

Thanks
Srinivasa
