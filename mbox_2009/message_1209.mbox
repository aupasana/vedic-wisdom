Heh, well said! Bt=
w, I know of at least one person who has been doing a homa of lord shiva fo=
pr the last ten years daily. He lives in a very remote location, away from =
people. He does a lot of other sadhanas too, but this is one thing he does =
daily. A renunciate.




The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva=

Namaste ray.siya1@yahoo. com !

As =
everybody knows, traditionally Lord Shiva (In Linga form) is 
mostly worshi=
ped with Water/Milk Abhishek.

Technically speaking, Fire worship would be =
better, in my opinion as 
you know that Fire is the un-currepted element le=
ft besides Ether. 
i.e. Fire element is more purer than water element in th=
e current 
times.

Let's try worshiping him with 'Fire'.

Warm Regards,

Ut=
pal
pS: Vo to Bhole Baba hai. Jyada Nakhare nahi dikhate. bhakto ne 
Dhatur=
e ka phul chadhaya to usise khush ho jate hain. Chahe Agani me 
bulao ya Pa=
ani me snaan karao, He'll be always happy :)
