Dear Anooj,

I dont know about your background, but, typically, for most of=
 us, we would either not be performing any of the homams or at best perform=
ing or participating in it once in a year. So, our next step should be prac=
tical and enable us to cultivate the niyama of performing it everyday witho=
ut any obstacles. Keeping this in mind, I myself started performing Mahagan=
apathi Homam everyday. Doing homam for all gods can be cumbersome and more =
importantly to introduce the concept of niyama, which includes sticking to =
one god. So, options a & b are ruled out. I suggest c.

Regards
-Narayan-
