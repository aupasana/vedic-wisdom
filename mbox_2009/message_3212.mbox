Dear Sriram,
=C2=A0
A few points. You said:
=C2=A0
He considers Geeta as th=
e absolute reference and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about it i=
n Geeta, it is actually not worth discussing 
=C2=A0
And then

He also quot=
es Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adhering to non-veg. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0=

Krishna does not speak of Jesus/Muhammed or Sai Baba in the Gita.=C2=A0So =
he is contradicting himself if he says that he only consideres what is ment=
ioned in the=C2=A0Gita as worth discussing. 
=C2=A0
In Chapter 9, Text 26, =
Krishna says, =E2=80=9CIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a fl=
ower, fruit or water, I will accept it.=E2=80=9D Ask your friend, why does =
not Krishna mention a non vegitarian food as offering? 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Krish=
na also talks about satwik food being the best.=C2=A0Ask him to provide exa=
mples from the Gita (since your friend consideres it the best) where Krishn=
a says that non - vegetarian food=C2=A0is considered sattwik? If not, and h=
e is still eating=C2=A0it that simply means, like 99.99 percent other non-v=
egetarians, he is deluding himself with lame excuses. The mind plays tricks=
 on every addict and non-vegetarians eat non veg mainly because they are ad=
dicted to the taste of non-vegetarian food. Like smoking, its an addiction.=
 Not easy to get rid off.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0Speaking about=C2=A0increases sattwa=
 guna, vegetarian food sure does that far better than non-vegetarian food. =
Aurobindo mentions the same in his own personal observations. He was a non-=
vegetarian intially.Vegeratian food=C2=A0increases a sense of purity in the=
 body and mind. I had been a hard core non-vegetarian untill a few months b=
acks. Therefore I speak from experience. Veg food surely inculcates a sense=
 of purity in the mind and body, far more than non - vegetarian food. If he=
 contradicts this, ask him to turn veg for 6 months and see for himself. Un=
less he has tried it, he won't understand.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Lastly, if he is g=
enuinely interested in his spiritual progress and engages in serious sadhan=
a, it is best to leave non veg food because:
=C2=A0
1) Non veg can=C2=A0rea=
ct VERY violently with the system when you engage in serious sadhana. (spea=
king from practical experience)
=C2=A0
2) Once a non-vegetarian shifts to v=
egetarian food, he will lose taste for food. Trust me on this. Therefore ea=
ting will become more like brushing your teeth in the morning, a necessary =
ritual but nothing to look forward to. This in turn helps a LOT to overcome=
 one of the three most powerful enemies IMO=C2=A0- food, sleep, lust. There=
fore 
if=C2=A0his desperation is genuine for spiritual progress, he should =
definitely give up non-vegetarian food for good.
=C2=A0
3) For a non-vegeta=
rian person, giving up non-vegetarian food can act as a test of your will p=
ower and discipline which in term helps you that little bit more in your pe=
rsonal sadhana.
=C2=A0

er try to argue with a non-vegetarian eater using science based arguments. =
If a person has inherent spiritual tendencies, he can be changed from a non=
-veg eater to a veg eater in time, with constant effort.=C2=A0If a person i=
s not spiritual and eats non-veg food, only God can change his/her mind. No=
 amount of arguments will be of any avail in that case because for every ar=
gument one gives, a non-veg eater will have a counter argument.

Namaste,


I am a f=
irm believer of Veg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to spi=
ritual growth. But, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some s=
piritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food,=
 he has put a counter argument. He says that if I can find him a single shl=
oka on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would give up.=C2=A0


So, if anybody on t=
his group can help me find the quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta=
 as the absolute reference and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken abou=
t it in Geeta, it is actually not worth discussing whether or not you take =
non-veg. If anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can bec=
ome vegetarian.


He also quotes Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adher=
ing to non-veg. If any of you know the counter argument, please help.


Bes=
t Regards,
Sriram
