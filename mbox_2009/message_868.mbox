Namaste Rajarshi Bhai,

Is it not akin t=
o offering clothes to the invoked diety? if for 
example, one offers 'Saree=
' in the Homa fire during chandi Homam, it 
may mean that one is great devo=
tion, offering Saree to the Mother 
Chandika. Like a Son/Daughter brings Sa=
ree for his/her own Mother.

just the way i thought about it and you also w=
ould have thought the 
same.

Regards,

Utpal
