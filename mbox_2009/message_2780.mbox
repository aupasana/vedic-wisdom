Dear Narasimha,

1.=A0  =A0 =A0Fortunately or unfortunatel=
y you have repeatedly broken
the decorum yourselves.=A0

2.=A0 =A0 =A0While=
 it has been told explicitly in a mail addressed to
you, that the debate is=
 over as far as you are concerned, you continue
to send me mails on the sam=
e topic, without any reason whatsoever.


3.=A0 =A0 =A0By virtue of my spen=
ding precious time on writing these
mails, I have a right to exercise on wh=
om I entertain for further
discussion.

4.=A0 =A0 If you are left with even=
 a little respect for the
individuality of another person, please ensure th=
at you don't send
unsolicited intercepting mails particularly when your nam=
e has not been
mentioned inside the mail.

5.=A0 =A0 If you are interested =
in propagating your ideas, take up a
new thread, on a part of the mail and =
invite responses or criticism or
what ever you want to.

6.=A0 =A0 =A0You h=
ave no right to tell others that they have a
limited understanding - as you=
 just did in your mail on Ahamkara =3D
Asmita - till you are an omniscient =
being yourselves.


7.=A0 =A0 If you tried this sort of a thing again, I wi=
ll ensure that
I don't reply to any of your mails ever again.


8.=A0 =A0 I=
f you don't give space to members, then, as a moderator,
you won't ever be =
able to achieve the "state of discipline and decorum"
and "participation of=
 group members" at the same time.

9.=A0 =A0The only persons whom I conside=
r as "still active in Gyan
Marg debate" include:

a. Sundeep
b. UtpalJi

c.=
 probably those who have not yet replied.

10.=A0 =A0=A0 As far as a ban or=
 moderation is concerned, there is no
dearth of people, nor is it an issue =
to run a yahoo group of ones' own.
We all know the fate of heavily moderate=
d groups, like "sohamsa".
Regards,
Nitish
