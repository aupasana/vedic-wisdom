Namaste,

1) Yes. Take a combined sankalpa to do the two homas, do one and move on to 
the other without doing uttarangam and poorvaangam.

2) When you are done with pradhana homam of one deity, offer naivedyam and 
neeraajanam and move on to invoke the next deity in fire. After finishing 
all deities, you can do uttaraangam once and finally one poornaahuti for all 
of them together.

Some people offer a small poornaahuti to each deity (without doing 
uttaraangam) before moving on to the next deity. At the very end, after 
uttaraangam, they do a combined final poornaahuti. But that is not needed.

3) The dry havan samagri powder is also good for Saturn. Saturn likes dry 
powdery things. Parasara maharshi recommends havischoornam.

The wood of Sami tree (Prosopis Cineraria), also known in Hindi as Jand 
tree, was particularly recommended by Maharshi Parasara for Sani. 
Unfortunately, it may not be easy to get in US and UK. So do with whatever 
wood or dry coconut pieces you normally use.

Though this is not mentioned in any book I have read, my intuition tells me 
(and I have tried it with a positive experience) that ashwagandha (withania 
somnifera root) powder can be offered to Saturn in moderation. Ashwagandha 
is a saattwik and rejuvenating herb that relieves one of vaata and weakness.

4) Various auspicious materials like various sugandha dravyas can be used. 
Various materials that are offered in homam, like sesame seeds, puffed rice, 
parched rice, juwar dhani (pelaalu in Telugu), jaggery, turmeric, sandalwood 
powder, pomegranate seeds, havan samagri powder, cashews, almonds, raisins, 
dates etc can placed along with a dry coconut (full or half) in a cloth, the 
cloth can be wrapped into one bundle and that can be offered as poornaahuti. 
Do whatever makes you feel good. But one dry coconut full/half is enough. 
Instead of a coconut, a fruit like an apple or a peach can also be offered 
as poornaahuti (symbol of head, i.e. ego). But it may need some wood and 
ghee to burn fully and also create a lot of smoke. Dry coconut burns easily.

The most important thing is to imagine that you have surrendered your ego to 
the Lord and nothing exists except the Lord. Focus your mind on the deity 
with as few thoughts as you can and meditate for 10-20 minutes. I see a lot 
of learned priests getting up and leaving as soon as poornaahuti is done. 
That is a mistake. Design your homam in such a way that you are able to 
spend 10-20 minutes meditating after poornaahuti. Sit in front of the 
burning poornaahuti, try to fotget everything including your body and 
meditate as deeply as you can.

Best regards,
Narasimha
