Namaste,
=C2=A0
(1) Your first question is a valid one. Yogis with a deep s=
ense of realization have supported that restriction. Though I myself am not=
 fully convinced, still I suggest following the restriction.
=C2=A0
In gene=
ral, I can say this. God is always in the heart. Just as Sun is always in t=
he sky, even when clouds block Him, similarly God is always in the heart, e=
ven when various things block one from seeing Him. It is our conditioning, =
our attitudes, our priorities and our thinking that act as the cloud separa=
ting us from God.
=C2=A0
For one who is able to see God in heart, there are=
 hardly rules. It is people who are trying to remove the clouds of conditio=
ning that block one from seeing the Sun of God, who need to follow rules an=
d do various kinds of sadhana.
=C2=A0
Some rules are designed in tradition =
conservatively, in order to prevent some potentially problematic situations=
. It may be acceptable to break them in some situations, but it will be wis=
e to follow them when one is unsure.
=C2=A0
(2) You are right. There is no =
need to have a kalasha (water pot) or an idol. One can invoke god only in f=
ire.
=C2=A0
(3) People who do rituals expecting some raajasik or taamasik r=
esults of a selfish nature (e.g. "I should become a millionnaire", "my enem=
y should get " etc) will face the wrath of gods when they fall. One who sur=
renders to the deity and does a ritual for saattwik purposes (e.g. "for the=
 pleasure of so and so deity", "for the increase of dharma in the world" et=
c) need not fear. Even a very strict and disciplinarian parent will not yel=
l at a selfless child who tries sincerely and fails. In fact, people doing =
rituals selflessly are so few that gods will be missing such people in thus=
 age. They will be very pleased with each additional person who does it!
=
=C2=A0
(4) What I mentioned regarding falling to lust applies to all people=
 and all sadhanas. As one progresses spiritually, one may be tested by natu=
re by being placed in increasingly difficult situations that provoke lust, =
anger etc in one. The shadripus (six internal enemies - lust, anger etc) ar=
e not easy to conquer. Even if one floors them a big blow, they always get =
up and come up with an even better effort than before. Persistence is neede=
d to overcome. Men and women are slightly different in the matter of lust. =
Women usually have better control over lust than men, but, when they lose c=
ontrol, it can be a difficult problem.
=C2=A0
However, please remember that=
 passing the tests and being able to resist all temptations that provoke lu=
st, anger etc is needed for self-realization.
=C2=A0
(5) Chandi homam is ve=
ry good, but do not jump into it if you are scared.
=C2=A0

Na=
rasimha

      If god is within us and we call god from o=
ur heart in fire then why can't a woman with periods do homam.What happens =
to the god in the woman's heart during periods?I find this confusing and ne=
ed clarification.



This might sound silly but I amn't able to understand =
that during homam why should we invoke the diety in the idol when we are al=
ready invoking the diety in the fire. So far I have done my homams without =
invoking the diety in idol.



I want to do chandi homam but after reading =
list of rules (like one shouldn't yawn, not hold the book in hand, sitting =
place should be very clean, no singing of mantras, pronouncing mantras prop=
erly etc ) am a bit scared. Also in the manual you have mentioned women sho=
uldn't fall to lust while doing chandi homam. Can you please put more light=
 into this? What will be the consequences if a woman fails? 

 My parents a=
re advising me not to do any complicated rituals as one can face anything b=
ut not the wrath of god. Kindly advice.



Regards and thanks,

Shraddha
