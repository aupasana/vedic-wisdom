Sir,
I have not completed my postings on this subject. I have just started =
quoting some texts from Smruties and Puranas. I am aware that the posting c=
ontains certain quotations which might look either =A0out of context or not=
 in line with the thinking of the intellectuals of to-day. Let us at least =
know how the Rishis of Bharathavarsha=A0=A0 visualised =A0 as to how a true=
 Brahman should conduct himself.
G.Balasubramanian

"San=
skrit commentaries" are not a panacea free from these lines of
thinking. In=
 South India, the dharma-shAstra most-widely "followed"
was written by Apas=
tamba. Certainly, his dharma-shAstra and a sanskrit
commentary upon it, bel=
ieve in varnA by birth, and prAyashcitta for
association with Shudras. Thos=
e who are interested can look at the
following sutras -- 1.1.4, 1.1.6, 1.1.=
32, 2.9.9, 2.9.11. After talking
about birth into a varNa, Apastamba also t=
alks about birth by
knowledge, brought about by a true guru (1.1.10 - 1.1.1=
8). This is
said to be superior to the "mere birth of the body from the par=
ents".
The context makes it clear that this is sub-category of the earlier
=
classification, and is not a contradiction.

All that aside, it doesn't rea=
lly matter. The world has changed.

bhavadiiyaH,

ajit
