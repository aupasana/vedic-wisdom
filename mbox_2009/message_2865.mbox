Dear Murahari,
 
Good questions. Of course, each story metaphorically repre=
sents some absolute truths.
 
1) Shiva is the supreme consciousness. Parvat=
i shows Kundalini or self-awareness in Moolaadhaara chakra, which is the so=
urce of all duality. One's self-awareness creates an entity called self-int=
erest. Though this self-interest operating in the material plane (moolaadha=
ara chakra) is created by the self-awareness in the field of duality, it is=
 originally from supreme consciousness (i.e. Shiva is the father of Ganesha=
). But it is not aware of that. This self-interest considers it its job to =
stop self-awareness from merging with the supreme consciousness. Supreme co=
nsciousness is forced to kill this self-ineterest in order to merge with on=
e's self-awareness. Notions like "I need this", "I have to do that" stop on=
e's self-awareness from merging with the infinite and limit one's self-awar=
eness to being aware of the material plane. When such notions are destroyed=
, one's self-awareness can be established in the infinite and supreme consc=
iousness.
 
However, when a yogi's self-awareness returns from the infinite=
 to the material plane, that self-interest needs to be brought back to life=
. However, self-interest of such a yogi is more sublime and expanded than b=
efore!
 
The original boy who was killed by Shiva was merely a boy who was =
guarding his mother. The new boy who was brought back to life was respected=
 by the whole world. The original self-interest of a person makes one too a=
ttached to the material plane and stops self-awareness from merging with th=
e infinite. The self-interest recreated by a yogi who experienced the infin=
ite is not so limited and covers the whole world. Such a yogi's self-intere=
st makes him engage in the right actions to safeguard not only his material=
 interests, but do one's dharma for the betterment of the entire world and =
merge with the infinite. Unlike the original boy guarding moolaadhaara chak=
ra, Ganesha brought back to life by Shiva guards Moolaadhaara chakra and th=
e entire sushumna naadi.
 
2) Throat has visuddhi chakra and it contains th=
e element of ether. Elements of air, water and earth can be defiled with im=
purity. But the element of ether is ever pure and untouched by impurities. =
If any poison that is released as a part of one's sadhana - search for the =
nectar of the bliss of sat-chid-aananda - affects elements below the elemen=
t of ether, it will create some destruction and problems. But if it is limi=
ted to ether and not allowed to come in contact with air etc, it has no bad=
 effect.
 
3) Raama is an incarnation of Vishnu corresponding to Sun, who s=
hows soul. Raama symbolizes aatmaa or soul (Aatmaaraama).
 
Sugriva is a so=
n of Sun and stands for dharma. Griva means neck, which contains visuddhi c=
hakra, and Sugriva means one with a good neck, i.e. a pure one. Sygriva sta=
nds for purity and dharma.
 
Vali is a son of Indra, who shows the power of=
 indriyas (sense pleasures). Vaali also means the strong one. He symbolizes=
 the strong trap of senses and one's pride in oneself. When that humbles on=
e's purity and dharma, it is a tough battle for purity and dharma! In other=
 words, purity and dharma is no match for pride and trap of senses.
 
>From =
the perspective of soul or Aatman, the distinction betweem good and bad and=
 divine and demoic is very thin. That is why saints who have risen above th=
e mind and established in the imperishable and infinite Aatman show very li=
ttle differentiation between rich and poor, saintly and evil and show the s=
ame love and compassion towards a saint and a sinner. It is tough for aatma=
n to distinguish between (1) dharmik and pure attitude and (2) vain and pro=
ud attitude under the influence of senses. That is why Raama is confused wh=
o is Vaali and who is Sugriva.
 
The pride and trap of senses is tough to c=
onfront. If the soul (i.e. the identification with the infinite Aatman rath=
er than a body or a mind) confronts it, it enhances the pride. To put it in=
 simple words, even thinking that "I am the infinite aatman" may makes one =
proud of one's infiniteness, which actually finitizes one. In other words, =
Vaali being confronted by AatmaaRaama would strengthen Vaali and weaken Aat=
maaRaama. Thus, this pride and trap of senses needs to be tacked indirectly=
 and subtly.
 
Your questions are good and answers are not easy convey in s=
imple words, but I tried. Hope it made some sense.
 
Best regards,
Narasimh=

on Puranic stories

  Namaste, 

  1) For lord Shiva, there is no concept o=
f time. However in the story of "Birth of Ganesha", it's mentioned that Shi=
va cuts off Ganesha's head for he "fails" to recognize Ganesha as his Son. =
Why did Shiva, who is the Lord of Kaala, fail to recognize Ganesha? 
  Is i=
t anything to do with Shiva, tacitly trying to re-design Ganesha, who has b=
een created by Parvati, with an Elephant Head and there-by telling all of u=
s that to evolve spiritually, the mortal beings require elephantine memory =
or something like that? 

  Is there any hidden meaning in that story? 

  =
2) In Ksheera Sagara manthana story, when halahala comes out of churning th=
e ocean, Shiva consumes it and stores it in his throat. Why throat only? Wh=
y not stomach or any other part of parama purusha? 

  Are our spiritual ma=
sters any way saying that Throat is somehow linked to Visuddha, which is in=
turn linked to overcoming of sadness and hence when one evolves spiritually=
, sadness is overcome. Is there any spiritual signification to this story o=
f consuming poison and holding it in "Throat"?

  3.  Lord Rama is a purna =
avatara and he could have easily distinguished between Vali and Sugriva. If=
 so, why did Rama ask Sugriva to wear a mala to distinguish between Vali an=
d Sugriva and also why did Rama have to kill Vali while hiding behind the t=
ree? (Vali having a mali which can weaken the opponent looks very trivial)
=

  Thanks & Regards,
  --Murahari
