Talk 548.

A visitor asked Sri Bhagavan (in writing) the following question=
s: (1) Were
the differences in the world simultaneous, with creation? Or ar=
e they of
later growth? (2) Is the Creator impartial? Then why is one born =
lame,
another blind, and so on? (3) Are the eight Dikpalas, thirty-three cr=
ores of
gods and the seven rishis existent even today?

M.: Refer these que=
stions to yourself and the answer will be found.

After a pause, Sri Bhagav=
an continued: if we first know our Self then all
other matters will be plai=
n to us. Let us know our Self and then enquire
concerning the Creator and c=
reation. Without first knowing the Self, to seek
knowledge of God, etc., is=
 ignorance.

A man suffering from jaundice sees everything yellow. If he te=
lls others
that all things are yellow who will accept his statement?


The =
creation is said to have an origin. How? Like a tree and the seed from
whic=
h it has grown. How was the seed produced? From a similar tree. Where is
th=
e end to the series of questions? Therefore one must know one=92s Self
befo=
re the world is known.
