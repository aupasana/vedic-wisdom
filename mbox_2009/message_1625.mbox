Namaste

I am quoting an analysis done by a very learned individual, on som=
e aspects of the Vedic times. One my find it an interest read.

The possibl=
e extent of India in the past.

"The earth's landmass to the extent known t=
o Indians was quite extended and was known interchangeably as their own cou=
ntry or the world...


1. Geography:
The political boundary of India was im=
material. The whole landmass known to Indians was known both as "Bharata" a=
nd "Vishwa" interchangeably, as per the scriptures. This mythology is maint=
ained in history insofar as playwright Kalidasa's works are concerned. Ther=
e are no movement restrictions imposed by the army of any king in the journ=
ey of Shakuntala or, much later, of Arjuna. Even mudraas (currency) are the=
 same everywhere they go. If not, they must be fully convertible at whateve=
r exchange rates were prevalent at that time (I did not read about such con=
vertibility though).

=95 2. Moral science:
When Krishna tells Arjuna, "=
360;्वधर्मे निध=
नम् श्रेयः प=
352;धर्मो भयावह=
ः (it's better to die doing one's own duty than attempt the job of so=
mebody else, which is fraught with danger)," does he mean non-Kshatriyas ar=
e non-Hindus? No, clearly "dharma" means duty here -- in Arjuna's case, Ksh=
atriya-specific duty (that to fight the enemy) -- not religion.

=95 3. Rel=
igion:
Back to Kalidasa, religion-wise, Gandhaara and Siam have been depict=
ed to have the same gods and goddesses as today's India. The corollary: the=
re was no other religion to talk about. 

=95 4. Sociology:
Before casteist=
 Manu, the dos and don'ts were not strictly defined. Yet certain things wer=
e taboo and, by that definition, irreligious. Cannibalism, for example. I h=
ave mentioned Kaliya Yaman already. The Mahabharata says many people in his=
 kingdom were cannibals. Which means the Vedas couldn't possibly have been =
followed in the region that is now known as the Middle East. However, you c=
annot call the citizens of another country criminals because they do not fo=
llow your country's laws. That means, the Vedic laws applied to the Middle =
East, but the people living in that region didn't give it a damn. Thus, tha=
t region was a renegade province and not a foreign country.

=95 5. Linguis=
tics:
(a) If you study Sanskrit grammar you will appreciate that it's far m=
ore detailed than Latin. The eight wibhaktis and several exceptions* in eac=
h are somewhat paralleled only by seven such classifications in Arabic. You=
 may note that details in grammar diminish gradually as we move westward. A=
rabic nominative, genitive and accusative are explicit and varied whereas a=
blative, locative, dative and instrumental cases are only implied, not cate=
gorised as such. Sambodhana (address) is not considered a case in Arabic. G=
reek has less details and some flaws in categorisation of cases. Latin has =
the least details. 

(b) The dwiwachana (dual) number in between singular a=
nd plural was prevalent in Ancient Greek (more similarities in Indo-Europea=
n languages: http://www.friesian.com/cognates.htm). Arabic is Afro-Asiatic,=
 not Indo-European, but it has the dual number too. In Africa, some modern =
dialects have the dual number, but in ancient times, there was no language =
contemporary as well as literary in Africa corresponding to Arabic in Asia.=
 And only advanced languages have the dual. So how come grammarians in the =
stretch between India and Greece through Arabia made rules that were so sim=
ilar? And why did the details disappear or reduce drastically in Latin? Why=
 are roots less scientifically graded in Greek? No philologist has the answ=
er. They only guesstimate Sanskrit, Greek and Latin may have had a common r=
oot**.

* {a classic example of exceptions within the same wibhaktis in San=
skrit: It's अहं मम मितî=
1;रस्य गृहे गच&=
#2381;छामि (I'm going to my friend's place), but &#=
2348;ुद्धम् शरणम=
;् गच्छामि (lit.: I'm going=
 in the path/to the shelter of the Buddha; in proper English: I'm seeking t=
he Buddha/embracing Buddhism) and not बुद्ध&#=
2360;्य शरणे गच्é=
1;ामि! Note that "of" =96 `-sya' in the first instance bu=
t `-am' in the second; "to" =96 `-e' in the first but `-am' in the second}
=

Therefore the four classical languages show similar thought processes. ** =
The "common root" of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin can be researched further fr=
om the papers of Asiatic Society, Park Street, Kolkata. They do not claim A=
rabic to have the same root. Neither do I. I am simply intrigued by the sim=
ilar studies of cases in Sanskrit and Arabic. 

All the above together indi=
cate that the then world as known to Indians behaved like a singular countr=
y defined by a single culture, albeit the influence of India reduced as we =
moved westward."
