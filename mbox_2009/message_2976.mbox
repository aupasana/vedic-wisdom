 NEIGHTBOUR: "Sir, is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life
of a householder?"

MASTER: "Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company
and pray unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the
mind are thus washed away, one realizes God.

The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet.The
needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears
wash away the mud, which is nothing but lust, anger, greed, and other evil
tendencies, and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well.

As soon as the mud is washed away, the magnet attracts the needle, that is
to say, man realizes God. Only the pure in heart see God. A fever patient
has an excess of the watery element in his system. What can quinine do for
him unless that is removed?

"Why shouldn't one realize God while living in the world? But, as I said, one
must live in holy company, pray to God, weeping for His grace, and now and
then go into solitude. Unless the plants on a foot-path are protected at
first by fences, they are destroyed by cattle."
