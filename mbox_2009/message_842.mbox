Shri Narasimha ji, Namaskar,
  This is a very good group you have started. =
thank you! Like other 
jigyasu, i too have several questions that books usu=
ally don't 
clarify much about. You have already mentioned the importance o=
f 
having pure heart,honesty of jaap and concentration on deity; and 
nothi=
ng else really matters, but I am eager to learn few gaun things 
that goes =
around the jaap procedure for me and others benefit.
  
  What is the need =
for utkilan of a mantra? if mantra and sound(or 
any akshar in varnamala) h=
ave its own energy to begin with. What is 
the effect of doing it or not do=
ing it? Its been said that sadashiva 
has locked *all* mantras,is it symbol=
ic? Does by all it meant *all* 
or just the mantras of 5 lower categories? =
Lots of people are 
suggesting they have had some signals of progress, how =
is that 
possible when mantras have been locked?

  What additional benefit=
s a sadhak may get by following proper 
procedure (viz aachaman,aangnyas, k=
arnyas,dikbandh,sankalp, stuti, 
mantra utkilan, mantra jap,homa, kshamapra=
rthana (not sure about 
order and steps?)). What are the gotchas and negati=
ve effects if not 
followed properly. what was the original intent of rishi=
-munis to 
follow/recommend a proper procedure? 

 What is the reason behin=
d Mantra jaap performing on one place with a 
particular pose? Scores of pe=
ople now chant/listen to mantra cds 
while driving? What are the effects of=
 such?

 What is the significance of Yantra? What is the significance of 
m=
aking yantra following particular sequence in drawing it? Theres 
been lots=
 of emphasis given to chant mantra infront of deity's 
yantra. I have also =
read about yantra construction to be made in 
certain order (viz lines have=
 to be erected in certain order) for it 
be qualified as yantra for a deity=
. Now a days there are premade 
(possibly pressed) copper yantras can be bo=
ught from merchants. What 
effect can it carry(or not carry). What is the p=
ossible test to 
identify if a yantra is praan prathistit?

 Does the # of =
words/letters of a mantra matters? Or should a 
possible addition/removal o=
f a bijakshar be performed before using 
it? Any mantra chant (or even ever=
y sentance spoken/written) is said 
to really move energy from one point to=
 the other. Sri Sanjay Rath ji 
mentioned this process as the # of words in=
 mantra would identify 
source house of the chart and # of letters would id=
entify destination 
house of the chart for energy movement. what # of words=
/letters in 
mantra are not advisable? 

 Should a person look for a mantra=
s that are more fruitful to that 
person? There are elaborate suitable mant=
ra identification mechanisms 
that helps a person identify a more fruitful =
mantra (to him/her), and 
even mantras one should not attempt. Should such =
path not be chosen? 
if getting closer to god is the key, and each person m=
ay have several 
leads in several births, why not pick the route that is/ar=
e optimal?

 How do we identify correct laya of a mantra. should every mant=
ra be 
pronounced in certain laya (intonation?) as hinted in chaanda (am i =

correct?). You also have a humming of sri gayatri mantra at your 
website.=
 Is this have to do with resonance of deity to the laya? 
There are some ot=
her mp3s of gayatri that use some other laya 
(http://www.omkarananda-ashra=
m.net/audio5.html) . how does laya of a 
mantra effects overall? Also, ther=
e are several mantra mp3 exists on 
web where pronouncer robotically reads =
a mantra, how good is that? is 
such plain reading of a mantra a good start=
? Or there is a generic 
laya that goes with anustup chaanda (most mantra f=
ollows this 
channda?) that you may advise, and possibly give a generic hum=
 for us 
to follow?
 
 Can you please post an easy,generic (but coverall) k=
shama prarthana 
in sanskrit? 

 Is there a possibiltiy for you to post a f=
ull video of full 
procedure of satyanarayan puja/homam of a somya devta et=
c? 

 Your help is most welcome! and thanks for everything.
