Namaste everyone, 

Objections overruled! :) Thank you ever so much.

I fee=
l truly humbled and blessed that you have replied to my post and quelled my=
 fears. I found the analogies very enlightening and I have reflected a lot =
upon your wise words of encouragement and I shall stop dilly-dallying asap.=
 

Aap sab ko koti koti dhanyawad.

e this is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the Chand=
i Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji's words. My desire to praise the Divine=
 Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we are c=
oming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to start with=
 the recitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing the hom=
am. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)

ou had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly=
 share how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter=
 objections from outside from fellow friends and family members who say tha=
t "the Chandi homam isn't part of the family tradition" hence the family de=
vta won't be pleased or "un-initiated people cannot perform such a high lev=
el ritual" or even "un-married people cannot get married if they do this on=
 a regularly basis"! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and=
 I am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  
> >

r to discard though, are personal objections that I create for myself..I ca=
ll it the "I-am-not-worthy-enough" syndrome. I am not confident of being ab=
le to stay completely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying t=
o say is that I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain=
 pure (unselfish) enough. At some point or another won't one end up automat=
ically asking for one's personal gains? After all, isn't it human nature to=
 confide everything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahi=
ye, please give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Bra=
hma's curse for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case=
, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to 'white-wash' one's selfish=
 motives?

ales about regular recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with 'Ku=
ndalini jagran', I am a bit worried. Can sadhana and 'kundalini jagran' eve=

only? Do they still have to undergo chakra awakening etc?
