Dear Sir,
It is said that Chandi Path can be done only after bathing. In th=
is regard I have some questions Sir.
1.Can I recite Chandi path at evening =
or at night after just washing my hands and feet? Or Bath is necessary?
2.I=
f somebody is coming at home and I have to attend him for half an hour, can=
 I continue the Chandi path from that completed chapter Or should I start f=
rom the first chapter again?
3.I=C2=A0am doing Chandi Homam with Kshir ( Bo=
iled milk with Rice) in Navratri=C2=A0but sometimes after offering Kshir, t=
he fire=C2=A0is going off. After reading your articles, now I will not offe=
r kshir as this is not good if fire goes off due to milk. Sir, Kshir offeri=
ng is necessary for mother? I had read somewhere so I was doing this. 
4.Ge=
nerally now a days the=C2=A0Deepak is enlighted in Stainless Steel.=C2=A0Is=
 it Ok or we should use copper or Brass for Deepak? 
Once we read something=
, our mind is=C2=A0questioning for what we are doing. This is why I have=C2=
=A0written this mail. 
With regards
=C2=A0Dr.Ashwin Rawal
