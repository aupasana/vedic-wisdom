Respected PVR ji,

I have been a avid follower of this group and learning m=
any things. My father passed away on 02/02/2009 in India and I, being the e=
ldest son, completed all the final rites and ceremonies, in the most religi=
ous possible way, observing all thithis. 

I have been wanting to do homam =
for my own peace of mind. My mother is of the view that homam should not be=
 performed at home and she also says that I should not also participate in =
any homam (taking sankalpam), while family priest is of the opinion that he=
 will do the homam for me in a temple premises. 

I would be thankful to ha=
ve your advice on the subject.

2. I am doing Yajur Vedhi 'Brahma Yagnam' (=
Bothayana Sutram, which I belong to) every day, which is offer of tarpana t=
o Deva, Rishi's and Pitru. Is this the same thing you mention as Pitri Tarp=
ana in Tarpana manual? Please advise. 

Thanks and Regards,
Shankar
