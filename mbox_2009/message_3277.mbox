Dear Rajarshi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 Thank you so much for writing such a detailed and prompt reply. You wrote =
it about 2-30 in the morning Indian time. That is the time to remain in bed=
 and dream.

=A0Reading it I felt joy and then sadness and disappointment. =
Then the word Yog-brasht strongly came in=A0 to my mind. My own life is tot=
ally dominated by Tulsidas and his Eashtdevji and His Grace

.I also turnof=
f when people start to say wrong things about Guru. Which sphere of Human r=
elations are pain and trouble free?? .Parents, siblings, husband, wife, tea=
chers, doctors, friends and so on. So if some so called spiritual guru chea=
ts us, so what? It is like a accident. We try to avoid it but it happened. =
I was in a forum where a famous Indian man who teaches Surya yog started to=
 say that you do not need a spiritual guru. I immediately left.
I have a fe=
eling that when his controllers will think that time is right, they will fl=
ick a switch and=A0 he will change. After all he was so vehemently atheist =
and when they needed him to change, he changed..

Anyway it was very good t=
o hear from you. and I just saw what your own guru said on telephone. Grace=
 is flowing.

Kind Regards
LaxmiNarayan

Dear Laxmi Narayan,
=A0
=A0I was intrigu=

you know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is h=
e following?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happ=
ened in his life after=A0 he had these samadhi and visions.Any other specia=
l things about him.
=A0
=A0
Yes he is a friend of mine.=A0 I can only tell =
you very little about his spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it =
with anyone. He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.
=A0
Befor=
e I tell you anything more=A0about his spiritual life=A0that I know, let me=
 say=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about=
 two years back. What first attracted me to=A0 towards him was his impeccab=
le honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=A0when it comes to=A0honestly.=A0If som=
eone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmle=
ss=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he nev=
er jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=A0spoken even a single=
 lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his t=
eacher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed =
his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive lang=
uage and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he b=
ought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for te=
n years every day he spend one
 hour reading the English dictionary and one=
 hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=A0up volumes of Hindi=
 and English literature.=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because=
 he wanted to be=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he c=
an take a really detached view to judge the truth about=A0which is more com=
prehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it c=
omes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is =
mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education t=
o journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes=
 fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French=
. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. =
When he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying fo=
r a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk=
 who was
 supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked my frie=
nd's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my f=
riend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Because,=
 he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would have =
been a lie. 
=A0
So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. Al=
l his friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.
=A0
One day, =
long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to offic=
e passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=A0his scooter, sudden=
ly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not =
know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in th=
e morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he ha=
s no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest s=
aid that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the=
 whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb=
 him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, a=
s if he was in deep sleep.
=A0
Then he started meditating at home, and it w=
as there=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about t=
hese, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. But on=
ce he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in =
the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=A0Only his =
wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when =
ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When some=
one asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the w=
hole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the pla=
nets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, sm=
aller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately des=
ribed.=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal=
 man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it=

 elevated Sri=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal =
Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=A0not a God.The diff=
erence he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ord=
inary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be =
emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=A0can try to l=
ead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely s=
tating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and =
advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is n=
ot an atheist any more.
=A0
Later he had once=A0mentioned he knew the relat=
ion he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he =
says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of ti=
me on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=A0with t=
hose in=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything wit=
h them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea=
 is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the future of thi=
s country.
=A0
He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fis=
h, meat etc.
=A0
I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not=
 asked his permission before mentioning him.
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi


PS:=
 I would not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate. This =
mail is just because Laxmi Narayan asked for information.


=A0

The upsurg=
e (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

I know a devotee of Krishna - not=

Hello Rajarshi=

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I was int=
rigued by above line in your mail and want to know more about this devotee.=
 Do you know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana =
is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes =
happened in his life after=A0 he had these samadhi and visions.Any other sp=
ecial things about him.

In the Gita Lord is saying whatever you do/eat off=
er it to me first. So he is offering all these non-veg to Lord with devotio=
n, Right?? Then prasdam all around??

My curious questions are not against =
your acceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is
 part o=
f hidden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome=A0 pain and misery on an=
imals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experi=
encing all these exotic=A0 visions, But no feeling of kindness towards bird=
s and animals.

Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do not even touch=
 onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? 

When we get burnt, we need to =
be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article=A0 about Dayamata who suc=
ceded=A0 Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to India and told a Spiritual M=
aster that her progress has stopped. Master said, you are eating eggs which=
 she admitted that she was doing=A0 secretly.

This is very complex world. =
No outright solutions for so many difficult questions. Followers of 3 faith=
s which all originated in middle east are fighting each other all the time.=
 Sometimes I think, from which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are com=
ing,Are they also enemies
 there?? Their Gods said in their holy books that=
 animals are their food. So they cannot even think about souls in animals o=
r their pain and emotions.

Then I have read stories about several people, =
who follow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperience=A0 spirit=
ual highs and other such phenomena. It is so difficult to comprehend.=A0 Wo=
uld they remain in the cycle of b/d=A0 till they learn about kindness???
