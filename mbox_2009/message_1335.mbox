Take =
a sankalpa to do Vighneshwara pooja. Invoke Vighneshwara in an idol 

made =
with turmeric paste. Do a shodasopachaara pooja to Vighneshwara. Then 

tak=
e a sankalpa to do the main homam (e.g. Mahaganapathi homam). Call back 

V=
ighneshwara. Invoke Varuna in kalasha with "imam me" and "tattvaayaami" 

m=
antras (veda mantras). Do shodasopachaara pooja to Varuna. Then read 

Puny=
aahavaachanam (Pavamaana sooktam). Call back Varuna and sprinkle a bit 

of=
 kalasha water all around.



Then start the fire. There are few additional=
 procedures including the 

invocation of Brahma and Varuna in small water =
bowls with darbhas on then 

and quick pooja to them with akshatas. After t=
he poorvaangam, call 

Mahaganapathi into fire and do shodasopachaara pooja=
. Then do the mantras 

you want. Do a shodasopachaara pooja again at the e=
nd. Do uttaraangam with 

avijnaataadi praayaschitta mantras etc just as in=
 the short procedure. But 

one can optionally do Jayaadi homam also in the=
 uttaraangam. It is a bunch 

of aahutis for various celestial beings with =
veda mantras. The rest is 

similar to the short procedure.



I have done =
big ones as well, including 7-hour Mahaganapathi homam and 

9-hour Chandi =
homam. But I have no doubt that a short homam repeated 

everyday is more e=
ffective than a long homam done once in a while.



*        *        *



=
I once saw some priests performing a Mahaganapathi homam and Navagraha 

ho=
mam. The priest declared, "all the bad karmas of whoever is present here 

=
are burned today and all of you will start on a clean slate now." Though 

=
they did a detailed ritual, the actual mantras of Ganesha and planets were =


done to the minimum. For example, they offered the mantra of each planet =


just 4 times! For such a small count of mantras to actually burn all the =


karmas of 100 people, the performer has to be a rishi or something! I was=
 

amused by the declaration.



Obviously, they were under time pressure a=
nd made a wrong tradeoff.



The point I wanted to make is this. If you are=
 able to do the main thing in 

a ritual for 2 hours, then it is reasonable=
 to have 30 minutes of overhead. 

If you have only 40 minutes, it is a bad=
 idea to spend 30 minutes on the 

overhead and wrap up the main thing in 1=
0 minutes. It is better to do the 

overhead in 10 min and do the main part=
 for 30 min. It is better that way.



Sometimes, I see learned priests mak=
ing the wrong tradeoffs when pressed for 

time. In this age, most people a=
re pressed for time. They need help to make 

the correct tradeoffs so that=
 they maximize the impact of the little they 

get to do.



Best regards,
