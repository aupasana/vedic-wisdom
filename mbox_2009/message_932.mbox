Dear Sir,
One more question for Homam.
Suppose I am giving 12 Ahutis daily =
to Maha Ganpati with (Aum, Shrim, Hrim Klim.....Vashamanaya Swaha) Maha Gan=
apati Mantra, is it necessary that I have to speak - Idam Maha Ganapataye, =
Idam Na Mama -=C2=A0after each Ahuti?=C2=A0=C2=A0
Or=C2=A0 It is OK if=C2=
=A0 I give 12 Ahutis first with the Mantras only and I will speak -Idam Mah=
a Ganpataye,Idam Na Mama - only once at the last after 12th Ahuti is comple=
ted?
