|om|Dear Fellow travellers, namaste

All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I've had for quite
sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any Hanuman temple
and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart which suffers
from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in navamsa). When I visited the
Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai
and asked the priest about a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra
inscribed on the walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which
comes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to
the 10th house with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra
teachings. I've been doing this every evening since.

Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question is how does
this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?

Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is it

|om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas

or

|om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas

Some say it should be 13 aksharas....

Sorry for astrological content in this mail.

best regards
Hari
