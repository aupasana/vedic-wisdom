Hi Narsimha Ji

I have just tried mahaganpati homam and krishna homam and c=
ould feel 
the differance ! Its quick !
I have some questions though:

1) I=
 see that mahaganpati homam has tarpanam (offering water towards 
the end o=
f homa) but in krishna and laxmi homam manual I could not 
find that. Is it=
 supposed to be like this ?

2) Is vaushat is necessary only if we are swit=
ching mantra ? If we 
chant ganapati atharva shirsha 8 times at last of all=
 the ganesh 
mantra, so at the 8rth time do we have to say vaushat instead =
of 
swaha at the end of every verse ?

3) I do homa with ghee mainly. Can w=
e offer flower petal (single 
petal) when we say svaha. what does offering =
of flower signify like 
u said murmura for finance amd white sesame for spi=
rituality. Can we 
offer fruits also as offering in main mantra ?

4) if i =
say a particular mantra 10 times can i do 2-2 offering like 
2 with ghee, 2=
 with flower etc ?

4) I use small homa kund, only 4.5 " to 4.5 ". Is it fi=
ne ?

5) Please post homam for Vishnu and Shiva also.

Thanks very much for=
 these homam procedures.
Reagards.
