namaste narasimha ji,

"serious sadhana is needed"

these words hit like a =
slap....though i know there was no intention 
of that on your part. the way=
 anything strikes us, including words, 
is a reflection of what we are with=
in. it is something personal.... 
not related to any person but the self.

=
my guru also told me the same thing five years back. so i struggle 
in the =
morning and in the evening with some practices. sometimes i 
feel i am not =
making any headway. sometimes i feel i am not 
sincere...or serious enough.=
 sometimes i feel maybe there is some 
transformation, no matter how gradua=
l or subtle. i am actually not 
sure of anything.

but why should sadhana h=
ave to be a struggle? that means there is 
resistance somewhere. maybe, as =
u mentioned, this must be the 
blocked karmas that stand in the way and mak=
e things difficult.

i see some people around who have benefited immensely =
from sadhana. 
the radiant smile on their face is something to be seen. tha=
t 
strengthens my resolve to be a little more serious about sadhana.

thank=
 you once again for your words.

love and best wishes.
