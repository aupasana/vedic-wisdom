Namaste Rafal and Nalini Bahen and other members,

Yesterday i wrote in som=
ewhat unusual mood. I know it's a highly controversial statement and very d=
ifficult to prove or explain.

Somehow i have come to some kind of abstract=
 understanding that even the thing which we call 'free will' is also pre-or=
dained. the famous example of 'Goat tied up with a pole' by thakur, wonderf=
ul explanations by Narasimha and many other explanations by earlier philoso=
phical thinkers in relation to free will and destiny are not to be disputed=
 here. they all seem true, however, personally I've a unexplainable feeling=
 that in the ultimate analysis, all the show is *completely* dictated.

I w=
ish to write a bit, not for the sake of empty arguments for proving my poin=
t (actually i have no strong point here as my thinking is not baked by soun=
d logic). 
***Nalini bahen said that some souls have free will to take the =
rebirth and so on. i would say that here that their wish on account of *the=
ir own free will* is also exactly dictated by Supreme power.

*Rafal questi=
oned by stating examples of Prashna chart by Harihara and dharma-sastra by =
Bruhaspati. i would say that that also is ordained to happen exactly the wa=
y it happened. Prashna chart of a moment gives the idea of action done till=
 that point which will dictate future life. my foolish, childish blabbering=
 says that the karma till that moment had been pre-ordained and the future =
is also DONE. Hari hara writing prashna maarga, content of writing, use of =
the paper and pen, sitting direction, thoughts while writing, my typing on =
my pc, your reactions and everything else has actually no free will.

Final=
ly what I wish to say is that "Free will is also Fixed Will"

Everything,-e=
very damn thing, is ordered by 'Durgaa Bhagavati Bhadra yayedam dharyate ja=
gat".

But all these are written with some intellectual understanding and n=
ot realization. As narasimha Garu often says, in the realm of Maya, nobody =
can be sure of anything.

Dear members, including my Guru - please ignore m=
e and also forgive me if it was in a bad taste, ridiculous and senseless.

=
Yours, 

Utpal

 I helped him, "do you mean to say that future has already happened at some=
 level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A mov=
ie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have al=
ready seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is ha=
ppening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?"

 He exclaimed, "exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to=
 happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be ab=
le to see it before future comes, because it has already happened."

 was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age =
