Namaste,
 
1. Every region of India has mistakes of its own and none of them is perfect. Yet, there are realized souls from every region of India. So do not worry about all this and follow whatever you were taught. As time goes on, if you find out a mistake and are convinced, you can change things from time to time. If you wait till you get perfect pronunciation, you will never even start. So start and keep improving your pronunciation. If you are lucky, it may end up not mattering also!
 
2. A lot of horoscopic rules taught by some astrologers today are relevant only in special prayogas for ensuring certain material results. You can ignore them.
 
You can worship the deity you feel an attraction for, using the mantra that you feel an attraction for, without worrying about those things.
 
Dakshina Kali may force some level of detachment on you. If that is fine, you can do her mantra. Do not worry about number of letters, number of words etc.
 
3. THAT is the nature of mind. As long as it is alive and active, that is what it does. Take cognisance of it and move on. If a heckler comes and disturbs your show, will you stop the show and leave? Or will you argue with the heckler. Neither is smart. A smarter thing would be to take a look at the heckler, say/do nothing and move on. Considered your meditation as a show and consider undesirable thoughts as just hecklers. Do not fight them, i.e. do not be agitated and start worrying about the thought. Do not give up and run away, i.e. do not stop the meditation. Just observe that fact that you had so and so thought and move on. Don't think too much about it (if you do, it will result in the seed of thought becoming a plant and then a tree!) and just continue.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
