Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.

Many Thanks for the grammer correction. Am I co=
rrect in assuming that "Omkareshwaraya" is actually pronounced "Onkaareshwa=
raaya", I know this is not exact and I am not sure how to type out the soun=
d of "On", the middle-back of the tongue is hitting the roof of the mouth w=
hen making the sound- so one is not pronouncing the "M" by putting the lips=
 together? Is this the technically precise way?


Thank you
