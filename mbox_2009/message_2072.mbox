Dear Utpal  ,

On vyavaharika platform Brhaspatis law based on advises (advise contains 
free will) would be then useless and misleading (avidya) which is 
against the dharma (quality) of Guru/Jupiter (satya).

Therefore this line of thinking is against the logic.

  <p>Namaste Rafal and Nalini Bahen and other members,<br>
  <br>
Yesterday i wrote in somewhat unusual mood. I know it's a highly
controversial statement and very difficult to prove or explain.<br>
  <br>
Somehow i have come to some kind of abstract understanding that even
the thing which we call 'free will' is also pre-ordained. the famous
example of 'Goat tied up with a pole' by thakur, wonderful explanations
by Narasimha and many other explanations by earlier philosophical
thinkers in relation to free will and destiny are not to be disputed
here. they all seem true, however, personally I've a unexplainable
feeling that in the ultimate analysis, all the show is *completely*
dictated.<br>
  <br>
I wish to write a bit, not for the sake of empty arguments for proving
my point (actually i have no strong point here as my thinking is not
baked by sound logic). <br>
***Nalini bahen said that some souls have free will to take the rebirth
and so on. i would say that here that their wish on account of *their
own free will* is also exactly dictated by Supreme power.<br>
  <br>
*Rafal questioned by stating examples of Prashna chart by Harihara and
dharma-sastra by Bruhaspati. i would say that that also is ordained to
happen exactly the way it happened. Prashna chart of a moment gives the
idea of action done till that point which will dictate future life. my
foolish, childish blabbering says that the karma till that moment had
been pre-ordained and the future is also DONE. Hari hara writing
prashna maarga, content of writing, use of the paper and pen, sitting
direction, thoughts while writing, my typing on my pc, your reactions
and everything else has actually no free will.<br>
  <br>
Finally what I wish to say is that "Free will is also Fixed Will"<br>
  <br>
Everything,- every damn thing, is ordered by 'Durgaa Bhagavati Bhadra
yayedam dharyate jagat".<br>
  <br>
But all these are written with some intellectual understanding and not
realization. As narasimha Garu often says, in the realm of Maya, nobody
can be sure of anything.<br>
  <br>
Dear members, including my Guru - please ignore me and also forgive me
if it was in a bad taste, ridiculous and senseless.<br>
  <br>
Yours, <br>
  <br>
Utpal<br>

But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious
thought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above
mail.<br>

This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main
characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind,
contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he
could not express himself.<br>

Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a
studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on
the screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you
saying something like that?"<br>
> > > <br>

something is going to happen in future, it will happen when future

it has already happened."<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking
along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his
vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably
confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things,
this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody
who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and
came to some important conclusions about "time" in his own way.<br>

However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes
changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual
Aatman or Brahman or Self.<br>

feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and
blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as "I am
done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave" filled my
entire consciousnss.<br>

sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India.
Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside
the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the
main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great
saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three
occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.<br>

The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how
smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist
attraction to external things better and you can resist internal
enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma
better. Ego - thinking that this is "I" and this is "mine" - is the
root cause of all problems.<br>

you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own
body - is god's property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all
of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without
entertaining the notion "this is mine". A faithful servant takes very
good care of his master's properties, but without thinking of all those
things as his or her belongings.<br>

master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is
taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A
servant will accept that is master's property and can be taken away
anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one possesses
and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one's
control.<br>
