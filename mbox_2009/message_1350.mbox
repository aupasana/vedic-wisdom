Many thanks, Narasimha! I have uploaded the entire text of the 
mantras in =
a pdf file -please refer to page 13 in which these verses 
appear. I agree =
with you -any 'trans'-literation only does disservice 
to the pronunciation=
 and accents that are so important in Sanskrit.

Please let me know if you =
encounter problems in looking into the file.

God Bless AND THANKS IN ADVAN=
CE!
