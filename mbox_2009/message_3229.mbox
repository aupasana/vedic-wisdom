Namaste,


I am a fir=
m believer of Veg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to spiri=
tual growth. But, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some spi=
ritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food, h=
e has put a counter argument. He says that if I can find him a single shlok=
a on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would give up.=C2=A0


So, if anybody on thi=
s group can help me find the quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta a=
s the absolute reference and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about =
it in Geeta, it is actually not worth discussing whether or not you take no=
n-veg. If anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can becom=
e vegetarian.


He also quotes Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adherin=
g to non-veg. If any of you know the counter argument, please help.


Best =
Regards,
Sriram
