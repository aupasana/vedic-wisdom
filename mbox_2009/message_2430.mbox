=C2=A0
Dear Narasimhaji and other Friends,

=
First of all would like to thank everybody for the generosity in replying a=
nd sharing their insights! I am truly overwhelmed at the responses!

To be =
honest I was really scared/worried when I saw the idol during the puja at h=
ome on Shri Ganesha Chaturthi and all sorts of thoughts were running in my =
mind.

Your mail is a real eye-opener for me. I think every now and then I =
have to keep coming back to this mail re-read your wonderful words.

Have d=
ecided to continue having the idol in the house and do puja for the same mo=
re regularly as per my ability. 

Would like to thank you again from the bo=
ttom of my heart for taking your precious time out and helping me out!

War=
m Regards,
Ramesh M
Bangalore

Namaste Ram and other friends,
=C2=A0
Before I try to address this =
quandary, I want to tell a small story.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
More t=
han 120 years ago, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Kaali temple=
 at Dakshineshwar. Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine wit=
h a beautiful Krishna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes=
. Due to an accident when another priest was carrying the idol during a fes=
tival, the idol broke oneday.
=C2=A0
The priests and the highly learned sch=
olars were in a quandary and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras w=
ere clear that a broken idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to=
 be immersed in flowing water. So the learned scholars recommended immersin=
g the idol in Ganges.
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna was asked by the temple administra=
tion for his view. He thought for a while and said calmly, "Suppose you hav=
e a son and his leg is broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at h=
ome and continue to love him or will you throw your son into Ganges?" His s=
imple common sense view prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ram=
akrishna himself fixed the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple a=
nd continued to be worshipped.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The idol was in=
 your house for 56 years. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating pro=
blems in your mind, after all these years! What good is that knowledge whic=
h spoils mental peace by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is =
better off being ignorant than having such knowledge.
=C2=A0
If you have an=
 idol that was worshipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it=
 would've captured and stored some of the positive energy and positive thou=
ghts of those people. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.
=
=C2=A0
It should not be a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to th=
e idol. Just doing simple things should suffice.
=C2=A0
Whenever you see th=
e idol, imagine that there is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who i=
s in that idol. Bow to him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some f=
ruit or raisins or something to the idol now and then, when you get a chanc=
e, and imagine that Ganesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in=
 water and wipe it (to keep it clean).
=C2=A0
The key is not how detailed y=
our rituals are and whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in=
 your ritual. The key is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol=
 and how deeply you love that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Ri=
tuals are only meant to facilitate such a visualization and increase such a=
 love. They are neither necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relatio=
nship with a deity (which is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
How does a metallic (or stone or whatever) o=
bject become divine?
=C2=A0
Of course, each object and each atom of this un=
iverse is filled, in essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But,=
 that would apply to the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as=
 being more divine than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-perva=
ding non-dual god here. We are talking about a deity within the field of du=
ality here. That deity is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. But=
, how does the deity get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in it =
simply because of its shape? Of course not!
=C2=A0
All lokas and all devata=
s are present within you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your though=
t, you concentrate a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or =
any object). When a priest with a good level of purity and good ability to =
visualize (which comes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pr=
atishthaa in an idol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa =
mantra as an instrument and a deity's essence enters the idol.
=C2=A0
Even =
if you do not do a praana pratishthaa formally, deity's essence will slowly=
 be established in the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is =
all about the power of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed=
 down by a dense and heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasana=
as work faster, but even thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed do=
wn by a dense and heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will =
also work, albeit=C2=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qual=
ities in an idol over a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invari=
ably be established in the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a meta=
llic object.
=C2=A0
If you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not ta=
king good care of him, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Ple=
ase stop this negativity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saa=
ttwika form with whom you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms=
 your mind when you see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity's a=
nger), it will indeed create such a presence in the idol and do you good.
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
There are several *well-meaning* people out =
there with half-baked understanding that is not based on any direct experie=
nce, who go around scaring people in several matters relating to god, relig=
ion and spirituality. But god is not to be feared.
=C2=A0
Love god. Do not =
fear god. When your father or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is=
 for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. They are not re=
ally angry at you and they actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes =
you or gives bad results, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be=
 for your good. Do not fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always=
 *love* god and love god very deeply. More deeply than you love your parent=
s, spouse, children etc. That is a simple principle for sureshot=C2=A0spiri=
tual progress.
=C2=A0
Good luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you d=
ecide to do with it!
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
