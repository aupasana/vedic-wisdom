Namaste Shankarji,

Usually, Tarpana is done to reduce/remove the bad/evil =
habits/traits of one's ancestors whose genes are still vibrating in us, and=
 to provide them relief in life here-after. For Grahas & other dieties, hom=
am is the norm followed. But, I guess there must be something in what you s=
ay ... I dont know its significance though!

Thanks
-Narayan-
