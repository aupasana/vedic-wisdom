Sir,
I have spent 5 years at Dwarka. I have visited that temple too. The we=
stern part of Gujarat is called as Saurashtra and whole Saurashtra is full =
of devotional energy (Bhakti). I first experienced Thakur at Okha port. Wha=
t you mentioned is Bet Dwarka and not Bruhad Dwarka.

Dear Hari,
=A0
Repeating any combin=
ation of syllables with a 
focussed mind will eventually do the trick on th=
e mind. So you may do 
either.
=A0
However, some combinations tried by othe=
rs 
successfully in the past are better and faster.
=A0
Regarding the speci=
fic mantra below: The words 
"raam" and "jay" (or "jai") have no meaning in=
 Sanskrit. They should be "raama" 
and "jaya" respectively. Arabic has word=
s mostly ending in consonants (i.e. no 
vowel "a" at the end of the word). =
That Arabic influence made Indians change 
Sanskrit words to remove "a" at =
the end of words. "Jaya Raama" becomes "Jay 
Raam".
=A0
If you want your ma=
ntra to be meaningful in 
Sanskrit, please restore "a" at the end of words.=
 The correct version of the 
mantra is "Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raa=
ma". You can add "Om" at the 
beginning.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 
*=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my =

guru went to many temples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka th=
at had 
a nice level of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and=
 Makaradhwaja 
(Hanuman's son) together. Apparently some yogi did intense s=
adhana there for a 
few decades in the past (with the mantra you mentioned)=
. The mantra above is 
written all over the walls of the temple.
=A0
Though=
 that yogi is not there now, the vibrations 
created by his sadhana are sti=
ll there. We were quite impressed when we spent 
some time there. You have =
to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to BrihadDwaarakaa 
and then go inside =
the village (a few km from the main Krishna temple at 
BrihadDwaarakaa) . I=
t is a very small temple without any crowd, but has stronger 
spiritual ene=
rgy than many famous temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or 
Gujarat in ge=
neral, I recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of 
hours the=
re.
=A0
The mantra you gave reminded me of that 
temple.
=A0
Best 
regards,=

  Dear Fellow 
  travellers, namaste
  
=

  All this talk 
  about Mangal reminds me about one question I've had for=
 quite sometime. 
  Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any Hanu=
man temple and get a 
  mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart =
which suffers from 
  rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in navamsa). Whe=
n I visited the Hanuman 
  deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thiruma=
zhisai near Chennai and asked 
  the priest about a mantra, he advised me t=
o chant the mantra inscribed on the 
  walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ra=
m jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7 
  word, 10 aksharas mantra. Ene=
rgy from the 7th house to the 10th house with the 
  mantra devata sitting =
in lagna as per mantra shastra teachings. I've been 
  doing this every eve=
ning since.
  

  Later I came to 
  know this is the Rama taraka mantra. M=
y question is how does this mantra help 
  to counter the rajabhanga of Man=
gal?
  

  Secondly what is 
  the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? =
Is it
  

  |om sri ram jaya 
  ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas
 =
 

  or
  

  |om sri rama jaya 
  rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksh=
aras
  

  Some say it should 
  be 13 aksharas....
  

  Sorry for 
  astr=
ological content in this mail.
  

  best 
  regards
  Hari
