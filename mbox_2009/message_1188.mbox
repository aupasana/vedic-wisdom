Namaste,

> What is the source of the definition of fire, is it agni puran?

I may disappoint some with this answer, but I have to be honest.

I am not aware of the specific external source of some things I know. I know 
some things because I heard from a person or read in a book and hence I can 
identify the external source of that knowledge. But some knowledge just 
comes from inside and I am not really sure of the source. This one is like 
that.

Of course, there are no guarantees that what I know, from outside or from 
within, is correct. So please take what I write with a pinch of salt.

I always remind people that I am not much of a scholar and merely a dumb 
servant of my guru and Mother. What *they* give me, from outside or from 
within, I merely share with others.

Best regards,
Narasimha
