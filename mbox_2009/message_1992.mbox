      Namaste,

=C2=A0 This is an extract the from the Pirtri Tarpana Manual.

"By thinking=

from various kaarmic predisp=
ositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) with several pe=

external event of satisfying and emancipating=
 an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view this as an interna=
l event of
satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ult=

perf=
orm external rituals, while thinking of what it means internally. This buil=

and eventually the desired
