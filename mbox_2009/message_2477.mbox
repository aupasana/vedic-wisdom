Namakarams Narasimhaji,
Thanks a lot for clarifying my doubts. You are doin=
g a great service to humanity and the sanathana dharma by guiding people in=
 homams and related activities. I pray to god that you=A0always be our guid=
ing star and guru in this world where its becoming increasingly difficult t=
o find persons who can give proper directions.

Thanks and regards,
Girish =
Sundaram

: Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam

=A0 
Namaste,

(1) Namboodiris are=
 (or atleast used to be) adepts in fire worship. What this namboodiri did i=
s the correct way.

Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and w=
orship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamli=
ne it, depending on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger=
 with practice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in=
 it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for=
 burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karm=
as are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. O=
f course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are read=
y and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong indivi=
dualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego=
. When one's ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more ka=
rmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, =
flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let=
 it grow very
 big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So,=
 until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free your=
self from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.

But some peop=
le use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the=
 fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one =
who strongly identifies one's internal fire with external fire does such th=
ings, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this a=
pproach do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong identifi=
cation with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and the=
y do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to s=
tart or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best=
 and disastrous at worst.

The best approach is: You start your own fire. O=
nly you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it=
 with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If=
 you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your know=
ledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.

(2)=
 There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga ny=
aasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry about these things =
and do what you are used to or what you are more attracted to.

As I said m=
any times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a lett=
er in a particular body part has a higher significance than just tough a pa=
rt and saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specifi=
c sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying o=
ne's subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentia=
lly a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.

(3) They sho=
uld be shown in the video. If you cannot get them, please feel free to just=
 say it and not show any mudra. It will not block you.

Best regards,
Naras=
imha
