Namaste,
      Just an addition of a point to this.
      I was told that the Gayatri mantra is the main food for one's spirituality and hence it is advised to keep it to oneself, at all times.

Om suragarave namah
Ravi

Yes, it is recommended not to pronounce Gayathri even in private. You are advised to pronounce it mentally. If you can not do it, give out humming kind of sound while mentally chanting the mantra.
