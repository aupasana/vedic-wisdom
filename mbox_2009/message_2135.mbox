Namaste,

If you mean the small pieces of dharbha to draw lines in the kund=
a, then yes, throw them away. However, the 8 sticks of dharbha we use to de=
corate outside the kunda can be re-used.

Regards
Narayan

ks for your graciousness! No apologies needed because I'm sure that's what =
you meant. However, just curious as to the larger significance of rejecting=
 the dharba (or sprinkling water over the left shoulder after purification =
of all the items in other traditions) towards the SW direction.

Thanks for the clarification. Much appreciated! I'm certain the priest was =
facing East, however, I'm less certain of the direction in which he threw t=
he darbha (which very well may have been Southeast as indicated by you).

 is how I understand the 8 Dikpala's directional positions (again my knowle=
dge is limited and clarifications from people like you who have traversed t=
he path much longer than I are always welcome!):

 draw the six lines with a darbha on the base of the havan kund before plac=

 I've sometimes used it in the homa and other times thrown it away. I ask b=
ecause I noticed a priest in our local tempple throw it over his left shoul=
der (southwest direction) when facing east.
