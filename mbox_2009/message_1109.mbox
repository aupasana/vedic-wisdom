Namaste 

As I was reading the homa manul for Kuja I came across a definiti=
on of 
one of the 21 names of Kuja as one who can grant all wishes etc.

So=
me days back I was re reading the Aghora book where it was mentioned 
at pl=
ace that the planets are like munis. Is this true?

Then what is the differ=
ence between a planet and a deity? Also why are 
they called graha?
