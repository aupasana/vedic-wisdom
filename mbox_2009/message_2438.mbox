Namaste Smt Sudha,

If you leave it as is, after 5-15 minutes it would auto=
matically die off. You don't have to explicitly try to extinguish it. 

Doi=
ng homam in US or other cold countries, can be tricky. Firstly I suggest us=
ing copra as it doesn't produce much smoke. Secondly, after you're comforta=
ble with the homam content and fire management, you will be able to optimiz=
e on the copra usage and reduce the smoke further. Using camphor can also p=
roduce much smoke, so use it sparingly. Ensure, you raise the window's a bi=
t, so that there's circulation in the house. However, please ensure that wi=
nd is not blowing in the direction of smoke alarm, as this would cause it t=
o raise the alarm. For example, once I performed Ganesha Homam with windows=
 close as it was very cold outside, by the end of it the room got stuffier,=
 and when I opened the windows a bit in both the rooms, the wind caused all=
 the smoke in one direction, passing the smoke alarm causing it to go off! =


Once the homam is over, you can go ahead and place the kundam in the balc=
ony, provided there's no fire in it. So, please wait the fire to die and th=
en move it outside, as we don't want to attract any attention. People in we=
stern continent are not aware of fire rituals, and can freak out on seeing =
fire. So. when you perform homam in the night, please ensure some light is =
on, otherwise if the lights are off, then one can see the flames from outsi=
de the apartment, causing some people to call the fire department. We certa=
inly dont want to get into such a situation!

Too much of clarified butter =
(ghee) can also cause too much smoke. The ghee has to be poured the right a=
mount. It would also help, if you could clean up the homa kundam so that yo=
u start empty. This also reduces smoke. Also proficiency in estimating the =
amount of ghee for a size of copra to keep the fire going (including turnin=
g at the right moment) all helps reducing the residual smoke effect. 

So, =
with more practice you will get a better idea on all the above parameters. =
Others may add their experience. If you have any more questions, please fee=
l free to ask.

Finally, I would like to mention, that the smoke from the h=
oma kundam is very therapeutic in nature and offers a lot of benefits. See =
my other mail on it.

Hope this helps.
Regards
Narayan
