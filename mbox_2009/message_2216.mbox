Thanks. When I read those posts some time ago I had for some reason
assumed that the two options Narasimhaji was talking about were (in
Itrans) gaM and ga~N, as opposed to gaM and ga{\m+}.

On reflection however I think the latter pair makes more sense rather
than one of them being a half-akshara.

Thanks again,

Samir
