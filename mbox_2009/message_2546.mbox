 He does not take milk and is nowadays eating only one iddli for breakfast
=
daily saying that a man who sits without doing any physical work does not
r=
equire two. So also with his midday meal.

Mixed with curry etc., each meal=
 amounts only to about a handful. Even that
he does not eat each dish separ=
ately as we do for taste.

He makes a ball of the vegetable, chutney,soup, =
etc. and then mixes it with
rice and eats. In the course of the conversatio=
n one day, he said, =93It would
be more tasty
to eat the rice with only one=
 dish instead of so many.

Why so many dishes? We used to eat only a single=
 dish in the olden days. I
have not given up that practice even now. While =
I was on the hill many
people used to bring rice, fruit and sweets.

Whatev=
er they brought, I used to eat only as much as could be lifted with
three f=
ingers. I used to eat some of whatever they brought so that the whole
day=
=92s intake of the food eaten did not amount to a handful.

That method of =
eating used to give me more than happiness. Nowadays they
spread a leaf and=
 serve several things on it. As I cannot waste anything, I
eat them and fee=
l heavy thereafter.=94

So also as regards sleep. On special festival occas=
ions such as the birthday
celebrations (Jayanthi) and Maha Puja,the student=
s do not commence the Vedic
recitations at the Brahma Muhurtham time (a cou=
ple of hours before sun
rise),being tired with work on the previous night, =
but Bhagavan gets up as
usual and keeps himself ready.

If he is ever in il=
l health and his personal attendants request him to sleep
a little longer, =
he replies, =93What is the point in sleeping at the time of
the Brahma Muhu=
rtham? If you want, you may sleep.=94

In Dhanurmasam (December-January), p=
uja starts in Arunachaleswara temple
early in the morning. Bhagavan wakes u=
p here by that time.
