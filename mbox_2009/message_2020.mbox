Namaste Shri Narasimhaji and everyone, 

Forgive me for this question as I =
have very limited knowledge regarding the method of doing this upasana. I w=
as listening to Shri LakshmiNarayan Hridayam the other day but I could not =
understand why one does the Narayan Hridayam first and then the Laxmi Hrida=
yam to finally end the puja with the Narayan Hridayam once again. 

When Sh=
ri LakshmiNarayan comes to mind..just like Shri LakshmiNarasimha or ShivaSh=
akti..the deities are conceived as one single entity, so why separate recit=
ations? 

Also, can anyone tell me the sources where I can find other praye=
rs/shlokas/stutis/mantras for Shri Lakshminarayan?

Many thanks,
S
