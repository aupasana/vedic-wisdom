Namaste Smt Aditi,

Well said! Agree with all your points. My point on *sme=
lly* was not pertaining to the menses but to the fact that if devatas are i=
ndeed repelled by the odor of menses, then why is it not applicable to peop=
le who are not really clean/hygiene.

Menses are indeed powerful and in som=
e aghora sadhanas has its use.

Thanks & Regards
Narayan
