Namaste Amitji,

Very true. I mentioned name of Shivaji as he was having al=
l that 
characteristics required to really create edifice from scratch. he =

possessed tact, shrewdness, maneuvering, velour, organizing ability, 
flex=
ibility to respect situation, etc... and could create, 
Effectively, the Hi=
ndvi Swarajya during times of total Darkness. 
Shivaji could achieve that b=
ecause he was mentored by Samarth Ramdas, 
Jija Mata and supported by soooo=
o many.. Bajiprabhu, Tanaji,Dadoji 
Kondadev, Murarbaji to name few.

On th=
e contrary, The Great Maharana Pratap, couldn't achieve for us 
what Shivaj=
i achieved because of the contemporary Traitors in 
Rajputana land. Most in=
famous example is Mansingh. Disputes of 
Egoistic brave Rajput Kings has co=
st our motherland so horribly.
Here, it is my personal opinion that Maharan=
a actually could n't 
succeed in uniting The Rajput kings against the great=
 Akabar.

***
as you rightly mentioned, Sikhs must be highly respected. the=
y have 
given their lives for saving Hindus. if they wouldn't have come 
fo=
rward voluntarily, I fear, what would have been left in Punjab area?
and we=
 crack jokes on them. I try my best not to entertain any jokes 
which are o=
n Sardarjis.


Arya Samaji movement of Swami Dayaananda Saraswati was one n=
oteworthy 
thing happened which was also effective in checking conversion.
=
*** 

Finally i mention here that Vedic Sanskruti (Sanaatan Dharama) has 
s=
urvived the test of times (Unlike Babylon, Greek culture) because of 
Spiri=
tual strength. Spiritualist of all the level has born in this 
land in plen=
ty every time, known & unknown. Ramdas was there so 
Shivaji came, Thakur, =
Vivekananda, Sainbaba, Raman Maharshi were 
there so we got Tilak maharaj, =
Sardar, Gandhiji, Subhash chandra, and 
band of people who struggled for In=
dependence.

lastly, if Sanaatan Dharma people, in the current times also d=
oesn't 
care and doesn't invest their resources to Convert people from othe=
r 
faith, if they maintain this one principal steadfastly, lives 
spiritual=
 life as much as possible, i am sure, Santan Dharma will 
never ever be fin=
ished.

yours 

utpal
