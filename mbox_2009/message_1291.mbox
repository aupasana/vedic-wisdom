Namaste Rajarshi,
        I just looked at the link that you provided for Devi Suktam. There are 2 versions of Devi Suktam, one tantric and the other vedic. 
        Narasimhaji was suggesting Vedic Devi Sukta Homam which contains 8 verses.
         
       The text is available in Durga Saptasati by Geeta Press, after the nyasas that occur after 13 chapters.

Regards
Ravi

Namaste
 
Thank you for your explanation. The person for whom I had asked the question is comfortable with the devi shuktam. I just wanted to know, where would the swaha come in the devi suktam. After every line or after every two lines? Like where it ends with "|" or where it ends with "||" ?
 
Here is a link for the online Devi suktam.

 Rajarshi

The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste,
 
> Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do homan of it
 
That is not a valid reason. Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in homam. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri mantra are very very powerful mantras and they are offered in homam. On the Tantrik side, Pratyangira mantra, Mahasudarsana mantra, Paashupata mantra etc are very very powerful astra mantras and they are offered in homam. As these examples show, even very powerful mantras can be offered in fire for amplification.
 
*        *        *
 
The power of powerful mantras is a mirage for most people. The experience given by a mantra and the internal/external results brought by a mantra vary from mantra to mantra. But, even with a very powerful mantra, one needs to be ready for the mantra to actually work.
 
When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects. 
 
There may be thousands of paths to climb a mountain. Each path takes one to a different spot atop the mountain. The view one has from the top may be different accordingly. One view may be more breathtaking and amazing than another. However, one taking a path leading to a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading to a normal view both have to struggle on their paths and reach the top despite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, but none is too easy. All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a more breathtaking view than the others.
 
Similarly, one chanting a "powerful mantra" and a "normal mantra" will both have to put in effort and overcome the weaknesses and get control over mind. The power of the powerful mantra refers to a more powerful experience after one succeeds with the mantra (more breathtaking scenery on reaching the mountain top). It is not correct to think that things will happen automatically and easily because one if chanting a powerful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.
 
*        *        *
 
Coming back to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommend homam with Kunjika stotra. Kunjika stotra is a coded stotra containing several mantras in coded form. It is not what it may seem to be. It is for a reason that Shiva tells Parvati that this prayer should be hidden like one's privates. It is weird that we are discussing such a secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a collection of powerful mantras for specific prayogas that would be considered raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the actions is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.
 
I see no point in wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to do a homam with Kunjika stotra to stop the army of a country in their tracks or kill someone or delude someone etc and if you are detached enough to carry it off successfully, then you will be given an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. Otherwise, why even try?
 
My advice is to drop the idea of doing a homam with Kunjika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses). If that is too long for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th chapter or just the 11th chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just the moola mantra (navaakshari) .
 
If one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well, a homam with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.
 
*        *        *
 
A few mails from the last couple of weeks are pending reply. I am aware of it and will try to catch up. I am very busy with various things right now. Please do not resend the mails. If I have something to say, I will send a reply in the next 10 days.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
