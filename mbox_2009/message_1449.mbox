Namaste,
 
Yes, he implies "Savitru Gaayatri" by Savitri. For that mantra, =
Savitaa is the deity, Saavitri is the shakti, Gaayatri is the metre and Vis=
hwamitra is the rishi. He is identifying the mantra by its shakti. He is sa=
ying that a mantra for Gaayatri devi is hidden.
 
Forget all that, this Sav=
itru Gaayatri mantra is powerful. If you spend 2 hours everyday on it with =
eyes closed and body movement minimized and brahmacharya maintained, it wil=
l definitely make some difference internally.
 
Yes, you can do this kind o=
f sadhana for any prasiddha mantra. The key is to follow the rules and spen=
d a considerable amount of time (e.g. 2 hours) everyday.
 
Best regards,

  Dear Narsimha,


  Some very valuable insight by Manish ji. Does he i=
mply Savitur Gayatri by ' Savitri' and what does he mean when he says the r=
eal Gayatri is hidden?
  I reckon for this type of ' sadhna' one can use an=
y other prasidha mantra as well.
  Would value your response.
  By the way,=
 although you do not need any support from list members, your cool and coll=
ected response on the thread is really admirable.
  As this is not relevant=
 to sohamsa list I have posted this only on this group.
  Many thanks

    Dear Narasimha,

    When the sadhaka efface=
s his own personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occupies =
him, then at that stage there is
    no real difference between the sadhaka=
 and the Deity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say th=
at there is no real difference).
    The difference that one feels is as fo=
llows:
    One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
    A =
few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity posse=
sses the sadhaka and the sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa R=
etas),
    During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or ha=
nds or face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details =
of the room (even though the sadhak's eyes are closed).
    The sadhak typi=
cally becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.
    The whole day the sa=
dhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i again experience the Belov=
ed.
    That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.
  =
  When the sadhak's personality is effaced such that the deity's personalit=
y sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that Deity(Devata).
   =
 There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a ce=
rtain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that which ap=
pears to be bad) . The deity's personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make th=
e person care almost for nothing himself, so self identification is minimis=
ed and the person's spiritual evolution continues.
    Remember, there is v=
ery little according to me which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti.=
 If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, Mah=
aKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Prov=
ided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins t=
he realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a se=
parate realm reserved for these beings.
    Attacking such a sadhak brings =
the full bearing of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people m=
ay realise this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying=
 the city of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may =
even equate this with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(=
Bit like you attack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from=
 that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you a=
ttack somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas=
 left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on =
the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).
    If peo=
ple persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then th=
ere is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover then their minds an=
d intellects will not be free of identification with the body and so their =
actions are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people u=
sually join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this i=
s not an enjoyable experience.
    Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chand=
ika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that=
 deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(beca=
use of his previous effort).
    On the other hand somebody doing this mant=
ra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantr=
a are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.
    According to me the=
 proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.
=
    If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reititio=
ns of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidde=
n) every day, main constraints
    Same time every day.
    Same place.
   =
 Same materials.
    Same direction.
    As little movement as one can.
   =
 Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
    Complete restraint=
 on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake,=
 grow a beard.
    Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels=
 are empty before you start.
    Continue this for 100 days and do this who=
le procedure 3 times.
    See the difference in your personality before and=
 after.
    Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, s=
o do some sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physical=
ly possible.
    I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were bein=
g discussed.

    Kind Love and Regards
    manish

      Some may be fascinated by the text=

      Most people w=
ho talk about mantra shastra focus on the chaff and not on the grain.

      I menti=
oned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mantras and technic=
alities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who w=
ill take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and a=
ll the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen techn=
icalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god. That =
is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works sl=
ightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.

      Also, com=
manding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic,=
 which can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually =
and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as g=
ods is possible only for a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely=
 small ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achie=
vement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in c=
ompletely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repea=
t something from the previous mail to clarify:

      The universe has many=
 lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. There are i=
nfinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are i=
nfinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind an=
d *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in=
 the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorp=
tion of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the fl=
ow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that =
causes corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding kar=
mic interactions between various objects.

      Each set of "karmic intera=
ctions between various objects" is a "result". Various mantras are for vari=
ous "results". One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and ge=
tting a specific result from it as "commanding a result" from god. Whether =
you like the term or not, it is essentially that.

      *        *        =
*

      But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very=
 low ego can command specific results from god (not for selfishness or even=
 ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfill=
ing one's dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mant=
ra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.

      Those are h=
ardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos seeking specific s=
elfish results. They cannot command specific results from god (because of t=
heir heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own atta=
chment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra sha=
stra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their ti=
me with these technicalities, they will be better off learning to be good b=
eggars at God's door.

      Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you=
 feel attracted to, without worrying about so many technicalities, and lear=
n to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give yo=
u what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.

     =
 Keep praying every day or every second when you are able to. Even when you=
 are not praying, remember him in all of your actions. When you enjoy somet=
hing in the material world, tell yourself that it is his and that he gave i=
t to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind wi=
ll start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more imp=
ortant than picking the right mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that =
too based on unreliable knowledge coming from questionable sources!).

    =
  *        *        *

      There may be a mountain with thousands of path=
s (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (differe=
nt experience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert adv=
isors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a s=
pecific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped perso=
n without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only to pe=
rson with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb=
 the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).

      E=
ven when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb the mou=
ntain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and traverse the l=
ong path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are bogged do=
wn by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantra advice f=
rom astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by doing that=
 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a powerful man=
tra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after* one succe=
eds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a path lead=
ing to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particularly beauti=
ful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive the climb al=
ong the long path.

      We need to emphasize the attitude and approach ne=
eded for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice of the path bas=
ed on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers w=
ho came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mant=
ra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct atti=
tude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, =
humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to b=
e oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

      Parasara's definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighbor=
ing areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of fire and water ele=
ments. "I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta" is a wrong approa=
ch. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars=
, a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *=
transition* in a contiguous space.

      In your example of upapada lord's=
 tithi, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition=
.

      Well, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based =
on marrying two different teachings of Parasara (bhava karakas and special =
lagnas). I do not really consider it as my creation but as understanding Pa=
rasara's teachings only.

      Subject: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: Res=
olving Points)


      Dear Sanjay,

      > Since you do not have any real=
 definition of Gandanta, I am dropping that

      I do have a definition o=
f gandanta, which is Parasara's definition in BPHS.

      Since some of yo=
u are extrapolating it based on the fire embodied in UL and water embodied =
in tithis, the onus is on you to outline and justify your definition. I got=
 into this thread because statements were made that fasting on particular w=
eekdays or tithis in a chart can cause "insult to Vishnu", "serious doshas"=
 and "danger to spouse", based on these far-fetched extrapolations of ganda=
nta.

      > Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.

  =
    Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and arudhas=
 represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful. Now, you associated =
UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri and water. I=
 question whether the new theory on fasting is really in line with everythi=
ng you have learnt (and taught).

      BTW, I specifically asked for a cla=
rification on whether this was based on your own thinking or from classics/=
parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context). Like so many times =
with similar questions I asked privately and recently publicly, you did not=
 respond.

      *        *        *

      > Statement 1 is an arrogance t=
hat the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus
      > and has no relevance as th=
e remedial measures prescribed by

      > not of much consequence.

      Fi=
rst of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or ti=
this based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.

      For doshas in birth =
chart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings o=
f planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to=
 perform them. His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I=
 am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fa=
ct slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselv=
es.

      Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of thes=
e homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e=
.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based o=
n the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudh=
a in the chart.

      Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from=
 Parasara.

      Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are men=
tioning complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of r=
ishis and scaring people that performing austerities such as fasting on cer=
tain days cause "danger to spouse" or "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu=
", based on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty=
 thinking. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on d=
ifferent days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the differenc=
e between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a "wrong day" doe=
s not cause danger as being suggested.

      Third, our shastras primarily=
 talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the energ=
y of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday=
 or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespe=
ctive of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man come=
s out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is bet=
ter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is mo=
re important.

      Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is mor=
e important and the variations based on individual horoscope are less impor=
tant. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But they are smal=
ler and, more importantly, I question if they are actually well-understood =
by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and o=
ver-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin and scaring people=
 on that basis.

      *        *        *

      > Statement 2 is an arrog=
ance that the entire mantra shastra is useless

      > seers=
.

      I did not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability=
 to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into consideration=
.

      The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings=
 and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between =
them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to=
 perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts b=
ut the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences t=
he mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then cau=
ses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (spe=
cific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the =
universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.

  =
    However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant=
 to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the =
mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness =
is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are ext=
remely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantr=
a and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

      *       =
 *        *

      Just repeating a combination of sounds does not guarante=
e anything. Some people may think that certain results come when they repea=
t a mantra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra m=
ay work for one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chantin=
g it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is=
 needed for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one =
may think.

      *        *        *

      A highly learned scholar in th=
e court of a king may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants=
 from king. An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather than tr=
ying to command (and failing for sure).

      Similarly, most people are b=
etter off begging god for what they want rather than trying to use the righ=
t mantra to command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabular=
y or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, =
surrender, patience and persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A begga=
r needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, bes=
t bet for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god's door.

     =
 What people today need for material and spiritual progress through remedia=
l measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a better choice =
of tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to =
command a specific result from god.

      It is worth noting that so many =
great spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphas=
ize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasiz=
ed having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience,=
 persistence, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and =
useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and i=
mpress god.

      *        *        *

      One more thing. We have many =
mantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on ho=
w to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers tod=
ay do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules c=
oming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperf=
ection. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irr=
espective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord an=
d 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good fo=
r debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's as=
trologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara's guidelines.

      If one has=
 a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of a=
n astrology theoretician.

      If not, there is no foolproof way to know =
the right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel =
attracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitud=
e. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at=
 god's door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you =
succeed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of succe=
ss than great scholars.

      Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panc=
hakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krish=
na maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra e=
tc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without =
the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.

   =
   *        *        *

      I hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand. =
I discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisd=

        om paramesthi gurave namah

        Dear Narasi=
mha,

        Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, I am d=
ropping that and continue with my belief of the junction between Agni and J=
ala rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctions. Which is perfectly=
 in line with everything I have learnt.

        Two statements you have ma=
de contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. Please correct =
me if I am not understanding you well out here -

        1. Statement 1: *=
fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as the sankalpa has been m=
ade for the devata you intend to pray to. Results maybe a bit delayed but w=
ill be there.
        2. Statement 2: *reciting any prayer* will give the d=
esired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy

        Is this what you =
intended to say or did I get this wrong?

        Statement 1 is an arrogan=
ce that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no relevance as the re=
medial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done on specific da=
ys are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like another astr=
ologer I had known some time back whose statements like this coerced me to =
write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled but such pr=
etexts to knowledge.

        Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire m=
antra shastra is useless and the Rishi=E2=80=99s were wasting time in givin=
g so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vi=
shnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying tha=
t we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have=
 to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic s=
eers.

        I think there is something wrong in the way you are saying w=
hat you want to say. Please rethink and correct your statements for the sak=
e of good record in this list.

      [Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water does i=

      My point is that the examples given have no real identifiabl=

      One can be creative and come up wi=
th a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala=
 tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as a=
gni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon =
and Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on=
 the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and seri=

 and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I said that my interest =
in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted m=
e to study the teachings of Parasara independently, meditate on them and sh=
are my interpretations with the world. He said I was very passionate in my =
Jyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispass=
ionately and without an attachment. He felt that I still have a contributio=
n to make to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unattached karma. His word=
 is everything for me.

      What I told you recently is not that I was le=
aving Jyotish but what I said above.

      However, if your judgment is co=
rrect and if Jyotish is indeed "leaving" me, I am sure my spiritual guru wi=
ll realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.

      [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.

      Is all that is=
 being taught and practiced now strictly from "Puranas and other teachings =
of the seers"?

      I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of co=
urse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.

=
      To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a =
brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some diff=
erence. But it is secondary. To say that "danger" and "serious doshas" (see=
 the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong=
. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also=
 a gross exaggeration.

      The main thing is that you need milk and suga=
r. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends=
 up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simpl=
y pick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will t=
ake an extra half hour, but the job will be done.

      I request Jyotishi=
s to behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and sa=
y that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or tithi in a ch=
art) can cause "danger" and "serious doshas". No wonder some spiritual teac=
hers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and se=
lf-importance from us does not help our cause!

      Yes, Jyotish is helpf=
ul, but let us not oversell it or overplay the importance...

      [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more=
