Dear Utpal,

There are many paths. They are all different, but all are valid paths. But 
each comes with different strengths and weaknesses.

Homam requires external substances that need to be acquired and used. By 
god's grace, many of us can afford to do it and we do it. But it is not 
affordable to all. Can a poor person with not much to eat do a homam 
everyday? Even if homam is done on a very small scale, it still requires 
atleast half a coconut and some ghee. That costs money. One can buy some 
food with that money!

But the strength of homam is that nobody is at risk with it. Even one with 
very bad vaasanas and not supervised by a capable guru will only benefit 
from homam. As one performs it everyday, one's vasanas will be purified one 
by one. There is no risk of fall.

Raja yoga practices need your body and air that is available everywhere 
freely. It is far simpler and easier and everyone can afford it.

However, it is not risk free. If one is eating saattwik food in limited 
amounts, leading a saattwik lifestyle, has good control over mind and the 
air being breathed is pure and a guru is available to save if energy rises 
and becomes uncontrollable, then raja yoga and hatha yoga practices will 
work. If one of these is lacking, one can run into problems.

These are not just my words. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who mastered various 
spiritual paths (including various sects of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, 
jnaana yoga, bhakti yoga, karma yoga and raja yoga), told his sishyas that 
raja yoga and hatha yoga are risky in this age.

Best regards,
Narasimha
