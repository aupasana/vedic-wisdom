Dear Narasimha,
   In my opinion, there are three distinct=
 phases that lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - correspond=
ing to the three bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (K=
arana) resp.

Rising above Ego is Jnana   - Merging Physical body in Physic=
al cosmos
Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cos=
mos
Rising above Chitta is Yoga   - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos

 =
  Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.

   Your com=
ments.
Regards,
Nitish

         We can see the difference between a body with prana and with out p=
rana. Can't we? Then, why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see pra=
na/atma sceintifically? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a =
path, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse that path.=

s one of the finest path I am sure.
> 
>         However, my understanding =
of this path differs a little from your understanding. Gyana, I believe, is=
 not really study of scriptures or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debat=
es etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is a state of being,  where one percieves=
 a certain oneness in the universe. It is achieved through sadhana. To be c=
onstantly in a state of discrimination between real and not-real, rejecting=
 the non-real, such that whatever is finally left is nothing but the eterna=
l. This is the sadhana of the marga called Gyan. But sadhana it is without =
a doubt.
> 
>         Whatever be the path, sadhana is a must to achieve th=
e results. Adi Shankara, they say, was an expert in the scriptures and scri=
ptural debates. But I feel, he engaged in all these once he had already bec=
ome a gyani through his sadhana. He was not a gyani because he debated a lo=
t or knew many scriptures, he was a gyani because he had achieved a state o=
f oneness.

       There is no question that is useless and there is no answer that is =
not relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that God is=
 not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be perceived=
. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your curren=
t knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing you can=
 not otherwise.
