Namaste,

Yes, some people offer it for Sun in navagraha homam.

Dry turmeric sticks can be offered to the divine Mother along with 
poornaahuti or as an aahuti. Some people offer turmeric sticks while 
chanting Durga sooktam, at the end of Chandi homam. If you do Chandi homam, 
you may consider offering turmeric stick as the aahuti when chanting the 
11th chapter shloka "sarva mangala maangalye shive sarvaartha saadhike, 
saranye tryambake gauri naaraayani namostu te".

Best regards,
Narasimha
