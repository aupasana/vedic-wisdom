Namaste
=C2=A0
Adding "swaahaa" in veda mantras may require changing the sw=
aram 
(intonation) of the last few syllables of the mantra. Most
people are=
 unfamiliar with the relevant rules. Even some good 
priests end up reading=
 the verse with the original swaram and simply
add "swaahaa". This is not c=
orrect. It is instead better to not 
add "swaahaa" and to read it as is and=
 not make an offering.
=C2=A0
So if someone is doing a homa of only the Dev=
i Suktam, how to do? Or what to do? 
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi





Th=
e upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste Raj=
arshi,

Ooops! sorry for the misleading information. i went thro' the manua=
l 
again. 

In the manual Narasimha has suggested following: 

[After kavac=
ham, argala and keelakam, read "Ratri sooktam" without 
offering anything i=
n the fire. Do not even add "swaahaa" at the
end of each verse.]

[
Then "D=
evi sooktam" may be read without offering anything in the 
fire. Do not eve=
n add "swaahaa" at the end of each verse
]

The Reason for above is mention=
ed in the following foot note.

[
Adding "swaahaa" in veda mantras may requ=
ire changing the swaram 
(intonation) of the last few syllables of the mant=
ra. Most
people are unfamiliar with the relevant rules. Even some good 
pri=
ests end up reading the verse with the original swaram and simply
add "swaa=
haa". This is not correct. It is instead better to not 
add "swaahaa" and t=
o read it as is and not make an offering.
]

Warm Regards,
utpal

Thank you Utpalji. I was asking about Devi Suktam itself. As per 
Narasimha=
ji' s advise I have told the person to carry on homas of 
devi suktam (whic=

else. I will check the Chan=
