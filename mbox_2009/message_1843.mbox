Namaste,

Lord Vishnu is the protector of the Universe. So it becomes His duty to protect the earth, His devotees or the other Gods against the various demonic forces. He has to take several avataras depending on what the situation is and how to vanquish the demonic forces (that also depends on what boons those Rakshasas had obtained from other deities).

Lord Shiva is the final truth. He annihilates the Universe and assimilates everything unto Himself. He does not need to come in any avataras to vanquish any demonic forces. Most creatures, even Rakshasas, worship Lord Shiva and no one dares to go against Him, except for some creatures like Bhasmasura, Tripurasura, etc. In those cases, Lord Shiva comes as Himself to vanquish those Rakshasas.

This is my understanding.

Regards,
Dr. Narasimhaswamy Banavara

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why only avatara of Vishnu





I am not an authoirty on this subject, but dwelling on to the topic nevertheless.

Puranas do talk about avataras of Shiva as well. How ever, they may be less popular among vaishnavaites.

Hanuman is an avatara of Shiva. I also heard about few other stories where Shivji took human birth to marry Parvathi who is born as a girl on earth (Kamakshi?).

How ever, I am not very familiar with Shiva's avataras (excluding Hanuman) that kills a rakshasa. Shiva killed many demons himself but mostly as Shiva himself and with out going through an avatara.

This perhaps is because Shiva being a maha yogi does not need to obey and go through Maya to show his Leela. Vishnu on the otherhand went through Maya and showedf his leela.

Best regards,
Vijay

Why is it that only the qualities(avatara) of Vishnu are necessary to bring about Righteousness on Earth? Why not qualities(avataras) of Shiva (destroyer of tamas) are required or to put it more clearly, why doesn't puranas mention about Shiva avataras but only Vishnu avataras?
