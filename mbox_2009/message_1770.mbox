 Arjun Mishra and his wife did not have much material wealth. In fact, they=
 were poorer than most poor. Like other Brahmins in those days, he never sh=
owed any interest in making money. His life was for studying the Gita and t=

t means, he saw Sri Krishna everywhere and in everybody, pervading the univ=

> 
> Indeed, nobody =
can be wise enough to discuss every message in the words of God. Those thou=
ghts humbled Arjun Mishra very much. But then, he wanted to write the comme=
ntary. So he reasoned, "if I get stuck, I will ask Sri Krishna to help me o=
ut with the meaning and wait. I am not going to rationalize, but just wait =
for Sri Krishna. May be Sri Krishna will have mercy on me, and teach me per=
sonally! Nothing can be more wonderful."
> He was doing fine with writing t=
he commentary until he came to verse 9.22 (that's the verse in the beginnin=
g of this story). A doubt came to his mind. Vahaamyaham? Can it really be t=
rue? God lugging provisions on His own back? How can that be? He believed i=
n God's words in the Gita, but just couldn't accept that God can also be th=
e porter for His devotees.

 rationalize, but that's exactly what he started doing. He reasoned, "May b=

ng so, he drew a line through the word vahaamyaham in his commentary with r=
ed ink. Isn't it interesting how we want God to conform to our model of Him=
? But the devotee in Arjun Mishra took over soon. He remembered his vow abo=
ut not rationalizing. He suddenly became very disappointed with himself. He=
 stopped writing and got up, with a sad heart that he just broke his vow. W=
hat could he do? After a while, he got back some of his composure and said =
a prayer to Sri Krishna in all humility, "Please teach me, O Madhava! I am =
ignorant and foolish and I do not know what you mean by vahaamyaham. Please=
 teach me, and guide me so the commentary can be completed. You give so muc=
h help to Your devotees. I know I am only a poor undeserving devotee, but p=
lease have mercy on me and help me."

 since morning. Please go to beg for alms, otherwise we will have to go hun=
gry."

ered it an honor to give food grains and vegetables to Brahmins like him. T=
heir begging is called maadhukari. Arjun Mishra was distraught from the mor=
ning, so he thought that he would go to take a dip in the holy Rohini kunda=
 first. He set out from home, the kunda was a little distance away.
> 
> As=
 he was walking towards the kunda, he remembered the story of the old crow =
in the Skanda puran. When the crow realized that death was near, it flew to=
 the Rohini Kunda and took a bath in the water and then looked devotedly at=
 Lord Jagannatha on the temple alter. Soon afterwards, it died and became f=
ree from life. Arjun Mishra thought that taking a dip in such a holy water =
will help him as well.
> 
> While he was gone, two young boys arrived at th=
e Mishra home with big sacks on their backs, huffing and puffing from the l=
oad. They looked miserable and were crying loudly. Arjun Mishra's wife was =
sitting on the verandah, looking out for her husband. When she saw the boys=
, she came down the steps running, very concerned. She was an extremely kin=
d lady.

ot understand who would hurt such young boys. Who is making you carry such =
heavy sacks? Where are you going?"

cars of fresh injury on their backs. Blood was oozing out from their scars.=
 "Oh! What kind of heartless person can beat small children in this manner?=
" she exclaimed.
> 
> She picked the two boys up in her arms and brought th=
em inside the house। She sat them down on wooden seats they had in th=
e verandah, and ran inside. There was no food in the house, so she brought =
two cups of cold water for them. After drinking the water, the boys looked =
slightly more comfortable. They said to her, "Ma! Punditji beat us, and mad=

could not wait for all the answers. She had to take care of their wounds fi=
rst. She ran inside again, and came back with a big pot of water and some b=
andage cloth. They had a ghritakumari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ra=
n to it and broke a fat leaf. Then she mashed the leaf with her masala-grin=
ding stone and collected the expressed resin. She was now ready to dress th=
eir wounds. She cleaned their wounds, put a little of the ghritakumari extr=
act and made a cloth bandage. The ghritakumari resin soothed their wounds a=

 for play. We want to go, Ma" they said. Then they bowed before her and lef=
t.

 She also knew how little boys are.. always short on patience. So, she hugg=
ed them and did not press for more answers and let them go. Then her though=
ts turned again to her husband. She just did not understand how her gentle =
husband could have hurt those boys. Anyway, she did not have time to think =
too much. She needed to start cooking. So she picked up the groceries and s=
tarted cooking. Her husband should come back any time now.
> 
> Arjun Mishr=
a had taken the vow of three-house maadhukari. He would only go to three ho=
uses and accept one handful of rice and some vegetables from each house. It=
 had rained heavily the night before and it rained all morning. The three h=
ouses he went to, were all flooded. He called out, but nobody was home. Peo=
ple had left for higher ground. So he came back home empty-handed. When he =
got home, he found his wife was cooking something. He thought that somebody=
 must have brought some food for them.

 She said in disbelief.
> 
> "Why should I beat anybody? You saw what I was=
 doing since morning. I was writing about the Gita. Then I went to the Rohi=
ni kunda and took a bath. Then I went for maadhukari. From there, I came st=
raight back home. I did not see any boys." He said in defense.

y had scars across their backs, and were bleeding. I treated them with ghri=
takumari myself. " She said.

was bad enough. What did they do that you beat them with a sharp iron stick=

 where he was writing in the morning. He was about to sit down, but his wif=

 and sat down to eat. "I do not understand how the day is going. First, I g=

I beat up two young boys." He mumbled. "Who brought us the food?"

se two boys, who else? You had sent them with the food, they told me." She =
said.

id, "Eat now. I have work to do."

said.

"They were cute little boys. The younger one was dark and the older one was=
 fair." She said.
> 
> Arjun Mishra did not need any more clues. He immedia=
tely realized who the two boys were: they were Sri Krishna and Balarama. In=
 the morning, he had doubted that Sri Krishna will personally carry provisi=
ons for his devotees. To show him that He does, He carried a sack of grocer=
ies on His back. He even made Sri Balarama carry a second sack for them for=
 another meal. And, he struck out the word vahaamyaham with red ink. That m=
ark Sri Krishna carried as injury.

> Arjun Mishra could eat no more. He =
was chocking with emotion. He had picked up a morsel, but he put that on hi=
s head and sat there in silence. Tears streamed out from his eyes.

this is prasad. Those boys were Sri Krishna and Balarama. You are so fortun=
ate that you saw them. Eat some of the prasad yourself and let's go out to =
fetch everybody in the village. This we should share with everyone." He sai=
d excitedly.Then he explained to her what had happened since morning.
> 
> =
She ate some prasad excitedly. After that, they had a big celebration with =
the neighbors sharing the prasad. There were lots of Harinam singing and ec=
static dancing. After everyone had gone home, Arjun Mishra went to his writ=
ing room. He wrote: vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham. He was convinced=
 of God's promise to His devotees.
> 
> Arjun Mishra wrote an excellent com=
mentary of the Gita with real Spiritual insights. His commentary is famous =
for the triple mention of vahaamyaham. The message of this story is that we=
 should never seek an imaginary relationship with God and trust God to pers=
onally help us, teach us and at the end, liberate us. If we do not have tha=
t confidence, we are not worthy of being called devotees.
