Namaste Ajit ji,

>Looking back,
>reading this book helped form my opinion,=
 and I thought that others >might find the book to be equally revealing.

i=
 sincerely wish to know if this perticular book has something new to offer.=
 i've gone through some books such as Vivekchudamani, Yogavaasishtha, Autob=
iography of a Yogi, Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, God loves fun, bang on the d=
oor and few other such spiritual and philosophical works.
Although i've men=
tioned earlier that the intrest of reading is at all time low in me, i woul=
d like to read the book as you have strongly recommended it.

Best Regards,=


Utpal
