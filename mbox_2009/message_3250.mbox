Namaste Rajarshi,

Thanks for painting such an portrait of this great perso=
n with your words.

Spending 72 hours in meditation is act of no ordinary p=
erson. His other
characteristics and experiences assert that he is a great =
person. I am
troubled by one thing just like you are. It is understandable =
if he says
Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a great perso=
n claims
Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition =
of God
which differentiates Rama from Krishna?

-Kishore

<div>=A0=
</div>
<div>Before I tell you anything more=A0about his spiritual life=A0th=
at I know, let me say=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine=

this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoev=

<div>One day=
, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to off=

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Then he started me=
