Namaste,
=C2=A0
Some more queries came up while thinking about the idol wo=
rship etc.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to =
an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one's enemies, brings=
 people under one's control=C2=A0and makes one successful. Suppose you focu=
s on that idol. 
=C2=A0
1) My question is, so eventually some thoughts/emot=
ions of the worshipper gets lodged in the idol, both positive and negative.=
 What is the relevance of doing a pranpratistha in an idol? Will not the ri=
tual of pranpratistha bring the energy of the deity into the idol? If it do=
es, then how can the emotions/thoughts of the worshipper get lodged in the =
idol since it already contains the energy of the deity?
=C2=A0
Or does it m=
ean that the energy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged in an idol where =
the pranpratistha ritual has been incorrectly/incompletely done, which happ=
ens so often in the case of idols at home.
=C2=A0
2) What is the relevance =
of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual.=C2=A0 Or rather, the sign=
ificance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituality in general. If the pranp=
ratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other language and used, w=
ill it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of the person doing=
 the prasnpratistha to be a constant?
=C2=A0
I mean, let us leave aside the=
 case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha of an idol because someone lik=
e Him does not need language to call the deity into an idol. But for others=
, how important is Sanskrit?

On a different issue about judging=C2=A0so called holy men from history=C2=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or othe=
rwise
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
While what you say is correct, there can always =
be some rational judgement passed on figures from history based on incontro=
vertible evidence. And I don't mean the actions of their followers but the =
very own lives of these people as recorded by their contemporaries. 
=C2=A0=

Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that always judg=
e a holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. That is real=
ly the BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to be spiritual=
. 
=C2=A0
Therefore, if a=C2=A0historically authentic biography of a spirit=
ual person is read and compared with standard=C2=A0models of spirtuality/sp=
iritual life along with the words/saying of the person,=C2=A0one can make a=
 fair judgement. It is using these tools that one can very easily question =
the spiritual realizations of=C2=A0some so called prophets in history.

=EF=BB=BF 
Dear Ra=
jarshi,
=C2=A0
Before I answer your main question, I want to address the fo=
llowing:
=C2=A0
> Interestingly, even that spiritual=C2=A0person=C2=A0told =
him that there is probably
> no divine presence inside the idol at Kaaligha=
t temple.
> 
> Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did =
not have a divine
> presence why did=C2=A0this person=C2=A0suddenly have su=
ch a nice meditation there?
=C2=A0
Two points:
=C2=A0
(1) One can have a ni=
ce meditation session anywhere. While different places and times have some =
difference in the nature and degree of spiritual energy, one can experience=
 anything anywhere anytime, if the internal factors are conducive.
=C2=A0
(=
2)=C2=A0What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observatio=
n. Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible tha=
t Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar=
 and I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and obser=
ve is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. T=
he Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.
=C2=A0
> But then, what ever the=
 idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/
> destruction, if someone pr=
ays to it with devotion, assuming that it is
> reaching God, is it=C2=A0not=
 enough?
=C2=A0
The purpose of an=C2=A0idol is to evoke certain imagery or =
thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form =
of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets =
"established" in that idol. As time goes on, his mind=C2=A0can be focused o=
n that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Thoug=
h we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected fee=
bly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people's st=
rong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as=
 a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on =
a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another =
person too.
=C2=A0
However, there is some translation involved when thought=
s of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This t=
ranslation is dependent on one's mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceiv=
e at the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!
=C2=A0
Suppose a=
 foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce godde=
ss who kills all of one's enemies, brings people under one's control=C2=A0a=
nd makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susce=
ptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who hel=
ps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is go=
ing to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a reposit=
ory of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.
=C2=A0
However, pleas=
e note that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes =
to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain d=
esires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyo=
ne praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The co=
ncentration of thoughts may be a=C2=A0little higher when an idol serves as =
a repository as opposed to just air. That's all.
=C2=A0
However, please not=
e that most people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some f=
ear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol.=
 Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of d=
esirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This d=
ownside becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas=
 indulging in terrible practices without understanding what they are doing.=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Bottomline is that I do not see any=
 risk in idol worship.

=C2=A0
> Does Man create God, =
or God creates man?
=C2=A0
God created man as his replica. But the replica =
got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fil=
l the mind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free f=
rom this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he i=
s not able to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of=
 his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and ke=
ep refining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure.=
 When one is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will ma=
tch the god that created man in the first place. When that god fills one's =
mind, one is free from the cycle.

=C2=A0
I saw people=
 deviating and speaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders o=
f other religions.
=C2=A0
In general, please remember that saying negative =
things about people that one may not have understood fully or correctly is =
unwise.
=C2=A0
>From time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of th=
e world to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is requi=
red in that part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spir=
itual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to fo=
llow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that p=
erson! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some l=
evel of realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging peo=
ple we have not met physically or otherwise.
=C2=A0
If one is unhappy becau=
se of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spiritual=

 the equilibrium=C2=A0from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do you=

Namaste,
=C2=A0
To add to my que=
ry,=C2=A0a good number of=C2=A0religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. =
If the underlying truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? 
=C2=A0
I c=
an understand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imaginati=
on which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can =
actually call Mahakali into an Idol.
=C2=A0
But then, what ever the idol ma=

with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God, is it=C2=A0not enough? Aft=

=C2=A0

a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in=C2=A0his mind that night, e=
xcept for an overwhelming

=C2=A0
Some=C2=A0months=C2=A0later=C2=A0he ended up=
 meeting a very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the G=

=C2=A0

If an incense stick with int=

Similarly, when a great saint meditates=

It is my humble opinion that som=
e famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not wa=
nt to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples see=
m to have a powerful divine presence.
=C2=A0
I was very impressed with the=
=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills=
 in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's plac=
e). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There=
 are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, even=
 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshinesh=
war is "alive". I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat te=
mple which is also in Calcutta.
=C2=A0
There was one small temple in Tamil =
Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples =
all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006=
. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. Th=
e name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil=
 language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name=
 now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in f=
ront of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose =
face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence t=
here. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess=
, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roo=
f over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident e=
ach time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no ro=
of. Though we spent only 5 min and left
 in a hurry, I was very pleased wit=
h that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the templ=
e and goddess.
=C2=A0
Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a po=
werful divine presence across India.
=C2=A0
Apart from the Kaali temple at =
Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishn=
a/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is=
 still meditating in the underground chamber there.
=C2=A0

=
=C2=A0
Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating tha=
n a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tam=
as. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there=
. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view i=
s that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are reall=
y good.
=C2=A0
If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sa=
dhana near a temple, I suggest the following:
=C2=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar=
, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam h=
ills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shi=
rdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, V=
aranasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantrala=
yam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.
=C2=A0
There are many other good plac=
es, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and =
staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and d=
oing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.

<DIV>While what you say is correct, there can always be some rational=

<DIV>Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that alway=

<DIV>Therefore, if a historically aut=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>To add to my query, a good nu=
mber of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying =
truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>I can understand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imagi=
nation which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who =
can actually call Mahakali into an Idol.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>But t=
hen, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/ destructio=
n, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God, =
is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecter of prayers. D=
oes not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whether a divine pres=
ence is there or not there infront?</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
</FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I would like to mention a small incident here abou=
t someone I know well. There was a certain individual, who whenev=
er he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and=
 meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. Onc=
e he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to media=
te for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he&n=
bsp;*thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imaginat=
ion) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His =
mind become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, e=
verything was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him =
that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he fou=
nd that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a kilomete=
r distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he fe=
lt was a deep
 joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that =
night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomline=
: a nice spiritual experience.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FON=
T> </DIV>
<DIV>Some months later he ended up meeting a =
very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.&nbs=
p; He strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with =
the person was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person =
;told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaal=
ighat temple.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT><FONT face=3DAr=
ial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Now my question is, if the idol at th=
e Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this person&=
nbsp;suddenly have such a nice meditation there?  Does it me=
an that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts fo=
r spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has an=
y energy at all?</DIV>
