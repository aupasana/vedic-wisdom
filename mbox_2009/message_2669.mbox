Dear Rajarshi,

Not sure if I get the thrust of your point. Yes, sadhana is=
 the only way to know this for sure. And so also for everything else that i=
s below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do=
 read about them (all these things e.g Atma etc), and about the significanc=
e of the vedic gods anyway, dont we? They do offer a mild complement to sad=
hana, dont they? They do help make the mind more receptive toward the benef=
its of sadhana..

Also wanted to assure you that I really want to know the =
answer to the question. I am not interested in a he-said/she-said type game=
 (if perhaps that is what you were hinting at?). I am extremely curious as =
to why there is an order and not a parallelism, for e.g. why are the mahabh=
utas not simultaneously formed. There is some lesson in there (at least for=
 me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation betwee=
n that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get=
 ahead of myself..

Regards,

Sundeep
