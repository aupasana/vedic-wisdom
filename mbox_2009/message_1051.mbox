My knowledge of Sanskrit is very rusty and minimal, so I would
obviously de=
fer to Narasimha-garu's learned opinion on this; however
here is my $0.02.
=

I think this is a case of "lost in transliteration" -- the trailing
"a" th=
at you refer to in South Indian accents may be pronounced as
"uh"; not "aa"=
 -- 
That trailing "a" was probably added during transliteration to
disting=
uish between the "virama" ("stop" character, akin to a flipped
comma charac=
ter added at the bottom of the alphabet to indicate the
sound stopping, e.g=
. the word "tat" when written in Devanagari)
alphabets/words versus the com=
plete sound of the last letter.

In your examples, when written in Devanaga=
ri, the word Shiva does not
have a virama attached to the "va" alphabet; wh=
ich indicates that the
sound should be completed, and hence when transliter=
ated to english
they attach the trailing "a". Likewise for the Krishna exam=
ple you
provided.

My apologies in advance if I'm wrong!
Best,
./Dinesh
