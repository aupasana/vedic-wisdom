Hi, Some time back I saw=C2=A0 similar article and was intrigued by it. Who=
 might be coming down to earth to help Human Beings?

=C2=A0Personally, I b=
elieve it was pointing towards Mother Meera. She is a Enlightened person an=
d has helped thousands who go to her by removing some of their karmic cords=
. Although she now lives in Germany but in her younger days she was connect=
ed to Aurobindo;s ashram. 

Regards,
LaxmiNarayan

Namaste
=C2=A0
I found an interesting a=
rticle based on Sri Aurobindo's writing. I am posting it here for anyone in=
terested.
=C2=A0
Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian fr=
eedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which =
had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw th=
at the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw th=
at the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for thi=
s divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending t=
o Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resista=
nce held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mysti=
c, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embar=
ked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant=
 to the colossal uncertainties we face today.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw t=
hat the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore ha=
s a force of
 consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending do=
wn into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine ascend=
s back upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobind=
o, humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simult=
aneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experi=
encing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consci=
ousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
=
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in wh=
at he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if sel=
dom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if=
 obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. Th=
ere is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer sen=
ses seems to contradict it.

Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is goi=
ng through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the hu=
man mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessl=
y inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the =
Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the =
human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been es=
tablished in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is =
to bring it down into cellular consciousness.

Evolution took a great leap =
forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We =
are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as w=
e prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about fo=
ur stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience =
concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our c=
urrent species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but lar=
gely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =
=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous-ly coming to b=
irth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being th=
at is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mi=
nd-consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who wil=
l still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Min=
d of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with=
 cellular consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is=
 the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within =
the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=
=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and =
spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

The great work of Sri Aurobindo=
 and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cel=
lular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousn=
ess, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being=
 brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment wh=
en it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.
Whenev=
er there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. =
Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=
=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world to=
day. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of F=
alsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardl=
y apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. Accor=
ding to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transforma=
tion recently, and the Asura of Suffering has
 returned to Source, and so o=
nly the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, the=
y spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitl=
er during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering=
 his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be=
 influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.

With the=
 descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human str=
uctures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although=
 the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. T=
he power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the mos=
t part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried =
a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means othe=
r than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorb=
ed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may=
 be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the=
 destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonizati=
on!

When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that =
the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imm=
inent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a ce=
rtainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =
=EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said tha=
t the year 2000 would be a turning point.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This was a very int=
eresting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the=
 world.
