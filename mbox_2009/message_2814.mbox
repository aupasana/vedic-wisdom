Namaste,
=C2=A0
If a=
n incense stick with intense smell was burnt in a place, the air there will=
 be filled with that smell long after the stick completely burns. However, =
eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends o=
n how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.
=C2=A0
Similarly, when=
 a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled with that=
 saint's spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves=
 earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak an=
d disappears.
=C2=A0
In many famous temples these days, priests have become=
 commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed ever=
y few years to re-energize the idols 
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
It is =
my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine presence=
 today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some not-=
so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.
=C2=A0
I wa=
s very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=
e is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=
i (Ramana Maharshi's place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=
gy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically=
 alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the=
 Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did not get the same impression =
at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.
=C2=A0
There was o=
ne small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me t=
o visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi=
 homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seeme=
d like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0=
present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do n=
ot even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started medit=
ating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a v=
ery fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there =
was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of=
 the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess=
. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came =
down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess=
 likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left
 in a hurr=
y, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably kn=
ows the name of the temple and goddess.
=C2=A0
Like this, I am sure there a=
re many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.
=C2=A0
Apart =
from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when med=
itating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure t=
hat Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there=
.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Even the middle of a busy road in India is b=
etter for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so f=
illed with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a goo=
d amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to=
 meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. Bu=
t some temples are really good.
=C2=A0
If one has a chance to spend a few m=
onths doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:
=C2=
=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tir=
uvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati=
)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (=
Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India =
and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.
=C2=A0
Ther=
e are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a tem=
ple once is one thing and staying there for several months while maintainin=
g a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) th=
ere is quite another.
=C2=A0
