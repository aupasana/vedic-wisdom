Pranam Narsimha ji,

i had started with homam practices on akshaya tritiya =
this year. in the beginning i was at sea because there was a mental block a=
gainst rituals. but the way u have been descibing these practices, how they=
 are symbolic of a much deeper meaning, how it is a cleansing process, how =
we are strengthening our bhooth agni, etc., etc. i have become more regular=
 with this practice. if i miss it on a particular day i feel a crying need =
to to it the following day.

i must admit i have experimented with many pra=
ctices...have had several gurus...

sometimes i feel totally like wet grass=
 which is so difficult to ignite....but the resolve is there that to be ign=
ited is the most important thing of our existence on this bhoo plane.

now =
i have started to feel that everything is with a purpose... we just have to=
 be conscious of this. when u told me to start with ganapati worship even t=
hough i was naturally drawn to shiva, i think it was with a purpose. i coul=
d relate these things to my chart...but that is not so important...and as u=
 have mentioned, astrology has its limitations.

over the last few months i=
 have become very conscious of my limitations. Earlier, and to some extent =
even now, these limitations  sucked me down...made me feel low...frozen in =
thought...but i hope as i gain greater strength within i will learn how to =
overcome these feelings and become more free...of energies that pull me dow=
n...

at present chanting works for me better than meditation. i sometimes =
get emotional during chanting and tears start flowing. there are many block=
s that perhaps need to dissolve...

there is a certain relationship that ha=
s started building with ganapati and with fire. i feel happy to light the l=
amp and take the fire from it to the homam...to light the agarbattis ...to =
hear a certain roaring sound that develops if the fire is strong...to hear =
the fire crackle....and leap up...

a few times it has happened that the fi=
re has gone out...but i try not to get disturbed because of this...and ligh=
t it again.

i also feel that each and every part of the coconut should bur=
n completely...though i dont want to be obsessed by this...

little by litt=
le i feel i am beginning to see a little bit of lali mere lal ki...jit dekh=
un tit laal...

thank you!

whether these are hallucinations or genuine experiences, the key thing is: =
do not get attracted and get stuck. Suppose one is driving on a road going =
to the top of a mountain. Suppose the scenery at some spot is very beautifu=
l. If one is mesmerized by the scenery and stops there, one will never get =
to the top. However beautiful the scenery may be, it is just a distraction =
from the final target. Observe the beautiful scenery that comes before your=
 eyes, but do not develop any attachment with it. It is particularly undesi=
rable to develop an egoistic attachment, e.g. the sense that "I experienced=
 this. I have achieved something. I am worthy." Just observe whatever is th=
rown at you and continue the journey.

it comes, let it come. Still focus on the mantra.

buses were running full till 9:30 pm (for two travel companies). I'd an opt=

ord instructed me to go to a certain place and try for one specific 8 pm bu=
s which as per my knowledge was already full. I went there and they offered=
 me a seat near the driver and I was ok to sit there - but the driver asked=
 me to wait for 10 min as it was very hot inside (till the bus leaves). I w=
aited and went to grab a cup of tea. When I came back, I was told that the =
seat near the driver is gone and now I'm left with a spot near the bus door=
. In this seat, I certainly cannot afford to take a nap. I told in my mind =
- "O Lord - I'm so tired". Now typically, I'd loose my temper and shout at =
that guy. However, I felt some energy which is

lt I would burst at the driver but my anger did not come out (even I was wo=
ndering why). In next 2 min, the same guy came back to me and told me that =
one of the seats have been cancelled by some other passenger who did not tu=
rn up and asked me to move inside the bus. I was so thrilled and had no wor=
ds to thank the lord. I was able to have a very good nap - thanks to the "l=
eela of the lord".

experiencing some sort of divine light. I was thinking this was my hallucin=
ation earlier. But I'm unable to experience this without the homam. Earlier=
 I used to see a yellowish light (not the normal yellow that we generally s=
ee - but I know this is a divine one) which used to come and go - and give =
me a feel that I'm traversing thru a forest at a very high speed. I started=
 seeing some other colors as well. In addition to this, yesterday I saw a d=
ivine violet/purple color which was so pleasing - I can say I've never expe=
rienced like this before. The light started small and then it grew big. And=
 when all this went off and I opened my eyes, I saw that the external fire =
was also off. I do try sometimes to medidate without the homam, but I dont =
get such experiences. Is there any way you would suggest?
