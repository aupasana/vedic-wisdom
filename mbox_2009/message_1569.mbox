Namaste,

Very happy Ugadi to you and everyone there.

>When I moved, I men=
tally asked Siva to pardon me.

That's it. I think that should suffice for =
occassional happenings. I have no idea of Mantra for shifting the lord temp=
erorily.

My point in Abhisheka was that, if we don't like to bath with reu=
sed water then we don't do that for The lord.If we wish to eat best quality=
 food, we must strive to offer same quality if not the better as Naivedya. =
You know all this but still i wrote with the intentions that somebody comin=
g to the list might get some idea in future.

However, you are the best jud=
ge of your situation w.r.t. Abhisheka as you mentioned your practical diffi=
culties.

Vey happy Ugaadi, Cheti Chand, Gudi Padava, Navreh to every one f=
rom Andhra, Karnaataka, Maharashtra and Kashmir.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
