Respected K.V. Sarma,
For the benefit of laymen like me , can you kindly el=
aborate your statements? Particularly, I would like to know about Dharma of=
 different jivas like Brahmins, Ladies etc. etc. in Kaliyuga via-a-vis  the=
  applicable Dharma enjoined  in various Smrtis?  Can you also state in whi=
ch respects the  smrti injunctions are/were at variance with  the correspon=
ding provisions of Srti?  Does Srti talk of all that is said in Smritis?  H=
ow could the Rshis who wrote the Smrtis afford to write something contrary =
to the Srti?  Who wrote  the Dharma for Kaliyuga?.  From the Puranas  we kn=
ow the  prophesies /attributes of Kaliyuga and we see it  now. But what is =
the Dharma for Kaliyuga?  Is that Dharma available as a book?  Is chanting =
the name of the Lord  the only remedy for Kaliyuga?  Pl. clarify.
G.Balasub=
ramanian

(With specif=
ic reference to Sri GB's mail on yuga and validity of smRti-s. I think 'I k=
now' at least one 'member from various other groups' who is claiming un-san=
atana-ness of smRti-s and batting for more yuga-specific smRti-s. To the ex=
tent that 'he' accepts the sanatana-ness of SRti-s, I thank God.)
 
smRti-s=
 are yuga dharma-s, no doubt.
To "correct" the smRti to the yuga (and dESa =
as the case may be), there should be a "correction factor." If the correcti=
on factor (or method to find it) is not given, it is not a good "scientific=
 system."
Fortunately for us, we have the correction factors for smRti-s!!
=
The simplest and most basic (thumb rule ?) correction factor is:
smRti (the=
 yuga-specific "interpretation") should be subservient to "SRti."
Thus, whi=
chever are smRti-s (specifically those of today) that are "in line" with th=
e SRti-s, are to be followed; others should be avoided like plague.

div>(With specific reference to Sri GB's mail on yuga and validity of smRti=

 claiming <em>un-sanatana-ness</em> of smRti-s and batting for more&nb=
sp;yuga-specific smRti-s. To the extent that 'he' accepts the sanatana-ness=
 of SRti-s, I thank God.)</div>

<div> </div>
<div>smRti-s are yuga dh=
arma-s, no doubt.</div>
<p>To "correct" the smRti to the yuga (and dESa as =
the case may be), there should be a "correction factor." If the correction =
factor (or method to find it) is not given, it is not a good "scientific sy=
stem."</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, we have the correction factors for smRti=
-s!!</p>
<p>The simplest and most basic (thumb rule ?) correction factor is=
:<br>smRti (the yuga-specific "interpretation") should be subservient to "S=
Rti."</p>
<p>Thus, whichever are smRti-s (specifically those of today) that=
 are "in line" with the SRti-s, are to be followed; others should be avoide=

<div></div>
<div>Dear G.Bal=
asubramanian ji, 
<div><br></div>
<div>You have indeed raised a wonderful p=
oint. Our Sanatana Dharma prescribes Yuga Dharma. Every Yuga has its Manu. =
In this era of many false swamijis, how to spot Manu!? How to know what to =
do and what not to do? Whats right and whats wrong? Sanatana dharma encompa=
sses Yuga dharma too. While Sanatana Dharma has dharma prescribed for every=
 varna, why not for every yuga? Does it make the dharma non-sanatana?  =
;The context of Sanatana dharma needs to be understood right.  I will =
give what my understanding is. WHat I express in words here is subject to m=
y imperfections in communication and limitation of verbal communication.</d=
iv>

<div><br></div>
<div>Now, its becomes very difficult for human mind to=
 comprehend all of these and follow everything picture perfect. The present=
 day science is an offshoot of a much stronger Indian version of Sankhya an=
d (Tantra/Kriya )Yoga. There have been many great people who had tried=
 to achieve many things including realization by their self-effort, by mast=
ering and winning over the nature and its laws. Prakriti is rich with =
such laws. So what is the way out?  The Lord is all merciful. It =
is precisely this that Bhagavan Ramana has countered in his Upadesa Sara "K=
artrur agnaya Prapyate Phalam, Karma Kim Param, Karma thajjadam". Its a big=
 blow to all the ones who believe in cause-and-effect reslationships in the=
 context of realization. It is precisely this that Lord Sri krishna counter=
ed and asked Arjuna to surrender ALL of his dharma unto himself  - "Sa=
rva dharman parityajya".</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Self-Realization alone=
 is the one and only solution. So only a realized person can be right and p=
erfect? - Yes!  But, as humans, unrealized yet, our perfection lies in=
 simple, humble and total surrender that The Lord describes in The Gita. Na=
masamkirtanam, Bhakti and Surrender are sure ways of getting protection. By=
 this we do not fight the laws or win them trusting our effort or mind's po=
wer. But leave the result to Lord and faithfully execute the dharma to the =
extent to which it is possible in a contaminated world of Kali today. =
</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>The difference between science and our Indian =
scriptures including Charuvaka (as I have heard), were works which were don=
e by invoking and surrendering to The Lord. Science is NOT. Science does no=
t know God and refuses to recognise it. That is why science is science and =
has its limitation. Sanatana dharma , as I understand, never let anything o=
ut, it comprehended ALL forms of sciences, philosophies etc etc.. In that s=
ense it was holistic and tied it to The ONE who IS!</div>

<div><br></div>
=
<div>The Thalidomide 'aushada' of today is a product of human mind's scient=
ific pursuit. Science's falsified basis can produce many chemicals which re=
acts in desirable or non-desriable ways to the extent to which humans have =
reach (complex lab instruments, experiments, guinea pig experiments to test=
ing on humans). Ayurveda, for instance, a Rshi proktam proclaims the Truth.=
 ANY disease is due to the imbalance of the Vata-Pitta-Kapha. This cannot b=
e contested. Science needs minimum 100 years to comprehend the three. Scien=
ce (sense based bahirmukha approach in pursuit of Truth)  is an arroga=
nt little child who by the virtue of Kali has got some importance today. Ca=
n Ayurveda solve the problem? Yes, if and only if it is understood in the r=
ight manner. Can any other methods offered by our Rshis can solve the probl=
em? Yes, if and only if it is recieved and practised in exact same manner a=
s they described it.</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>So how to do it?  - I=
ts one's own Prarabda that decides. So what can help?? - Grace of The Lord =
alone can help! nothing else. Thalidomide may produce adverse reaction in p=
erson A (unfortunate ones) but not in B. Why? Science needs more time to an=
swer. </div>

<div><br></div>
<div>The answer is Prarabda and Grace. G=
race can effect anything. Science can never comprehend Divine Grace. Can on=
e measure the love and yearning of a child in a remote boarding school miss=
ing her mother? Can science quantify human love? Leave alone bhakti and Gra=
ce!! At the maximum science can define the child's yearning as "a mental an=
d emotional phenomenon by which a human goes through and exhibits emotional=
 states due to absence of company of comforting nature"   This is like=
 a blind man saying the elephant is like a long rope (touching its tail) an=
d another blind man saying that an elephant is a big boulder (touching its =
belly).. Science or technology cannot 'solve' the problems. It has indeed m=
ade the problems more complicated, in an attempt to solve them.</div>

<div=

<div>I suppose my attempt to clarify has helped clarify your qu=
ery. Do let me know if I have not.</div>

<div></div>
<div><br>Dear Dr.Praveen, 
<div><br></div>
<div=
>You have brought up a topic which was quite a significant one that helped =
me in a big way.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style=3D"text-decoration:=
 underline;">I would like to share my thoughts as I read through the post:<=
/span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Science - its strength (humility to stand=
 corrected as many times as necessary) and its weakness (its very basis whi=
ch is non holistic and its validity limited to ONLY to verifiable extent)</=
div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I admire the strength, which essentially is the h=
umility of its surrender to laws of nature , discovering them and meticulou=
sly studying and putting them down. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The we=
akness is totally a grave one, given that the 'science' is now ruling every=
thing, right from medicine, entertainment, profession, way of life, food, h=
ealth etc etc..</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Whats true today need not be tru=
e tomorrow when another theory or evidence over-rides it. (Due lack of any =
other alternatives) world helplessly clings to science. </div>
<div><b=
r></div>
<div>Moderation is the right way to go in utilizing anything, Scie=
nce is no exception. Unfortunately no leadership to call a spade a spade. T=
he atheist rules in the name of science today. In short period it might hav=
e seen success. But what is surfacing is the blunders committed in the name=
 of promoting science. Humanity is in a grave danger. Environment being des=
troyed, arms race growing, every day every person has to learn new stuff to=
 keep him upgraded. A well learned(so-called) man in modern times soon gets=
 outdated as science gets 'updated'. Is it not true that when no of people =
who need to upgrade themselves have increased? Which only means there are a=
 lot more people 'ignorant' and level of ignorance , in the name of science=
, technology and knowledge , keeps increasing.</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>=
If emails are order of the day, some futuristic multimedia, pda based virtu=
al world networking could be the order of tomorrow. May be in next year or =
two. No cyber laws. But lots of cyber crime!!  Seems that there is onl=
y more chaos than order.</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>I am neither cynical, =
nor would like to be. I also use emails and network in forums. WHat I have =
seen and observed is what I have shared. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I=
 would now like to share something that struck me to be very profound.</div=
>
<div><br></div>
<div>Vedas, Shastras, Ayurveda and any Rshi proktam is th=
e Truth. Unchanging with time, age, person and place. No revisions. No vers=
ion 1.0 or 2.0.  Because Rshi proktam is The Truth. Rshi is a Drshta a=
 'seer' who see the Truth as is. Can there be a better scientist? Today's s=
cientist needs a most complex lab with lost of instruments to measure accur=
ately and follow laws, formulae etc. Any error is very costly. Governments =
will apologise and easily get away by giving drugs which cause side-effects=
. Rshis have no take away from this world. They are unattached and are mani=
festation of Love and Truth. Realized and Divine. What they give is for ben=
efit of humanity and is purely selfless.</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>When I=
 realized the above fact, that's when it dawned on me as to how many people=
 are blindly wooed by the attractive science in a short term and pledge the=
ir souls to science, technology, fame and money.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div=
>DO we have enough time in one lifetime to go with ever-evolving science an=
d technology to gather the right 'knowledge' ? Or trust the ever valid Sana=
tana Dharma and align our puny tiny little life with much more powerful eve=
rlasting Truth of the Dharma and move towards realizationthe ultimate goal =
as outlined by our scriptures!..</div>
