Namaste,

I was wondering if anyone has the Roman transliteration of the text of
the Punyaah Vaachanam? I have the text of the Pavanamukta Suktam, but
do not have the other mantras that precede the suktam in the Punyaah
Vaachanam, which I understand is to be recited during the kalasha
stapana prior to homam (as an optional step).

I hope that everyone has had a wonderful Sharada Navaratri, and best
wishes for Vijaya Dashami!

Warm regards,
Aditi
