Sundeep,
 
  Updated - Reposting.

I understand your time=
 constraints and everybody who is replying. Neither do I have time for repl=
ying to so many people around.

Patanjali Sutras, cited by me in first mail=
, have clearly stated what I am only trying to convey. Simply because it wa=
s impossible for me to directly attempt to understand this subtle differenc=
e, the writings of Sri Yukteswar helped bring the focus light on it. Only t=
he Sage like Patanjali could have put the subtle classification in place, b=
y the exact term.

Chitta and not Ahamkara causes Yoga
Manas and not Ahamka=
ra is involved with Vairagya
Asmita and not Ahamkara causes Jnana (Sasmita =
samadhi)

Ahamkara is not real, it is only a term, not a Causati=
ve-principle on the same grounds as Manas, Chitta and Asmita! A term that i=
s only a representative state of existence, which has been separated from t=
he true state of existence.

Upanishads have not used Ahamkara as a centeri=
ng principle for the three bodies, but only as a representative of unnatura=
l state of existence. It doesn't exist after the Self is realized because i=
t is replaced by a constant focus on Souls' I-ness.

If there were any real=
ity to Ahamkara, it wouldn't cease to exist!

  However, these three center=
s (Causal-body ideas) exist even after
self-realization, in the three bodie=
s, till the Sage leaves all the three jars - and create no further binding =
Karma.

  NOTE - I do not know the subtle details i.e. if Causal body gets =
destroyed, how does the Sage operate with just physical and astral bodies a=
nd Chitta expanded in Causal Cosmos. So, am keeping it simple for now.

Now=
, they are in the states of Yoga, Vairagya and Jnana respectively. Thus, ev=
en the Brahman realized beings take birth as Avataras, without Ahamkara, bu=
t with the essential required centering principles of Asmita, Manas and Chi=
tta (all fixed on brahman).

While for an unenlightened person, these three=
 states don't exist, and the same centers become afflicted with a non-entit=
y called Ahamkara (like darkness is a non-entity, it is not there but still=
 it exists till you switch-on the light).

This is all my understanding and=
 opinion as interpreted and understood from the sources I have mentioned.

=
What is so difficult in this that one cannot understand ?
Apart from the te=
rminology, that caused the problem - the truth of the matter is that - if a=
 person doesn't want to understand something, nobody can make him understan=
d.

Regards,
Nitish

ntially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are no=

yaani or jnaani is a wise and learned person, who may or may not debate (or=
 even engage) with others. One may become a gyaani using either gyaana yoga=
 or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raaja yoga.

Gyaana/jnaana yoga is a path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual a=
nalysis. One pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may o=
r may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within ones=
elf. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and withou=
t a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is awa=
re of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is p=
erishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the pro=
cess of elimination, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure=
 gyaana yoga is very difficult to follow in this age.
