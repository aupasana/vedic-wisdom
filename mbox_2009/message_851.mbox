Namaste Dheeraj,
         You can use as much quantity of offerings as you =
want, as long
as the offerings are properly consumed in the fire. It all bo=
ils down to
the amount of fire that is present in the homa kunda. If there =
is good
amount of fire, even if you do not offer ghee, offering marmara , h=
avan
samagri etc will be easily consumed. But if the fire is small, then yo=
u
do need to offer ghee drops to keep the fire alive.
         There were d=
ays when I used about  8-10 coconut halves for 1
chandi homam, ie started w=
ith 2 pieces of 1 coconut half, adding half
piece of  coconut half for each=
 chapter and finally a piece for
purnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chan=
di homa with about 2-3 coconut
halves. Others out there might be able to do=
 with much less.  It also
depends on the coconut pieces itself, some pieces=
 burn slow and some
fast, so the quantity you may need may vary.
         M=
ost importantly I  suggest you follow an important advice of
Narasimhaji. P=
ouring ghee drops around the corners of the coconut piece,
making sure the =
piece catches fire from all the corners. Doing this way,
at the end of the =
homa, all the coconut pieces are completely burnt,
almost like powder.
    =
    So, my suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings  at your
dispos=
al, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does not matter). 
Make sure =
the offerings that you put with each swaha (sloka) catch fire.
Hold your of=
ferings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc joining your
ring finger, middl=
e finger and thumb. This way, you will be offering
decent amount with each =
swaha.
        Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, blac=
k and
white sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and used the
comb=
ination as offering.
        I am sure within first few days of your homa, =
you will have very
good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you need =
to make.

All the Best.
