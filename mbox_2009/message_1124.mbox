Namaskaara=A0 Ravi,
Very moving words -straight from the heart-the ant and =
the Everest analogy.
Such humility is to be imbibed by all of us without sl=
ipping into the mundane matters related to Masterji.
I think your message s=
ymbolically represents my feelings (and 'am sure many many fellow boarders,=
too)towards Resp.Narasimhaji.
BTW-there is no tremor felt and the shoot was=
 really good. Abhinandana for the same.

            Namaste



The vid=

It was a pl=
easure watching it and I feel that I will watch it a few 

more times.



M=

japa=

the lustre=
 etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I have seen 

one picture of =
him may be from many years ago and now the video. 

There is a striking dif=

The transformation internally may be more inten=

On a different note, I have heard from a very realize=

The Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is r=

for them, it is not advisible for people like us married or singl=

I have seen in Acharya Rajn=

The color si=

What the the views of the people here?
