Namaskaram Narasimha ji,
I had a query in general about homam. Kindly answe=
r them for me.

1) Can I perform mutiple homams in the same homam kund one =
after the other ?  I mean once lets say Ganapathi homam is done and after t=
he completion can I perform Sani Homam in the same fire by following the st=
eps from the beginning.

2) If yes are there any separate procedure to be d=
one before switching from one homam to another?

3) For Sani homam I know y=
ou have mentioned white snd black sesame seeds . But is there any other spe=
cial items that can be offered in the homam spdecially for Sani.

4) For po=
ornahuti are there any additional special materials that can be used. 
Than=
ks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
