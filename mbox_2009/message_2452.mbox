Namaste,

    First of all many thanks to Narasimha & Manish for the detail=
ed Homam manuals .
     These are some basic questions, I have been having.=

      1. In the Initial part of Ganapathy Homam Manuals, The direction of =
movement of ladle with ghee while pouring & saying 'Swaha' is mentioned, bu=
t rest of the places there is no direction mentioned.
     Is there any gen=
eric rule when there is no directions mentioned?
   2. On the 'Kalash Suddh=
i' when you keep in for a week, before changing the water, do we need to do=
 the 'Kalash Suddhi' procedure everytime to the same water?
     Also in so=
me other homams i had happen to see there is a kalash with saffron,clove et=
c installed and a coconut kept above the same. But the water is never taken=
 in this case!!
    Any idea on the difference?
   3. In the 'pranayamam' t=
owards the end, I am assuming that there is no need to keep
      'akshata'=
 in the left hand as in the first time. Is this right? 
   4. Are there any=
 days during which you should not do Homam? eg  Passing away of  relations =
etc, especially when you only have heard of them and not known them.

Thank=
s & Regards,
Shashi
