Dear Sir, you are absolutely right in this statement. I fully agree with yo=
u. The vision and experience of every astrologer will be different. Those w=
ho are blessed can only guide properly.

Namaste,

I'll add one point.

Even if you get a highly co=
mpetent astrologer to give you a muhurta, it is
possible for that astrologe=
r to overlook a factor and give you a bad
muhurta. Our knowledge is quite f=
allible. Moreover, a muhurta considered
good by one astrologer may be consi=
dered bad by another. There is no
uniformity in the available knowledge. An=
d you cannot say that knowledge of
one person is correct and that of anothe=
r is wrong. Everybody has some
correct knowledge and some incorrect knowled=
ge.

Nevertheless, when you have a chance, you can follow the words of
astr=
ologer(s) you trust. But, when it is not possible or when you have 
already=

done something, do not worry about it at all.

In general, a full Moon day=
 is auspicious for sadhana. In any case, good
luck!

Best regards,
Narasimh=
