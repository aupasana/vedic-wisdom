Namaste,

Great questions!

It is possible to ask humbly also. But, if you are not comfortable, it may 
be difficult to ask.

> because aren't priests after-all, micro-Gods...

That is the theory. That used to be true in practice too...

If any person does a good amount of sadhana and makes spiritual progress, 
the divine forces are stronger and active in that person.

Remember one thing. An elevated soul with no ego would care little about 
others pointing out his mistakes. You have nothing to fear when you point 
out a mistake to such a person. An egoistic person without much spiritual 
progress will be offended, but again you have nothing fear with such a 
person. It is somebody who made some progress and yet has a strong ego, that 
you have to fear! Such a person has accumulated some shakti, but keeps 
wasting it now and then due to ego. You don't want to be the target of such 
a wasting exercise.

Thus, your attitude of not questioning is pragmatic.

> 1. one has to accept this is one's karma for getting a 'wrong' mantra?

Getting a wrong mantra may be the fruit of one's previous karma. But one can 
use one's free will to get out of this situation. You are, after all, not 
forced to do the wrong mantra.

If the purohit is pure and pious and has some shakti, yes, it is the best to 
just do it. Even if that is not the case, if you *firmly believe* that to be 
the case and do it, it will still do good to you. However, in this age, such 
blind faith in somebody is very difficult. But, if you have such blind 
faith, nothing like it.

In fact, a sishya seeing guru as Shiva (or Krishna) with the full force of 
mind and a firm unshakable belief will make much progress and his faith may 
even end up making his guru as Shiva!

> 3. or should one trust one's own judgement and auto-correct the mantra 
> without informing the purohit about it?

If you do not have 100% blind faith in the purity and piety of the purohit, 
the best course of action is to use your own judgment and correct it based 
on available literature.

Best regards,
Narasimha
