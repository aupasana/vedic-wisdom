Namaste Rajarashi,

Narasimha is contemporary to us and a professional with=
 family life. Involved in many Astrlogical clashes. that is why it is quite=
 possible that some or many may not understand his spiritual greatness. one=
 thing i can say with 100% confidence that he is no ordinary soul and i am =
really really blessed to be his shishya! it was a punyodaya in my life when=
 i was inspired to accept him as my guru on a Janmaashtami day. i hope i li=
ve up to his expectations and stature. as you rightly said, his writings wi=
ll inspire the spiritualist of coming generations and i add astrlogers as w=
ell.

Durgaashtami has already started and lets perform a heartmelting Chan=
di Homam !!!

Best Regards,

Utpal
