Dear Utpalji,
=A0
That mail of Narasimha, whos link you posted in your mail=
, is simple awesome. The energy of the writing is such that one=A0is left s=
peechless and amazed and filled with a deep sense of reverential humity for=
 that great source of=A0 limitless compassion=A0and bliss we call God. A sa=
dguru is indeed God's representative on earth, IMO.
=A0
Someday this mail a=
nd the other mails of Narasimha will become guiding posts for thousands and=
 thousands of=A0genuine spiritual aspirants across ages, across generatoins=
, across countries. Indeed, this is the stuff of legends!
=A0
I feel blesse=
d to be a member of this yahoo group.

Namaste Vijay,

I am sure that you have had read a lot and=
 quite a knowledgeable person you are. ignorng that, i am mentioing somethn=
g which i've heared and cherished.

for Guru's importance, following is the=
 very apt explanation which i think was given in Vivekachudamani by great A=
di Shankarachaarya.

"Guru is the TIGER IN THE DREAM who awakens you from t=
he WORLD OF DREAMS" - Guru and the world both are unreal once one is awaken=
ed.

Thakur used to repeat " Satchidananda is The Sadguru". It is my belief=
 that even if no formal Guru is there in the Life of a MUMUKSHU, Brahman is=
 always there for him as Guru hence to put it anotherway, NO sincere seeker=
 is WITHOUT GURU.

by the way following is the chain of message in VA list =
which triggered an event where Satchidanda became a Tangible guru for me.

=
http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 382 

The above prob=
ably relevent to your first two questions.

i again give a quote form VC wh=
ere in Shankara again suggest a beautiful idea.

"We all are God who have f=
orgotten that reality".

for your third query, i wish to ask a counter ques=
tion? Why we create dreams while sleeping and then play happy, sad and frig=
htened?

***
Again, i've no realisation myself. it si probably all partiall=
y cooked or uncooked knowedge which is reproduced, which was liked by intel=
ligence.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
