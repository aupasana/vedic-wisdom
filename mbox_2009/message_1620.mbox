y, for most of us, we would either not be performing any of the homams or a=
t best performing or participating in it once in a year. So, our next step =
should be practical and enable us to cultivate the niyama of performing it =
everyday without any obstacles. Keeping this in mind, I myself started perf=
orming Mahaganapathi Homam everyday. Doing homam for all gods can be cumber=
some and more importantly to introduce the concept of niyama, which include=
s sticking to one god. So, options a & b are ruled out. I suggest c.

   I totally agree wit=

h, puja, etc. just like doing without concentrateing our will i think this =
is useless, keeping our heart clear i mean without any other thoughts, and =
concentrating on God svarupa in  our thought or in our mind, just in very s=
hort time we get the blessings of that God, its personal exeriance.

Last but not least, I would like to thanks PVR.N.Rao ji for his infinite co=
