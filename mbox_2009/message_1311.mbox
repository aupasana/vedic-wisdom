Dear Arunisha,

>which said "your priority is
>not me...but burning off tha=
t piece of wood?". 

This is a note worthy point you made. See, Narasimha h=
as cautioned 
members about the un-burnt material offered as Aahuti. I am s=
ure 
people doing Homam will be cautious about that and it is equally 
poss=
ible that many will be *Over cautious* about that. The danger 
here is that=
 the attention is diverted to un-burnt Aahuti and NOT to 
the invoked deity=
 and what motive behind that is our SELFISHNESS. 
Because we are scared of =
facing any unpleasant fruits of our 
surfaced karma, we even forget the lor=
d for who we are doing the 
whole ritual. Major part of my Aahuti is White =
Til, and i see some 
of them burst during burning and come out of Homa Kund=
am. Initially 
i was little distracted worrying about the Un-burnt Aahuti i=
ssue but 
i stopped worrying about that after a couple of Homa. However it =
is 
important that one learn quickly to optimize the *type* & *quantity* 
o=
f Aahuti offered depending upon the capacity of Agni. This is not 
difficul=
t and within a couple of Homa, one can easily adjust to it 
and then distra=
ction is removed. 

By the way, please note my experience, whenever i have =
started 
reciting Chandi Paath and Now Homam, My relation with some of the =

close colleagues are becoming tensed for no fault of mine 
(Honestly). My =
only fault was that earlier i happily accepted their 
misbehavior and pampe=
red their ego in effort to reduce my `I' ness.  
Now i have decided not fee=
d their ego and selfishness and changed to 
little bit offensive mode.

I w=
onder (though it is very painful) if this is mother's way of 
removing some=
 unwanted & harmful bondage!!!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
