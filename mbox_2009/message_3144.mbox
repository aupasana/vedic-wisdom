Namaste Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
I have been doing Ganapati homam for some time =
and was looking forward to offer my homam for Chandi maa.
=C2=A0
I had a co=
uple of queries related to Chandi path - 
1. Is there any specific day whic=
h is considered auspicious to start with Chandi homam for the first time?
2=
. I found the following text in the Chandi manual "Whenever you encounter a=
n =E2=80=9Cuvaacha=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Coochuh=E2=80=9D followed by a numbe=
r, you may want to consider offering a flower or a fruit piece. For example=
, a rose petal or a raisin (kismis) may be offered. 
If you read all the 13=
 chapters adding =E2=80=9Cswaahaa=E2=80=9D at each number in the text, you =
will end up making 700 offerings."
When I tried to look into the 13 chapter=
s, I encountered less than 60 "uvaacha". I tried scanning thru the durga sa=
ptashati for "oochuh" but am unable to find the same. Maybe I am not lookin=
g at the correct verses. Can you please give me one example of a verse whic=
h has "oochuh"?
=C2=A0
Many Thanks in advance
Anup
