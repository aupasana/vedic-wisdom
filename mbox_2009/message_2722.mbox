Namaste Rajarshi,

I don't have the book at the moment but it is my impress=
ion that the chapter indicated that the souls in the suvarna lokas have ear=
lier reached the state of what we call "Kundalini rised to Sahsraar Chakra"=
.

i haven't given a correct idea in my earlier message when i wrote "...th=
e souls who depart from Sahsraar...".

So i again repeat my query - Kundali=
ni reaching and established in Sahasraar chakra is *Final Realisation - com=
plete moksha from all bonds* or still there needs to pass through some stil=
l higher realm (say for instance Suvarna loka) to workout Karan Shareer/Aan=
andamaya Kosha. 

Best Regards,

Utpal

s Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understand=
ing of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadha=
ara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leav=

at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the =
"vidhyut" of Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted with the chaos, it produced=
 some universal energies which are more commonly known as the universal dei=
