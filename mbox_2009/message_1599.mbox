Respected Sri. Narasimha,

I visited your website www.vedicastrologer.org a=
nd found the Tarpana manual. 

I would be thankful if you can please advise=
 me the difference between Brahma Yagnam (performed everyday afternoon, aft=
er Madhyahina Sandhya Vandanam) which also contains Deva Rishi Pitru Tarpan=
am and the manual given by you. 

I am from Bodhayana Sutram and found many=
 differences between the tarpana mantras. 

Thanks in advance,

Shankar
