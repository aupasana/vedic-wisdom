Rao Garu!!!

I was always thinking that it is due to South Indian Accent, p=
eople 
of that part of india say Raama instead of Raam. Krishna instead of =

Krishna.

I've a explanation for that. In devanagari script, (Take instanc=
e of 
Gita) it id written Krishn and not Krishna. another example is Durga =

Saptashati where it says "Shiv Uvvach" and not "Shiva Uvvach"

please clea=
r my doubts.

Best Regards,

Utpal

t Mangal reminds me about one question I've had 
for quite sometime. Someti=
me ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to 
any Hanuman temple and get a mant=
ra for lifting up the Mangal in my 
natal chart which suffers from rajabhan=
ga (uccha in rasi and neecha 
in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity=
 in Sri Veetirundha 
Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked t=
he priest about 
a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on t=
he walls of 
the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to=
 be a 7 
word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th ho=
use 
with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra 
teachin=
