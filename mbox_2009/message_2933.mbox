 MASTER (sharply): "That's the one hobby of you Calcutta people =96 giving
=
lectures and bringing others to the light! Nobody ever stops to consider ho=
w
to get the light himself. Who are you to teach others?

"He who is the Lo=
rd of the Universe will teach everyone. He alone teaches
us,who has created=
 this universe; who has made the sun and moon, men and
beasts, and all othe=
r beings; who has provided means for their sustenance;
who has given childr=
en parents and endowed them with love to bring them up.
The Lord has done s=
o many things =96 will He not show people the way to
worship Him? If they n=
eed teaching, then He will be the Teacher. He is our
Inner Guide.

"Suppose=
 there is an error in worshipping the clay image; doesn't God know
that thr=
ough it He alone is being invoked? He will he pleased with that very
worshi=
p. Why should you get a headache over it? You had better try for
knowledge =
and devotion yourself."

This time M. felt that his ego was completely crus=
hed. He now said to
himself: "Yes, he has spoken the truth. What need is th=
ere for me to teach
others? Have I known God? Do I really love Him? 'I have=
n't room enough for
myself in my bed, and I am inviting my friend to share =
it with me!' I know
nothing about God, yet I am trying to teach others. Wha=
t a shame! How
foolish I am! This is not mathematics or history or literatu=
re, that one can
teach it to others. No, this is the deep mystery of God. W=
hat he says
appeals to me."

This was M.'s first argument with the Master, =
and happily his last.

MASTER: "You were talking of worshipping the clay im=
age. Even if the image
is made of clay, there is need for that sort of wors=
hip. God Himself has
provided different forms of worship. He who is the Lor=
d of the Universe has
arranged all these forms to suit different men in dif=
ferent stages of
knowledge.

"The mother cooks different dishes to suit the=
 stomachs of her different
children. Suppose she has five children. If ther=
e is a fish to cook, she
prepares various dishes from it =96 pilau, pickled=
 fish, fried fish, and so on
=96 to suit their different tastes and powers =
of digestion.
