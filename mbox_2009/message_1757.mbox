Shri KK ji,
Namaskar.
True, the article reiterates and in fact 'seems' to b=
e a compiling of various messages of Narasimha garu. Though they are very=
=A0 elaborate and easily understood through his various analogies and examp=
les.
I cannot express enough gratitude for his relentless help to flounderi=
ng people like me.

Kind regards,

Nalini
=A0

Namaskaram Nalini Garu,

I'm glad you liked the artic=
le. 

Infact most of the points mentioned in the article were already said =
by Sri Narasimha Garu in his various mails in this forum. It was like a ref=
resher to go through all of them at one place via this article.

Thanks and=
 Best Regards
KK
