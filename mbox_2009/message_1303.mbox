One thing =
i have noted in chanting. When i chant loudly (CP or Any 
Mantra or 108Name=
s of Mahalakshmi) and then switch to only mental 
mode it gives a good expe=
rience of peacefulness. I have noticed that 
it helps chanting Loudly for s=
ome time and then chanting mentally 
for a brief period.

warm regards,

Ut=
pal
