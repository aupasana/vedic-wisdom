Namaste Nitish,
 
I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example,=
 ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, bu=
t extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in t=
he causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chit=
ta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are part=
s of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.
 
Ahamkaara=
/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observ=
es sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes curren=
t and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind)=
 stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, t=
hey are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates t=
hrough all layers of one's individualized consciousness.
 
Upanishads and v=
arious scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into va=
rious groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praan=
as, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven cha=
kras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of the entire individu=
alized consciousness.
 
Though the word jnaana means different things to di=
fferent people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and=
 discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies an=
d koshas are merged in cosmos.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ur understanding. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptures or sc=
holarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is =
a state of being,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the universe. I=
t is achieved through sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discriminatio=
n between real and not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that whatever is =
finally left is nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the marga c=
alled Gyan. But sadhana it is without a doubt.

 the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say=
, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. But I feel, he en=

He was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was=
 a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness.

t is not relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that G=
od is not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be perc=
eived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your c=
urrent knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing yo=
