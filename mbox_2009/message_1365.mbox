Dear Sir,
After reading this mail on Bhartuhari, I would like to write one =
experience narrated by an old man to me before 20 years. This happened whil=
e his Parikrama of River Narmada. While walking at night near Narmada river=
 he met with one tall man of 10 feet height with long hair. He introduced h=
imself as Ashwasthama and he talked with that learned gentleman who was pio=
us by heart. They both talked in Sanskrit only.=A0 Ashwasthama first told h=
im that I am Ashwasthama of Mahabharat. I am suffering=A0constant pain=A0fr=
om my forehead Scar which is never to be cured as Lord Krishna has cursed m=
e. Please give me some curd or butter. (Dehi me kinchit Dadhi va Navanitam)=
. 
This is a fact and not immaginory story as the person who told me his ex=
perience was 70 years old at that time and he was a noble and purehearted p=
erson
Dr. Rawal

Namaskaaram Utpalji,
A real gem from you-how mu=

Suppose I have memorized this-how much to remember.
I a=

Yo=
u are absolutely right in pointing out what I have mistakenly stated "Niti =
Shataka"-It should have been VAIRAGYA SHATAKA...My sincere apology for the =
unintended misinformation.
Strange-i have wanted to write V.Shataka and wro=
te his being ascetic/renouncing the 'Samsaara',etc.
A small clarification- =
I have not meant to say Raaja Bhartruhari is the Chranjiva like Bhagwan Par=
ashuraama or Sri Sri Ashwathaamaa- I have mentioned that many believe that =
R.B.still roams in India and grants Darshana to the deserving.

Again thank=
s for that poser on memory,
Humble regards,
amit

Namask=
aaram Amit Bhai,

Our own resourceful Mitesh has provided good information =
of Ujjain 
and Shree Maa and other places where Yagyas are performed.

"Ujj=
ainiya Mahaakaalm.. ." ! My Parents visited Mahaakaal last year. 
it is als=
o said that, the main attraction of Mahaakaal is to attend 
their early mro=
ning Bhasma Aarati. and people told me that it is a 
custom to bring the as=
hes of last cremated body from the nearby 
smashaan for the Bhasma Abhiskek=
.. by the way it is well known that 
Amitabh Bachhan has a turn around in h=
is career after rirual 
performed at Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing
 happened an=
d came out from 
debt etc..
Ujjain was once the capital of great king Vikra=
maaditya. Gujarati 
calander year, which is Vikram Samvat is also named aft=
er him. so 
gujaraatis have connection to Ujjain:)

I am not sure but is Ra=
ja Bhartuhari considered as one of the 
Chiranjivis? and was under the impr=
ession that the name of his 
treaty was Vairaagya Shataka.

but not much im=
portant. how much information we'll store in this 
memory and what we will =
do with that.

warm regards,

utpal
