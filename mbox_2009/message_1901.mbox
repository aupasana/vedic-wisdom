Dear Narsimha-ji,
As odd as it might sound, but our family deity (kula-deva=
ta) happens to be Lord Bhairav - and we do not know (or the elders in the f=
amily have forgotten over the years) of any specific puja/aradhana that is =
done for HIM. 

After reading the manuals you have for so many Gods and God=
desses, I am tempted to ask if a homam for Bhairav would be appropriate and=
 if yes, what would be the mantra/procedure for doing the same. 

I was onc=
e told by someone that Bhairav is usually worshipped by Tantriks and that i=
t was odd for a business family to have HIM as their kula-devata. But I bel=
ieve this to be a super-ficial explanation. If you are able to give us any =
insight you might be having on this too - it would be much much appreciated=
. I was awed with your insight/explanation on Dakkhineswara Kali etc. 

Kin=
d regards
Sharad
