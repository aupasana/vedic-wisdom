Namaste, 
=A0
Scriptures and other great people who have understood the ess=
ence of these scriptures say that God is everywhere. Since human brain cann=
ot assimilate the concept of infinity, sages have tried to decipher Truth b=
y saying that avataras, prophets etc are but manifestations/personification=
s of the same Truth.
=A0
Depending on the propensities of the human beings,=
 they have "followed" different prophets and avataras=A0and assimilated the=
ir teachings in=A0their way of life, hoping that they would reach the Truth=
 through them. 
=A0
If this understanding is right, my question is:
=A0
a) =
Why did God come on earth in different forms(Mohammad, Jesus, Vishnu etc)? =
Did=A0God not anticipate the problems=A0of having different faiths? Or is i=
t that He/She/IT wants us to go through these problem and overcome our weak=
ness to realize Self/God? 
=A0
I am unable to understand this cycle :
=A0
G=
od Creates human beings -> Human beings destroy themselves due to their wea=
kness -> God incarnates=A0as Krishna to=A0save dharma -> Followers of Krish=
na come to existence -> Again humans destroy eachother -> This time God inc=
arnates as Jesus -> Followers of Jesus come to existence -> Now Jesus follo=
wers and Krishna followers fight with eachother -> Now God is supposed to c=
ome as Kalki to save the followers of Krishna/Jesus
=A0
Isn't God creating =
confusion in already confused/weak minds of humans?

Thanks & Regards,
--Mu=
rahari
