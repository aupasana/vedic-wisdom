Namaste,
 
Yes, chanting in the mind is the best. But, even when chanting i=
n the mind, one can pronounce it correctly or incorrectly. I was only point=
ing out some common mistakes even learned people make and secondly I was sa=
ying that correct pronunciation is only one part of making the mantra perfe=
ct.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimhaji,


        I am confused =
after reading your post. Can we not just chant the mantra in mind? Will the=
se rules still be applicable in that case? Will not chanting the mantra usi=
ng mouth reduce its effectiveness?


        Thank you,

          Namaste,

          I cannot point to =
any audio that I found satisfactory.

          Please buy the book "Mantra=
pushpam" by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri 
          mantra with inton=
ation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too..

          I w=
ill point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:

          (=
1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines 
  =
        below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a=
 row. For 
          example, all the three letters in "dheemahi" are witho=
ut any lines below or 
          above. They have to be pronounced in the s=
ame pitch. People end up 
          introducing some pitch variation and mi=
spronouncing them. In veda mantras, 
          pronouncing all udattas in t=
he same pitch is the most important thing. Do 
          not stress any let=
ter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string of 
          udatt=
as.

          (2) The last syllable of "prachodayaat" is "yaat". It is sup=
posed to be one 
          syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, "t" i=
s hardly audible. If you 
          artificially add an vowel at the end of=
 it and make it "prachodayaatu" , you 
          will end up introducing an=
 extra syllable ("tu") and mess up everything. A 
          lot of people d=
o not pronounce "t" correctly. Probably some guru sometime 
          back =
started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words ending 
  =
        in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what conso=
nant he 
          was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice=
. This is good for 
          teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word en=
ds in a consonant, end it with 
          a consonant (which cannot be hear=
d clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT 
          add a brief vowel af=
ter that consonant.

          (3) Take "dhiyo yo naH". The "H" in "naH" is=
 a visarga (written in Sanskrit 
          as ":" and notated in itrans as =
"H"). Visarga means "letting go". You are 
          supposed to let air go=
 from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation 
          of "naH" is=
 very close to "nah" though slightly different. Again, this is 
          s=
upposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make=
 
          it "naha". Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha)=
 is added to 
          the mantra and that messes up everything. Again thi=
s is wrong.

          In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same sy=
mbol "H" is pronounced 
          differently in "raamaH", "hariH" and "gur=
uH". The same symbol
          "H" or ":" is pronounced as "ha", "hi" and "=
hu" in the 3 words, respectively 
          (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu).=
 That is wrong. If you pronounce it as 
          letting air go, without a=
dding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 
          words.

          =
Watch out for these 3 common mistakes.

          However, as I keep saying=
, the pronunciation is only a small percentage of 
          it. Creating t=
he right mental images and the perfect mental focus is more 
          impo=
rtant. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut down all 
    =
      other thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on any =
veda 
          mantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic e=
xperience. Please 
          note that correct pronunciation is not difficu=
lt to achieve, but the other 
          things I mentioned here are not tha=
t easy!

          <BR>below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas c=
ome in 
          a row. For <BR>example, all the three letters in "dheemah=
i" are 
          without any lines below or <BR>above. They have to be pro=
nounced in 
          the same pitch. People end up <BR>introducing some pi=
tch variation and 
          mispronouncing them. In veda mantras, <BR>pron=
ouncing all udattas in 
          the same pitch is the most important thin=
g. Do <BR>not stress any 
          letter or take the pitch up/down when p=
ronouncing a string of 
          <BR>udattas.<BR><BR>(2) The last syllable=
 of "prachodayaat" is "yaat". 
          It is supposed to be one <BR>sylla=
ble. When you pronounce it 
          correctly, "t" is hardly audible. If =
you <BR>artificially add an vowel 
          at the end of it and make it "=
prachodayaatu" , you <BR>will end up 
          introducing an extra syllab=
le ("tu") and mess up everything. A <BR>lot 
          of people do not pro=
nounce "t" correctly. Probably some guru sometime 
          <BR>back start=
ed the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of 
          words endi=
ng <BR>in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen 
          clearly =
what consonant he <BR>was saying. Unfortunately, it became a 
          sta=
ndard practice. This is good for <BR>teaching, but wrong for 
          sad=
hana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it with <BR>a consonant 
         =
 (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT 
        =
  <BR>add a brief vowel after that consonant.<BR><BR>(3) Take "dhiyo yo 
  =
        naH". The "H" in "naH" is a visarga (written in Sanskrit <BR>as ":"=
 
          and notated in itrans as "H"). Visarga means "letting go". You =
are 
          <BR>supposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalat=
ion. 
          Pronunciation <BR>of "naH" is very close to "nah" though sl=
ightly 
          different. Again, this is <BR>supposed to be one syllable=
. A lot of 
          people, especially south Indians, make <BR>it "naha".=
 Due to extra 
          vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added t=
o <BR>the mantra and 
          that messes up everything. Again this is wr=
ong.<BR><BR>In this style 
          of mispronouncing visarga, the same sy=
mbol "H" is pronounced 
          <BR>differently in "raamaH", "hariH" and =
"guruH". The same 
          symbol<BR>"H" or ":" is pronounced as "ha", "h=
i" and "hu" in the 3 
          words, respectively <BR>(i.e. raamaha, hari=
hi, guruhu). That is wrong. 
          If you pronounce it as <BR>letting a=
ir go, without adding any vowel, 
          it sounds identical in the 3 <B=
R>words.<BR><BR>Watch out for these 3 
          common mistakes.<BR><BR>Ho=
wever, as I keep saying, the pronunciation 
          is only a small perce=
ntage of <BR>it. Creating the right mental images 
          and the perfec=
