 29th October, 1947

This afternoon at 2-30, Bhagavan was reading a Malayal=
am book and was
speaking to a devotee seated near him. The devotee was aski=
ng, =93Did Bhagavan
learn to read Malayalam in his younger days?=94

=93No,=
=94 Bhagavan replied, =93while I was staying in Gurumurtham, Palaniswami
us=
ed to be with me. He had a copy of the Adhyatma Ramayanam and was often
rea=
ding it aloud. Every Malayali who knows how to read, invariably reads
that =
book.

=93Hence, even though he did not know how to read well,he somehow ma=
naged to
read it, albeit with many mistakes.

I was at the time observing s=
ilence, and so I used merely to listen. After
we shifted to the palmyra gro=
ve, I took the book and found it to be in
Malayalam script. Having already =
learnt that script, I easily learned to
read and write.=94

=93When did you=
 learn Telugu?=94 asked someone.

=93When I was in the Virupaksha Cave,=94 =
said Bhagavan,

=93Gambhiram Seshayya and others asked me to write some sta=
nzas in Telugu and
so I transcribed letter by letter from Sanskrit into Tel=
ugu script and
practised them. Thus I slowly learnt Telugu in the year 1900=
.=94

I asked him when he had learnt the Nagari script.=93That must also ha=
ve been
about the same time,=94 said Bhagavan. =93Muthurama Dikshitar and o=
thers used to
come frequently, as they had books in Nagari script, I used t=
o copy the
letters and in that way got used to them.=94 Someone said, =93We=
 had heard that
you learnt Telugu only after Nayana came to you.=94

=93No,=
=94 said Bhagavan, =93I learnt it much earlier, but I got used to speaking
=
it freely only after he came, that=92s all.=94 =93We had heard,=94 said ano=
ther,
=93that you learnt Telugu in your boyhood days.=94

=93I did not know=
 how to write or read Telugu at that time,=94 said Bhagavan.
=93My grandfat=
her=92s younger brother knew Telugu; he used to keep me by his
side on the =
cot and teach me Telugu alphabet. That was all. I learnt Telugu
only while =
writing the stanzas. Subsequently, when I wrote =91Upadesa Saram=92,
Yogi R=
amiah wanted it in Telugu, so I wrote it in couplets (dvipada),
closely fol=
lowing the Tamil metre.

I then showed it to Nayana who said that it was no=
t a correct Telugu couplet
and he taught me the metres (ganas) of the Telug=
u verses.

I wrote them down in Tamil script and then made the required alt=
erations.
When I showed it to Nayana,he said it was correct and could be gi=
ven to the
printers.

Later,when Balarama Reddy got me a copy of the Sulaks=
hana Saram,I learnt the
metres of the other verses, copied them on two page=
s of paper and pasted
them in our copy of the Telugu primer.

That has been=
 sufficient for my purposes. Now, if anyone reads a verse, I
can easily fin=
d out in what metre it is and what mistakes, if any, there
are. I learnt on=
e language after another in the same way. I did not
purposely learn any lan=
guage,=94 said Bhagavan.
