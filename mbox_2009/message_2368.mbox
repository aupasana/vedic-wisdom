Dear Krishna Kanth,
=A0
Super-short tarpana is g=
ood enough.
=A0
Though traditionally homam is done after japam and tarpana,=
 I strongly recommend making homam the first activity and then doing japam =
and tarpana. That is more appropriate for the times we live in.
=A0
People =
of old times had brightly burning bhootaagni inside. Their performance of a=
 daily fire ritual was just a responsibility towards the universe. They wer=
e doing fire ritual for maintaining dharma in the universe and not necessar=
ily for saving their own bhootaagni from being extinguished.
=A0
Most peopl=
e today - even those who are re-incarnations of very good yogis=A0from the =
last life - are initially lacking in internal purity and their bhootaagni i=
s very very very weak and actually pretty much extinguished in most people.=
 The times are such, the culture is such, our lifestyles are such, the infl=
uences on our minds are such and the energy filling the air we breath is su=
ch. Thus, one's reason for doing a homam is different from the old times. W=
hen one does a fire ritual,=A0one does one's dharma towards the universe an=
d, at the same time, improves one's own internal bhootaagni a little bit.
=
=A0
For doing any spiritual activity - japam or tarpana or just reading a s=
cripture or contemplation - strong bhootaagni is very important for interna=
lizing and digesting the experience spiritually. If a person with a very we=
ak or extinguished bhootaagni does such spiritual activities, the impact is=
 negligible. As a person's bhootaagni is maximized immediately following a =
ritual with an external fire, it helps one do a better job with other spiri=
tual activities.
=A0
Thus, my recommendation is the same as Narayan's. Do h=
omam, meditate as the poornaahuti burns and then do tarpana. In fact, if yo=
u are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, you can even integrate it with ho=
mam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas while sitting in front of the fire,=
 after the uttaraangam and before the poornaahuti, and then go on to offer =
poornaahuti. However, if you also want to include pitris (deceased ancestor=
s) along with devas and rishis, I suggest doing it separately after the hom=
am.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I want to narra=
te an incident related to tarpana manuals.
=A0
Manish thinks very highly of=
 tarpana and asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of h=
omam, I studied and practiced several approaches and experienced some thing=
s internally and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals we=
re created. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding wa=
s limited when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish's blessings, I ha=
d some doubts=A0on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enou=
gh or not. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Cha=
ndi homam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/ Durga ido=
l I use for homam, "O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, bu=
t my experience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and di=
stribute tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manua=
ls in future. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please giv=
e me some signal today as I perform the
 procedure. I will understand. I wi=
ll publish them only if you give your approval."
=A0
Then I sat down to per=
form tarpanas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, there=
 was such a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of the=
 wind was really loud. I started deva tarpana and said "brahmaa tripyataam"=
 and left water. Then I took water into my palm again and said "vishnuh tri=
pyataam". As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds from o=
utside. When I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heavy r=
ain with really big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previous=
 10 days and there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It wa=
s very sunny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as tar=
pana started and the rain continued till the end of the day.
=A0
I took the=
 wind and the rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanked her at t=
he end=A0and went ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed the ritual m=
ore times later, I slowly understood the real meaning and purpose of tarpan=
a. For many people with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas to deceased =
ancestors with mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very useful ritual. I n=
ow fully understand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter, emphasized =
performing both homam and tarpana and how they supplement each other. I am =
glad that more people are considering performing a quick homam and a quick =
tarpana on a regular basis. Even a combination of=A0a 30-minute homam and a=
 5-minute tarpana performed daily will go a long way in freeing one.
=A0
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha
