Dear Narasimha,

you mentioned in one of the messages:

>When a being like =
Krishna is 
> born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of =
the >dual world. When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas,

You=
 recently wrote refering to Ramakrishna:

>If this is how the Leela of an i=
ncarnation is, imagine how the 
>leela of apoorna purusha like Lord Krishna=
 must have been!

I am curious to know as to how you have come to conclusio=
n on Sain Baba's case that he accquired 2/3 Kalas?
Do you have knowledge of=
 the power of Thakur in terms of Kalas and also in case of Lord Sri Rama?

=
Pranaams!

Utpal
