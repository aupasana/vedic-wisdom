Namaste

I think there the 10 main Avatars, plus many secondary Avatars =
of various deities including Vishnu.
=A0
The ten main avatars have the purp=
ose of giving a boost to human spiritual evolution. That is why they are Vi=
shnu Avatars - Vishnu being the one who sustains.

The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

I am not=
 an authoirty on this subject, but dwelling on to the topic nevertheless.

=
Puranas do talk about avataras of Shiva as well. How ever, they may be less=
 popular among vaishnavaites.

Hanuman is an avatara of Shiva. I also heard=
 about few other stories where Shivji took human birth to marry Parvathi wh=
o is born as a girl on earth (Kamakshi?).

How ever, I am not very familiar=
 with Shiva's avataras (excluding Hanuman) that kills a rakshasa. Shiva kil=
led many demons himself but mostly as Shiva himself and with out going thro=
ugh an avatara.

This perhaps is because Shiva being a maha yogi does not n=
eed to obey and go through Maya to show his Leela. Vishnu on the otherhand =
went through Maya and showedf his leela.

Best regards,
Vijay
