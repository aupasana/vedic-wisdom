Namaste,
=C2=A0
Vishnu is =
the maintainer of dharma and sustainer of 
the worlds. He maintains natural=
 order in creation. One may start chanting his 
names without understanding=
 the meanings. After chanting those names for a few 
months or years, one w=
ill wonder about the meanings and learn the meanings of 
those 1000 names. =
Then, as one chants, one's mind forms auspicious images based 
on those nam=
es. Frequent occurrence of those images and thoughts in the mind 
purifies =
the mind and strengthens certain tendencies of the mind and weakens 
others=
.
=C2=A0
Vishnu sahasra naam is a very saattwik prayer that 
promotes dharm=
a and sattwa in the person.
=C2=A0
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

          Honestly speaking, I=

          thinks a fool like me can certify =
or endorse or comment on the "worth" 
          of Vishnu sahasra naam, whi=

        Mantras like Vishnu sahasra naam (1000 names of Lord

          Ga=

          However, that is not to say that eve=
ryone meditating 
          with them will make fast spiritual progress. To=
 explain this, let me 
          return to a previous analogy, as I believe=
 that analogies help one 
          understand concepts better.
          =
=C2=A0
          Mantras are for protecting mind (from its enemies, 
      =
    i.e. one's weaknesses like ego, pride, attachment, lust, anger etc). 
 =
         Imagine one's mind to be a person. Imagine one's weaknesses to be =

          enemies charging at the person aggressively. Imagine mantra to b=
e a 
          weapon (stick or stone or gun) in the hands of the 
person.
=
          =C2=A0
          One may have a nice stick that was used by thous=
and 
          people before him to beat up strong enemies. Yet, he may not=
 know how 
          to use it and the weapon may become ineffective in his=
 hands. If one 
          taps an aggressive enemy gently with a stick, tha=
t will hardly be 
          effective. One has to beat hard and with all th=
e energy one can 
          muster. Similarly, one's will power should be s=
trongly focused on 
          overcoming ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy=
=C2=A0etc and one should 
          make conscious and forceful effort.
   =
       =C2=A0
          If one with some experience in beating up enemies 
=
          with sticks tries to throw stones at them, he may not know how to=
 aim 
          and may fail. Similarly, one with experience in chanting ot=
her mantras 
          tries beejaksharas, one may not succeed in aiming th=
em correctly and 
          making them work.
          =C2=A0
          If=
 one not knowing how to shoot a gun aims a gun 
          confidently as th=
e enemy approaches and tries in vain to shoot, one 
          will fail and=
 be beaten by enemy. Similarly, one not knowing how to 
          use power=
ful Veda mantras is overconfident, he may fail in 
          sadhana=C2=A0a=
nd succumb to ego, pride etc. If one atleast realizes 
          that one c=
annot shoot, one can atleast use the gun as a stick and try 
          to b=
eat up the enemy. Similarly, if one atleast realizes that one does 
       =
   not know how to put veda mantra to use, one can chant the veda mantra 
 =
         hundreds or thousands of times everyday with sincerity, surrender =
and 
          humility and try consciously to control negative emotions su=
ch as ego, 
          pride, lust, anger, jealosy etc.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
          =C2=A0
          Bottomline is t=
his: Just as how well a person puts a 
          weapon to use and overcome=
s enemies depends on how strong and serious 
          the person is, how m=
uch training and practice he has in using the 
          weapon, similarly =
how well a person puts a mantra to use use to 
          overcome internal =
weaknesses depends on what kind of mental 
          conditioning one has, =
how strong a desire one has for spiritual 
          progress, what kind of=
 a guru one has and how much effort one puts 
          into spiritual sadh=
ana. Thus, we cannot make a blanket statement that 
          reading Vishn=
u sahasra naam, for example, everyday will help one 
          become pure =
and get moksha.
          =C2=A0
          While one engages in various ext=
ernal practices as a 
          part of the spiritual sadhana, one should r=
emember that the internal 
          goal is to overcome ego and attain a s=
pirit of complete surrender and 
          detachment and try to cultivate =
that internal spirit. In the 
          beginning, things are difficult and=
 this is a mere thought. But, as 
          one progresses and crosses a th=
reshhold, external practices promote 
          stronger internal focus and=
 purity and stronger internal focus and 
          purity promote better an=
d more effective sessions of external 
          practice.=C2=A0A kind of=
=C2=A0synergy develops between them. 
          Eventually, one makes suffi=
cient progress internally, which is the 
          goal after all.
        =
  =C2=A0
          Whatever mantra or stotra or ritual was given to you 
  =
        by a guru that you *surrendered* to, you should follow it while
