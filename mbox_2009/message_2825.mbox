Bhagavan: Whatever work is done for the good of others is absolutely free
from fault.

He who performs good works through love, without seeking results, attains to
God. But he who works for name, fame or any other selfish purpose remains
bound. Further, I may say that you have already become Siddha (perfected).

Vidyasagar: Sir, how is that?

Bhagavan: You know that Siddha, or well-boiled potato, becomes soft and
tender. Have you not become tender-hearted by your compassion for all?

Vidyasagar: But the paste of Kalai (a kind of pulse) when boiled (Siddha)
becomes harder. Is it not so? [Book-learned Pandits like vultures.]

Bhagavan, laughing: Yes, but you are not like that.Mere book-learned Pandits
(scholars) are hard-hearted. They do good neither to themselves nor to
others. They are like vultures who soar high in the sky, but always search
after carrion-pits. They may talk about Divine truths, but their minds are
attached to woman and wealth.

Their attachment is to worldly things (Avidya). Compassion, Devotion
(Bhakti), Dispassion (Vairagya)--these are the manifestations of Vidya.

Vidyasagar was listening to the words of wisdom with whole attention, while
the eyes of other gentlemen present were fixed upon the blissful face of
Ramakrishna radiant with Divine glory. [p. 104]

The Bhagavan continued: The Absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of Vidya
(knowledge) as well as of Avidya (ignorance), which keeps one away from the
realization of the Absolute. The absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of
Maya, while Maya is either Vidya or Avidya. Vidya-Maya and Avidya-Maya both
exist in this world.

As there are knowledge (Jnana) and Devotion (Bhakti), so also there are lust
and greed for wealth. Good and evil, virtue and vice, are to be found in
this world of relativity; but Brahman is unaffected by them. They exist in
relation to Jiva (individual ego), but cannot touch the Absolute Brahman.
[p. 105]
