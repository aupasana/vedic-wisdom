Subject: Tarpana query - where should the water fall?

Dear group members, Namaste

I have a basic question about performing tarpana as per Narahimha-ji's manuals.  Apologies if it has
already been answered and I have missed it in the archives.

The question is, during the ritual, where should the water being placed into the palm be allowed to
fall?  Is it okay for it to simply fall on the floor (I am thinking in particular of the case where
one is doing it on a balcony or terrace) or should it be collected and then disposed of into the
earth later?

Kindest regards,

Samir
