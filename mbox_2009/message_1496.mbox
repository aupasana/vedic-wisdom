Even though you were not serious, this was not rea=
lly needed.
 
In fact, I have not encountered any "compulsive" critics on t=
his yahoogroup.
 
People should feel free to express their opinions and kno=
wledge without any worries. I always encourage and welcome that. I have no =
problem being criticized by well-meaing and earnest seekers of knowledge.

Best regards,
Narasimha
