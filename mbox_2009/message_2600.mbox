 And once Paul Brunton criticise the Indians for their neglect of material
=
development. To the author's surprise the Maharshi frankly admits the
accus=
ation.

=93It is true. We are a backward race. But we are a people with few=
 wants. Our
society needs improving, but we are contented with much fewer t=
hings than
your people. So to be backward is not to mean that we are less h=
appy.=94
