only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is l=

ed on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. I=
t may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, ea=

he internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way of represen=
tation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or external, is infi=
nite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and =
mind's idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecti=
ng Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and bright=
er Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or big=
hter. He is the same always. We can say "Sun in the mirror" has b=

mi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitru=
 Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships=
, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagi=
nes only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahalak=
shmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. Af=
ter a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He los=
t the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he w=
as part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he came=
 back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described something un=
usual that he "saw". In the middle of the pooja, that priest turn=

neither "internal" nor "external"). He basically percei=
ved Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. How=
ever, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a pur=

me=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading f=
orm. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two di=
fferent ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither internal =
nor external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. B=

maste Krishna Kanth,<br><br>Suppose god really came to your place in a huma=

<b=
r>It is not just about "serving god", but serving god *well*. A p=
urified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and=
 has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may t=
hink various things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-cente=
redness and ego even in serving god.<br>
<br>The god in your homam fire is =
not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, =
you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire an=
d honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one =
thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre=
-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that =
your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and mor=
e, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On=
 practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows=
 with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestatio=
n of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This li=
mited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than u=
sed up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinit=
e, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you will be able to =
single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will help you in t=
he journey.<br>
<br>Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings =
in your homam fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he=
 has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!)=
 to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes h=
im weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!<br>
<br>Of cour=
se, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some unnece=
ssary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a ne=
cessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else's desire=
s cause an extra slow down?<br>
<br>Thus, this is not a matter of political=
 correctness and being nice.<br><br>However, there is already a lot of karm=
ic intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmically, lik=
e wife, children and parents. Wife's desires may affect husband's d=
esires and mother's desires may affect son's desires already (atlea=
st in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no signific=
ant drawback to allowing them to share fire.<br>
<br>Bottomline:<br><br>If =
some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and the=
ir desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow =
such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifica=
lly, some close people's karmas and desires may already be directly aff=
ecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!<br>
