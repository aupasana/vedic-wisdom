Yesterday morning at 9-45, when Bhagavan went out and returned to the hall,=

a dog which was living in the Ashram was barking at another dog which had
=
come there and which it was trying to drive away. While the people there
we=
re trying to pacify the Ashram dog,Bhagavan said in a lighter vein, =93It i=
s
usual everywhere for those who come earlier to exercise authority over th=
ose
who come later. This dog is trying likewise to exercise its authority.=
=94 So
saying, he looked at the Ashram dog, and said, =93Why do you bark? G=
o away.=94
It went away accordingly, as if it had understood his words.

Th=
is morning at 10 o=92clock Dr. Anantanarayana Rao and his wife Ramabai
brou=
ght some good mangoes from their garden and while giving them to
Bhagavan, =
said, =93The monkeys are taking away all the mangoes. So we
hurriedly pluck=
ed these and have brought them here.=94 Bhagavan said
smilingly, =93Oh, is =
that so. So the monkeys are going there also?=94 Then
looking at all the ot=
hers there, he said, =93Yes,monkeys take the fruits one
by one while people=
 take them all in one lot. If asked why, they say it is
their right. If wha=
t the monkeys do is petty theft, what people do is
regular looting. Without=
 realising that, they drive away the monkeys,=94 said
Bhagavan.
