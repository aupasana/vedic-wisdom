Namaste Narasimha and friends,

I am now working on transliterating Maha Ga=
napathi Homam mantras in Tamil, similar to the work done in other languages=
. I am using Baraha Unicode software. Any way, I have to type completely, s=
ince Baraha is not supporting vedic swaras for Tamil language (Tamil langua=
ge has its own limitations for subtle sounds) and I have to find suitable/ =
subtle ways to get the same word to get the same pronounciation. This docum=
ent will be a quick reference guide (or "cheat sheet") containing only mant=
ras and no instructions. I will send the same to Narasimha before end of th=
e week so that he can publish it in his website. He can also add it to the =
main manual.

Regards,
Shankar
