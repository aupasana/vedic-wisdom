There is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you =
will clear that point. You mentioned:

The god in your homam fire is not=
 an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you=
 are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and h=
oning your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thi=
ng here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-oc=
cupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that you=
r mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, =
you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.

W=
hen we are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity fro=
m within ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deit=
ies reside(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just brin=
ging out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, =
universal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the univers=
e, and I am trying to invite him into the fire?
=A0
I remember a line from =
Vimalananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body=
=A0so that this deity (the one we projected)=A0may lead us to the real deit=

Namaste Krishna Kanth,

Suppose god r=
eally came to your place in a human form and asked you to give him some nic=
e food. Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow hi=
m to "serve god"?

It is not just about "serving god", but serving god *wel=
l*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devot=
ion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal perso=
n may think various things in mind even when serving god. There is some sel=
f-centeredness and ego even in serving god.

The god in your homam fire is =
not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, =
you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire an=
d honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one =
thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre=
-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that =
your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and mor=
e, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On=
 practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows=
 with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestatio=
n of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This li=
mited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than u=
sed up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinit=
e, all your desires and other thoughts
 will vanish and you will be able to=
 single-mindedly focus on that divinity.. Some precautions will help you in=
 the journey.

Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in yo=
ur homam fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he has =
enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to g=
rant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him we=
aker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!

Of course, when you=
 are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some unnecessary desire=
s which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil=
 and there is no escape. But, why let someone else's desires cause an extra=
 slow down?

Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being =
nice.

However, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people=
 very closely connected to one karmically, like wife, children and parents.=
 Wife's desires may affect husband's desires and mother's desires may affec=
t son's desires already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned fami=
lies). So there is no significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.
=

Bottomline:

If some people are so close to you that you want to allow the=
ir karmas and their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you =
down, then allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do no=
t allow specifically, some close people's karmas and desires may already be=
 directly affecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!=


Usually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation bett=
er..

Best regards,
Narasimha

 (1) Namboodiris are (or atleast used to be) adepts in fire worship. What t=

 as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle you=

e or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the =
entire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a=
 person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces =
and work on erasing that ego. When one's ego becomes very subtle, it may be=

 very

> >

The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you=
 make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fir=
e (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a=
 strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire wi=
ll become strong and burn various vaasanas.

these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a par=
ticular body part has a higher significance than just tough a part and sayi=
ng it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is =
possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one's subtle=
 perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a forma=
lity. I can tell you that this will not block you..

ess. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let som=
eone else's desires cause an extra slow down?<BR><BR>Thus, this is not a ma=
tter of political correctness and being nice.<BR><BR>However, there is alre=
ady a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to on=
e karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife's desires may affect hu=
sband's desires and mother's desires may affect son's desires already (atle=
ast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no signifi=
cant drawback to allowing them to share fire.<BR><BR>Bottomline:<BR><BR>If =
some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and the=
ir desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow =
such people to
 offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specific=
ally, some close people's karmas and desires may already be directly affect=
ing your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!<BR><BR>Usually,=
 that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better.<BR><BR=

 parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the enti=

the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do not ben=
