Rajarshi,

Rama gives an explanation to Vali who asks the same question and=
 Vali gets convinced. How ever, going by a story I read, Angada, who is son=
 of Vali takes birth as a hunter in Dwaparayuga and mistakes Krishna's leg =
fingers to be ears of a deer and shoots an arrow with which Krishna conclud=
es his avataram.

Killing an animal from behind is allowed and Rama equates=
 Vali to an animal for his behaviour to his brother.

I disagree that Rama =
was unaware of his deviness. In fact, during the war with Ravana, on a spec=
ific day he tell his men  "Only I and Siva can shower arrows in this manner=
". If he were to behave like an ordinary man, he can not say he knew Siva's=
 amstery with bow & arrow.

How can an ordinary man bestow boon of eternal =
life to others? (Hanuman and Jambavantha). Rama also grants a boon to Jamba=
vantha that he would fight him in next birth.

Rama, no doubt knew who he w=
as. In another story, Rama tells Chandrasena that he would marry her in his=
 next birth as Krishna (and Chandrasena is Satyabhama). So, many instances =
where he gives clear indications that he knew he is no ordinary man.

How e=
ver, as Utpal said earlier, he lived a life as an ordinary man. 

Best rega=
rds,
Vijay

eciate your explanation here. however i still think that Lord Rama was capa=
ble of manipulating realm of Maya (Miracle worker) like Lord Krishna BUT th=
e role assumed by him in that incarnation was of that 'Maryaada Purshottam'=
 and that is why he demonstrated 'Maryaada' in every aspect of life.he abid=

not Mastered the Duality. where as Krishna didn't bound himself in any boun=
