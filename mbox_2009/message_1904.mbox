Namaste,

I am doing homam in the evening. once or twice i performed in the=
 morning and i think it was a better experience but no crawling of ants tho=
ugh:). for some days, i am thinking to perform it in the morning. the advan=
tage i see is that it'll help me mantaining the same time everyday which is=
 not the case when i do in the evening after coming back from work.
one mor=
e advantage i fore see is that if the meditation part comes around 5.45-6.0=
0 am, it may prove to be more beneficial.

i don't meditate on any mantra, =
instead sit just observing thoughts and praying. i feel that is also one of=
 the many ways.

morning homam and night for CP seems to be a Jay-Veeru com=
bination. "homam karvano, Chandi paath bolvano, khavanu pivanu ane majjaaa =
ni life"

congratulations to all those fortunate people who have started ho=
mam or whatever ritual regularly. god bless everybody.

warm regards,

utpa=
