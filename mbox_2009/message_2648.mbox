Namaste,

I am doing parayanam of Chandi Path and getting confused with whi=
ch goddess took what form and killed whom. For example, Uttama charitham 
e=
xplains how goddess Saraswathi killed Shumbha and Nishumbha. But when I was=
 reading the English translation it's mentioned that Uma killed them. But U=
ma is another form of Parvathi !!  Lakshmi killed Mahishasura in the form o=
f Durga?!  I think Durga is also similar to Parvathi Devi, right? 

So, can=
 someone please explain the explicit meaning ( I am not that spiritual yet =
to understand the inner meaning). If it's already explained in the old mess=
ages, can you please direct me to that post.

Thank you & happy Dasara.
Lak=
shmi.
