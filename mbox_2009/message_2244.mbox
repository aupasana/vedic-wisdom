Dear PVR jee,

I have a question on maala type for mantra japa. 

For japa =
- can a Rudraksha mala be used for both Shiva and Vishnu mantras. 
OR
is it=
 prescribed in shastra to use rudraksha for Shiva and Tulasi maala for Vish=
nu. 

I don't remember in which forum I read about to use 2 separate malas =
for vishnavites and shaivites. Thought of asking you. My understanding is o=
ne can use any type of maala. Correct me if I am wrong. 

Regards
Bijay Yer=
