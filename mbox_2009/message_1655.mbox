Namaste

Pyramids are not a strange idea, there is more to it.
In fact we h=
ad ancient spirtuality at the time in Eygpt and
a place known as Atlantis e=
ven before that.

These places used to have pyramids etc. The sun temples i=
n peru also have similar shapes.

More on pyramids during atlantis and eygp=
tian times may be found out
from the books that were written when teachings=
 were imparted by
then spiritual Master Agasha.
He is still alive in sooksm=
a sareer and used to guide people till 1960 or so. the books are authored b=
y some american physicist and known as "The wisdom of Agasha". These books =
have a picture of pyramid. There was a church in LA area where the spirit o=
f these ancient masters used to come and teach about karma theory, reincarn=
ation and other spiritual fundamentals.

In india I understand one swamiji =
has procured land in hardwar area and is building pyramids and is going to =
do homans and other pooja inside the pyramids so that it can cure diseases,=
 I believe his name is Kumar Swamiji. I donot know any more details but I h=
eard once a lecture about pyramids and healing.

So I do believe there is m=
ore to pyramids and it needs to be researched.

Best Regards
Mitesh
