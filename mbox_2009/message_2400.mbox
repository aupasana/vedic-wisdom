Dear PathiSir,
Thanks foradding=
  the footnote"Pl. Note" at the end. Thanks for acting on my suggestions in=
 this regard.  The bad effects of Sani`s transits are the effects of bad  k=
armas in this very or past janmas.Sufferings during this period can be mini=
mised by worshipping Sani Bhagawan, Tirupathy Venkatachalapathy and Hanuman=
 on Saturdays  by chanting relevant stotras and or Mantras and by distribut=
ing  Rice preparation  mixed with sesame seed (Ellu sadam)    to poor and p=
hysically challenged people,especially lame.Chanting of Hanuman Chalisa is =
stated to be effective.

Transit Results of Saturn in Virgo (Kanya) Ra=
si
General
	1. When Saturn passes through Janma Rasi of Kanya, those born i=
n stars of Uttara-Phalguni =E2=80=93 Hastham =E2=80=93 Chittirai may live f=
requently separated from family. They could wonder in foreign lands. They c=
ould feel lonely. They could feel undecided in plans in domestic front.  Th=
ey may pick up quarrels in least provocation. Some could suffer with physic=
al troubles, or ailments. Some could run pillar to post without any aim. So=
me could be troubled by unwanted problems =E2=80=93 being (second) move of =
two and half years in =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 in the house wh=
ere the Moon is deposited in the Natal =E2=80=99s Birth Chart. Transit in t=
his house is the secvond part of three parts of Sade Sati. 
	2. For many it=
 will be bereft of good appearance, happiness, pride and short of adequate =
earning to meet basic demands in life, when Saturn passes through 2nd  Hous=
e  from Simha =E2=80=93  in Stars Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uttara Phalguni the=
 last part in three  parts of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99. Some has to meet=
 excess expenditure, and could easily become tired in work place. For one c=
ause to another, some could be persistently in grief, and have commercial l=
osses. One should avoid in total, gambling any form, share market stakes, t=
o avoid financial loss as well as avoidable humiliation. Certainly they sho=
uld avoid bad company, association, illegal connections with opposite sex, =
some could harm educational progress, realize virility falling down, get ac=
ross to avoid the temptation of earning through illegal means. Many will be=
 forced borrow amounts beyond means to repay them, due to domestic unexpect=
ed needs. 
	3. Those born with Moon in Cancer =E2=80=93 Kataka =E2=80=93 Ra=
si - in Stars Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha will have the most profitable, pr=
ogressive, and satisfactory period of next Two and half years, with plenty =
and prosperity.  They will be free from any type of ailments. They will suc=
ceed in heroic efforts.  Fortunes shines on this native, They will have man=
y travel to gain. Their spouse will be happy in all expectations from the p=
artner through this period of next two and half years. This period will shi=
ne to bring prosperity and popularity to all politicians in public life wit=
h birth Stars of Pumarpoosam, Pusam and Ayilyam. The bed time desires will =
be fully satisfactory. Auspicious events, hither to delayed, will culminate=
 to the satisfaction of all. Friends will help the native and siblings will=
 progress. 
	4. The mood and act of native having Moon in Gemini =E2=80=93 =
Mithuna =E2=80=93 in Janma Kundali, in Stars Mrigasheera, Arudhra, and Puna=
rvasu will be far from social norms, and he becomes vindictive in reactions=
, when Saturn transits in 4th house.  That person will be separated from fr=
iends.  Some may lose properties and quarrel with spouse leading to irrepar=
able results.  One could lose a dear and near relative. Body ailments based=
 on colic with flatulence, along with mental distress and fear could troubl=
e many. (This is called Ardhashtama Sani or Kantaka Sani)  For some, in the=
ir Birth Chart findings, if life span is near its end, this period could ca=
use extreme anxiety resulting in death of that person. A few, may not find =
a comfortable shelter.  Some could develop fear that about something or oth=
er. 
	5. Those born with Moon in Taurus =E2=80=93 in Stars Karthika, Rohini=
, and Mirgasheera, Saturn, during this period, will be moving in 5th house =
from the position of Moon in the Birth Chart. One should be careful to avoi=
d any confrontation with his children.  Expenses on them will increase, mor=
e than normal. Problems due to their wrong involvements could cause anxiety=
, waste of money, and related confrontations. Some could fail in their unde=
rtakings, and incur money loss. One could invite troubles due to union with=
 mean partner in sex. One could be forced to move away from family without =
repute. Accumulated assets may dwindle during this period, in undesired inv=
olvement. 
	6. Moon should be in Aeries =E2=80=93 Mesha =E2=80=93 in his bi=
rth Stars Aswani, Bharani and Karthikai ,to know that in this period Saturn=
 is moving in 6th house to the place of Moon in birth chart.  One will over=
come suddenly all his enemies =E2=80=93 a last ball =E2=80=98sixer=E2=80=99=
 to win a cricket match! The spouse, must be floating in joy and comfort an=
d be proud of the partner. Lady can get a long waited pregnancy and become =
proud of her child. Financial status increase unexpectedly. The person will=
 find that appreciation never could ever come from a known person, will pou=
r in abundance from that person to create a flood of growth in popularity. =
All sickness will disappear and health will be blooming. All desired luxuri=
es and comforts will be there for asking! 
	7. Saturn, going into the 7th h=
ouse for next two and half years, to the position of Moon, - Pieces =E2=80=
=93 Meena - for those born in Stars Poorvapathrapada (poorattathi) , Uthara=
pathrapada (Uttirattathi) , Revathi in the birth chart will cause healthy s=
eparation from family frequently, while putting all efforts and hard work w=
ith dedication in work to invite appreciation and reward from all. Some cou=
ld have minor ailments during this period. However, one has to be careful i=
n expenses. Those traveling in speedy vehicles could either commit an accid=
ent or involve themselves to put them away on bed for some time. Absolute c=
areful driving is recommended. One should not invite perennial problems due=
 to illicit relations with opposite sex, which could damage the reputation =
of the person. Here Saturn could give malefic effects more that what is det=
ailed above when he passed through the fourth house to the position of Moon=
 in the birth chart. 
	8. One would be dragged to extreme and damaging temp=
tations during this period for those having Moon in Aquarius =E2=80=93 Kumb=
ha =E2=80=93 Born in the stars of Dhanishta (Avittam), Sathabhisha (Sathaya=
m),Poorvabh adrapada (Poorattathi) , he will be away from family often.  (T=
his position  of transit is termed as =E2=80=98Ashtama Sani=E2=80=99).   On=
e has to be careful with the company in which he associates to avoid bad re=
percussions and heavy loss of earnings. Consequently, the good friends and =
relatives will be put to trouble.  Decrease in wealth, troubles due to ill =
health, obstacles to various undertakings could cause mental depression dur=
ing this period. There could be eye trouble.  Acute shortage of money would=
 be felt by many. Some sort of mental agony will always persist.  Certainly=
 please avoid any bad physical relationship during this period in emotional=
 involvement with one, which could bring in perennial problem all life. 
	9=
. Having transit of Saturn in the 9th house from the position of Moon in Ca=
pricorn =E2=80=93 Makara =E2=80=93  born in Starsof Utthirashada (Uthiradam=
), Sravana (Thiruvonam), Dhanishta (Avittam) in the birth chart, one has to=
 watch out for enemies to harm him in least excuse. One has to work very ha=
rd which normally he could finish it easily and early. Lose of finance is i=
mminent, unless this condition is offset by other Planets, positioned or in=
 transit, in birth chart, which are in favor.  Distress concerning spouse a=
nd progeny will also exist. Money will be spent in unwanted and useless pur=
poses. Keep away from any unknown opposite sex.  If the judged life span co=
incides with Maraka Desa, at this time, many related disappointments could =
become confronted by the Jathaka.  The sources of income will be obstructed=
. Saturn transiting in 9th house is generally not safe and satisfactory a p=
eriod. 
	10. When Moon is positioned in Sagittarius =E2=80=93 Dhanush =E2=
=80=93 Moolam, Poorvashada (Puradam), Uthrashada, (Uttirsadfum) and Saturn =
is transiting in the 10th house (Kanya), it could bring in sudden expenses =
and fall in reputation.  One could cause distress, loss of work, meet obstr=
uctions and objections to decisions, to cause bewilderment.  Many could not=
 satisfactorily complete the education.  One could have meager income for h=
ard work.  Avoid agitations, violent involvement for public cause and enter=
 to peace with fighting groups, which could result in never ending litigati=
ons and sufferings. One could lose respect and gain humiliation. It is firm=
ly said that the native will undergo ordeals when Saturn is in 10th from Ja=
nma Rasi. 
	11. The Moon in Scorpio =3D Vruchika =E2=80=93 Rasi in the star=
s of Visakam, Anuradha (Anusham), Jyesta (Kettai), Saturn is in the 11th ho=
use to the position of Moon in Birth chart. One gets pleasure, money, and c=
omfort from spouse. One will find success in all endeavors in which involve=
d. The person will get elevated status and gain appreciation.  Excellent he=
alth, many financial gains, increase in happiness related to spouse and chi=
ldren and have people with pure heart and deed around the person all time. =
If wife is pregnant during this period a female child will be born to him (=
subject to, of course, result of many other factors in the birth chart to b=
e considered, in both partners=E2=80=99 chart, before such a pronouncement =
is made!). One could get extra-ordinary elevations in his place of work.  S=
ome could get money belonging to others! These two and half years will be v=
ery good. 
	12. When Saturn is positioned in the 12th house from Moon, in S=
tars of Chittirai (Chitta), Swathi, Visakam, it is easily said that just th=
e opposite will result to all that is said, under item 11 above. Do not pos=
sess or hold any money belonging to others! One will be plunged in series o=
f miseries, as that will be the first leg of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99, -=
 Chittirai, Swati, Visakam Stars.  All endeavors fail. Intelligence and ski=
ll get diminished.  His reputation is affected. The person=E2=80=99s life s=
pan judged in the birth chart to the Desha period in effect during this per=
iod, could cause health hazards and death, if it is Maraka Lord Desha perio=
d.  Intensified malefic period will be in exercise during this period of tw=
o and half years.
 
 
Please Note:  The details given above are general and=
 millions would have born in each category.  Therefore, a complete study of=
 individual charts is absolutely necessary before these comments are taken =
as effective.  Many changes due to relations of Other Planets, by its posit=
ion, occupation and qualities with the movement of Saturn and its position =
has to be studied in depth before individual results are set to be pronounc=
ed.
