Namaste

The video is very good, Good work by the video grapher and Narasim=
ha.
It was a pleasure watching it and I feel that I will watch it a few 
mo=
re times.

Most importantly I want to bring out the fact that when one does=
 a lot
japams and homams, the good work is reflected in the persons face, 
=
the lustre etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I have seen 
one pi=
cture of him may be from many years ago and now the video. 
There is a stri=
king difference between the two.

The transformation internally may be more=
 intense and fantanstic.

On a different note, I have heard from a very rea=
lized soul that
The Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks i=
s reserved 
for them, it is not advisible for people like us married or sin=
gle to 
put it on. Many years ago the realized sould did explain me the 
re=
asons but I dot remember more things about.
 
I have seen in Acharya Rajnis=
h order a lot of family oriented people 
putting it on. 

The color signifi=
es detachment.

What the the views of the people here?

Best Regards
Mitesh=
