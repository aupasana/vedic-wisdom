Dear Utpalji and Narasimha,

   If any of you is offended =
due to my being explicit with words - it also shows that you people have a =
lot of scope in learning of new ideas!

> The second statement says somethi=
ng radical. Ahamkaara and I Ness 
> is completely two different identity.
>=
 your second statment is a departure from almost every Gnyaani has 
> to sa=
y.

   It is none of my fault that this conflict arose and continues. Here =
is the reason.

   In my first mail (#2704) itself it is explicitly written=
, that Patanjali has used the exact word "asmita" for Egoism - which is the=
 I-ness (Ahamkara) in Physical body consciousness - that causes identificat=
ion of the seer with the instrument of seeing i.e. Physical senses.

> In P=
atanjali Yoga Sutras:
> drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6
> Egoism is t=
he identification of the seer with the instrument of 
> seeing.

>>> Patanj=
ali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.


  PATANJALI has not used the wor=
d AHAMKARA anywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertation on YO=
GA - he has chosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.

1.  vitarka vic=
haranandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -

                 SASMITA SAMADHI=


2.  From Lahiri Mahasayas' Commentary on Patanjali - 

  avidyasmitaragad=
veshabhinibeshah panchakleshah

"Avidya" [ignorance], "asmita" [egotism], "=
raga" [attraction or 
 liking], "dvesha" [hatred or disliking] and "abhinib=
esha"  [engrossment] -- these are the five types of afflictions.

  Thus, u=
sing "Ahamkara" while talking about Sankhya and using "Asmita" while talkin=
g about Patanjali Sutras brought in the conflict. In any case, what is call=
ed as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, which can be=
 very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.

  The idea stated by me was on firm grou=
nds - with reference to Patanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in =
Autobiography of a Yogi. And this idea is there in my first mail, though no=
t the exact table: 

  PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D ASMITA   =3D Physica=
l Egotism
  ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS    =3D Astral attachments=

  CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D Causal Perceptions

  Also,=
 one of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don=
't have sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:

> Since ast=
ral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to 
> see, hear, smel=
l, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a 
> Yogi)... the sense of egois=
m does not take roots in the astral-body > and hence doesn't create Astral =
Karma.
> Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everythin=
g.

> Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is 
> ass=
ociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has 
> Physical Karma.=


  Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings in the Astra=
l cosmos who have never been in Physical forms - We Physical beings are not=
 the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will still have the id=
ea of "Asmita" in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by =
the grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, an=
d hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to "Asmita".

[ TO ALL IN THE LIST ] =
 
  - If the above explanation resolves the issue, well and good. Whether i=
t does or doesn't, this is my last mail on this topic because I had said al=
l I had to in the first mail itself - whether you read it or missed it.
  Y=
ou may read a detailed article on this topic that I will write as and when =
time allows me to do so.


[ TO UTPALJI ]
      - Am not a jnani.
        B=
ut there are Jnanis, who know that 6th tattwa doesn't exist.
        That i=
s why there is a significant departure.

[ TO NARASIMHA ]

> So you are acc=
epting that there as "I-ness of manas" and "I-ness of > chitta". I-ness=3Da=
ham-kaara.

   There was never a time that I didn't, and I have no control =
over what meaning you derive from my words.

   The power of mind needs no language to ex=
press itself...If a Programmer just understands this much, he will become t=
he Architect!
   Also, while a Programmer always assumes that every other p=
erson he encounters is a Programmer, an Architect knows that every other pe=
rson is an Architect in making. Hope you become an Architect one day!

The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the s=

 One may become a gyaani using either gyaana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma y=
oga or raaja yoga.

 path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual analysis. One pursuing t=
hat path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scr=
iptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with th=
e basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end=
). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self=
. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not=
 Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, fi=
