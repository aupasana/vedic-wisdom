Namaste Kishore,
 
Not really.
 
Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of no I-ness. I-ness of Narasimha Rao, I-ness of Kishore Chitrapu, I-ness of Manish Pandit - all vanish in it. No deities or demons or persons or objects exist in that state. There is no knower and nothing to be known. One's consciousness is absorbed in Brahman or Aatman or supreme consciousness, in which there is no I or You or That. Of course, all deities, demons, persons and objects are *present* in Brahman as a *potentiality* (like a tree is present in a seed as a potentiality), but they are not really there. Thus, there is nothing to perceive or desire or know or do. There is no concept of time as well.
 
Thus, a yogi in nirvikalpa samadhi is not necessarily able to "read" a student's mind. In fact, he reads or writes nothing in that state.
 
However, when one goes from a limited I-ness operating at a particular time to nirvikalpa samadhi (where no objects exist and no time exists, but all objects and all times exist as potentialities) or when one comes back from nirvikalpa samadhi to a limited I-ness operating at a particular time, one's I-ness may traverse through a trajectory covering several beings and several times. Thus, one may happen to "observe" some things from past or future that are not known to others. But one may have no control over the route followed and what exactly one observes en route.
 
On the other hand, if a yogi (such as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Shirdi Sai Baba or Ramana Maharshi) is in sahaja samadhi, then one has access to the I-ness of all beings at all times. One is absorbed in Brahman and aware of manifestation (field of duality) at the same time. Such a yogi may know past, present and future of all beings. However, he will engage in actions the are appropriate for that body and mind. So he may or may not engage in actions that reveal his ability. It all depends on for what purpose Nature wants to use that body.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
