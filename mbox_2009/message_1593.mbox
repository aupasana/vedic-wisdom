Namaste, 
Confusing statements:
a) Killing is prohibited as God is sarva vy=
apakeswara and is existent in everyone
=A0
b) Killing is alright when seen =
through the filter of dharma or detachment. Justified in Gita with the usag=
e "We are the instruments in the Godly plan and hence we are not killing" /=
 "Duty of a Kshatriya is to defeat enemy when the Truth is abused"
=A0
May =
be knowledgeable people on this forum can clear our doubts. 
=A0
* * *
I ha=
ve come across a similar upanishadic paradoxes and it is clarified brillian=
tly in a book. 
=A0
Paradoxes: 
1) Truth is unchanging and rest is changing=

2) Truth is present in all mortal=A0beings 
3) The=A0universe is a manifes=
tation of Truth. If so, why is Universe encapsulated in time frame?
The aut=
hor in the said book, clearly links all together=A0and shows that there are=
 no paradoxes.

I have taken that line into consideration. Now read Narasimhajis mail=

So technically a terrorist may=
 have all the mental/internal/dharmic justification to act the way he acts.=

The root lies in, why do such situations arise where the dharma of a p=

therefore, focusing on karma is far more profitable I feel.

I think you missed the following sentance in Swaboda's article

*=
**
Terrorists surely believe themselves to be doing their duty, but mere co=
nviction is not dharma, for terrorism involves sacrificing the lives of oth=
ers, and dharma sometimes requires its followers to sacrifice themselves or=
 their loved ones.

When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dharma.=
 That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what his "g=

<DIV>So technically a terrorist may have all the =

<DIV>&n=

<DIV>The root lies in, why do such situations arise where the dh=

 karma. So therefore, focusing on karma is far more profitable I feel.</DIV=
