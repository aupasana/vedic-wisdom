notions rather than reality. There is no real you, I and he, but there is o=

>=A0
>When a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific per=

 with so many things that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly... Due to=
 its pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in =
a very limited way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. S=
un's image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be b=
roken and dark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may app=
ear broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a =
different extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying "the mi=
nd focuses on internal god and he is limited".
>=A0
>This is just a simple =
way to put things.=A0In reality, the issue is not internal vs external. The=
 issue is the mind's ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind's pr=
e-occupation with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god g=
oes up, we say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is j=
ust a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal=
 or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind =
can focus better and mind's idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirt=
y mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a c=
leaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really beco=
me cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can say "Sun in the mirror=
" has become cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun "in the" mirr=
or! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirro=
r 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and
 the same!
>=A0
>This manner=
 of speaking about internal vs external god and talking about strengthening=
 internal god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is that any visualizat=
ion of god by a mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities and impuriti=
es of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the best of its =
ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Event=
ually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in t=
he infinite god. Then we say that internal god has become infinite. This is=
 just a manner of speaking.

>Once=A0a couple of priests wit=

in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra=
, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships, he always con=
siders everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as=
 receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling=
 his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. After a while, hi=
s Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He lost the regular a=
wareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he was part of and =
remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he came back and the p=
ooja was finished, one of the priests described something unusual that he "=
saw". In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned towards this person an=
d was surprised by what he saw. He saw
 a tall=A018-handed form of Mahalaks=
hmi standing in=A0the place of this person for a little while.
>=A0
>As tha=
t person meditated, his=A0senses turned inward and he was looking internall=
y. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being in his=
 visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and external=
 blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (it is=
 neither "internal" nor "external"). He basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as=
 the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the priest wh=
o happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state and so =
he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time=A0made him see a=
 specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both the p=
riest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways. One w=
as external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external (but o=
btained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are the sa=

In fact, when you say "inside me", ask yourself : "what is this I"? Is it t=

 a physical body and looks at it as I. When mind entertains the notion that=
 it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it=

becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally overcom=

dy (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upanishadic understanding, the=
re is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions=
 like "inside me", "inside you" and "inside him" are just expressions that =
describe false notions
 rather than reality. There is no real you, I and he=

with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity=
 he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalaksh=

zing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantr=
a to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modi=
fied. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading lig=
ht that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. =
When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described =
something unusual
 that he "saw". In the middle of the pooja, that priest t=

part* of all-pervading light (it is neither "internal" nor "external"). He =
basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was als=
