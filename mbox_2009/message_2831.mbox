Namaste Utpal,

With reference to Kali, here is what Sri Aurobindo wrote (taken from
Letters on Yoga):

> Mahakali and Kali are not the same. Kali is a lesser form. Mahakali
> in the higher planes appears usually with the golden colour.

On Kali, he says with such eloquence (from Essays on the Gita):

> It is only a few religions which have had the courage to say without

So I think there need not be a contradiction with the teachings of
Ramakrishna.

Best regards,

Samir
