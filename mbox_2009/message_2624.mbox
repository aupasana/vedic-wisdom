Namaste Vijay,

I am sure that you have had read a lot and quite a knowledg=
eable person you are. ignorng that, i am mentioing somethng which i've hear=
ed and cherished.

for Guru's importance, following is the very apt explana=
tion which i think was given in Vivekachudamani by great Adi Shankarachaary=
a.

"Guru is the TIGER IN THE DREAM who awakens you from the WORLD OF DREAM=
S" - Guru and the world both are unreal once one is awakened.

Thakur used =
to repeat " Satchidananda is The Sadguru". It is my belief that even if no =
formal Guru is there in the Life of a MUMUKSHU, Brahman is always there for=
 him as Guru hence to put it anotherway, NO sincere seeker is WITHOUT GURU.=


by the way following is the chain of message in VA list which triggered a=
n event where Satchidanda became a Tangible guru for me.

http://groups.yah=
oo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/382 


The above probably relevent to you=
r first two questions.

i again give a quote form VC where in Shankara agai=
n suggest a beautiful idea.

"We all are God who have forgotten that realit=
y".

for your third query, i wish to ask a counter question? Why we create =
dreams while sleeping and then play happy, sad and frightened?

***
Again, =
i've no realisation myself. it si probably all partially cooked or uncooked=
 knowedge which is reproduced, which was liked by intelligence.

Warm Regar=
ds,

Utpal
