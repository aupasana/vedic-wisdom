Namaskar Narasimhaji,
I have a query regarding Tarpanam. Last year while do=
ing tarpanam our pandit here has used a huge brass Bowl. We need to take wa=
ter from the Bowl in  our both palms and drop it into the same bowl  with h=
and gestures as mentioned by you. So instead of water being poured from pot=
 into hand and same water from Bowl was used again and again. Is this Ok or=
 against the rule?

Regards,
Aashish
