AOL is a decent organisation
they give proper receipt unlike many dubious saints organisation
the aol is a mix of powerful yet  simple pranayama simple asanas and simple exercises and meditations 
i sent three persons there and one of them got relieved of his back pain and began telling he can concentrate ten times better in his work now

thanks

Dear Jitender,

I am a member of the Art of Living Foundation for about 4 years now. I have done almost all the courses (few many times over) and listened to the spiritual discourses tapes by Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar.
I'm currently working on becoming a teacher/facilitator .

You can consider such spiritual organization( s) or groups as a Hand Rail while climbing the staircase. 
If its dark around you and you have no clue about how many steps there are etc., - You can do it without holding on to anything, bump into something, etc., - or you can reach to hold the hand rail and go where it takes you.
At some point you'll also have to let go the hand rail and continue your path as well.

Art of Living gives you a set of tools and techniques to help be yourself - open yourself to the world around you. Have a company of good people, good sattwic practices, rich wisdom and knowledge, good tips to a healthy body,mind and productive life.

Many people do get caught up in the course fees and doubts about where the money is being used/funneled etc.,
Art of Living does not have any deep pocketed donors who can fund the immense amount of humanitarian projects. Every dollar comes from contributions from members who have taken the courses.

Yes, all these courses can be free or inexpensive - but how do we view schools or colleges that are inexpensive. We become better learners, when we actually invest in the courses, take ownership and be responsible. You can pay for it or in olden days, the students would do some work at the ashram to "pay" for the knowledge.

I'll leave you with a final thought.

Meditate now or Medicate later.

Shrikanth
