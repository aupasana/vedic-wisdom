Dear Amitji
=C2=A0
Sorry for interrupting your email to Narasimhaji. He is =
no doubt the best person to answer these queries, but I would still like to=
 share my thoughts on them.
=C2=A0
Irrespective of how a planet is placed i=
n the chart, doing homa for a planet helps to make the graha happy and a ha=
ppy planet can only help a person. This is not like wearing some gemstone. =

=C2=A0
As Narasimha's documents mention right in the beginning, homa is a =
process of sustainance of dharma and nature of any being and universe at la=
rge. Its goal is much larger and broader than just a mere planetary influen=
ce. So when someone is doing homa for Kuja, he/she is acting as a meduim fo=
r "sustainance" of Kuja in all his totality. And I believe since Narayan is=
 the Supreme Being who sustains everything,. every homa is but His doing.
=
=C2=A0
Also these mantras of Kuja are taken from what the Rishis had given =
us, therefore they are always benefic for us. I believe there can be no har=
m in doing Kuja homa irrespective of how malefic or benefic it is in the pe=
rsonal chart.
=C2=A0
Just my two cents. I am sure Narasimhaji can much bett=
er perspective on this question.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Respected Sri Narsimhaji,
May I request guidance on :

Will it be a=
 good idea to perform Kuja Homam for subjects who have=C2=A0 Atmakarka Mang=
al ?
Will it enhance martian traits in such people or will it help check su=
ch traits ?
Of course,the Kuja Homam will be performed for spiritual proger=
ss only with no will for material gains,etc.
Thanking sincerely,
amit=C2=A0=

Namaste,
=C2=
=A0
Mars can give diseases, debts (including financial debts), enemies, lit=
igation, quarrels, wars=C2=A0etc and also the energy to fight and overcome =
those problems. Propitiation of Mars is useful to a lot of people these day=
s.
=C2=A0
Compared to meditating with the mantra of any deity or worshippin=

was instructed by my spiritual master, who was told by the divine Mother, t=
o teach simple procedures for worshipping various deities in fire and sprea=
d the ritual of homam in the world. As the world goes through an interestin=
g phase in the coming years, it will be good to have a large number of peop=
le performing homam to various deities on a regular basis around the world.=

=C2=A0
Several manuals for doing homam (fire ritual) to various deities in=
 30-40 minutes are already there on my website. More manuals will be added =
in the course of time.
=C2=A0
Now, I have added a manual for a short Kuja h=
omam for Mars that can performed everyday or once every week (Tuesday or so=
me other day) or once every month. It is hoped that some people will take a=
dvantage of this manual, get some relief from the material troubles given b=

Best regards,
Narasimha
