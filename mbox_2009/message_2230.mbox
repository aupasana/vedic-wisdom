Balasubramanyam ji

I do understand the spirit in which you are suggesting =
the below , definetly giving higher value to the well laid rules of the ris=
his is a nice suggestion.

But given the progress of Kali and its effects. =


1.Most food including Milk nowadays is contaminated with Pesticides.Thank=
s to the hybrid culture propagated by the big genetic seed companies...No f=
ood on earth is left untainted.

So should such food be offered to god.Shou=
ld we altogether give up offering food >

2.The water that comes from the t=
ap in the US is heavily contaminated with heavy metals, lead , chlorine and=
 what not....filtered water is striped of its natural healing properties...=


So should we use such a water in Pitri Tarapana..Kalasha etc etc...


3. =
Fire should not be lit with Matches according to Vedic homa rules , it must=
 only be lit with Samidhas and that too with a elaborate procedure....

So =
should we stop using matches untill we attain perfection with the procedure=
...



When the whole world is under the effect of Kali yuga it is but a pa=
rt of nature that impurities will creep into all the materials that are off=
ered to god.



Same goes for the search for the perfect ingredients..
Same=
 goes for the search for the perfect guru who can be followed..
Same goes f=
or the search for the perfect muhurta....
Same goes for the search for the =
perfect astrological remedy.....

What is visible to the naked eye is 10% w=
hereas the invisible is 90% ...so what is to guarantee that any of those ca=
lculations will work.

Does not Krishna say in the 9th chapter Verse 26 of =
the gita...he is easily pleased with a offering of a flower , leaf ,fruit d=
one with the purest of intentions.


I strongly beleive it is much better t=
o do homa with complete surrender to the divine and he/she will absolve us =
of the lapses committed conscious or unconscious.

>  Dear Friends,
> At the time of Poorna Ahuti,  a  full coconut(poor=
na phalam)  is required to be offered by chanting  the  Vedic Mantra" Poorn=
amadah  Poornamidam  Poornaat  Poornamudatchyate   Poornasya   Poornamaadaa=
ya  Poornamevaasishyate".  Simply because half coconut burns faster than fu=
ll coconut, in my humble opinion we can not substtute a full coconut with a=
 broken half of coconut in Poorna Ahuti. Already our purohits are using cam=
phor for lighting Agni.  This is not the prescribed method of generating fi=
re for Homam( Havan).Some of them are also blowing fire with  a gush of win=
d from their mouth for  the purpose of creating flame  instead of  using ha=
nd fan or  by blowing through a cylindrcal pipe or blowing through Dharba g=
rass. My appeal to learned people is let us not devite from the procedures =
and dos and donts handed over to us by Rishis.
