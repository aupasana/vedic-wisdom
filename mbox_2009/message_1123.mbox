Dear All,

Wish to clear one =
thing. i am one of the biggest admirer of 
Narasimha's writings and like Ra=
vi said, I myself keep reading again 
and again and again his many knowledg=
e messages.

Again please go through what he has mentioned. i am pasting be=
low. 
In my opinion, It is Crux of All books on Spirituality. if one can 
d=
igest the few lines mentioned below, one really don't need to read 
any boo=
k further.

[
External things such as facial lustre are quite subjective, 
=
misleading and
not that important. Let us please leave out the superficial =
things.

In general, I encourage people to do serious sadhana, but I also 
=
urge them
to constantly contemplate one's thoughts, motives and actions and=

consciously try to improve self-control. Serious sadhana tends to 
bring
t=
hose changes internally, but it can still take a long time. There 
are some=

who do serious sadhana for years and yet stuck in the quicksand of 
ego. Y=
es,
ego IS a quicksand. Getting out is very very tough.

Contemplation and =
conscious effort to overcome ego should go in 
parallel to
the "severe sadh=
ana". In fact, I see them as much as a part of one's 
sadhana
as the extern=
al rituals, practices and meditation.

Without a conscious effort to weed o=
ut ego, even serious sadhana can 
cause
pride in one and make one fall. Per=
haps nobody exists today who can 
do more
severe sadhana than Ravana. But, =
despite such severe penances, 
Ravana was
not immune to pride and he fell.
=
]

***

I know our praises will not harm him becuase he has moved to much 
=
safer orbit.

Spiritually yours,

Utpal

Sadhana makes things easier on the=
 effort to overcome ego, but does 
not
guarantee anything. One needs to sup=
plement sadhana with a conscious 
effort
to overcome ego.
