 29th November, 1945

I believe it was about a year back. You know Ramachan=
dra Rao, an Ayurvedic
physician? For preparing a medicine that would give s=
trength to Bhagavan=92s
body, he made out a long list of the necessary herb=
s and ingredients and
showed it to Sri Bhagavan.

Like a good boy, who woul=
d readily obey instructions, Bhagavan went through
the whole list, praised =
the efficacy of the various drugs and finally
said,=93For whom is this medi=
cine, my dear man?=94 He said quietly, =93For Sri
Bhagavan himself.=94

On =
hearing that, Bhagavan said, =93No doubt, you have given me a long list,
bu=
t where am I to get the money for it? It may cost Rs. 10/-, and whom am I
t=
o approach for it?"

Someone quietly said, looking around at the Ashram pro=
perty, =93Whose is all
this, Swamiji?=94

=93Yes, but what have I? If I wan=
t a quarter anna, I must go and ask the
Sarvadhikari. How should I go and a=
sk him? He gives me a little food, if I
go there as soon as the bell rings.=
 I also eat along with the others and
then come back, and I might be refuse=
d food if I was late. Even in being
served food, I come last,=94 said Bhaga=
van.

The poor physician trembled with fear and, with folded hands, said,
=
=93Swamiji, I just showed you the list and I myself will get the required
d=
rugs.=94

Upon this Bhagavan said, =93Oh yes? You will get them? But if tha=
t medicine is
good for me, it must necessarily be good for all the others h=
ere. Can you
give it to them also as well as to me?=94

When some people sa=
id, =93Why do we want it, Swamiji?=94

Bhagavan replied, =93If people who d=
o physical work don=92t need a body-building
tonic, how do I who merely sit=
s here and eats? No, no, that can=92t be!=94

Once before, Dr. Srinivasa Ra=
o told Bhagavan about an Allopathic medicine
which gives strength and said =
that it would be good for Bhagavan if he took
it.

Bhagavan said,=93Yes, th=
at is all right, you are rich and can take anything;
but what about me? I a=
m a mendicant. How can I have such a costly
medicine?=94

Then the doctor s=
aid, =93Bhagavan always declines everything that is offered,
but if he agre=
es to take something, won=92t it be forthcoming? Or if not
medicines,why no=
t take some nutritious food such as milk, fruit and
almonds?=94

Bhagavan r=
eplied: =93All right; but I am a daridranarayana (God in the form of
the po=
or and the destitute). How can I afford it? Besides, am I a single
individu=
al? Mine is a large family. How can all of them have fruits, milk,
almonds,=
 etc.?=94 Bhagavan dislikes anything special for himself.

He has often tol=
d us that if anybody brings eatables and distributes them
amongst all he wi=
ll not mind even if he is left out, but he will feel hurt
if the eatables a=
re given to him only and not distributed to others along
with him.

If he i=
s walking along a path, and some people are coming in the opposite
directio=
n, he does not like them to step aside for him but instead he will
himself =
step aside and allow them to pass and, until they do, he will not go
a step=
 farther.
