In fact my father also expired and when we do shradda karma we usually take=
 the nakashtra which he passed away.The date of the nakashtra may differ fr=
om year to year.=A0 Dont worry take the nakashtra in which he passed away a=
nd do the karma with your heart and soul.

       Sir,=A0 
I have some questions pertaining to Shraddha Tithi.=A0 
1.G=
enerally as per our Hindu Shastras, Tithi is to be counted from one sunrise=
 to next sunrise. There remains a big controversy in this decision. Sometim=
es it happens that=A0Tithi is changed after few hours from sunrise as per S=
un Moon distance. I will give one example. My mother expired in 1999 on Ash=
tami tithi as per calendar. This tithi was upto 5-35 evening as per real ca=
lculation of Sun Moon distance. My mother expired at 23.25 hours at night o=
n Ashtami tithi when actually Navami tithi was started from 5.35 hours. Whi=
ch day I should fix for Shraddha and death anniversary ? Ashtami or Navami =
? ( I am doing Shraddham on Navami ).
2.Some say that Tithi of actual death=
 moment should be taken for Shraddha day and=A0one openion is that Day of f=
uneral ceremony should be taken as Shraddha day. If one expires on Saptami=
=A0late evening and if funeral is done on Ashtami morning, Ashtami should b=
e taken as Shraddha Tithi. But I=A0am not convinced with this second openio=
n as sometimes funeral is done after so many days, how this funeral day is =
acceptable?=A0
Kindly give some light on these confusions.=A0 Regards.
