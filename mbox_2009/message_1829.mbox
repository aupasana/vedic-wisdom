Namaste Rajarshiji,

As you may know, Kali is time personified and deals wi=
th death and destruction, which is what the concept of time does. What is f=
uture today becomes present tomorrow and past later. Hence the concept of t=
ime is inevitably synonymous with death.

Dakshina also means south-facing =
or the realm of death, and Bhadra means auspicious, as the great Mother Kal=
i through death reminds of the truth of the ephemeral nature of our life/li=
ves and grants us moksha, thereby relieving us temporary death and hence fe=
ar!

Since the concept of death has to be dealt by tantric practitioners on=
 their path, they are first introduced to Kali, who is the first among the =
Dasa (10) Mahavidyas.

Hope this helps.

Thanks
Narayan
