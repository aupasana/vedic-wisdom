Namaste,

Personalities come and go and let us not waste time and energy discussing 
personalities. Praise and criticism are both merely a set of words 
expressing certain feelings generated by a play of karmas between persons. 
There is no need to be sensitive. If discussing anything helps one fulfil 
one's dharma, one can do it. Otherwise, it is a distraction and a waste of 
time.

*        *        *

People are criticizing Mitesh's perceived tone and attitude. That is 
subjective and irrelevant to growing our knowledge/wisdom. What is relevant 
is an important point he indirectly raised: what is the role of scripture vs 
intuition/judgment/interpretation of people? Though there was some confusion 
between him and me on what he asked and what I was saying etc, we can lay it 
to rest. The thing to *take forward* is the question of word of scripture vs 
interpretation based on one's intuition.

I want to share my thoughts using a simple analogy.

*        *        *

Word of scripture is like raw rice or wheat. You cannot eat and digest raw 
rice or wheat. You need someone to cook it and give you cooked food. 
However, cooked food cannot be stored for too long. It will get spoiled. So 
you can only store raw food. When you need to eat it, you need to cook it.

Similarly, scripture only stores raw (uncooked) knowledge. This is done for 
a purpose. If interpreted knowledge is stored, it becomes stale or spoiled 
or corrupted with time. So it is wise (and possible) to only store raw and 
uncooked knowledge.

If raw rice is stored in a nice container, someone has to cook it for you so 
that you can eat it. Similarly, the raw knowledge in scriptures has to be 
processed in the internal fire of a learned person to be fit for consumption 
by people [though I do not consider myself a learned person, my guru gave me 
a responsibility and an assurance. I operate on that basis]. Depending on 
how good the fire is, the food may be properly cooked or improperly cooked 
(and inappropriate for consumption). But the bottomline is that the words of 
scripture have to be interpreted by someone well, for them to be useful.

Of course, the food one cooks may appeal to some and not appeal to others. 
Similarly, when one processes raw knowledge in one's internal fire and 
offers the processed knowledge to others, some will be drawn towards it and 
like it and some will not like it.

But many people liking some food does not make it good food. It may be bad 
for health or cause indigestion or be junk food. The goodness of the food 
will be proved when people digest it well and get strength from it.

Similarly, the presence on this list of several people who take a liking to 
my writings and admire me does not mean anything. It is just a play of 
karmas. IF some of them benefit from my writings, have an internal 
transformation and start making spiritual progress, then my writings will 
have served a purpose and then it will suggest that I succeeded in "cooking" 
the knowedge of scriptures well.

*        *        *

There was more I wanted to write, but I have to stop for tonight.

Best regards,
Narasimha
