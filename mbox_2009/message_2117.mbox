Namaste,

It depends on you as to which form you want to worship. There are=
 many forms like Raja Ganapathi, Lakshmi Ganapathi, etc. Each having a part=
icular form and mantra, which is specified in the Dhyanam. If you are not s=
pecific, you can just visualize any form you may want. However, for the wor=
ship to be more effective, Rishis have provided Dhyanam followed by the par=
ticular mantra of that form, to help us visualize and concentrate better.

=
Regards
Narayan
