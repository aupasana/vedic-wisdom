 5th February, 1946

=93About forty years back =97 perhaps in 1906 =97 when=
 I was in Pachiamman Koil, I
had with me only one Malayalam towel. It was g=
iven to me by somebody. As the
material was
flimsy it became worn out withi=
n two months and was torn in several places.

Palaniswami was not in town. =
I had therefore to look after the cooking and
all other domestic work. As I=
 used to dry my feet and hands with the towel
every now and
then, it got al=
l sorts of colours. Its condition would be seen if I used it
as a cover for=
 the body. So I used to roll it and keep it near at hand. What
did it matte=
r to me? It was enough if the required work gets done with its
help. After =
bathing, I used to dry myself with the towel, and then put it
out to dry. I=
 used to guard it carefully so that no one else would know
about it.

One d=
ay a mischievous little boy saw when I was drying it,and said, =91Swami,
Sw=
ami, this towel is required by the Governor. He has asked me to get it
from=
 you. Please give it to me.=92 So saying he mischievously stretched out
his=
 hand.

=91Oh, dear! This towel! No, I cannot give it. Go away!=92 I said.
=

=93As that towel gradually got torn more and more with a thousand holes in=
 it,
I ceased to keep it with me lest it should be seen by Sesha Iyer and o=
thers.
I used it after my bath,and then after drying it, hid it in a hole i=
n the
trunk of a tree
within the temple precincts.

One day, when I went ou=
t somewhere, Sesha Iyer and others, while searching
for
something else, hap=
pened to search that hole in the tree trunk, and found
the towel. Seeing it=
s condition and blaming themselves for their neglect,
they began offering p=
rofuse apologies when I returned. =91What is the matter?=92
I asked. =91Is =
it this towel with a thousand holes that you are daily drying
your body wit=
h after your bath? Shame on our devotion to you! We could not
find out even=
 this.=92 So saying, they brought
several bundles of towels.

=93Something =
else also happened before this.

My kowpinam (small piece of cloth, usually=
 a small strip, worn over the
privities) got torn. I do not usually ask any=
one for anything.Bodily privacy
has however to be maintained. Where could I=
 get a needle and thread
available to mend the kowpinam? At last, I got hol=
d of a thorn, made a hole
in it, took out a thread from the kowpinam itself=
, put it into the hole and
thus mended the cloth, and, so as to hide the pl=
ace where it was mended, I
used to fold it suitably before putting it on. T=
ime passed like that. What
do we need? Such were those days!=94 said Bhagav=
an.

It was quite natural for him to tell us all this but we who heard him =
felt
deeply grieved. Having heard this incident from Bhagavan some time bac=
k,
Muruganar is reported to have written a verse. The purport of that verse=
 is:

=93Oh, Venkata Ramana, who wore a kowpinam mended by a thorn, and who=
 was
served by Indra as a towel with a thousand eyes.=94
