Dear Rajarshi,

>but if we discuss this with an open mind, all can gain fro=
m this. 

Yes... you are right. if we don't discuss and put forth arguments=
 and counter arguments, many aspects may remain hidden or misunderstood. ye=
s..the open discussions have their own utility and must go on.

i also agre=
e that discussion on concepts like comparing Krshna to Kaali - Influence of=
 Surya, chandra, Guru etc.. on Avataaras like Rama, Krishna, Vaaman - Ida &=
 Pingala Nadi and Dakdhina Kali (Dakshin Means Left side and Vaama means Ri=
ght side....in Nyaasa we say Dakshin Karne, Vaama Karne...Dakshin Naasapute=
, Vaama naasaa pute and so on) are very necessary.
I take back my reservati=
on on that regard which i expressed in a mail y'day.

***
About Raama's com=
plete divinity and his uninterrupted awareness of the same, there is no dou=
bt.
one more point i want to add in what vijay and you said
* when Rama, La=
kshman and Sita were passing throught the forest, many Rishis met Rama and =
told him that they are meditating enough on non dual Brahman but they now w=
ant to taste the bliss of Dwaita. Rama assured them that in this incarnatio=
n he can not fullfill their wish but in the next incarnation he'll fullfuil=
l their desire. All those Rishi, it is said, were born as Gopis and Rama in=
 the form of Krishna gave them the Higest bliss possible in Dwait.

See how=
 much i know ;)

Warm Regards,

Utpal
