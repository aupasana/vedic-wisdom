 The Self alone, the Sole Reality,
Exists for ever.
If of yore the First of=
 Teachers
Revealed it through unbroken silence
Say, who can reveal it in sp=
oken words?
=96 Ekatma Panchakam, Sri Bhagavan.

Sri Bhagavan once told the=
 story that follows to Sri Muruganar. This brings
out the profound signific=
ance of the Supreme Silence in which the First
Master,Sri Dakshinamurti is =
established.

Sri Bhagavan said,

=93When the four elderly Sanakadi rishis =
first beheld the sixteen-year-old Sri
Dakshinamurti sitting under the banya=
n tree, they were at once attracted by
Him, and understood that He was the =
real Sadguru. They approached Him, did
three pradakshinas around Him, prost=
rated before Him, sat at His Feet and
began to ask shrewd and pertinent que=
stions about the nature of reality and
the means of attaining it. Because o=
f the great compassion and fatherly love
(vatsalya) which He felt for His a=
ged disciples, the young Sri Dakshinamurti
was overjoyed to see their earne=
stness, wisdom and maturity, and gave apt
replies to each of their question=
s. But as He answered each consecutive
question, further doubts arose in th=
eir minds and they asked further
questions.

Thus they continued to questio=
n Sri Dakshinamurti for a whole year, and He
continued to clear their doubt=
s through His compassionate answers.
Finally,however,
Sri Dakshinamurti und=
erstood that if He continued answering their questions,
more doubts would a=
rise in their minds and their ignorance (ajnana) would
never end. Therefore=
, suppressing even the feeling of compassion and
fatherly love which was we=
lling up within Him, He merged Himself into the
Supreme Silence. Because of=
 their great maturity (which had ripened to
perfection through their year-l=
ong association with the Sadguru), as soon as
Sri Dakshinamurti assumed Sil=
ence,they too automatically merged into Supreme
Silence, the true state of =
the Self.=94

Wonderstruck on hearing Sri Bhagavan narrating the story in t=
his manner, Sri
Muruganar remarked that in no book was it mentioned that Sr=
i Dakshinamurti
ever spoke anything. =93But this is what actually happened=
=94, replied Sri
Bhagavan curtly.From the authoritative way in which Sri Bh=
agavan replied and
from the clear and descriptive way in which He told the =
story,Sri Muruganar
understood that Sri Bhagavan was none other than Sri Da=
kshinamurti Himself!
