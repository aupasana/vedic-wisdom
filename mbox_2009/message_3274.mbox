In this heavy discussion of veg v/s non veg v/s spirituality I know I stand=
 nowhere as I am very bad at debating most of all not very knowledgable,=A0=
 but thought that I will still put little bit of my thoughts too as I am ag=
ainst animal cruelty. 

This world is full of mystery all questions will mo=
stly end in why. The more deeper we think the more mystery. So lets do what=
 our heart says. What good is that spirituality, that prayers when a simple=
 thing like not killing an animal doesn't strike the mind of such people. I=
 don't care the penance the samadhi one has achieved if that person tells m=
e that he eats meat I at any cost won't care at his preaching no matter how=
 high they are. 

=A0I know I am not an authority but personally feel that =
if the non veg eaters argue that eating plants is wrong then
 they are righ=
t. In the olden days vegetation used to be abundant hence rishis etc used t=
o eat only fallen fruits and vegetables.
 No leafy vegetables
 were consume=
d.=A0 In this modern era everything is disrupted. When non veg agree that p=
lants are being tortured then why torture more beings(animals) in the plane=
t. 
Finally I applaud all the non veg who have converted to veg and all tho=
se veg who attempt to convert non veg to veg.I think it is a high kind of p=
uniyam that we are earning by doing so. It is sad to see a whole lot of veg=
 Indians in US converting to non-veg in the name of American culture.=A0 Ho=
pefully I haven't hurt anybody's sentiments. 

Thanks,
