Hi All,
=C2=A0
Just a thought of mine:
=C2=A0
To me, Lord Hanuman is the =
greatest Bhakta who attained whatever he has by devotion towards Rama as a =
God. 
=C2=A0
Likewise there are somany like Bhakta Ramadas, Tulsi das and s=
o many who have attained the spiritual heights in devotion of Rama as a God=
.
=C2=A0
I do not know the reasons why your frieds views are different, but=
 to me it doesn't seems to be appropriate.
=C2=A0
Thanks
KK

Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
I do not =
think that Saint like 'Tulasi Das' would ever be so hard on women. 
The act=
ual poem is like this:
|| Dhol Ganwaar Shudra Pashu Naari, Yah sab Taadan k=
e adhikari ||
Some years back, i read an explanation that Tulasi Das ji mea=
nt "Pashu Naari" and NOT pashu and Naari. It means He feels appropriate to =
punish a Naari who is like pashu in her characteristics.=C2=A0That really m=
akes good sense atleast to me.
=C2=A0
I am no one to comment on an accepted=
 saint like Sri Tulasidasji' s spiritual level, but that sentence definitel=
y looks like he clubbed "pashu" and "naari" in same category, not pashu-nar=
i. The highlighting is done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pash=
u-nari he should have used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did n=
ot. At the level of text, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your explana=
tion, why only Naari who are pashu, why not Naras who are like pashus? Ther=
e are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=C2=A0This expla=
nation=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a back engineering job to bail =
out.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Regarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable to=
 express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really=
 saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees t=
hat Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C2=
=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended =
in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A p=
ath that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C2=A0 Co=
mpare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was not =
named "Krishna+ayana" . One cannot follow Krishna's path. 
=C2=A0
Whenever,=
 according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind wil=
l create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper and the worshipped and=
 thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama did. BUt if we try to loo=
k at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc,=
 we have a better chance of following such a life.
An ordinary man cannot l=
ead the life of a God but he can follow the life of a great man.
=C2=A0
Sim=
ilarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become like =
Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in=
 teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C2=A0saint=
 of highest calibre, but his life's image is like=C2=A0one who=C2=A0lived l=
ike a lion among sheep of ordinary=C2=A0men, fearless and uncompromising an=
d principled. If every=C2=A0person would constantly think that Vivekanada w=
as a saint=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme sp=
irituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C2=A0no one will ever make an a=
ttempt to be inspired by him or=C2=A0emulate his way of living.Vivekanada w=
as a spiritual giant, but=C2=A0the image he projected was one of a tireless=
, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0On the other h=
and=C2=A0you will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead a =
life like Ramarkishna.=C2=A0=C2=A0That is impossible. He=C2=A0 was God inca=
rnate leading a charmed life.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Similar is the case with the Ava=
tar called Sri=C2=A0Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna. One can become=
 Rama in actions but one can never=C2=A0become Krishna. Therefore, my frien=
d believes, one should not consider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as =
a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.
=C2=A0
Hope I have put forth=C2=A0=
his idea clear.

Dear Rajarshi,
I som=

.
I do not think that Saint like 'Tulasi Das' would ever be so hard on wome=
n. 
The actual poem is like this:
|| Dhol Ganwaar Shudra Pashu Naari, Yah s=
ab Taadan ke adhikari ||
Some years back, i read an explanation that Tulasi=
 Das ji meant "Pashu Naari" and NOT pashu and Naari. It means He feels appr=
opriate to punish a Naari who is like pashu in her characteristics.=C2=A0Th=
at really makes good sense atleast to me.
About Lust in Tulasi das: It is w=
ell known that Tulasi Das=C2=A0was extremely attached to his wife so much t=
hat he won't allow her to go even at her parental home for a day. However h=
e left the sansaara=C2=A0in a Flash.=C2=A0 in a=C2=A0moment for ever. That =
is a great vairaagya. almost like Sri Ramakrishna used to give=C2=A0the exa=

=C3=82=C2=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the=

s whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C3=82=
=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita's abduction, but Rama di=

 way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama's ideas tha=
n to worship Rama.
> =C3=82=C2=A0

om a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awad=

 equates women with animals or something similar. He believes that was intr=
oduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust=
. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further,=
 he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his A=
vatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krish=
na was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on=
 this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he =
thinks.

ne day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=82=C2=
=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromisin=
g attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By educat=
ion, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from ba=

He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Ara=
bic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all t=
he above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheis=

 he asked

office for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna templ=

uld aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary =
men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C3=82=C2=A0can try to lead his life=
 like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his i=
dea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises peop=

<DI=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>To me, Lord Hanuman =
is the greatest Bhakta who attained whatever he has by devotion towards Ram=
a as a God. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Likewise there are somany like Bh=
akta Ramadas, Tulsi das and so many who have attained the spiritual heights=
 in devotion of Rama as a God.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I do not know t=
he reasons why your frieds views are different, but to me it doesn't seems =
to be appropriate.</DIV>

really makes good sense atleast to me.</EM></DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I =
am no one to comment on an accepted saint like Sri Tulasidasji' s spiritual=
 level, but that sentence definitely looks like he clubbed "pashu" and "naa=
ri" in same category, not pashu-nari. The highlighting is done by you, not =
in the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic gr=
ammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the level of text, it is indefens=
ible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari who are pashu, why =
not Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than N=
aaris in the world. This explanation  that you found looks more l=
ike a back engineering job to bail out.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>Regarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable to expres=
s the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really saying=
 that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri=
 Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion) God di=
d not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in order =
to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that =
an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.  Compare thi=
s to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was not named "Kr=
ishna+ayana" . One cannot follow Krishna's path. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<=
DIV>Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcs=
ious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper and the w=
orshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama did. BUt if =
we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man, a devoted=
 husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a life.</DIV>
<DIV>=
An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the life of=
 a great man.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Similarly, even today lot of peo=
ple advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda, or that this cou=
ntry needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean=
 Vivekanada was not a self realized saint of highest calibre, but his =
life's image is like one who lived like a lion among sheep of ord=
inary men, fearless and uncompromising and principled. If every p=
erson would constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint who worked by=
 the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of=
 a great guru, no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him =
or emulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but&nbs=
p;the image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT ca=
n inspire people. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> On the other hand&nbs=
p;you will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead a life li=
ke Ramarkishna.  That is impossible. He  was God incarnate l=
eading a charmed life. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Similar is the ca=
se with the Avatar called Sri Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna.=
 One can become Rama in actions but one can never become Krishna. Ther=
efore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama as a God to be wors=
hipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.</DIV>

 =
is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather t=

 paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics =
nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with animals =
or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because T=
ulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up
 co=
mposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama=
 is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri R=

re=C3=82 about his spiritual life=C3=82 that I know, let me say=
=C3=82 line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him =
about two years back. What first attracted me to=C3=82  towards him wa=
s his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=82 when it comes =
to=C3=82 honestly.=C3=82 If someone were to put a gun to his head=
 and ask him
 to just say a simple, harmless=C3=82 lie, like sun rises=
 in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too=
! He has actually never ever=C3=82 spoken even a single lie in his who=
le life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him=
 that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher. La=
ter someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the wo=
rld cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself t=
wo thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every d=
ay he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and<BR>> one hour re=
ading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=82 up volumes of Hind=
i and English literature.=C3=82 When I asked him why, he just said it =
is because he wanted to be=C3=82 equally adept at both the languages s=
o that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=
=C3=82 which is more
 comprehensive language! As I said, he has an unc=
ompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything.=
 By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different field=
s, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in mos=
t places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, San=
skrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetr=
y in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself=
 an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for rel=
igion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that =
blank space, he asked<BR>> my friend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the c=
lerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk=
 and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and =
writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&=
gt; So this gives a
 basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friend=
s, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&=
gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His=
 way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=82&nb=
sp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He s=
ays he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That =
was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in =
the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked th=
e priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just st=
ayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow =
felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He=
 remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&g=
t; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82 that he =
got visions etc of Krishna.
 He does not say much about these, infact most =
people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=
hi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=
ce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82  Only his wife and=
 close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he =
sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone aske=
d him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole uni=
verse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, th=
e animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller th=
an the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=
=C3=82 He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=82 Lord Rama to =
be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because =
he thinks it elevated Sri=C3=82 Rama to the<BR>> level of a God whe=
reas the aim of the orginal Valmiki
 Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an id=
eal man,=C3=82 not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man =
is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to becom=
e like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot =
become Krishna, but one=C3=82 can try to lead his life like Rama. I ha=
ve argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he doe=
s not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust =
most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.<BR>&=
gt; =C3=82 <BR>> Later he had once=C3=82 mentioned he knew the=
