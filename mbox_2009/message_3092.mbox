I forgot to mention one more Sufi master, without whom this discussion will=
 surely remain incomplete. Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi, more famo=
usly known as Ibn Arabi.
=C2=A0
He never started a tariqa (path/method) of =
Sufis but wrote extensively on what is called tawhid - or Monotheism. His i=
dea of tawhid is quite different, he called it wadat-al-wujud (The oneness =
of Being). THIS idea is almost life the idea of self realization or Vedanta=
. Obviously, most true muslim scholars reject it.=C2=A0 Some of his famous =
quotations are as follows:
=C2=A0
'Whoever witnesses without ceasing what h=
e was created for, in both this world and the next, is the Perfect Servant,=
 the intended goal of the cosmos, the deputy of the whole cosmos'
Self is a=
n ocean without a shore. There is no end to the contemplation of it in this=
 world or the next
'God seeks from you your heart and gives to you all that=
 you are. So purify and cleanse it [the heart] through presence, wakefulnes=
s and reverential fear'
=C2=A0
Clearly you can you these ideas have no basi=
s or root inside the Islam of Muhammed.



The upsurge (of consciousness) i=
s Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

De=
ar Utpal,
=C2=A0
If you are asking specifically about Bulle Shah, he was a =
Sufi saint of the 15th Century in area of modern Pakisthan. As you can well=
 understand from his poetry, his realization was quite different from tradi=
tional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his ti=
me. He was a pacifist and a true saint.
=C2=A0
Most people consider Sufism =
or Sufiana=C2=A0to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is different. In =
most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=
=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that their personal real=
ization was quite different from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the=
 Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these=
 areas, specially Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to prote=
ct their philosophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwi=
se they would have faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self pres=
ervation which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a m=
ore sublime path - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths and =
the Koran proper.
=C2=A0
For example Rumi talks a about something similar t=
o=C2=A0reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does talk=
 about communion with God:
=C2=A0
I searched for God among the Christians a=
nd on the Cross and therein I found Him not.
I went into the ancient temple=
s of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.
I entered the mountain cave of Hi=
ra and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.
With set purpose I =
fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only 'anqa's habitati=
on.
Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; Go=
d was not there even.
Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn S=
ina but found Him not within his range.
I fared then to the scene of the Pr=
ophet's experience of a great divine manifestation only a "two bow-lengths'=
 distance from him" but God was not there even in that exalted court.
Final=
ly, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.
=
=C2=A0
Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. T=
he creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Ku=
fr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my int=
erpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Isla=
mic garb. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The person who changed the life of Rumi was also a=
nother Sufi called=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular le=
gend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One da=
y the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to=
 a dead body and said, "In the name of Allah, wake up!". But nothing happen=
ed. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, "In my =
name, wake up!" and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him f=
or doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah =
as per true Islam - and executed him.
=C2=A0
Same was with case with Mansur=
-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means =
I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional I=
slam. 
=C2=A0
Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaal=
is in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lor=
d Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.
=C2=A0
Generally, except for the=
 famous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis=
 saint. 
=C2=A0
Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective inte=
rpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled.=
 Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not =
blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you in=
 no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God commu=
nion is unacceptable to Islam. I won't digress into my views of what ails I=
slam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and a=
uthentic version of Islam is to be followed.
=C2=A0
BTW, Sufi ideas are qui=
te famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual high=
er middle class. But like most things under the sun, they hardly know anyth=
ing about anything.

Dear Rajarshi,

Warm Regards,
