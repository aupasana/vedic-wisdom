Namaste,
Thankyou Sir, for so kindly clearing my doubts.
One more sir--ther=
e seem to be no end to my questions!
While doing  homa one evening,i rememb=
ered a friend of my husband--she is a dentist,when we had last met her (a y=
ear ago) she was in pain--something to do with her spine;As soon as i remem=
bered her i just prayed for her  for a moment.The next thought was whether =
it is all right to do this while doing homa?It was not planned.In fact we h=
ave not spoken to or of this lady in months.What should one do?
Best regard=
s,
Sunita
