Namaste,

1. One may be afraid of telling one's father (or mother) "I love you". 
Especially one who has a strict disciplinarian for father may be too 
hesitant and concerned about mistakes. Well, my friend, even if you make a 
mistake when telling "I love you" to your father or mother, nothing bad will 
happen. Even if they punish you a little, it is for your own good. Your 
mother and father want you to succeed.

Even if you say "I love you" without much emotion and as a formality, they 
do not mind. They still love you. After following formality for some time, 
the emotion will come by itself!

The trick is to actually *see* god as father/mother. If that attitude is 
there, the emotion in saying "I love you" (i.e. devotion in saying mantras) 
will come by itself in time.

Think of the above and think of your ishta devata as the father. Try to 
think that whatever you have is given by him and you owe everything to him.

2. This is irrelevant. Don't worry about it. With a veda mantra, 
pronunciation must be fixed. If you are doing some other mantra, do not 
worry about a constant pronunciation.

Best regards,
Narasimha
