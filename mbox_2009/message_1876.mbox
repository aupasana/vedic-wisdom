Namaste PVR=
ji,

In your Lakshmi Homam manual, you mentioned only the first 15 verses o=
f Sri Suktam, while in parayana purpose, I note that there are 32 verses, a=
s per books published by Sri Ramakrishna Mutt. In the audio CDs, I found th=
at scholars have sung only the first 15 or 18 verses and rest of the verses=
 are left out.

Is that only the first 15 verses are important. Can you ple=
ase advise? 

Thanks and Regards,
Shankar
