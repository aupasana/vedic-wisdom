Namaste Utpal

Good Question?

Why compare Apple and an Orange. They are tw=
o distinctly different items.
Any path practised sincerely under the guidan=
ce of a siddha gurudev
leads to end place, and once reaching there everythi=
ng is alike.

What path one gets attracted to and make progress depends on =
the constituent sanskars that person has, accumulated over many past lives.=


All paths are equal having their own pros and cons. 
Kriya Yoga is very e=
ffective in doing Nadi Shudi, the first step, along with this one needs to =
practise Vaivhar Shuddi - good conduct.

I am not sure about Sri Sri's suda=
rshan kriya, but babaji's kriya yoga had 10 or so different kriya, which we=
re taught to the sadhak one after other as he made progress, these kriyas c=
an be also termed as pranayams or yogic breathing technics.

But as one pro=
gress eventually the Kundalini Shakti rises and it takes over and that is w=
hat is called the Raja Yoga in Bhagvat Geeta.

Once Kundalini Shakti starts=
 rising and does chakra bhadan, the sadhaka starts to do interesting medita=
tion, yoga, mantra in spontanous way, i.e he is not the doer, he is just th=
e observer to the play of shakti.

This leads to experiances that are not v=
ery easy to explain or describe.

Similarly doing Homam also, the path is s=
lightly different as with control and concentration on fire, one regulates =
internal fire and that is also the way.

The main benefit of fire is the im=
pact on environment, it cleans up the environment. Also their a sloka, from=
 fire, we have smoke and it creates clouds and clouds create rain and rain =
creats food, it supports the natural cycle.

These days we see a lot of peo=
ple proposing Homams is due to the fact that we have severly polluted our e=
nvironment, global warming, water pollution etc. Homams help in cleaning up=
 the environment.

Why worry about air and fire, practice what suits your m=
ind or practise both. do kriya yoga in morning and homan in evening.

In my=
 opionion an integrated systematic approach of
vyavhaar suddi, nadi suddhi,=
 service or seva, mantra yoga, other forms of yoga, bhajans and satsang is =
needed in these trying times to
get focused. One needs to constantly focus =
on his chitta and look at the impurties and try to clean them using one or =
more of above techniques.

Best Regards
Mitesh

 Babaji or Sri Sri or any other master (present day or ancient) have stress=
