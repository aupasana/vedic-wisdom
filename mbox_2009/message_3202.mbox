Hi all,

During homam some of my offerings don't get burnt properly. There =
are leftover halfburnt coconut pieces, half burnt naievdyam etc. Is it ok t=
o collect all these leftover halfburnt pieces and use it for the next homam=
 or will it be like giving stale food to god. I have lot of raksha accumula=
ting what do you all do with so much raksha. 

Thanks,

Sudha
