 23rd August, 1946

The day before yesterday a learned man who came from Ma=
dras, began at 3 p.m.
to question Bhagavan thus: =93Was there a period at a=
ny time when Bhagavan did
sadhana?=94
Bhagavan said, =93Sadhana? Sadhana fo=
r what?

What is there to do sadhana for? Sitting like this is itself sadha=
na. I used
to sit like this always. I used to close my eyes then; now I kee=
p them open.

That is the only difference. What is now, was then also. What=
 was there
then, is also here now. Sadhana is necessary only if there is a =
thing other
than =91I=92, Self.

Sadhana is required only for one who does =
not look towards the Self which is
permanent, but is deluded by looking at =
the body,etc., which are transitory
and delusive; but not for one who sees =
the Self and so does not see anything
else different. And what else is sadh=
ana for?=94

Someone asked, =93Then why is it that many books say that no o=
ne can attain
jnana without a Guru?=94

Bhagavan said,=93Yes.

For those wh=
o, because of the action of their minds, are deluded into
believing that th=
ey are the bodies, a Guru and sadhana are necessary to get
rid of that delu=
sion.=94

Another person asked, =93People say that those who have received =
upasana can
attain the physical manifestation of their favourite God and ot=
her blessings
by sadhana. What is the meaning?=94

Bhagavan said, =93That w=
hich is present at all times is sakshath (manifest).
The person =91I=92 is =
always present (sakshath). Then what is karam?

That which is the cause is =
karam, so sakshatkaram (manifestation) means the
knowledge of that which is=
 true,that which is permanent and that which is
the cause of
everything is =
one=92s own Self.

And they say that God will descend from somewhere and ma=
nifest Himself if
the Self which is ever existing, creates a shape accordin=
g to its own
desires,and meditates on it.

You give up the Self which is ex=
isting at all times and at all places, and
do sadhana with the hope that so=
me God from somewhere will manifest
Himself.They say that God just descends=
 and again just disappears.

You give up the Self which is always existent =
and strive for this transient
vision, obtain boons and thus multiply the me=
ntal struggles and strivings.
There will be no trouble at all if one simply=
 remains as one is,=94 said
Bhagavan.

Sadhana is necessary but for what pu=
rpose? His Self is there at all times
and at all places. So there is no nee=
d to try and get it from somewhere
else.

Sadhana is only to get rid of the=
 bodily and other illusions which are in
the way of the self standing up as=
 Self. This delusion arises only by
thinking that this bodily world is real=
, instead of looking at the Self,
which is real.

Sadhana is only to get ri=
d of this illusion. Otherwise, why should there be
sadhana for the Self to =
attain its own Self? He who has realised his own
Self does not recognize an=
ything else.=94
