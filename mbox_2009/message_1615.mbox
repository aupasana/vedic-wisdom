Namaste Friends,

Queries of Vijay are note worthy. I share the same doubts=
. It is not easy to solve the riddle of cast system in its original form be=
cuase as back as Mahabharata days, Ashwatthma was not reduced to Shudra cas=
t even after doing the horrible karma.

Example of Valmiki and Vishwamitra =
are stray examples but what about normal people of those days? With which c=
ast tag they used to live their daily lives?

and one more thing is that we=
 don't find one example of A Brahmin being degraded to other cast such as f=
or exaple say Shudra.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
