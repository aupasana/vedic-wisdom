Gandhiji's statement=C2=A0"The=C2=A0path of Truth is through=

This reminded me of =

=C2=A0
Taken toget=

(Non-v=

Namaste All,
I again give link to my Initi=
al message which wasn't responded to.
http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=
- wisdom/message/ 411
I repost some later part of the message below:
But am=
 I wrong in thinking this way? Am I wrong in my efforts to make
them unders=
tand my view point? Though I never pressurize or irritate
anybody on the is=
sue.
Some times I feel that if most of the humans on earth eat meat, fish
a=
nd eggs then is there any fundamental misconception about it? can
there be =
so many people wrong in their food habits. But in any case,
for me I=C2=A1=
=C2=A6ll stick to veg food simply.....
***
I got the Final conclusive Confi=
rmation to my=C2=A0view point=C2=A0yesterday in quite an interesting way. Y=
esterday evening i went to a mall along with some family friends. Occasion =
being my marriage anniversary.=C2=A0=C2=A0One senior friend, whom i respect=
 very much, who is also=C2=A0a vegetarian, suddenly started arguments with =
me on the=C2=A0same topic. He was=C2=A0arguing from the Nonveg point of vie=
w. In short, he was saying=C2=A0by giving examples that People who meat are=
 also very gentle, polite and good natured.=C2=A0 They are not Tamasik and =
such arguments. =C2=A0I again reiterated my view. I told him that=C2=A0i do=
 not say that the people who eat meat are *Bad* people. I do not also claim=
 that Pure veggies are all and always *Good* people.=C2=A0 Infact, i have a=
 couple of very good friends who are meat eater and they are really good hu=
man beings. =C2=A0I only say that the people who eat meat are not doing the=
 right Karma because the act results in to cold blooded killing/ butchering=
 / massacre
 of innocent Creatures. I only say that for eating (actually sa=
tisfying cravings of palate), one has no right to harm the other life.
We b=
oth kept quite for a while and then i suddenly saw a advertisement poster o=
f Mont blank pen on which Mahatma Gandhi's picture was shown=C2=A0with=C2=
=A0one of his thought and signature. I had earlier seen this poster but nev=
er felt like going near and reading it. but yesterday i went near that=C2=
=A0to read the thought of Mahatma in his own handwritings and Lo! It was wr=
itten:
"The=C2=A0path of Truth is through Ahimsa (Non-Violence) ....". I ca=
lled my friend near and showed him that. he also starred for a while to tha=
t thought.=C2=A0The discussion ended. =C2=A0He got the answer probably and =
I got my confirmation!
***
I always recite a=C2=A0 prayer at conclusion of =
my daily Homam (I prefer this prayer over "Sarve Janaha Sukhino Bhabantu...=
) which goes like this:
Sarve Bhavantu SukhinaH, Sarve Santu NiraamayaaHa

 that the people who eat meat are not doing the =
