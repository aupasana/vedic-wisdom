Subject: Relief from Rahu problems (Re: query)

Namaste,

1] Rahu homam manual will be created in time. Homam with the veda mantra 
"kayaanschitra" was suggested by Maharshi Parasara for relief from problems 
with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaasa's pouraanika mantra "ardha kaayam". I 
will try to create Rahu and Ketu homam manuals soon.

2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of Rahu mantra, one can pray to 
Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as "Devi Maahaatmyam" (glory of the 
goddess) or "Durga saptashati" (Durga's 700) or "Chandipath" (chanting of 
Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not fluent in Sanskrit and not willing to 
try at all can try Durga/Chandi saptashloki, which is a collection of 7 
representative verses out of those 700.

It is possible to do a simple homam by using the Chandi homam manual on the 
website below and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) for pradhaana homam. 
Just invoke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaaras, offer one aahuti to her 
parivaara devatas and then keep offering these 7 verses over and over, as 
many times as you can.

One can also pray to Lord Venkaeswara or Balaji for relief from Rahu 
problems.

Best regards,
Narasimha
