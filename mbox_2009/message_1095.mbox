Namaste,
=A0
Yes, Mahaganapathi homam =
can be performed in the night too. In fact, the most pleasant Mahaganapathi=
 homam I have ever attended was performed in the back yard of a priest's ho=
use, right next to a river, on a night. I practically know that it is perfe=
ctly fine to do Maha Ganapathi homam in the night and the energy generated =
is still pleasant and saattwik.
=A0
However, if you do Chandi homam, my adv=
ice is to do it in daytime, atleast in the beginning. The energy that manif=
ests is different at night than at daytime, especially with Chandi homam. I=
f you are unable to perceive that energy, then there is no problem and no d=
ifference between day and night. But, if you are able to perceive that fier=
ce energy and if it scares you, that may be bad. Thus, it is better in the =
beginning to do Chandi homam during the daytime.
=A0
For Lakshmi homam also=
, daytime is preferred. But night is also acceptable.
=A0
Other homas are o=
k anytime.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Na=
maste,

I am glad to know that. With practice, it will become smooth and yo=
u can 
start to focus better of mantra.

When priests perform homam on a gr=
and scale, they distribute the tasks among 
them. If you do on a smaller sc=
ale by yourself, you can do everything by 
yourself. In fact, the latter is=
 better.

In fact, even when many priests do it together with one fire, it =
is good to 
have one person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants,=
 one prepares 
and chooses offerings and one finally makes the offerings in=
 the fire, that 
is better than everybody making different offerings in fir=
e. Ideally, the 
contact with fire should be from one person. Of course, if=
 each has a 
separate homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.

Never t=
hink in terms of keeping the positive vibrations to yourself or 
within you=
r house. Fire is the basis of creation. Fire rituals are important 
to main=
tain dharma in this universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do 
homam=
 thinking that you are doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of 
mot=
ives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping nature, nature WILL 
rewa=
rd you for it. But leave it to nature and do your part selflessly. 
Self-ce=
nteredness is an acid of which a single drop is sufficient to break 
the mi=
lk of your ritual.

Actually, a homam done under the sky (i.e. in open air)=
 is better than one 
done under a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when=
 one cannot do in open 
air, one can do inside a house also.

Best regards,=

Narasimha
