THE WOMEN OF INDIA (New Discoveries, Vol. 2, pp. 411-26.)
Volume 9, Lecture=
s and Discourses

Going back to our Vedas =97 they are the oldest literatur=
e the world possesses
and are composed by your and my common ancestors (the=
y were not written in
India =97 perhaps on the coast of the Baltic, perhaps=
 in Central Asia =97 we do
not know).

Their oldest portion is composed of =
hymns, and these hymns are to the gods
whom the Aryans worshipped. I may be=
 pardoned for using the word gods; the
literal translation is "the bright o=
nes". These hymns are dedicated to Fire,
to the Sun, to Varuna and other de=
ities. The titles run: "such-and-such a
sage composed this verse, dedicated=
 to such-and-such a deity".

In the tenth chapter comes a peculiar hymn =97=
 for the sage is a woman =97 and
it is dedicated to the one God who is at t=
he background of all these gods.
All the previous hymns are spoken in the t=
hird person, as if someone were
addressing the deities. But this hymn takes=
 a departure: God [as the Devi]
is speaking for herself. The pronoun used i=
s "I". "I am the Empress of the
Universe, the Fulfiller of all prayers." (V=
ide =93Devi Sukta=94, Rig-Veda
10.125)

There is that beautiful story of th=
e great sage Y=E2jnavalkya, the one who
visited the kingdom of the great ki=
ng Janaka. And there in that assembly of
the learned, people came to ask hi=
m questions. One man asked him, "How am I
to perform this sacrifice?" Anoth=
er asked him, "How am I to perform the
other sacrifice?" And after he had a=
nswered them, there arose a woman who
said, "These are childish questions. =
Now, have a care: I take these two
arrows, my two questions. Answer them if=
 you can, and we will then call you
a sage. The first is: What is the soul?=
 The second is: What is God?" (
Brihad=E2ranyaka Upanishad 3.8.1.-12.)

Thu=
s arose in India the great questions about the soul and God, and these
came=
 from the mouth of a woman. The sage had to pass an examination before
her,=
 and he passed well.

Drinking wine, killing a woman and killing a Brahmin =
are the highest crimes
in the Hindu religion.

We come to another class of =
women. This mild Hindu race produces fighting
women from time to time. Some=
 of you may have heard of the woman [Lakshmi
Bai, Queen of Jhansi] who, dur=
ing the Mutiny of 1857, fought against the
English soldiers and held her ow=
n ground for two years =97 leading modern
armies, managing batteries and al=
ways charging at the head of her army. This
queen was a Brahmin girl.

The =
very peculiarity of Hindu women, which they have developed and which is
the=
 idea of their life, is that of the mother. If you enter a Hindu's home,
yo=
u will not find the wife to be the same equal companion of the husband as
y=
ou find her here. But when you find the mother, she is the very pillar of
t=
he Hindu home. The wife must wait to become the mother, and then she will
b=
e everything.

It is alone in the Sanskrit language that we find four words=
 meaning husband
and wife together. It is only in our marriage that they [b=
oth] promise,
"What has been my heart now may be thine". It is there that w=
e see that the
husband is made to look at the Pole-star, touching the hand =
of his wife and
saying, "As the Pole-star is fixed in the heavens, so may I=
 be fixed in my
affection to thee". And the wife does the same.

Aryan civi=
lization has been of three types: the Roman, the Greek, the Hindu.
The Roma=
n type is the type of organization, conquest, steadiness =97 but
lacking in=
 emotional nature, appreciation of beauty and the higher emotions.
Its defe=
ct is cruelty. The Greek is essentially enthusiastic for the
beautiful, but=
 frivolous and has a tendency to become immoral. The Hindu
type is essentia=
lly metaphysical and religious, but lacking in all the
elements of organiza=
tion and work.

And let me tell you, this should be done by women. There ar=
e some of our
books which say that the next incarnation, and the last (we b=
elieve in ten),
is to come in the form of a woman.
