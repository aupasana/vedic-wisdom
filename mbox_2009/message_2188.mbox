Namaste Narayan,

I am extremely surprised to know that one can complete Ch=
andi Homam in 1 hour. please educate me as to how it is possible to complet=
e it in such a short time.

I've performed Chandi Homam around 12 times. Ho=
mam exactly as per manual takes around 2.5 hours. (with Kavach, Argala, Kil=
ak, Ratri Sukt, devi sukt,13 chapters etc...)

my daily CP, Even though i r=
ead with good speed, i am able to read all the 13 chapters in 50 minutes so=
 i really wish to know about how you manage everything in 1.15 hours.

awai=
ting your reply.

Best Regards

Utpal

like to add that  I was able to reduce the time by practicing it regularly =
and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaushik's Durga S=
aptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has a great voice=

tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast for my liking.

how long does it take to do the full homam generally? Also when they starte=
d initially, did it take longer time to do the full chandi homam?
