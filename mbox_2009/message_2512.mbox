Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams

Is it also possible to have a simplified Chandi homam in which only the
fifth or eleventh chapter is recited plus the usual preamble and postamble?

best regards
Hari

That can be done. It is not inappr=
opriate. You do not need to modify <br>
anything. The sankalpa may be modif=
ied each day to specifically say that you <br>
will do a homam to Chandi wi=
th so and so adhyaya(s) from Devi Maahaatmyam, <br>
but that is not necessa=
ry.<br>
