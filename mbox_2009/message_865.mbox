One more question I had, the homa Agni burns away the karmas which are repr=
esented by the wood and the offerings we give. Now is this only the negativ=
e karmas it burns or also the once we call good karmas?



The upsurge (of =
consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Dear Members

Wish you all a =
very happy new year.

I had a few questions to people who use wood for homa=
. Sometimes the 
wood bursts in the fire with a loud crack. Is it because o=
f trapped 
air in teh wood? If so, is there anything that can be done to re=
duce 
this cracking. 

Sometimes I have seen people offering pieces of clot=
h in fire during 
poornahuti. What does cloth indicate?

-Regards
Rajarshi
