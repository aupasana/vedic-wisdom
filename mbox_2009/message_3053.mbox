 Has God any form? Or is He formless? God is both with and without form and=

yet transcends both. He alone can say what else He is. God with form and G=
od
without form are like ice and water.

When water freezes into ice it has=
 form. When the same ice is melted into
water, all form is lost. God with f=
orm and without form arc not two
different beings. He who is with form is a=
lso without form.

To a devotee, the worshipper of a Personal God,He manife=
sts Himself in
various forms. Just think of a shoreless ocean=97 an infinit=
e expanse of
water=97no land visible in any direction! Only here and there =
are visible
blocks of ice formed by the intense cold, similarly under the i=
ntensifying
influence of the deep devotion of His worshipper,the Infinite r=
educes
Himself, as it were, into the Finite and appears before him as a Bei=
ng with
form.

Again, as on the appearance of the sun the ice melts away, s=
o with the
awakening of knowledge, God with form melts away into the Formle=
ss, The
water of the ocean, when viewed from a distance, appears to have a =
dark-blue
colour, but becomes colourless when taken in the hand; in the sam=
e way God
is also associated with a definite colour and complexion from a d=
istance,but
He is the attribute-less Truth when the devotee merges in Him.
