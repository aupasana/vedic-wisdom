Namaste Shri. Balasubramanian,

One more reason for this is the fact that t=
he deities whom we invoke are ethereal beings and eat with their nose (smel=
l). They don't eat with the mouth as we do, and they have a powerful sense =
of smell and can detect the menses, which irritates them causing them to go=
, which obviously defeats the purpose of inviting/invoking them! This is al=
so the reason why we were told not to smell the prasad before offering, as =
this would be akin to soiling it.


However, it is not clear why menses (ap=
art from the toxicity of it you just mentioned) is treated differently as o=
pposed to someone who lets say travelled long distance and is sweaty and sm=
elly. 

Thanks
Narayan
