Namaste,

["When I am in Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus,=

anything I say about the "experience" of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually
th=
e observation of an I-ness as it is being torn down or being
reconstructed,=
 i.e. just before or after Nirvikalpa samadhi but not
*during* it."]


To m=
e, that was a superb statement because it cleared confusion
surrounding exp=
eriences of Nirvikalpa samadhi.

Thank you very much for the same.

Best Re=
gards,

Utpal

Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to =
me: "When I am in
Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anythin=

his statement is perfect. However, one
who is not at Buddha's wavelength ca=
n easily misunderstand it. If an
observer exists and observes "void", that =
is different. What we are
talking about here is the absence of observer, i.=
e. merging of observer,
observed and the act of observing into one, without=
 ANY distinction
whatsoever between them. Is "void" the right word to descr=
ibe that state
or is "everything" the right word? Is there a good way to de=
scribe it?
Problem is that the word "void" may make people imagine a scenar=
io where
there is an observer, but a void to observe.

When=C2 we say that we enter t=
he middle of the diamond, when duality is
no more, then how can it=C2 be ex=
perienced differently by different
people? Shouldn't it be=C2  the same? I =
thought, whichever face of teh
diamond you chose as your entry point, the m=
iddle of teh diamond should
feel and look exactly similar. Please correct m=
e if I am wrong in my
understanding.=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual g=
aints have spoken
differently of their realizations. If duality itself does=
 not exist,
then how can the field of possiblity at all arise? Which means,=
 how can
there be a difference in the "perception" of the same One final Tr=
uth?

trans=

at all be=C2 described from within the field of
duality? Then I wonder why =
these three people - saints of highest order

descriptions are from within duality...
