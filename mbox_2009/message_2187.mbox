Namaste,

I would also like to add that  I was able to reduce the time by p=
racticing it regularly and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Pr=
akash Kaushik's Durga Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awe=
some, has a great voice, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can =
pause and repeat it. I tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a b=
it fast for my liking.

It is important for beginners, to know how to chant=
 in a rhythm, the sandhi's and especially some complicated words.

Hope thi=
s helps.

Regards
Narayan
