pranam!

i have been performing the abbreviated homam for more than a month=
 now. today i became a little conscious abt. certain things i was doing and=
 thought i will take the opinion of the forum members / narasimhaji.

is it=
 ok to touch the burning pieces in the homam with tongs to ensure that the =
offering burns properly? today i got a little caught up in this and therefo=
re want a second opinion.

there are days when the mantra is strong. but to=
day i found i was more concerned about burning all the pieces properly. i w=
anted the fire to be strong and roaring so that everything became ashes. bu=
t then this was at the expense of the meditation and the mantras.

secondly=
, i have a fetish to wash everything thoroughly after performing the homam.=
 i scrub away all the dark spots in the kund. somehow, i feel i am cleaning=
 my own insides while doing this. other things also have to be washed and k=
ept aside for the next day's homam. was thinking whether this was becoming =
a fetish or something...like the lady macbeth syndrome!

thirdly, as i ment=
ioned when i started with the practices, i did not know which deity i shoul=
d recite the mantra to / think of while doing the homam. i liked maha mrity=
unjaya mantra but then switched to Ganapati mantra on the advice of Narasim=
haji. i want to continue with this till i develop a deeper relationship wit=
h ganapati. however, which other ganapati mantras (besides "Om Gam Ganapati=
 Namah) should i recite if i want internal obstacles on the path of spiritu=
ality to be dissolved?

Thankyou.
