Dear Shri. Narasimha,
    I was giving an explanation from my understanding=
, but it was still at my mental level. The actions of an englightened maste=
r established in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concept=
s of how things should be. 

 For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of =
the highest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Ma=
thura instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself year=
s later would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a=
 satisfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?

Sri Aurob=
indo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: If Krish=
na were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in itself!=
 An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more com=
plete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the orig=
inal to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.

Another instance that co=
mes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big=
 nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity. Sri Rama=
na was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intellectually argue th=
at it was his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates from the thieves. 

=
Besides, there were certain things that I did not want to put in an public =
email. 

Some clues - AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditati=
ng and doing sudarhsn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There we=
re several threats from certain militants from one community about planting=
 bombs or disrupting it in other ways police security provided was not suff=
icient for that sized gathering.

The concerned debate where lot of SIMI me=
mbers were among the participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 200=
6.

Some people believe Sri Sri's presence in the event changed the heart o=
f some miscreants.

Many does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings =
with the future head of state of a superpower few minutes before the meetin=
g was to happen. Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained=
 logically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty =
about an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot cont=
ain them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is mu=
ch higher.

As the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental under=
standing, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. 

I do not expect=
 my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said everything I h=
ad to say. 

In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to gi=
ve an intellectual explanation for something that I myself have not yet int=
ellectually understood.

I did want to object to some statements saying Sri=
 Sri did not know what do say or was confused. It was a judgement of those =
without any knowledge or understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does=
 not understand Sri Krishna might judge him differently for several of His =
acts which could not be intellectually explained. Having observed him in pe=
rson with questions several times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can =
confidently say that it was not true. 

Best regards, 
-Siva.

In fact, this is a question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than th=

 without anybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in variou=

 and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inn=
