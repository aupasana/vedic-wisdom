Dear Samir,
=A0
You are very correct. Infact it was from one writing of Sri=
 Aurobindo that I first got an idea that even a wrong pressence can come in=
to an idol, though I am yet to recoincile it to the understanding I have ab=
out methods of worship. He goes to mention that many of the Kali idols ofte=
n have a presence created by the worshipper which is Kali without being div=
ine at all, a grotesque formation out of fear and other negative emotions o=
f the worshipper. Such a being is of no help, and should not be worshipped.=
 The actualy Mahakali, Aurobindo says, is splendid golden in color as he sa=
w it. He said it is also becuase of wrong pranpratistha and priests who do =
not know how to do it etc.
=A0
=A0
I find this information difficult to und=
erstand yet. I mean, if I am calling to Kali or any deity, is it not going =
to Kali - the divine one? What does it matter how the pranpratistha has bee=
n done, if I am using the name Kali to address my prayers. There is only on=
e who is Kali, and when I pray with Her name,=A0I feel it should always go =
to that One. How can it reach any other being at all? 
=A0
Now imagine some=
one gets an image of Kali and prays to it with fear, insecurities etc and o=
ther negative emotional qualities, I can understand that these emotions - w=
hich are eventually an energy - may get lodged into the idol. But what powe=
r does that mass of emotion have? In my view nothing. Neither good not bad.=
 Now say another person comes infornt of the idol and bows down and says a =
prayer to Kali, where is that going to reach? I believe - logically - it sh=
ould reach=A0the real Kali wherever She maybe and idol will, even though it=
 has negative emtions=A0lodged in it,=A0will only play the part of symbol t=
hat makes one remember Kaali. 
=A0
This is how I look at it logically. If I=
 am wrong, I would like to get corrected.
=A0
-Regards

Namaste Rajarshi,

Your question reminds me of something =
the Mother (Sri Aurobindo) said on
this subject during one of her talks wit=
h aspirants - I cannot remember
where exactly but will try to find it later=
.

Mother said that many temples today are filled with the negative energy
=
of asuric beings from the lower planes, many of which are capable of
causin=
g harm to people.

The reason, she said, is that many people today visit te=
mples seeking
fulfilment of short-term, material desires (wealth, health, m=
arriage,
children etc). They perform rituals and make offerings while harbo=
uring
such desires. Such tamasic and rajasic sentiments attract
ill-intenti=
oned beings from the vital plane to the place of worship.

Therefore she sa=
id that one should be cautious about which temples one
visits, especially i=
f one is weak and susceptible to negative energies.
And when one does visit=
, one should try one's hardest to do so with the
spirit of complete surrend=
er to *whatever* Divine presence is there (and
without seeking to fulfil pe=
tty desires).

So it may be that there is a risk.

Best regards,

Samir
