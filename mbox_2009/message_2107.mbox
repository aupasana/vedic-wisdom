Namaste

1)While doing homam can we move the coconut pieces that are there =
in the havan kund, so that they get burned easily.
i asked it becoz would i=
t be right to poke in the fire with a stick while we are actually assuming =
Ganpati is in that fire and the idol at that time.

2)Almost every time som=
e pieces are left  unburnt, so i do not remove the remains from the kund an=
d next time use it as it is and add fresh pieces of coconut.Is it fine??
