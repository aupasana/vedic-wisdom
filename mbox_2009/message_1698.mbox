Namaste friends,
 
Thanks to the efforts of Ravi Poruri and Kishore Chitrap=
u, we now have Mahagnapathi homam manual and Shiva homam manual available w=
ith mantras written in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam scripts (in addition t=
o Sanskrit and English scripts). The instructions and explanations continue=
 to be in English, but the mantras are written in these languages for ease =
of reading.
 
We have also made available a quick reference guide (or "chea=
t sheet") containing only mantras and no instructions. If you already read =
the manual and feel comfortable with the procedure and only want a printout=
 of mantras to refer to, you can download it and use it. It is also availab=
le for Mahaganapathi homam and Shiva homam in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, S=
anskrit and English scripts.
 
Just go to the homam website below and go to=
 Mahaganapathi homam or Shiva homam link to download these additions.
 
Oth=
er homam manuals will also be available in this format soon. Ravi and Kisho=
re are slowly working on one manual after another.
 
Baraha software from b=
araha.com was used for Indian languages (big thanks to them!). They have Ve=
dic swaras available only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If you want the=
 manual in any other Indian language, please send a nice note requesting th=
e friendly developers of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in that lang=
uage. As they add this support in other languages, we will create more homa=
m manuals.
 
In the long run, I want manuals to be fully translated to vari=
ous Indian languages, i.e. instructions and explanations also in Telugu, Ka=
nnada, Malayalam etc. But that may take a long time.
 
Best regards,
Narasi=
mha
