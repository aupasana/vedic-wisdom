Dear Ravi garu, Hari ji, Utpal Bhai,
Namaskar.
Thank you all from the botto=
m of my heart.
Utpal Bhai had offered to send a Homa Kundam by courier.My d=
eepest gratitude that cannot be put into words.
I am deeply indebted to all=
 of you for your support. 
Yesterday I=C2=A0approached another shop here an=
d to my surprise they had a wide variety of sizes in copper and the shop in=
formed me that they were seamless, so non leaking and had been specially br=
ought in a few=C2=A0days back.
He even offered to give me a special price!!=
!!=C2=A0As I could not measure them he gave me two of them so that I could =
do it at home and return the other.
I am still stunned and so humbled... Ho=
w She does look after Her children!!!!
Such a disoriented lot like me, clut=
ching at straws of Grace from her, for they are firm tassels which once cau=
ght can never let us go=C2=A0astray or leave us=C2=A0floundering.

And my g=
reatest regards to Sri Narasimha Garu for the opportunity and self-less ded=
ication in bringing the Homam to each of us.

May you all be Blessed by The=
 Divine Mother,

Nalini


=C2=A0

Namaste Nalini and Hari,
=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I agree with Hari. Starting off with G=
anapathi Homam is definitely better. The procedure is short and it helps on=
e practice the fire management, the mantras, the swaras and the whole nine =
yards. Moreover, the Chandi Homam Manual by itself is not self-sufficient. =
It relies on Ganapathi Homam manual. So, you have to go back and forth betw=
een the 2 manuals to perform Chandi Homam which can be done but gets little=
 bit tricky in the beginning. So, get comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam =
procedure.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 After you feel comfor=
table with the Ganapathi Homam procedure, while continuing to do Ganapathi =
Homam daily, you can actually do Chandi Homam occasionally on certain days =
say weekends, or on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdasi which are especially aus=
picious for Chandipath/Chandi Homam. When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip =
your Ganapathi Homam for that day. After doing this for few months or when =
you feel you are comfortable with the Chandi Homam, finally settle down wit=
h it.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 It's getting close to an y=
ear since I did my first Chandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding =
me with fire management and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my=
 pronunciation and all. I used to do it over weekends, which for me was tak=
ing about 3- 3 1/2hrs initially, owing to my poor Telugu reading skills. Th=
en, slowly switched to daily after the whole process started taking about 2=
 hrs. While still, I am not perfect, I continue to practice. On this note, =
I am reminded of Narayan.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The id=
ea of writing a Maha Ganapathi Homam manual started off as Narayan asked Na=
rasimha to help him out with the Homam Procedure. (Narayan's own inspiring =
message in this regard can be read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=
- wisdom/message/ 727). After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed =
the first copy to Narayan. Such was Narayan's dedication that he started go=
ing through the manual over and over. A few days later I met Narayan and en=
quired about the Homam manual and all. He very casually mentioned that he w=
as doing the Homam mentally. I was dumbstruck. I said "What?". He said he w=
ould perform the whole procedure as mentioned in the document, IN MIND. Ima=
gining taking the vow, imagining Agni pratishtapana, imagining invoking Gan=
esha, imagining offering ahutis, everything, start to finish in mind. I was=
 really bowled over by his creative thinking. That is how Narayan practiced=
. Later, Narasimhaji gifted us Homa Kundam and
 we started our Homas. After=
 few months passed by and I had to go on couple of trips where I could not =
carry my Homa Kundam and all the samagri. I implemented Narayan's idea and =
did my homam mentally for those few days. It then helped me avoid that feel=
ing that I missed my homam. Though this process is not a replacement for th=
e Homam with all the physical materials, yet, it is a form of a prayer to G=
od. Something is better than nothing.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 Naliniji, She has already decided when you would start the Homam, it=
's just that we have not been informed yet. 
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 I wish you all the very best.

Best Regards
Ravi

Dear Nalini, namaste



...thought I should probably start with G=
anapati Homam and=C2=A0wondered if I also start Chandi homam...=C2=A0




{=
Hari} I also had similar thoughts like you but I think that starting with G=
anesha homam is better and then one can 'graduate' to Chandi homam.

=C2=A0=

Sadly, when I enquired locally (New Zealand) at the Indian shops I could n=
ot find Homa Kundam...



{Hari} Why not try to purchase it from rediff.com=
? A small copper homa kundam will cost around Rs 150 or so. Additionally yo=
u could ask the priest at the local temples there...I am sure they will gui=
de you.=C2=A0

After the first attempt to do Ganesha homam on 26 January, I=
 did the homa again last Sunday and this time, it worked out fine. =C2=A0

=
best regards
Hari
