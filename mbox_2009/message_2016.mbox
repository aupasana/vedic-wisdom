Namaste,
 
Aurobindo need not be talking about a single "savior" the way pe=
ople may imagine. Also, he need not be talking about somebody "connected to=
" his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are connecti=
ons between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister N=
ivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when =
he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Viv=
ekananda, just a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo =
some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sa=
nskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Rama=
krishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his =
knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.=

 
Coming back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of=
 earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying so=
me attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one =
of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth =
by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some po=
sitive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus=
 a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few imp=
ortant souls to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or =
yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to f=
ulfil different parts of a divine play.
 
You may then see several (not jus=
t one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings born on eart=
h to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of the=
m will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, based on wh=
at their part in the play is.
 
*        *        *
 
The "Asura of Falseho=
od" that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he m=
anifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he m=
anifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.
 
One should not tolerate t=
his Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura o=
r those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand=
 for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that ne=
eds to be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job assigned to o=
ne by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and wit=
h unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.

I know very little. But I was told that an age that=
 is somewhat like the bygone ages will be established on earth for a few hu=
ndred years in the coming decades. The reason the Divine Mother appeared be=
fore Manish and asked him to spread simple homam procedures in the world wa=
s to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also told me that all this is the=
 play of a senior maharshi.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

                Namaste

  =
              I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writi=
ng. I am posting it here for anyone interested.

                Near the b=
eginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage=
, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed befo=
re. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a =
new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manife=
st right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Ear=
th life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth expe=
rienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her materia=
l body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
                =EF=BF=BD
  =
              Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French m=
ystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they e=
mbarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very rele=
vant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.
                =EF=BF=BD=

                Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matt=
er, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process=
 of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The=
 process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called e=
volution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where th=
ese two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he f=
oresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=
=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely c=
hange everything on Earth.
                =EF=BF=BD
                Man=EF=
=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he =
makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom ac=
tive in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstr=
ucted from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is=
 a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses se=
ems to contradict it.

                Sri Aurobindo recognized that humank=
ind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in wh=
ich the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left=
 hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhil=
e, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher=
 than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recent=
ly been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our ta=
sk now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.

                Ev=
olution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with =
the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward,=
 even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri=
 Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon =
be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDan=
imal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an in=
dividualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with =
it.
                =EF=BF=BD
                Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman hu=
man,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous-ly coming to birth under the in=
fluence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely abl=
e to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness.=
 

                Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still=
 inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Li=
ght, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellul=
ar consciousness. 

                Finally, our ultimate goal as a species=
 is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully with=
in the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =
=EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter a=
nd spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

                The great wo=
rk of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousnes=
s down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a=
 unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was s=
imultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awa=
iting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collec=
tive matter.
                Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD =
there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of th=
eir experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-div=
ine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the=
 Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These =
are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in cont=
rol of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Luci=
fer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Sufferin=
g has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak =
havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=
=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own=
 intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficul=
t to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the =
current political sphere.

                With the descent of this new vib=
ratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolish=
ed. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be eno=
rmous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automa=
tically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of False=
hood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization=
 which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle=
 and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original e=
manations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to specu=
late, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might ha=
ve experienced if not for this power of harmonization!

                Whe=
n does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the worl=
d stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. T=
he Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty =
now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDa=
lthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year=
 2000 would be a turning point.

                This was a very interestin=
g read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.=

        <DIV>Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian 
     =
           freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a=
 
                truth which had not been expressed before. In his high st=
ates of 
                divine union he saw that the time had come for a n=
ew stage in 
                the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divi=
ne was to manifest 
                right here on Earth and that the time f=
or this divine emergence 
                into Earth life was now. He spoke=
 of heaven descending to Earth, 
                even as Earth experienced =
a breakdown due to the intrinsic 
                resistance held within he=
r material body towards this 
                =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<BR=
>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, 
                Ind=
ia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known 
            =
    as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive 
      =
          cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal 
  =
              uncertainties we face today.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo sa=
w that the 
                divine force permeates all matter, and that all=
 matter therefore 
                has a force of consciousness. The proces=
s of the divine spirit 
                descending down into matter is call=
ed involution. The process by 
                which the divine ascends bac=
k upwards out of matter is called 
                evolution. According to =
Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a 
                stage where these tw=
o events are occurring simultaneously, and 
                in his inner vi=
sions, he foresaw that we would soon be 
                experiencing a des=
cent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or 
                monadic) c=

     Earth.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, s=
ays Sri 
                Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immor=
tal soul is 
                somewhere within him, even if seldom active in=
 most people, 
                while an eternal spirit overshadows him, eve=
n if obstructed from 
                descent by the hard lid of his constr=
ucted personality. There is 
                a great divine plan in motion,=
 even if the evidence of the outer 
                senses seems to contrad=
ict it.</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT><BR>S=
ri Aurobindo recognized 
                that humankind is going through an=
 evolutionary crisis. A stage 
                has been reached in which th=
e human mind has made tremendous 
                strides on the one hand, =
but is left hopelessly inadequate to 
                prevent its own extin=
ction as a species. Meanwhile, as the 
                Mother testified bef=
ore her death in 1973, a consciousness 
                higher than the hum=
an rational mind, what may be termed the 
                Supermind, has re=
cently been established in the fields of the 
                Earth, and is=
 active there. Our task now is to bring it down 
                into cellu=
lar consciousness.<BR></DIV>
                <DIV>Evolution took a great le=
ap forward with the origins of 
                Life, and later with the em=
ergence of Mind. We are now at the 
                threshold of another le=
ap forward, even more momentous, as we 
                prepare for the eme=
rgence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks 
                about four s=
tages of human evolution, which we will soon be 
                starting t=
o experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is 
                =EF=BF=
=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing =

                an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contac=
ting 
                and merging with it.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Next is the =EF=
=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a 
                species that is spontaneous-=
ly coming to birth under the 
                influence of an ever-expandin=
g supramental field, a being that 
                is largely able to merge=
 and live from soul-consciousness rather 
                than mind-conscio=
usness. </DIV>

                <DIV>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who=
 will still inhabit a dense 
                physical body, but will be in =
possession of the Mind of Light, 
                which is supramental cons=

                <DIV>The great work=
 of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in 
                bringing suprament=
al consciousness down into the cellular 
                consciousness of t=
heir own bodies. Since this is a unified 
                consciousness, th=
is meant that the supramental consciousness was 
                simultaneo=
usly being brought into the consciousness fields of 
                the Ea=
rth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its 
                ful=
l manifestation in collective matter.<BR>Whenever there is a 
             =
   =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobin=
do and 
                the Mother speak of their experience with the four =
=EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD 
                essentially anti-divine forces, =
at work in the world today. 
                There is the Asura of Darkness=
, the Asura of Suffering, The 
                Asura of Falsehood, and the =
Asura of Death. These are the forces 
                that are so outwardly=
 apparent, and which seem to be in control 
                of current glob=
al events. According to them the Asura of 
                Darkness (Lucife=
r?) has gone through a transformation recently, 
                and the As=
ura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only 
                the l=
atter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. 
                Interestin=

   =
             through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive=
 
                inner work in countering his influence. It would not be

                difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=
er

                <DIV>With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness=
 all 
                our old obsolete human structures will be demolished.=
 However, 
                Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the chang=
es will be 
                enormous they would not be necessarily catastro=
phic. The power 
                of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, a=
nd our world for the 
                most part consists of Falsehood. Yet,=
 the Supramental, he 
                maintained, carried a power of harmon=
ization which could 
                overcome this resistance by means othe=
r than dramatic struggle 
                and violence. The Asuras will eve=
ntually be absorbed into their 
                original emanations of Ligh=
t, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be 
                interesting to specu=
late, with all the violence in the world 
                today, the destru=
ction we might have experienced if not for this 
                power of h=
armonization!<BR></DIV>
                <DIV><U>When does all this happen? =
Sri Aurobindo and the Mother 
                believed that the world stage=
 was set for this quantum descent, 
                and that it was quite i=
mminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the 
                supramental tran=
sformation was a certainty now, and that it 
                would come abo=
ut with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this
