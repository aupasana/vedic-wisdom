Hello PVR gaaru:

I have couple of dumb questions; please don't laugh get a=
 chance can 
you please clarify the same for me, hope I'm not misusing the =
group 
with my silly questions:

1.	Will there be any effect of playing Aud=
io Mantras read/rendered 
by experts? (as layman like me, who do not know h=
ow to pronounce the 
Sanskrit mantras correctly, is it OK to take help of t=
he CD's or Audio 
MP3 mantras available?).
2.	You have provided Audio and V=
ideo of Ganapathi Homam, will 
there be the same effect if one plays and mi=
mic (imitating the actions 
without any self voice and your original voice =
in place)?
3.	If the answers to the above is `Yes', who will get benefitted=
 
(I mean will I get benefited or the originators who rendered the 
mantras=
 or performed Homam?)

Thanks,

CVRKumar
