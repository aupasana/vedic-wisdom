Namaste RawalSaheb

The website is www.shreemaa.org,

Mother has an ashram =
in Napa Valley California, beautiful place, 
Strong Sattvic Vibrations, she=
 is very down to earth, always joyful.
The ashram is on a small hill. They =
also conduct online classes and 
you can view their ashram as they have web=
cams.

She in this life considers Shri Ramakrishna Paramhans as her guru an=
d 
had visions of him from a very early stage. Her biograpghy has many 
det=
ails.

Her web site has all the information about the books.
I consider the=
 books from them a gold standard in presentation, 
quality and content.

I =
use their books for all/any pooja I do like Satyanarayan vrath 
katha, Shiv=
 Pooja, Laxmi Pooji, Chandi Paath, Hanuman Pooja etc.

By the way Sant Shre=
e Mota was a realized soul, I know very little of 
him, except that he was =
a great saint.

Best Regards
Mitesh
