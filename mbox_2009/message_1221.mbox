Namaste,

for long it has been a most favourite mantra for me. Whenever i 
=
found somebody struggeling with life & death, i have used this 
mantra. I k=
now 2 specific cases for whom i recited this mantra, one 
was a cancer pati=
ent and other was in very critical condition due to 
grave bike-truck accid=
ent. i am happy to note that both are alive. 
(its not that because of my r=
ecitation-;)
i've a faith in this mantra and instinctively recite when some=
body 
is in serious physical trouble.

I recite "bandhanaat" -

By the way,=
 shri Sanjay rath has given a meaning in his book on 
vedic remedies.

wish=
 you all a very happy Ramkrishna Birth day (english date wise)

Warm Regard=
s,

Utpal
