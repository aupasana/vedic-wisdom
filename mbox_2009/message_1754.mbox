Dear Narasimhaji,
 Thank you very much for your reply. It makes a lot of se=
nse to me. And exactly as you say, Shiva is correct for me (from an astrolo=
gy point of view). Sun is the only planet in 12th from Karakamsa in Navamsa=
.

 After doing the homam a few times, I now quite clearly understand that =
it is truly an accelerated form of sadhana. Your selfless effort in clearly=
 explaining it is much appreciated..

 Thank you,

Sundeep

This applies to all sadhanas of ugra devatas and not just homam, but homam =

In homam, you are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you a=

all people irrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery=
 signs/planets in their horoscope.

 burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water =
and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically i=
nherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who =
was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ances=
tor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts=
 due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the w=
eaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebir=
th to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness is attached to a new b=
ody, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your c=
onsciousness. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, =
while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very import=
ant sadhanas for spiritual progress.
>

ith Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology.
