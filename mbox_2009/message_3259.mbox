Dear Rajarshi,

I some how did not read your point no.2.

>Also, there is =
a line in there which equates women with animals or
>something similar. He =
believes that was introduces in the text >because
Tulasidas had a problem c=
ontrolling his own lust.

I do not think that Saint like 'Tulasi Das' would=
 ever be so hard on
women.

The actual poem is like this:

|| Dhol Ganwaar =
Shudra Pashu Naari, Yah sab Taadan ke adhikari ||

Some years back, i read =
an explanation that Tulasi Das ji meant "Pashu
Naari" and NOT pashu and Naa=
ri. It means He feels appropriate to punish
a Naari who is like pashu in he=
r characteristics. That really makes good
sense atleast to me.

About Lust =
in Tulasi das: It is well known that Tulasi Das was extremely
attached to h=
is wife so much that he won't allow her to go even at her
parental home for=
 a day. However he left the sansaara in a Flash.  in a
moment for ever. Tha=
t is a great vairaagya. almost like Sri Ramakrishna
used to give the exampl=
e of  a village Man to define the true vairaagya.

my 2 quick cent!

Best R=
egards,

Utpal

it comes to=C2 honestly.=C2 If someone were to put a gun to his he=
ad
and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C2 lie, like sun rises in
the=
 west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too!
He ha=
s actually never ever=C2 spoken even a single lie in his whole
life, big or=
 small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him
that Indian la=
nguages are richer than English, he believed his teacher.
Later someone els=
e told him English is more comprehensive language and
the world cannot do w=
ith it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought
himself two thick fat di=
ctionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten
years every day he spend one=
 hour reading the English dictionary and
> one hour reading the Hindi dicti=
onary apart from reading=C2 up
volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2 =
When I asked him why, he
just said it is because he wanted to be=C2 equally=
 adept at both the
languages so that one day he can take a really detached =
view to judge
the truth about=C2 which is more comprehensive language! As I=
 said, he
has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the t=
ruth
about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worke=
d
in different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not
=
last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English,
Benga=
li, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is
learning Tami=
l. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he
was in college, h=
e considered himself an atheist. While applying for a
job he had kept the p=
lace makered for religion as blank. When the clerk
who was supposed to take=
 the forms saw that blank space, he asked
> my friend's name. Hearing a Hin=
du name, the clerk wrote "Hindu".
Seeing this, my friend snatched the form =
from the clerk and tore it up
right there. Because, he considered himself a=

in the form would have been a lie.
> =C2

friends, whoeve=
r knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.
> =C2
> One day, long back, he was=
 going to office for some urgent meeting.
His way to office passed by a Kri=
shna temple. As he was passing by
in=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a str=
ange urge to go into the
temple. He says he still does not know why he went=
 inside the temple,
but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next =
when he sees his
watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge o=
f how the time
went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went=
 into the
temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time with=
out any
movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my fri=
end
had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in
d=
eep sleep.
> =C2
> Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2 =
that he got
visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infac=
t most
people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was i=
n
samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact
s=
ame place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2  Only his wife
and =
close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when
ever he s=
its for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When
someone asked=
 him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as
if the whole univ=
erse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the
stars, the planets, the=
 animals, men, women, children, the wind, the
water, the space, smaller tha=
n the atom and bigger than everything. It
cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=
 He considers Sri Krishna to be God
and=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.Th=
at is why he does not like the
Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevat=
ed Sri=C2 Rama to the
> level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=
ki Ramayana was to
show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The differen=
ce he says is
that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinar=
y man can
and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emul=
ated by
ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2 can try to lead=
 his
life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely
stat=
ing his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least,
and adv=
ises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say,
he is not =
an atheist any more.

Delhi and has a son as well.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Before I tell you an=
ything more=C2 about his spiritual life=C2 that I know, let me sa=
y=C2 line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him ab=
out two years back. What first attracted me to=C2  towards him was his=
 impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2 when it comes to=C2&nb=
sp;honestly.=C2 If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him t=
o just say a simple, harmless=C2 lie, like sun rises in the west, he w=
ould not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually =
never ever=C2 spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small=
. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian language=
s are richer than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told=
 him English is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it=
. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictiona=
ries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour =
reading the English dictionary and<BR>> one hour reading the Hindi dicti=
onary apart from reading=C2 up volumes of Hindi and English literature=
.=C2 When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=
=C2 equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a =
really detached view to judge the truth about=C2 which is more compreh=
ensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes=
 to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is math=
ematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to jo=
urnalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes flu=
ently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. No=
w he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When=
 he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a =
job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk who=
 was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked<BR>> my f=
riend's name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote "Hindu". Seeing this, m=
y friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Becau=
se, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would ha=
ve been a lie. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> So this gives a basic idea of the=
 man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama o=
f Kaliyuga.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> One day, long back, he was going to o=
ffice for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple=
. As he was passing by in=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange u=
rge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went insid=
e the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when h=
e sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how =
the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into =
the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without an=
y movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend ha=
d no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sl=
eep.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Then he started meditating at home, and it w=
as there=C2 that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much a=
bout these, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. =
But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation sea=
t, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2&nb=
sp; Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe n=
owadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samad=
hi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feel=
s as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the s=
tars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, =
the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be a=
ccurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C2 =
Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit M=
anas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2 Rama to the<BR>> level of=
 a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama=
 as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The difference he says is that, an idea=
l man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to=
 become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One c=
annot become Krishna, but one=C2 can try to lead his life like Rama. I=
 have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he =
does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not tru=
st most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.<B=
R>> =C2 <BR>> Later he had once=C2 mentioned he knew the re=
lation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother =
he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of=
 time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2&nb=
sp;with those in=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and=
 everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, et=
c etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be th=
e future of this country.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> He is am omnivorous per=
son. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.<BR>> =C2 <BR>>=
 I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked his permi=
ssion before mentioning him.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> -Regards<BR>> =C2=
