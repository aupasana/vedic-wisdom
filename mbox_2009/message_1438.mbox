Dear Utpal

Your talk will never hurt me..and you should not think that way=
.. you are telling what you feel right.. and i respect your feelings and yo=
u know that well.. sometimes truth is bitter to accept but then you donot h=
ave any choice except to accept it..

well I just shared what i felt.. that=
 day on fone also.. well one thing is for sure.. i feel that i am on the ri=
ght path..and i am with the right people.. thanks to narsimhaji.. and i wou=
ld thank you first.. because of you i got in to this site.. i know i am lac=
king so much.. i am not trying to become modest here.. but yeah i will have=
 to work very very hard to be in this line..it reminds me one very good duh=
a of KABIRJI

JAB "MEIN" THA TAB TU NAHI.. AB TU HEIN "MEIN" NAHI
PREM GALI=
 ATI SANKARI.. JAA MEIN DO NA SAMAI

Here in this, kabirji had nicely said =
"MEIN" i.e our ego is our enemy.. and if you have ego in you, you will neve=
r be able to reach to god. as road to god is so narrow..=A0 one person only=
 can walk on that road.. two cannot accomodate in it. you have to remove yo=
ur ego from you..then only you can walk on that road which would take you t=
o god..this is difficult sadhna.. and we all are working very hard for this=
 only. but everybody is having different karmas and different sadhnas.. but=
 each one has one goal and that is to reach to god.. this reminds me one mo=
re dua of sant KABIRJI

KABIR KUVA EK HEIN.. PANIHARI ANEK
BARTAN SABKE NYA=
ARE NYAARE.. PANI SABMEIN EK

you also said it correct to fight selflishnes=
s or achive desirelessness is not easy.. but then after doing homam also i =
get this desires..so i was thinking that what is the use of doing homam if =
i cannot control my desires? i also know this fact that i would not get in =
life what i have desired for.. i will get what i deserves.. 

i just tried =
to analyse my feelings.. and i tried to be true to myself..i think that is =
very difficult.. and now most difficult things has become easy for me..than=
k you and narsimhaji for that..

regards,

rajesh

            Dear Raju,



>I am a normal humanbeing.. and desires=
 are thre in me.. 



i hope i haven't hert you. i didn't write with the in=
tention to belittle you or giving a theoritical lecture. if my message has =
given that feeling or it has created any feeling of complex or guilt in you=
,then i am sorry.



most are not vignani here. you and me included. yester=
day i recited durga saptashati where in i was never in to it mentally. my m=
ind was wandering in my professional and other matters.... do you remember =
'SO WHAT and SOHAM'? to kya hua? Jaisi Maa ki Ichchha.



my main point to =
convey you and others is that we have to start at some point in our life to=
 struggle for Truth. till now we were living and praying to god only for ge=
tting some thing or the other like money, flat, luxuries, good marks in exa=
ms, acadamic degree, fame, respect, importance, wife, children, their comfo=
rt, our comfort,career growth and infinite things. if we honestly judge, mo=
st of us have never loved god in real sense. it was mostly bagging for our =
maintanance of body and ego. Now i am sure that when one starts struggle fo=
r truth, it will be a real fierce struggle which will test one to the core.=
 one might cry, feel frustrated, agitated, helpless, fallen, ruined, elated=
 during this period. to fight selfishness and achieve desirelessness is NO =
easy thing. 



I am very happy that you have now started doing Homa every =
day. please forget about the feelings during Homam and after that. let it c=
ome and go. the other day you called me from Mumbai. i could feel your hapi=
ness from you voice.



thanks to our dear Guruji Shri PVR Narasimha Rao Ga=
ru for the begining of bringing this change for us.



Regardlessly Yours,
=



Utpal

<br>
my main point to convey you and others is that we have to start a=

 praying to god only for getting some thing or the other like money, flat, =
luxuries, good marks in exams, acadamic degree, fame, respect, importance, =
wife, children, their comfort, our comfort,career growth and infinite thing=
s. if we honestly judge, most of us have never loved god in real sense. it =
was mostly bagging for our maintanance of body and ego. Now i am sure that =
when one starts struggle for truth, it will be a real fierce struggle which=
 will test one to the core. one might cry, feel frustrated, agitated, helpl=
ess, fallen, ruined, elated during this period. to fight selfishness and ac=
hieve desirelessness is NO easy thing. <br>
<br>
I am very happy that you h=
ave now started doing Homa every day. please forget about the feelings duri=

 our narasimha said, refrain from giving if you know before that it will be=
 misused. It is ideal NOT TO feel that you are giving or helping or favouri=
