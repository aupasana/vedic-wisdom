Hello,
-----Even the middle of a busy road in India is better 
for meditati=
ng than a temple in USA.---

You know all these meditating people will pack=
 their bags for India=C2=A0 and sit there=C2=A0 in middle of road. It is al=
ready very busy all the time and it will make matters worse.lol

So there i=
s no sattwa in Temples in America What will the Presiding Deities of those =
temples will think?

My English is not good.
=C2=A0For me a idol is a man m=
ade lifeless object which can be any where. A Deity is a Supernatural force=
 which comes and reside in a idol after we have done proper puja for PranaP=
ratista.etc. Then that idol not a lifeless object. It is our Sri Thakurji o=
r Sri Mother and their body is Sri Vigrah.

So when we are talking about a =
idol in a temple, are we saying things about idol of stone or metal or othe=
r objects or we talking about Divine Beings who are there.

So in Dakshines=
hwar Temple idol is alive but idol is not so alive in Kallighat Temple. Are=
 these two different Divine Beings, Two different Mothers. One which gives =
spiritual bliss and the other could not care less.

I have never been to Ca=
lcutta but I suppose Main Temple is Kallighat and many more people go there=
 then the other one
. There has been a very large population growth. There =
are millions and millions more humans. They need jobs and good education an=
d many necessary everyday things. And these are also Spiritual things for t=
hem. They go to Temple and Mother is listening to them. She might not have =
time for us to show spiritual vision. So what? It does not make that place =
or HER less spiritual.
There might be several other things which we may not=
 understand if we do not get some spiritual experience
There is the very fi=
rst Temple of Iskcon=C2=A0 in London and I have been there hundreds of time=
. Some years back Divine Mother stopped me going there. I do not know the r=
eason. Thousands of people go there all the time and it is very good for th=
em.But I cannot say that it is less spiritual because I am not allowed to g=
o there.

I was composing this letter and then saw your todays letter about=
 spiritual energy at kallighat temple. Again I have never been to US but I =
am sure there is sattwa in temples as well.=C2=A0 Personally I think we nee=
d the Grace of Divine Mother to get her Light.

Perhaps I should=C2=A0 not =
have=C2=A0 written this mail. Anyway you take care now.

Namaste,

If an incense stick with intense smell was b=
urnt in 
a place, the air there will be filled with that smell long after t=
he stick 
completely burns. However, eventually the smell will be gone! How=
 long it takes 
to disappear depends on how strong the smell was when the s=
tick was 
burnt.
=C2=A0
Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place,=
 
the air there will be filled with that saint's spiritual energy. Even aft=
er the 
saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy wil=
l linger 
there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.
=C2=A0
In many famo=
us temples these days, priests have 
become commercial and do not have the =
devotion needed. The rituals performed 
every few years to re-energize the =
idols 
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
It is my humble opinion that some famo=
us temples do 
not have much divine presence today, though I do not want to=
 name any names. At 
the same time, some not-so-well-known temples seem to =
have a powerful divine 
presence.
=C2=A0
I was very impressed with the=C2=
=A0Krishna temple 
in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills i=
n Gujarat and 
Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's place=
). There is a 
tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There=
 are several temples 
where the idol is practically alive. For example, eve=
n 123 years after 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshine=
shwar is "alive". I did 
not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat=
 temple which is also in 
Calcutta.
=C2=A0
There was one small temple in Ta=
mil Nadu that I was 
taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 tem=
ples all over Tamil Nadu 
before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai i=
n 2006. I never heard of that 
temple before and it seemed like a small tem=
ple. The name of the=C2=A0form of 
the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was=
 a Tamil language name and I did not 
understand it. I do not even remember=
 the name now. But, when I closed my eyes 
and started meditating with my m=
antra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a 
vision of a very fierce god=
dess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt 
that there was a powerfu=
l presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the 
name of the place o=
r the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the 
goddess. They trie=
d to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof 
came down in a =
fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess 
likes op=
en air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I 
was =
very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the 
=
name of the temple and goddess.
=C2=A0
Like this, I am sure there are many =
temples with a 
powerful divine presence across India.
=C2=A0
Apart from th=
e Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one 
of my best experiences when meditatin=
g was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at 
Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that J=
naneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the 
underground chamber there.
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Even the middle of a busy road in India is b=
etter 
for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so =
filled with 
rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a g=
ood amount of 
sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place=
 to meditate, but my 
view is that there is not much left at *some* temples=
. But some temples are 
really good.
=C2=A0
If one has a chance to spend a =
few months doing 
spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:=

=C2=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east 
India, Kurtaalam=
, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and 
Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Ti=
rupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, 
Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar moun=
tains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan 
and Hrishikesh in nort=
h India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in 
central India.
=
=C2=A0
There are many other good places, but the above 
come to my mind. Vi=
siting a temple once is one thing and staying there for 
several months whi=
le maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual 
sadhana (like homa=
m or japam) there is quite another.
=C2=A0

      Respected Narsimhaji,
        

     =
   I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples 
      =
  etc) in today's time. Say, for example, how do you see going to Shirdi 
 =
       Temple and Shree Tirupati temple, as far as spiritual sadhana is 
  =
      concerned. Please share your views on this.

not have much divine presence today, though I do not want to name any nam=

the same time, some not-so-well-known temples seem to have a powerf=

presence.</font></div>

<div><font size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial">I was very impressed w=
ith the Krishna temple 
in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girn=
ar hills in Gujarat and 
Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Mahars=
hi's place). There is a 
tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those pla=
ces. There are several temples 
where the idol is practically alive. For ex=
ample, even 123 years after 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol a=
t Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did 
not get the same impression at the famou=
s Kalighat temple which is also in 
Calcutta.</font></div>

al">There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was 
taken to by a prie=
st who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu 
before we did=
 the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that 
temple b=
efore and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of 
the =
divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not 
u=
nderstand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my ey=
es 
and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzl=
ed by a 
vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like S=
un. I felt 
that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do n=
ot remember the 
name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple witho=
ut roof over the 
goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few =
times, but the roof 
came down in a fire accident each time and they finall=
y decided that the goddess 
likes open air and no roof. Though we spent onl=
y 5 min and left in a hurry, I 
was very pleased with that temple. Someone =
from Tamil Nadu probably knows the 
name of the temple and goddess.</font><=
