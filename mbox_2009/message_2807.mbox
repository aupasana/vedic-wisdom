Namaste,
 
If an incense stick with intense smell was burnt in a place, the=
 air there will be filled with that smell long after the stick completely b=
urns. However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disa=
ppear depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.
 
Simil=
arly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled=
 with that saint's spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place=
 or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becom=
es weak and disappears.
 
In many famous temples these days, priests have b=
ecome commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed=
 every few years to re-energize the idols 
 
*        *        *
 
It is my=
 humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine presence t=
oday, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so=
-well-known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.
 
I was very i=
mpressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), =
Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Mah=
arshi's place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those p=
laces. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For e=
xample, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol a=
t Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did not get the same impression at the famous=
 Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.
 
There was one small temple in=
 Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 t=
emples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai =
in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small tem=
ple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil la=
nguage name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name no=
w. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in fron=
t of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose fac=
e was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence ther=
e. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, b=
ut it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof o=
ver the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each=
 time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.=
 Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with th=
at temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple an=
d goddess.
 
Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful di=
vine presence across India.
 
Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar,=
 one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temp=
le at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditat=
ing in the underground chamber there.
 
*        *        *
 
Even the midd=
le of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. T=
hese western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas i=
n India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple i=
n India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not =
much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.
 
If one has=
 a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I su=
ggest the following:
 
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east In=
dia, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near=
 Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (J=
unagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India a=
nd Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.
 
There are many =
other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is=
 one thing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple =
lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quit=
e another.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
