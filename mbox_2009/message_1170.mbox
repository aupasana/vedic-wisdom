Dear Sir,
I also agree with this mail. I feel I have double minds. One is r=
eading Chandipath or doing Japam and other mind is thinking on various thou=
ghts. Is it possible that we have two minds at a time? Because when we thin=
k on other issues while reading Chandipath, the first mind reading Path is =
not at all stopped. Path is going on mentally.

Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar

Thank you for answer=
ing all my queries. I really have a nagging problem 
which others may be ex=
periencing at various intensities. 

Without fail, my mind thinks of a very=
 particular highly negative thought whenever I am 
doing Japa.
Often I try =
to negate it in my mind with the obvious result that my Japa gets destroyed=
.
I am paranoid about these bad thought coming true, especially as I am thi=
nking them 
while doing Japa. In my heart I definetly do not want them to m=
aterialize. How should I 
proceed? 

Please advise.

Thank you yet again.
