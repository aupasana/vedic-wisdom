Gauthama rejects to teach a boy a he is not a brahmin.
=C2=
=A0
This is incorrect. 
=C2=A0
The=C2=A0Chandogya Upanishad mentions this i=
ncident. The boy came to Gauthama Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked h=
im for his gotra. The boy goes back to his mother and finds out that his mo=
ther is not aware of who the father was. The boy comes back and says the sa=
me to Rishi Guathama, who says that he shall teach the boy as the boy belon=
gs to the gotra of truth, and thus by default is a Brahmana.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=
=E2=80=9CThereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a st=
udent. =E2=80=98Of what family are you, my lad?=E2=80=99 inquired the sage.=
 Satyakama replied: =E2=80=98I asked my mother what my family name was, and=
 she answered: =E2=80=9CI do not know. In my youth I was a servant and work=
ed in many places. I do not know who was your father. I am Jabala, and you =
are Satyakama. Call yourself Satyakama Jabala!=E2=80=9D I am therefore Saty=
akama Jabala, sir.=E2=80=99 Then said the sage: =E2=80=98None but a true Br=
ahmin would have spoken thus. Go and fetch fuel, for I will teach you. You =
have not swerved from the truth.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D (Chandogya Upanishad 4:4=
:3,4)
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
So that is one sure shot, explicit case, where a Rishi =
shows that the tag Brahmin is more by action than by birth.

If casts are de=

Parasurama identifies him as a kshatriya. Karna did not show any hunger for=
 power. He showed the qualities of a sudra/sevaka. The only kshatriya quali=
ty demonstrated by him is the liking for wars!

Gauthama rejects to teach a=
 boy a he is not a brahmin.
Rama killed a sudra (not sure if this was relia=
ble) for doing tapam. How do we justify all of these?

Also, Ravana is a br=
ahmin (Rama gets Brahmahatya patakam after killing Ravana) even as all he s=
howed is the huger for power and ego. He has learn vedas but, mere learning=
 does not make him a brahmana. Going by that, Karna acted like a brahmin an=
d learnt quite a few things from Parasurama. But, Parasurama calls him a ks=
hatriya and banishes him.

Drona was a brahmin, but he showed hatred and an=
ger not suitable for a brahmin (towards Drupada).

Best regards,
Vijay.

=E2=80=9CThereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a st=

 Satyakama replied: =E2=80=98I asked my mother what my family name was, and=
 she answered: =E2=80=9CI do not know. In my youth I was a servant and work=

are Satyakama. Call yourself Satyakama Jabala!=E2=80=9D I am therefore Saty=
