Namaste,

1. Yes. One can do homam as many times as one wants. It will give faster 
results if one maintains the same devotion and focus.

In general, if one has free time, it is better spent in activities that make 
one focus the mind on god (to the extent one is capable of) rather than in 
activities that make one focus the mind on impermanent things.

2. Do not worry about continuity. Forget a break of 7 days. Even if one does 
a sadhana in one life, leaves earth and is reborn after 700 years and 
continues the sadhana, there WILL be continuity. One may or may not perceive 
the continuity, but it will be there.

Do not worry about continuity and keep doing whenever you can. No effort is 
wasted.

3. It is fine to take the yantra with you and pray. But you should follow 
the opinion of the person who energized it for you, instead of my opinion.

Yes, it can be used in homam. You can put it next to homa kundam and invoke 
the deity in it. If one is ok with a yantra getting disfigured, one can even 
put in *inside* the homa kundam on the base of the homa kundam and leave it 
there.

Best regards,
Narasimha
