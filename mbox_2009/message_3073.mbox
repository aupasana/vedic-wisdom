Dear Siva,
 
Respectfully, I want to offer a different perspective.

One can "show the way to Realization of T=
ruth to those that are ready" without accepting to take part in a debate li=
ke that!

If one answers only when there is "sincerit=
y in the heart of the questioner", why would one then agree to debate a rut=
hless debater who is known to not have "sincerity in the heart" and who onl=
y wants to ruthlessly destroy the views of opponents? After all, opponent i=
n a debate is different from a "questioner" or a disciple seeking spiritual=
 direction.

If a yogi has such stature, one can do "justice to the topic" wit=
hout even taking part in the debate and just by being oneself.
 
*        *=
        *
 
When people of little or no understanding were debating Truth/G=
od and misleading the world, great teachers in the past stepped in and dire=
cted the debate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or recently Aa=
di Shankaracharya or Swami Vivekananda. They had the knack of steering the =
debate in a direction that they wanted - a direction that would help establ=
ish sanatana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and ignorance with "poli=
te words". They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the sword of detached,=
 and yet firm, actions.
 
Fighting with hatred or anger or agitation in the=
 heart is bad. But, fighting with a calm and equanimous mind is completely =
saattwik.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear 
Rajarshi,<BR>>    Very good question. In fact, this=
 is a 
question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that don=
t know him. 
In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is=
 it that somebody 
like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several =
scriptures, who is an 
authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization a=
nd learning, who recited the 
Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without=
 anybody teaching him, and who 
gives impromptu discourses in various forum=
s across the world on all topics 
under the sun shy away from explaining so=
me simple questions that are about his 
home turf?<BR>> <BR>> The ans=
wer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never 
debates on Truth! To him Trut=
h / God is not an article of debate. He can show 
the way to Realization of=
 Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in 
anything else. He =
answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of the 
questioner. Other=
wise he would say some polite words and let it pass, however 
big the occas=
ion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting 
were an=
swered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & 
discourses=
 year ago!<BR>> <BR>> One may ask why then did he go to this 
meeting=
 or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was something like "Concept 
=
of God in Hinduism and Islam". IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by "B=
EING" 
an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of dis=
cussion. 
Those that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would =
have benefited.

Sri Sri always practices "experience first and=

principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will =

people and Sri Sri will only say very =
simple things or share some simple jokes 
and laughs, but his presence woul=
d convey what needs to be conveyed for those 
that are receptive. A Master =
may not be interested in getting 100,000 people 
trading one mental concept=
 for another, but prefers one sincere person opening 
up to Truth in silenc=

debate. If you see the vedios of that debate that happened a
