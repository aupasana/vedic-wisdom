Dear Jitender,

I am a member of the Art of Living Foundation for about 4 y=
ears now. I have done almost all the courses (few many times over) and list=
ened to the spiritual discourses tapes by Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar.
I'm c=
urrently working on becoming a teacher/facilitator.

You can consider such =
spiritual organization(s) or groups as a Hand Rail while climbing the stair=
case. 
If its dark around you and you have no clue about how many steps the=
re are etc., - You can do it without holding on to anything, bump into some=
thing, etc., - or you can reach to hold the hand rail and go where it takes=
 you.
At some point you'll also have to let go the hand rail and continue y=
our path as well.

Art of Living gives you a set of tools and techniques to=
 help be yourself - open yourself to the world around you. Have a company o=
f good people, good sattwic practices, rich wisdom and knowledge, good tips=
 to a healthy body,mind and productive life.

Many people do get caught up =
in the course fees and doubts about where the money is being used/funneled =
etc.,
Art of Living does not have any deep pocketed donors who can fund the=
 immense amount of humanitarian projects. Every dollar comes from contribut=
ions from members who have taken the courses.

Yes, all these courses can b=
e free or inexpensive - but how do we view schools or colleges that are ine=
xpensive. We become better learners, when we actually invest in the courses=
, take ownership and be responsible. You can pay for it or in olden days, t=
he students would do some work at the ashram to "pay" for the knowledge.

I=
'll leave you with a final thought.

Meditate now or Medicate later.

Shrik=
anth
