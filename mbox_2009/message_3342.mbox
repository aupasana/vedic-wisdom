 ONCE, a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. It wanted to tel=
l
others how deep the water was. But this it could never do, for no sooner =
did
it get into the water than it melted.Now, who was there to report the
o=
cean's depth?

What Brahman is cannot be described. In samadhi one attains =
the knowledge of
Brahman=97one realises Brahman. In that state reasoning st=
ops altogether, and
man becomes mute. He has no power to describe the natur=
e of Brahman.
