Namaste Narayan, 

Thanks for the clarification. Much appreciated! I'm cert=
ain the priest was facing East, however, I'm less certain of the direction =
in which he threw the darbha (which very well may have been Southeast as in=
dicated by you). 

I humbly submit that Nirritti's position is Southwest. T=
his is how I understand the 8 Dikpala's directional positions (again my kno=
wledge is limited and clarifications from people like you who have traverse=
d the path much longer than I are always welcome!):

Indra - East
Agni - So=
utheast
Yama - South
Nirritti - Southwest
Varuna - West
Vayu - Northwest
So=
ma - North
Ishan - Northeast

Regards (and thanks again),
Alok.

 Can you confirm if that priest wasn't facing North, in which case the left=
 shoulder would be Southeast or Nirritti direction.
