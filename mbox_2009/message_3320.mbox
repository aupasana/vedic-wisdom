 The following article, which describes the life of a unique devotee of
Bha=
gavan Ramana, was written by Darlene Delisi Karamanos, using Dr. G.
Swamina=
than's Biography of Guru Devi Sri Janaky Matha for source material.
July 27=
th is Janaky Matha's one hundredth birth anniversary.

Sri Janaky Matha was=
 a wife, mother of seven children, community volunteer,
devotee of Bhagavan=
 Ramana Maharshi and an enlightened soul. Her amazing
life of inner visions=
, spiritual yearning, surrender and bhakti inspires all
to pursue the spiri=
tual ideal, delve into the Supreme Self and not waste
even a minute in the =
process.

Born on July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exhibited unusual detachm=
ent. She
accepted all things with a joyous heart. Janaky was full of devoti=
on to the
local deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalakshi, and as she grew in =
years,
Janaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faithful, pure and holy wif=
e of Sri
Ram.

In her thirteenth year her uncle discussed with Janaky her w=
illingness to
marry a doctor who was then thirty-two years of age. When tol=
d that the
widower had two daughters, aged two and six, Sri Janaky replied,=
 "What of
that? That doesn't make much of a difference and, after all, I li=
ke
children." Even though her parents were not too keen on this matrimonial=

arrangement because of the extreme age difference, Janaky intuitively felt=

that the doctor would be helpful in the attainment of her goal of
Liberati=
on. So in 1919, Sri Janaky married Dr. C. S. Ganapathy (known
hereafter as =
'Doctor'), in a quiet ceremony performed before Lord
Venkataramana of Tirup=
athi. The Doctor was often heard to remark: "Wherever
you (Janaky) go, I sh=
all follow you." And where else could she go, but to
God? Living in Tirupat=
hi, Sri Matha's devotion to Sri Venkataramana grew
steadily.

In 1921, she =
gave birth to a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the
consort of Lor=
d Venkataramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born,
and several y=
ears later another daughter, Sarada.

There came a point in her life when s=
he realized: "To none but Him (God)
should true love be directed. To turn t=
o the Divine is the only truth in
life." From that day on she continued to =
take care of her family and
responsibilities but shifted her life's ideal t=
o that of total devotion to
God.

At the age of twenty her daily routine wa=
s as follows: She read the Gita and
other Scriptures until about 1 a.m. eve=
ry night. Janaky would get up at 5
a.m., finish her ablutions and meditate =
until 7 a.m. Then she would take a
bath, recite hymns while attending to ho=
usehold work for about three hours,
and after sending the children to schoo=
l and the Doctor to work, she would
engage herself heart and soul in worshi=
p until 1 p.m. From 1 to 4 p.m. she
was busy looking after the needs of her=
 husband and children. At 4:30 p.m.
she would go to the Ladies' Club (which=
 did much volunteer community
service), attend meetings, play tennis and re=
turn home at 7 p.m. Upon
returning home she would meditate for an hour befo=
re taking her supper of
gruel and milk. Though she took very little food, s=
he was healthy and always
cheerful.

Although the Doctor was then earning a=
 good salary, owing to various
reasons, there was a lack of funds. One day =
before going to bed she prayed
to Sri Subrahmanya to keep her carefree by t=
aking on His shoulders the
oppressive burden of the family's welfare. The n=
ext day, a sannyasi
(ascetic) came to her house. She was all alone when he =
said to her, "You
were calling me yesterday. I have come from Palni. Leave =
to me all your
family worries and worship me with a carefree heart. Whateve=
r is needed for
the family - be it money or other needs and necessities of =
life - will be
provided for." He asked her to give him the promise that she=
 would never
forget him. After she agreed, he disappeared.

After this she =
had many wonderful spiritual experiences and visions of
deities, often last=
ing the whole night.

Sri Subrahmanya came twice more in the disguise of a =
sannyasi. When Janaky
revealed this to the Doctor, he replied with sceptici=
sm, "I will believe
your words only if He comes here when I am in." Janaky =
responded, "If that
be your desire, let it be so."

The Doctor had just ret=
urned for lunch when they both felt a presence
outside. Seeing a sannyasi, =
both Janaky and the Doctor came out and offered
him a chair. He took some f=
ood and said, "You wanted me to come when your
husband is in, and here I am=
." To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He
exhibited some psychic power=
s. He asked for another chair and requested
Janaky to be seated. She felt r=
eluctant to sit on the same level with Him,
but he insisted and asked her w=
hat more she desired. Janaky requested Him to
bless her with a Sadguru in h=
uman form.

What the sannyasi next said to her shocked her very much. "I am=
 none none
other Subrahmanya. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and =
depth of
devotion, I have a longing to be born as a child to you. I will pl=
ay with
you for two years and then my power will get infused in your heart.=
" Janaky
exclaimed, "My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of =
samsara
(worldliness) when my desire is to ferry across it." She argued tha=
t she
would not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was o=
n fire
with renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and p=
unished
him? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck an=
d call;
she would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psych=
ic powers
and fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, "L=
et me be
blessed with a Guru."

With a smile of His face, Subrahmanya said,=
 "Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if
such be your wish, there is a Mahatma by n=
ame Sri Ramana Maharshi in
Tiruvannamalai. You may go and have His darshan.=
" He showed Janaky a photo
of Bhagavan Ramana that he was carrying. It was =
the first time that she had
heard about Bhagavan Sri Ramana. Saying that he=
 would come again to discuss
with her His desire to be born as her child, H=
e disappeared from sight.

Her heart then surged with an intense love for B=
hagavan Sri Ramana. She
continued with her meditations, worship, household =
chores and volunteer
work. Day by day, Janaky could feel a number of change=
s happening to her
nervous system. Her visions continued. A severe pain dev=
eloped in her spine
and she became bedridden. Her nerves seemed to have bee=
n shattered and often
the heartbeat was faint and hardly audible. In spite =
of all this, her mind
remained peaceful. Friends wanted her to be seen by s=
pecialists, but the
Doctor was sure it was not a disease to be treated medi=
cally and that, by
the grace of God, she would be all right. This state con=
tinued for forty
days and then disappeared as mysteriously as it came.

Aft=
er a few days, a sadhu appeared before her and again asked about
Subrahmany=
a being born to her. Again she pleaded that she didn't need
obstacles, but =
a helping hand. The sadhu assured her that, "Begetting a son
will in no way=
 shackle you in bondage. There will be no hindrances to your
spiritual prog=
ress."

Janaky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. H=
er long
cherished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitti=
ng in the
meditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and=
 gracious
look of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated w=
ith the
nectar flowing through Bhagavan's eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be se=
ated. Her
heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flo=
w of
Bhagavan's Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagava=
n
blessing her.

To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the formless Aru=
nachaleswara. In
the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky knelt bef=
ore Bhagavan and
spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri Subrahma=
nya's decision to
incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her experience o=
f the all-pervasive
nature of the Paramatma and awaited instructions from B=
hagavan as to what
she should do next. He said, "Continue doing it in just =
the same way."

With the infant Swaminathan, Janaky and the Doctor returned=
 to Sri
Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bhagavan in August 1936. For a lo=
ng time
Janaky had been praying for her husband's spiritual awareness to be=
 aroused
so that he might not, at any time, stand in the way of her spiritu=
al
progress. Bhagavan asked both the Doctor and Janaky to come before him a=
nd
he read aloud "Upadesa Saram" (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to=

follow it. Janaky's heart was overflowing with joy.

To quote from Janaky =
Matha's biography:

".From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana=
, He was her all. She
reasoned, 'There is only one thing in the world worth=
 achieving: the root
cause of the whole universe, the 'One Without a Second=
'. I must attain it,
realize it and experience it with Bhagavan's Grace."

=
Physically and mentally drained by her spiritual experiences, Janaky sought=

Bhagavan's help in October 1936. At an opportune moment, she prostrated
be=
fore Bhagavan and poured out her heart to him. She told of her spiritual
ex=
periences and begged for his protection and the removal of obstacles in
her=
 quest for Liberation. She also expressed her fear of becoming deranged
bec=
ause she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan replied: "Who told you that
you=
 have no Guru? Don't get disheartened. I am here as your Guru; nothing
will=
 upset your mind." With that assurance, she transferred all her cares
and w=
orries to Bhagavan Ramana.

About a year later, Janaky felt something like =
a forceful explosion at the
back of her head and powerful currents througho=
ut her spinal cord. She did
not think her physical body could withstand it.=
 She said to herself, 'Let
things take their own course. The grace of the G=
uru will do what is right
and good for me.' This state continued for twenty=
-six days after which she
asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam.=
 He was reluctant at first
due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself=
 to be persuaded. Sri
Bhagavan's full glance of grace poured forth blessing=
s and strength on her.
Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her expe=
riences, he spoke to her
about a similar experience he had had in his early=
 days: "Look here. Don't
get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I=
 felt as if I had been
bombed from inside at the back of my head."

The you=
ng Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to
Janaky in a=
 sweet, childish voice, "Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we saw
there in Ti=
ruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you wherever
you go." =
These words were a source of great consolation and joy as Janaky
continued =
to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.

It was January of 1938 when Jana=
ky's body became rigid from her toes upward.
She thought she was nearing he=
r end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Ramana in
the heart. She had many visions=
 and experiences, but the one that crowned
all others was the experience of=
 the dynamic force or Sakti ascending and
embracing the Supreme Self. The k=
undalini continued to push upwards and
tried to break through the spot in t=
he top of her head. Janaky cried out,
"What are you trying to do? Bhagavan =
Sri Ramana and I are inseparable!
Against the downpour of the Guru's Grace,=
 you can do me no harm." With this,
the force stopped its attempts and bodi=
ly feeling returned. She told the
Doctor that she had at last been set free=
 from the rounds of birth and death
and had attained her long cherished goa=
l. The purpose of her earthly life
was fulfilled. By the grace of Bhagavan =
Sri Ramana, Janaky became a
Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-two years=
 of age.

Janaky had travelled between Ramanasramam and her home whenever s=
he felt the
need to be near Bhagavan, but on January 18, 1938, while visiti=
ng
Ramanasramam, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor wa=
s
upset and felt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger childre=
n
were grief-stricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she =
was
revelling in a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she
re=
membered the promise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for
f=
ive more years. She immediately said she would go back with them to
Kakinad=
a. Bhagavan gazed at her and said, "Did I ask you to become a
sannyasini? L=
ook at me. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre
cloth. You h=
ave only one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all
these devotee=
s and their families." She knew then that renunciation must be
in the heart=
.

Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions and
experi=
ences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birth and
death=
. Bhagavan gently said, "Can one get this for the mere asking? It seeks
the=
 heart where it wants to shine."

As the Doctor and Janaky were preparing t=
o leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor,
"You doctors say that the heart is at th=
e left side of the chest. But the
whole body is the heart for yogis. Jnanis=
 have their hearts both within and
without." He then gazed at Janaky and ag=
ain assured her: "I am always with
you."

Bhagavan was her All. She desired=
 only to contemplate the Holy Feet of
Bhagavan. In the months and years tha=
t followed, devotees were drawn to
Janaky as bees to honey. She began to be=
 addressed as Sri Matha. She took a
few of them to Sri Ramanasramam and sai=
d to Bhagavan, "All these people seek
me as their Guru.I have never wished =
to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan,
in all humility, to kindly accept t=
hese devotees as Bhagavan's disciples."

Bhagavan said, "When you are above=
 likes and dislikes, desires and
aversions, let things take their own shape=
. To the extent they believe in
you, they will reap results. I will protect=
 those who, with full faith,
trust in you."

Another incident that happened=
 at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil lamp
went out and the hall was in dar=
kness for a few minutes. When the light came
back, three-year-old Swaminath=
an exclaimed, "The light failed and Bhagavan
was not visible; the light cam=
e back and Bhagavan is seen!" Bhagavan turned
to the boy and said, "What yo=
u say is precisely correct. When there is
ajnana (ignorance), God is not re=
alized. With the dawn of jnana (wisdom), He
is seen." As it was Bhagavan wh=
o gave Sri Matha her light of wisdom, she
decided to pay for the electrific=
ation of the Ashram.

Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her=
 domestic and social
activities. She was elected President of the Child Wel=
fare Centre and Vice
President of the Ladies' Club. She performed all her a=
ctions for God's sake
in a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mi=
nd, she saw the Lord in
all of the world.

To some people she would advise,=
 "Lead a righteous life and discharge your
duties to the family, conduct fa=
mily worship, practise charity, have an
abundant life and learn to graduall=
y still the waves of passion." To others
who wanted to know more about Libe=
ration, she taught, "Always nurture Divine
thoughts, obliterate likes and p=
assions and surrender to the Guru."

There were times when Sri Matha was lo=
st in samadhi, oblivious to her
surroundings. Food had to be forced into he=
r mouth for sustenance and she
had to be bathed by others, as she was obliv=
ious of her body. At other times
she attended to her routine work and conce=
aled her exalted state.

After the marriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Ma=
tha was making final
arrangements for a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam.=
 After bowing before
Bhagavan, the ten-year-old Swaminathan poured out his =
sorrow, weeping
bitterly and rolling on the ground. He sobbed, "Pray give u=
s back my mother
and order her to come with us to Thanjavur."

Bhagavan, wi=
th a voice choked with emotion said to Sri Matha, "What can I
do?" Then tur=
ning to Swaminathan said affectionately, "Take your mother and
go back to T=
hanjavur." Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan's request and
returned with the =
Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandran.

At Sri Matha's re=
quest the southern portion of the family house remain as an
ashram and spir=
itual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main
objective of the ce=
ntre is to spread the teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.

Moments before her pas=
sing away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives
chanted Bhagavan's hymn Ak=
sharamanamalai, with the refrain of "Arunachala
Shiva, Arunachala Shiva."

=
Sri Matha's life stands as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal o=
f
Liberation and devotion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devote=
es
were having a lengthy discussion of Bhagavan's 'Who am I?' enquiry, she
=
halted them saying, "Enough of this discussion! My head begins to swim with=

such dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show
devo=
tion to Sri Bhagavan." It was through such steadfast devotion that Sri
Math=
a achieved Liberation.

"A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of th=
e fact that he is not the
body. But there is one thing more. Unless one loo=
ks upon death as a thing
that is very near and might happen at any moment, =
one will not be aware of
the Self. This means that the ego must die, must v=
anish, along with the
inherent vasanas." - Letters from Sri Ramanasramam

ars and then my power will get infused in your heart." Janaky exclaime=
d, "My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsara (wor=
ldliness) when my desire is to ferry across it." She argued that she w=
ould not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on fire =
with renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and punished=
 him? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck and call;=
 she would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psychic powe=
rs and fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, "Let=
 me be blessed with a Guru."</span><br>

<br>With a smile of His face,=
 Subrahmanya said, "Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if such be your wish, =
there is a Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in Tiruvannamalai. You may g=
o and have His darshan." He showed Janaky a photo of Bhagavan Ramana t=
hat he was carrying. It was the first time that she had heard about Bhagava=
n Sri Ramana. Saying that he would come again to discuss with her His desir=
e to be born as her child, He disappeared from sight.<br>

<br>Her heart th=
en surged with an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She continued with =
her meditations, worship, household chores and volunteer work. Day by day, =
Janaky could feel a number of changes happening to her nervous system. Her =
visions continued. A severe pain developed in her spine and she became bedr=
idden. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often the heartbeat was=
 faint and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her mind remained peaceful=
. Friends wanted her to be seen by specialists, but the Doctor was sure it =
was not a disease to be treated medically and that, by the grace of God, sh=
e would be all right. This state continued for forty days and then disappea=
red as mysteriously as it came.<br>

<br>After a few days, a sadhu appeared=
 before her and again asked about Subrahmanya being born to her. Again she =
pleaded that she didn't need obstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu a=
ssured her that, "Begetting a son will in no way shackle you in bondag=
e. There will be no hindrances to your spiritual progress."<br>

<br>J=
anaky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long c=
herished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the=
 meditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and gracious=
 look of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the n=
ectar flowing through Bhagavan's eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated.=
 Her heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of =
Bhagavan's Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan=
 blessing her.<br>

<br>To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the forml=
ess Arunachaleswara. In the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky kn=
elt before Bhagavan and spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri S=
ubrahmanya's decision to incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her e=
xperience of the all-pervasive nature of the Paramatma and awaited instruct=
ions from Bhagavan as to what she should do next. He said, "Continue d=
oing it in just the same way."<br>

<br>With the infant Swaminathan, J=
anaky and the Doctor returned to Sri Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bhag=
avan in August 1936. For a long time Janaky had been praying for her husban=
d's spiritual awareness to be aroused so that he might not, at any time=
, stand in the way of her spiritual progress. Bhagavan asked both the Docto=
r and Janaky to come before him and he read aloud "Upadesa Saram"=
 (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to follow it. Janaky's heart w=
as overflowing with joy.<br>

<br>To quote from Janaky Matha's biograph=
y:<br><br>".From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, He =
was her all. She reasoned, 'There is only one thing in the world worth =
achieving: the root cause of the whole universe, the 'One Without a Sec=
ond'. I must attain it, realize it and experience it with Bhagavan'=
s Grace."<br>

<br>Physically and mentally drained by her spiritual ex=
periences, Janaky sought Bhagavan's help in October 1936. At an opportu=
ne moment, she prostrated before Bhagavan and poured out her heart to him. =
She told of her spiritual experiences and begged for his protection and the=
 removal of obstacles in her quest for Liberation. She also expressed her f=
ear of becoming deranged because she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan rep=
lied: "Who told you that you have no Guru? Don't get disheartened.=
 I am here as your Guru; nothing will upset your mind." With that assu=
rance, she transferred all her cares and worries to Bhagavan Ramana.<br>

<=
br>About a year later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosion at t=
he back of her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal cord. She d=
id not think her physical body could withstand it. She said to herself, =
9;Let things take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do what is r=
ight and good for me.' This state continued for twenty-six days after w=
hich she asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was reluctant=
 at first due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be persuaded.=
 Sri Bhagavan's full glance of grace poured forth blessings and strengt=
h on her. Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experiences, he s=
poke to her about a similar experience he had had in his early days: "=
Look here. Don't get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I fel=
t as if I had been bombed from inside at the back of my head."<br>

<b=
r>The young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to Ja=
naky in a sweet, childish voice, "Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we s=
aw there in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you wher=
ever you go." These words were a source of great consolation and joy a=
s Janaky continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.<br>

<br>It wa=
s January of 1938 when Janaky's body became rigid from her toes upward.=
 She thought she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Ramana in =
the heart. She had many visions and experiences, but the one that crowned a=
ll others was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti ascending and em=
bracing the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to push upwards and tried=
 to break through the spot in the top of her head. Janaky cried out, "=
What are you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I are inseparable! Again=
st the downpour of the Guru's Grace, you can do me no harm." With =
this, the force stopped its attempts and bodily feeling returned. She told =
the Doctor that she had at last been set free from the rounds of birth and =
death and had attained her long cherished goal. The purpose of her earthly =
life was fulfilled.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">By the grace of B=
hagavan Sri Ramana, Janaky became a Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-t=
wo years of age.</span><br>

<br>Janaky had travelled between Ramanasramam =
and her home whenever she felt the need to be near Bhagavan,=C2=A0<span sty=
le=3D"font-weight:bold">but on January 18, 1938, while visiting Ramanasrama=
m, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor was upset and fe=
lt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger children were grief-s=
tricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she was revelling =
in a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she remembered the p=
romise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for five more years=
. She immediately said she would go back with them to Kakinada. Bhagavan ga=
zed at her and said, "Did I ask you to become a sannyasini? Look at me=
. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre cloth. You have only =
one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all these devotees and the=
ir families." She knew then that renunciation must be in the heart.</s=
pan><br>

<br>Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions=
 and experiences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birt=
h and death. Bhagavan gently said, "Can one get this for the mere aski=
ng? It seeks the heart where it wants to shine."<br>

<br>As the Docto=
r and Janaky were preparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor, "You d=
octors say that the heart is at the left side of the chest. But the whole b=
ody is the heart for yogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within and withou=
t." He then gazed at Janaky and again assured her: "I am always w=
ith you."<br>

<br>Bhagavan was her All. She desired only to contempla=
te the Holy Feet of Bhagavan.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-style:italic">In the=
 months and years that followed, devotees were drawn to Janaky as bees to h=
oney. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. She took a few of them to Sri=
 Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, "All these people seek me as their=
 Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan, in all hu=
mility, to kindly accept these devotees as Bhagavan's disciples."<=
br>

<br>Bhagavan said, "When you are above likes and dislikes, desire=
s and aversions, let things take their own shape. To the extent they believ=
e in you, they will reap results. I will protect those who, with full faith=
, trust in you."</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Anot=
her incident that happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil lamp went o=
ut and the hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When the light came back=
, three-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, "The light failed and Bhagavan=
 was not visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!" Bhagavan =
turned to the boy and said, "What you say is precisely correct. When t=
here is ajnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn of jnana (wi=
sdom), He is seen." As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha her light of=
 wisdom, she decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashram.</span><b=
r>

<br>Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her domestic and =
social activities. She was elected President of the Child Welfare Centre an=
d Vice President of the Ladies' Club. She performed all her actions for=
 God's sake in a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mind, sh=
e saw the Lord in all of the world.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bol=
d">To some people she would advise, "Lead a righteous life and dischar=
ge your duties to the family, conduct family worship, practise charity, hav=
e an abundant life and learn to gradually still the waves of passion."=
 To others who wanted to know more about Liberation, she taught, "Alwa=
ys nurture Divine thoughts, obliterate likes and passions and surrender to =
the Guru."</span><br>

<br>There were times when Sri Matha was lost in=
 samadhi, oblivious to her surroundings. Food had to be forced into her mou=
th for sustenance and she had to be bathed by others, as she was oblivious =
of her body. At other times she attended to her routine work and concealed =
her exalted state.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">After the mar=
riage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Matha was making final arrangements for =
a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam. After bowing before Bhagavan, the ten=
-year-old Swaminathan poured out his sorrow, weeping bitterly and rolling o=
n the ground. He sobbed, "Pray give us back my mother and order her to=
 come with us to Thanjavur."<br>

<br>Bhagavan, with a voice choked wi=
th emotion said to Sri Matha, "What can I do?" Then turning to Sw=
aminathan said affectionately, "Take your mother and go back to Thanja=
vur." Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan's request and returned with =
the Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandran.</span><br>

<b=
r><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">At Sri Matha's request the southern =
portion of the family house remain as an ashram and spiritual centre with S=
ri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main objective of the centre is to spread t=
he teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.</span><br>

<br>Moments before her passing=
 away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives chanted Bhagavan's hymn Ak=
sharamanamalai, with the refrain of "Arunachala Shiva, Arunachala Shiv=
a."<br><br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Sri Matha's life stan=
ds as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal of Liberation and devo=
tion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devotees were having a leng=

em saying, "Enough of this discussion! My head begins to swim with suc=
h dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show devotion=
 to Sri Bhagavan."</span>=C2=A0It was through such steadfast devotion =
that Sri Matha achieved Liberation.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bol=
