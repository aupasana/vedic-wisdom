Thank you for this fantastic explanation. Makes a LOT of sense!

Namaste,

There is no reason for it. You can add the "idam na mam=
a" part in the parivaara devata aahutis of Chandi homam too, or remove them=
 in Shiva homam.
=A0
In general, whenever you say "I offer this to x" (x-aa=
ya swaahaa), you can also add at the end: "this is for x and not mine" (x-a=
aya idam na mama). That is optional.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Irrespective of which version you use, mentally visualiz=
ing the entity to which you are making the offering is more helpful than th=
e exact words uttered.
=A0
For example, we make offerings to Agni, Vaayu an=
d Surya in uttaraangam of a homam, right? You can imagine the three gods as=
 you make the offerings.
=A0
Fire god transforms various subtle factors int=
o this gross world and has dominion over the bhU loka. When saying "om bhUH=
 swaahaa, agnaya idam na mama", imagine a deity who transforms one thing in=
to another and who has transformed subtle elements into this material world=
 we see around us.
=A0
Wind god causes motion. He causes motion in somethin=
g made essentially of Brahman - mind - and this mind starts seeing various =
objects within Brahman due to its motion. If there is no motion in it, it w=
ill be absorbed in Brahman. When saying "om bhuvaH swaahaa, vaayava idam na=
 mama", imagine a deity who causes motion in mind made of Brahman to enable=
 it to experience the world.
=A0
Sun god is the soul of the universe. He is=
 the source of all light, but his light is difficult to directly stare at. =
His light when reflected by other things is easier to see. Similarly, soul =
radiates brilliant light that is tough to get close to (unless you are a Ha=
numaan) and the light is received in limited forms as reflected by various =
things. When saying "om suvaH swaahaa, sUryaayedam na mama", imagine a deit=
y who fills the universe as its soul.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The words, the instruments and the actions=A0in rituals =
are designed to evoke certain thoughts and certain visualization. Instead o=
f getting too caught in the superficial details, try to delve deep into the=
 meaning and start to visualize. That will help the mind get a better persp=
ective of the universe and progress faster.

Dear Rajarshi,

The word yoginyaadib=
hyaH means "to Yoginis etc" and devataabhyaH means "to 
deities". The full =
line means "I offer to Yoginis etc deities in the family 
of Chandi". This =

in the family.=
 Giving all the 100 aahutis takes about 5 min if one knows all

one wants t=
o save time, one can just offer one aahuti to all of them 
together.

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A query on parivara devata mantra

Nam=
aste

In the Chandi homa manual, the one line mantra for parivara debata ah=
uti is 
mentioned as:

om yoginy=E4dibhya=F9 ca=EB=F2ik=E4 pariv=E4ra devat=
=E4bhyo nama=F9 sv=E4h=E4|

Whatd does the word yoginy=E4dibhya=F9 and deva=
tbhyo mean?

In the Shiva homa manual that one line is mentioned as follows=
:

om sad=E4=E7iva pariv=E4ra devat=E4bhya=F9 sv=E4h=E4| sad=E4=E7iva pariv=
=E4ra devat=E4bhya ida=E0 na 
mama||

What is the difference in the meaning=
 and relevance of usage of the two 
mantras for parivar devata ahuti for Ch=
andi homa and Shiva homa?

-Regards
Rajarshi
