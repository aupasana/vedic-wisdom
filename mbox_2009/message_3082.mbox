ALWAYS FINISH WHAT YOU HAVE STARTED

**

WORLD'S FIRST MANAGEMENT GURU - *C=
HANAKYA AND HIS TEACHINGS From KAUTILYA'S
ARTHASHASTRA (WRITTEN IN 3RD CENT=
URY BC)* WHICH CAN BE PRACTICALLY APPLIED
BY EACH PERSON EVEN IN MODERN DAY=
 SCENARIO.

       *Radhakrishnan **=91Chanakya=92 Pillai*

There=92s this =
friend of mine who seems destined to end each and every project
of his with=
 nothing but success. I once asked him to share his secret.He
said, =93Befo=
re taking on any new project, I always complete the previous work
undertake=
n. That ensures that I single-mindedly, and successfully, finish
every proj=
ect I take up!=94

 *These words immediately reminded me of a verse by Chan=
akya:*

* =91Activity is that which brings about the accomplishment of work=
s
undertaken=92 (6.2.2)*

 Very few people are good at completing work they=
 already have. Indeed,
almost all of us keep on taking new projects, accept=
 new orders and even
pick up new books to read without asking ourselves, =
=93Shouldn=92t I first
complete the existing one?=94

 No wonder we land up=
 with various problems like stress, atrocious
time-management and a patheti=
c work-life balance. Why don=92t we first
complete the work we already have=
 at hand? Chanakya says that this happens
because we are not =91active=92. =
We have to =91act=92 to complete all existing work.
There=92s simply no alt=
ernative to this.

 And you only need a few steps:

 *1)      **LIST ALL PE=
NDING WORK*

* If you want to see why your life is in a mess, try this simp=
le exercise:
List the number of activities that you have started but not co=
mpleted or
finished till date. It could be finishing a report, calling up a=
nd thanking
the organisers of an event, or simply completing that book you =
picked up. If
you=92re honest, you will be shocked at the size of your list=
!*

 *2)      **PLAN IT, AND DO IT*

* Now, list the time required for comp=
leting each unfinished work. For
example, it may take a half hour to finish=
 that report. Or about 5-10
minutes to call and thank the organisers of tha=
t party. Or the book that you
started reading and left mid-way may take abo=
ut three hours more to
finish. Keep sometime, say about one hour daily, to =
complete these
unfinished tasks. Very important: Actually =91DO IT=92, and =
don=92t just think
about doing it.*

 *3)      **MAKE IT A HABIT*

*This ex=
ercise may look difficult initially. After all, we all do get into
the dirt=
y habit of procrastinating. But if we really discipline ourselves by
comple=
ting all unfinished tasks, we will grow in self-confidence and even
yearn f=
or bigger challenges. The chairman of a multinational firm once
revealed to=
 me that he spends his Saturdays just to complete any work that
may have be=
en left unfinished. This shows how important is to be a good
finisher rathe=
r than just being a good starter.*
