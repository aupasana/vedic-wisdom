Subject: Dharma or Choice?

Is Dharma the right thing to follow or personal choice?

My marriage is fix=
ed with a girl who I said 'yes' but currently feel is not good looking enou=
gh. Marriage is next week - engagement is over. I feel the girl is not suff=
icient looks wise to me and I am disappointed.

Parents and elders have fix=
ed the marriage - I said 'yes' like an idiot owing to my mistake. The weddi=
ng card is printed.

Should I run away and not attend marriage and ditch th=
e girl?
or should I accept it was my mistake and proceed with the marriage =
as it is the dharma to follow?
