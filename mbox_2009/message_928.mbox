Namaste Narasimhaji

I was reading up=
 on the old mail about how your started doign Chandi 
Homa. You mentioned t=
hat you always considered Ma Lakshmi as you 
Istha Devata.

Now what I was =
wondering about it that, is it possible that for a 
person to get closer to=
 his/her Istha, he/she may have to under go 
serious sadhana of some other =
deity?

Like in your case you have done so many homas for Ma Chandi, so doe=
s 
it mean Ma Chandi is your Istha devata? 

Or does it mean Ma Lakshmi wan=
ted you to do these sadhanas so that 
you can progress faster, maybe you ha=
d done a lot of sadhana for Ma 
Chandi in previous lives?

Kindly tell us y=
our views on this.

-Regards
 Rajarshi
