Dear Sir:

I find the happenings in lankapuri to be very sobering with
mil=
lions displaced and losing contact with their children,
and suffering in so=
 many ways. 
Truly this shouldn't have been the fate of people who live
in =
the land touched by Rama and Hanumanta's feet.

At the same time, is there =
any value in our praying for this?
If this is truly the Lord in his Kaala a=
vatara forcing his will,
will our prayers help? Will we get karmically link=
ed by prayer
for these suffering folks?
It seems that as Kali yuga progress=
es, man finds new ways to
inflict suffering on himself and his brethren.

R=
egards.
