Namaste,

Holy places - i am thinking about how to decide if a certain plac=
e has good spiritual vibrations or not? Whenever i see writings from Narasi=
mha or from others which talks about spiritual vibrations, i wonder! If it'=
s a feel good factor within or without?

If we go to the famous temples of =
India today, it is almost sure that one will find lot of crowd and resultan=
t noise, gossips, business, cheating, discrimination etc... etc...
can that=
 be criteria for judging the spiritual energy of the place?

my two distinc=
t experiences (external):
1) i went to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when=
 i entered to take Darshan of all the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the =
dogmatic behavior of the Pandas standing there near the Idols. they almost =
commanded me to put some money in front of the Idol. one can imagine my con=
dition. Instead of focusing on the lord, i was angry at them and refused to=
 oblige.

2) Once we (group of friends) went to 'Mota Ambaji' (in Gujarat n=
ear Mount Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entra=
nce of the famous temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made=
 a mistake by not asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he =
asked us to pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. =
we have to bargain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja =
saamgri whenever i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Te=
mple of Mumbai, i'll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSara=
swati and that is all.

However I must say that the above two bad experienc=
es did not discourage me.

Such things as well as few other things like Gen=
eral atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external things IM=
HO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many pure hearted visi=
tors.

Warm regards,

Utpal

 I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certain "Amavasya". After taking ba=
th, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately o=
r unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain plac=
e. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. A=
nd per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per their "Cu=
stom". Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already ha=

soning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the, but=
 could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.
