Bot=
h are correct, but at different levels. I will elaborate. However, this is =
philosophically complex and those who do not follow what I say should not w=
orry at all.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Non-du=
al self has no division of self into various objects or space or time. Ther=
e is no concept of time or space or space-time continuum within non-dual se=
lf. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of space or time or objec=
tification.
=A0
Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-du=
ality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the enti=
re field of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time=
 continua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the perspectiv=
e of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are His parts and a=
ll their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will. As all space-time c=
ontinua are within Him, there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, pres=
ent and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibi=
lity, that possibility=A0and yet another possibility - all are accessible a=
nd fully "known" to His self-awareness.
=A0
Now, let us come lower and into=
 the field of duality. The field of duality consists of infinite divisions =
of space, time and space-time continua. There are infinite possibilities wi=
thin this field.
=A0
Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a li=
near sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. Ho=
wever, field of duality also contains planes of consciousness where differe=
nt senses of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at =
various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum i=
n such a plane of consciousness=A0may experience a point of time that maps =
to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being experienced by you=
. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 year in anoth=
er space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one m=
ay think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-time cont=
inua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousness that on=
e's self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a =
specific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality=
. But relaity
 consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each=
 other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out your course=
 based on your actions and Nature's reactions to your actions.
=A0
*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
>From the perspective of a yogi=
 who is in a different space-time continuum, your state may be known at a t=
ime that is in "future" as per the space-time continuum in which you exist.=
 But, from the perspective of the space-time continuum that you are in, you=
r state at that future time is not yet known and depends on your current ac=
tion.
=A0
If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state=
 in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his reference=
 frame.=A0It has no causal relationship to your current action or your futu=
re state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen=
. His observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover a=
ll the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the s=
pace-time pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Let us go further. Is there only one=
 future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in space-time =
continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can your actions at=
 important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?
=A0
If so, what is th=
e meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his observation =
only a possibility or a certainty? One may say "how can one observe a possi=
bility? Anything we observe must be a certainty." But is that correct? Aren=
't the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua contained in i=
t merely a set of infinite possibilities?
=A0
Some great rishis can see not=
 just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same time, i.e=
. they can see various possibilities based on various possible actions. How=
ever, visions seen by most yogis about "future" are just one possibility.
=
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Bottomline: At the =
level at which we exist, there is certainly something called "freewill". Wi=
thin the limits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own previo=
us actions, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this t=
ime. Depending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly di=
fferent. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A r=
ishi may be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibi=
lities for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most pos=
sibilities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced=A0yogi may be able to see a=
 few possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a=
 few moves or guessing a future position).=A0But the supreme cosmic being k=
nows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.
=A0
H=
owever, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame=
 of your consciousness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all the=
 possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come t=
o fruition, but it is your actions=A0that actually make some of those possi=
bilities a reality.

Namaste Narasimhaji
=A0
No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for al=
l of us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up=
 in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.
=A0
If events =
have already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they h=
appen in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? =
Like a placebo that makes us "happy" but in reality does not exist!
=A0
I a=
m not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events having alrea=
dy happened, because same has been said by other great spiritual people in =
the world. 
=A0
But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a f=
reewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.
=A0
Theoritical=
ly speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world reforms itself, do=
es a self correction exercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then wh=
y should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has=
 to incarnate - as our texts say - then such a self correcting option is al=
ready negated out.
=A0
Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no on=
e has any choice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging wit=
h the divine.
=A0
So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to t=
hink.

 Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego

Namaste,

I=
 mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi homam and =
saw Vishnu's ten incarnations above the fire in the following mail:

http:/=
/groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761

This boy was born and=
 brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He di=
d not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he sa=
w and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he s=
aw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty roa=
d. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn't come yet.

* * *

This boy is usua=
lly playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, =
I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the epis=
ode mentioned in the above mail.

I asked what he was thinking. He said, "i=
t is not that the future that is to come has not already happened. It has a=
lready happened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. Y=
ou know what I mean?" I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not t=
o know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"

He said, "I don't know how to say =
what I am thinking." This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or arti=
culate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sw=
eet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But=
 he could not express himself.

I helped him, "do you mean to say that futu=
re has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people lat=
er? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a =
studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the s=
creen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying som=
ething like that?"

He exclaimed, "exactly. That is what I am saying. If so=
mething is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But=
 somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has already=
 happened."

Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along=
 these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over t=
he fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given h=
is age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed lik=
e an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he =
was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusi=
ons about "time" in his own way.

Time seems linear at the level of regular=
 consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of t=
ime becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in n=
on-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.

* * *

The same boy once performed a ve=
ry short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beeja=
akshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I fel=
t a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energ=
y I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blis=
sful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as "I am done her=
e. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave" filled my entire consciou=
snss.

I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that.=
 Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to m=
y guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I=
 had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famo=
us temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was=
 sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt =
was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that i=
ntense shakti.

Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes=
, that boy remarked, "out of all the different homas I did so far, this is =
the bestest homam." I asked him why. He said, "I don't know how to say it, =
but it just felt awesome and different."

* * *

This boy performed a reall=
y simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it s=
eemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. Th=
e bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.

Rituals =
help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of=
 it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until on=
e breaks through.

Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do =
pay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The o=
nly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your=
 ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external=
 things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealos=
y etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is "I=
" and this is "mine" - is the root cause of all problems.

* * *

Overcomin=
g ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easie=
r. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, s=
pouse, children and your own body - is god's property and that you are a te=
mporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you ca=
n, but without entertaining the notion "this is mine". A faithful servant t=
akes very good care of his master's properties, but without thinking of all=
 those things as his or her belongings.

Realize that thinking of things as=
 "mine" is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves =
one's master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing i=
s taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant =
will accept that is master's property and can be taken away anytime. This e=
nables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about w=
hat one does not possess or what is out of one's control.

Developing the a=
ttitude of a servant who takes care of master's properties will help one wa=
de the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.

Best=

Narasimha

hich we exist, there is certainly something called "freewill". Within the l=

me. Depending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly dif=
ferent. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A ri=
shi may be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibil=
ities for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most poss=

 a few possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out=
 a few moves or guessing a future position). </FONT><FONT face=3DArial=

<DIV>No doubt a wonderful and insp=
iring mail for all of us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable q=
uestion popped up in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eternal question=
s.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>If event=
s have already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they=
 happen in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug=
? Like a placebo that makes us "happy" but in reality does not exist!</DIV>=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I am not questio=
ning that what you wrote in the mail about events having already happened, =
because same has been said by other great spiritual people in the world. </=
DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>But my quest=
ion is because I cannot reconcile this with a freewill. Both cannot be corr=
ect. It is either this or that.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FO=
NT> </DIV>
<DIV>Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority=
 of the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings in=
 peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? =
But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then suc=
h a self correcting option is already negated out.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3D=
Arial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Well, theoritically, in a very larg=
e viewpoint no one has any choice in the sense that finally everyone will e=
nd up merging with the divine.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FON=
T> </DIV>
<DIV>So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to=

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>I mentioned an episode of a sm=
all boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu's ten incarnations=
 above the fire in the following mail:<BR><BR><A href=3D"http://groups.yaho=
o.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761" target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow>http:/=
/groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761</A><BR><BR>This boy wa=
s born and brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hindu=
ism. He did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described =
what he saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the =
forms he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a=
 dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn't come yet.<BR><BR>* * *<B=
R><BR>This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was =
with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou=
 a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.<BR><BR>I asked what =
he was thinking. He
 said, "it is not that the future that is to come has n=
ot already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen=
 later when the time comes. You know what I mean?" I guessed what he was ge=
tting at, but pretended not to know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"<BR><BR=
>He said, "I don't know how to say what I am thinking." This boy is not kno=
wn to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that =
he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. Howeve=
r, he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.<BR><BR>I =
helped him, "do you mean to say that future has already happened at some le=
vel, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie =
may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have alrea=
dy seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happe=
ning in front of them. Are you saying something like that?"<BR><BR>He excla=
imed,
 "exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen =
in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to se=
e it before future comes, because it has already happened."<BR><BR>Though h=
e did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I =
told him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and=
 he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to=
 think and understand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him th=
at he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think h=
ow it was possible and came to some important conclusions about "time" in h=
is own way.<BR><BR>Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness.=
 However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes cha=
nged. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman =
or Brahman or Self.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The same boy once performed a very
=
 short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaak=
shara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt =
a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy =
I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissf=
ul and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as "I am done here.=
 I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave" filled my entire consciousn=
ss.<BR><BR>I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before t=
hat. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next =
to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was wh=
en I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a =
famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which=
 was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I f=
elt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I
 feel t=
hat intense shakti.<BR><BR>Interestingly, after we finished meditation and =
opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all the different homas I did so fa=
r, this is the bestest homam." I asked him why. He said, "I don't know how =
to say it, but it just felt awesome and different."<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Thi=
s boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what I gi=
ve in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful en=
ergy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most imp=
ortant thing.<BR><BR>Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritu=
al better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one =
has to keep doing it until one breaks through.<BR><BR>Keep performing your =
chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you =
engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual prog=
ress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego
 becomes smaller, y=
ou can resist attraction to external things better and you can resist inter=
nal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma be=
tter. Ego - thinking that this is "I" and this is "mine" - is the root caus=
e of all problems.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is =
relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is a=
round you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your ow=
n body - is god's property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of=
 these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining=
 the notion "this is mine". A faithful servant takes very good care of his =
master's properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her=
 belongings.<BR><BR>Realize that thinking of things as "mine" is not necess=
ary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one's master takes th=
e best care of things entrusted to one. When a
 thing is taken away, a serv=
ant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is =
master's property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the=
 best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not pos=
sess or what is out of one's control.<BR><BR>Developing the attitude of a s=
ervant who takes care of master's properties will help one wade the ocean o=
f worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.<BR><BR>Best regards=
