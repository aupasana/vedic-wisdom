Dear Krishnendu,

Neither Manish nor I see ourselves as "gurus", though we are happy to share 
what we know.

Different people may do different sadhanas, but the goal of all sadhana is 
perfect control over mind and emotions. And, no sadhana is successful 
without some minimal level of control over mind and emotions to start with!! 
There lies the paradox. This is an egg first or chicken first kind of 
situation. Just keep doing whatever sadhana you do (e.g. homam or japam) and 
try to break through. Until you break through, sadhana will be a routine and 
will work slowly. Once you break through, you will start making progress.

Apart from formal sadhana, keep control over your mind and emotions as much 
as you can, in all your activities. That is the key. Nothing is worth 
desiring and nothing is worth hating in this universe. This body is like a 
temporary house in which you live while you take care of your 
responsibilities (karmik debts) in the town (on earth). Take decent care of 
the house (body), but do not be attached to it. Discharge your 
responsibilities to the best of your ability. Once you do something, 
surrender the action and its doership to the lord and disengage from it, 
i.e. stop thinking about it. Always focus your mental energy on deciding 
what to do and on doing what you decided to do, rather than worrying about 
past or furutre or worrying about what others are doing. Focus on what you 
can and should do.

As you discharge more and more responsibilities and as your sense of 
ownership over your actions goes down, the clarity with which you can see 
your responsibilities will increase considerably.

Best regards,
Narasimha
