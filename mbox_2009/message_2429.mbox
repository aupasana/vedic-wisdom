 The feeling of a need to work in order to gain happiness (being the index
=
of misery) is the misery of miseries. How can there be pleasure or removal
=
of pain so long as it continues?

Only those who need not engage in action,=
 are happy; they are perfectly
content, and self-contained, and they experi=
ence a happiness which extends
to all the pores of the body.

Wrongly do th=
ey ever engage in work, being deluded; such is the plight of
humanity stupe=
fied by the poison of the sense of obligation.

Confounding dispassion (vai=
ragya) with misery,and the pleasures of the world
with happiness (sukha), a=
 man suffers in the cycle of births and deaths,
while powerful ignorance pr=
evails.

Association with the Sages is alone said to lead to the highest go=
od. Your
contact with Samvarta has led you to this stage of enlightenment, =
which is
the forerunner of emancipation. On being approached, the Sages tea=
ch the
greatest good.

Misery is of two kinds, external and internal.The fo=
rmer pertains to the
body and is caused by the nerves, etc.; the latter per=
tains to the mind and
is caused by desire.

Mental distraction is worse tha=
n physical pain and the whole world has
fallen a victim to it. Desire is th=
e seed of the tree of misery and never
fails in its fruits.

Respite gained=
 by the fulfilment of one desire before another takes its
place, is not hap=
piness, because the seeds of pain are still latent. Such
respite is enjoyed=
 by the insects also (which certainly do not typify
perfect happiness).Yet =
is their enjoyment distinctly better than that of men
because their desires=
 are less complex?

Fatigue is certainly produced for everybody after the f=
lurry (or passion) of
copulation, just as there is fatigue for an animal ca=
rrying a load

Beauty is only a mental concept, as is evident from the simi=
lar feeling in
similar enjoyments of lovers in dreams.

The idea of beauty =
lies in one=92s own desire innate in the mind.

Even the most accomplished =
among men have fallen into the habit of seeking
pleasure from woman, for al=
l consider her the best hunting ground for
delight.Similarly also a man=92s=
 body is thought by women to be the highest
source of enjoyment.Shaped of f=
at and flesh, filled with blood,topped by the
head, covered by skin, ribbed=
 by bones,covered with hair, containing bile
and phlegm, a pitcher of faece=
s and urine, generated from semen and ovum,
and born from the opening from =
where urine is ejected =97 such is the body.
Just think of it! Finding deli=
ght in such a thing, how are men any better
than worms growing in offal?

W=
hat is known as the mind is, after all, always like a restless monkey. So
t=
he ordinary man is always afflicted with troubles. Everybody knows that a
r=
estless mind is the channel of endless troubles; whereas one is happy in
sl=
eep in the absence of such restlessness.Hearing with a distracted mind is
a=
s good as not hearing, for the words serve no useful purpose, resembling
th=
e fruit-laden tree seen in a painting.

Men earn their food, gods their nec=
tar, pious ascetics the highest beatitude
and others their desires, by indi=
vidual exertion alone.

Whatever has the impress of misery on it cannot be =
good. Such are wealth,
children, wife, kingdom, treasury, army, fame, learn=
ing, intellect, body,
beauty and prosperity. For they are all transient and=
 already in the jaws of
death, otherwise called time.

Therefore worship th=
e Primal Cause of the universe as the starting point; be
devoted to Him; He=
 will soon enable you to succeed in your attempts to
destroy the illusion.
=

Among the methods of approach to God, there are (1) worship to overcome
tr=
oubles, (2) worship to gain wealth, etc., and (3) loving dedication of
ones=
elf. The last one is the best and surest in its results.

A human master ma=
y take long to recognise unselfish work;but God, the Lord
of the Universe, =
the Dweller in our hearts, knows everything and soon
bestows appropriate fr=
uits. In the case of other kinds of devotees, God has
to await the course o=
f destiny =97 that being His own ordainment; whereas for
the selfless devot=
ee, God, the
Lord and the sole refuge, is all in all and takes care of him =
without
reference to the devotee=92s predestiny or His own ordained laws. H=
e
compensates the devotee quickly, and that is because He is supreme and
se=
lf-contained without depending on anything else.

Predestiny or divine will=
 is powerless before Him. Everyone knows how He set
aside predestiny and di=
vine laws in the case of His famous devotee,
Markandeya.

[Note: A Rishi, M=
rikandu by name, who was childless,pleased Siva by his
penance. When Siva a=
ppeared to him,he prayed that a son might be born to
him. Siva asked him if=
 he wished to have a dull boy long-lived, or a bright
boy short-lived. Mrik=
andu preferred the latter. So Siva said =91You will have
a very brilliant s=
on; but he will only live for sixteen years=92. Accordingly
a son was born =
who was very good and dutiful, and most intelligent and
pious,charming all =
who saw him. The parents were delighted with him but grew
sad as he grew up=
. He asked them the reason for their sadness and they told
him of Siva=92s =
boon.He said, =91Never mind. I will see=92, and took to
penance.Siva was pl=
eased with his intense devotion and ordained that he
should remain sixteen =
years of age for all eternity.]

The current notion that one cannot escape =
one=92s destiny is applicable only
to weak-minded and senseless wastrels.

=
The Primal Being is Siva with five faces and three eyes, the Creator would
=
in that case be like an ordinary potter making pots, endowed with a body an=
d
brain. True, there is no art found in the world, without a body and some
=
intellect. In fact, the creative faculty in men belongs to something betwee=
n
the body and pure intelligence.

[Note: Body being insentient cannot act =
of its own accord; nor can intellect
do so without a tool.]

Therefore the =
mind operates apart from the gross body,in dreams; being
intelligent it cre=
ates an environment suitable to its latent desires. This
clearly indicates =
that the body is only a tool for a purpose and the agent
is intelligence.In=
struments are necessary for human agents because their
capacities are limit=
ed and they are not self-contained.Whereas the Creator
of the universe is p=
erfect in Himself and creates the whole universe without
any external aid.T=
his leads to the important conclusion that God has no
body.Otherwise, He wo=
uld be reduced to a glorified human being, requiring
innumerable accessorie=
s for work and influenced by seasons and environments,
in no way different =
from a creature, and not the Lord. Moreover,
preexistence of accessories wo=
uld quash His unique mastery and imply limits
to His powers of creation. Th=
is is absurd, as being contrary to the original
premises. Therefore, He has=
 no body nor the other aids, yet He still creates
the world, O Lord of my l=
ife! Fools are taken in by the notion of giving a
body to the transcendenta=
l Being. Still, if devotees worship and contemplate
Him with a body accordi=
ng to their own inclinations, He shows them grace,
assuming such a body. Fo=
r He is unique and fulfils the desires of His
devotees.

Nevertheless, the =
conclusion must be reached that He is pure intelligence
and His consciousne=
ss is absolute and transcendental.Such is the
consciousness-intelligence in=
 purity,Absolute Being, the One Queen,
Parameswari (Transcendental Goddess)=
, overwhelming the three states and
hence called Tripura. Though She is the=
 undivided whole, the universe
manifests in all its variety in Her, being r=
eflected as it were,in a
self-luminous mirror. The reflection cannot be apa=
rt from the mirror and is
therefore one with it. Such being the case, there=
 cannot be difference in
degrees (e.g., Siva, or Vishnu being superior to e=
ach other). Bodies are
mere conceptions in the lower order of beings and th=
ey are not to the point
in the case of God. Therefore, be wise,and worship =
the one pure, unblemished
Transcendence.

As long as you are contaminated w=
ith notions of me or mine (e.g., my home,
my body, my mind, my intellect),t=
he Self will not be found, for it lies
beyond cognition and cannot be reali=
sed as =91my Self =92.

Retire into solitude, analyse and see what those th=
ings are which are
cognised as mine; discard them all and transcending them=
, look for the Real
Self.

Is there any moment when the Self is not the Sel=
f? Neither is control of
mind used to gain it. I shall give you some exampl=
es:

Just as things unseen in darkness are found on its removal by means of=
 a
lamp, and are therefore said to be recovered from oblivion.

Just as a c=
onfused man forgets his purse, but remembers and locates it on
keeping his =
mind unruffled and steady, yet still says that he has gained the
lost purse=
,though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.

So also the control =
of your mind is not the cause of your Self-realisation;
though the Self is =
always there, it is not recognised by you even with a
controlled mind becau=
se you are not conversant with it.

Just as an infant tries to take hold of=
 his own reflection being unaware of
the mirror, so also common people are =
taken in by their mental reflections
in the mirror of the pure, luminous Se=
lf and are not aware of the mirror,
because they have no acquaintance with =
the Self.

The mind should be brought to the condition of a newborn baby.Th=
en he feels
as if he were separate from all gross materials and only the fe=
eling =91I am=92
persists.
