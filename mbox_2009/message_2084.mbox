Namaste Narasimha garu,

There are few things from your message which i am =
trying to link for clearly understanding this puzzel of free/fix will.

1) =
>there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, present and future; >here, =
there and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibility, >that possibilit=
y and yet another possibility - all are accessible >and fully "known" to Hi=
s self-awareness.

2)> Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is=
 certainly >something called "freewill". Within the limits imposed by the >=
reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have >a scop=
e for engaging in different actions at this time.

The above are main two p=
oints if understood and linked can give clarity.

you have brought to me a =
very FRESH Knowledge that most of Yogi's can find out one or two possibilit=
ies of future depending upon the space-time cycle zone in which their consc=
iouness can access. a really advance yogi can see more possibilities of fut=
ure events due to their access of more time cycles. BUT please explain to m=
e about the supreme cosmic being who is a sole link between Dual and Non-du=
al self. now as you have mentioned (pl. refer to no.1 above) he is all know=
er so every possibility is known to him and not only every possibility but =
even every action going to be taken in a perticular Space-time zone and wha=
t the eventual result. we call him by Naraayana/Shiva/Bhagavati/GOD/Allah/G=
anapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and many such names depending on our faiths.=
   

The point no.1 indicates that HE is all knower and point no.2 indicate=
s that Free will is certainly there at our Spac-time level. Now if ONE BEIN=
G knows everything including EXACT action and EXACT REACTION, then would it=
 be really called free will ULTIMATELY? i know that it can be argued that H=
E ONLY KNOWS but DOES NOT INTERFEAR and hence Free will exist but then what=
 is the meaning of the verses in the context of the topic...
"Mohyante Mohi=
taashchaiv Mohameshyanti chaapare..."
"Mamatvagartetimahaandhakaare Vibhraa=
mayatyetadativ Vishvam"
"Tannatra vismay kaaryo yoganidra jagatpate
Mahaama=
ayaa Hareshchaishaa tayaa sammohyate jagat"

"....Mrigtrushna bhramayati" o=
f Gita

please forgive me for wiritng all these things but it is very diffi=
cult for me to really reconcile and i think you are the only help for me.

=
Warm Regards,

Utpal

self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a spec=

t relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each othe=
