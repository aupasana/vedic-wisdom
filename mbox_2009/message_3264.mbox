Namaste,
 
Aayushya homam is performed with the Aayushya sooktam. You can f=
ind Aayushya sooktam in the following PDF file that I just uploaded:
 
http=
://vedicastrologer.org/mantras/aayushya_sooktam.pdf
 
People perform homam =
with it by simply invoking fire, doing poorvaangam and then directly offeri=
ng this sooktam in fire, and then uttaraangam. In other words, praana prati=
shthaa of the deity, panchopachaara pooja to the deity ets are not done. Yo=
u can follow such a procedure.
 
For it to be more effective, finish the 9 =
verses with 9 aahutis and then repeat the nine again. Repeat as many times =
as you can.
 
Normally, only ghee is used for this homam.
 
All the best.
 =

Best regards,
Narasimha
