|| OM TAT SAT ||
Dear Sundeep,
  I am writing an article on the 6th Tattwa,=
 that will put it all together in a coherent essence.

  Answers to your qu=
estions:

> (a) Is there a level of realization in which the 5 tattwas are =

> calm, and only the 6th is active 

1. Transfer your consciousness to you=
r Causal-body or Causal-cosmos. They are constituted of SuperEther (mind-st=
uff), which is why it is a tattva at all!

  About Causal Cosmos, Sri Yukte=
swar says in Autobiography of a Yogi:

..."The causal world is indescribabl=
y subtle," he replied. "In order to understand it, one would have to posses=
s such tremendous powers of concentration that he could close his eyes and =
visualize the astral cosmos and the physical cosmos in all their vastness-t=
he luminous balloon with the solid basket-as existing in ideas only. 

   I=
f by this superhuman concentration one succeeded in converting or resolving=
 the two cosmoses with all their complexities into sheer ideas, he would th=
en reach the causal world and stand on the borderline of fusion between min=
d and matter....

> (b) Does this state have Ahamkara or not/does it corres=
pond to any > well known chakra?

2. It doesn't have Ahamkara, but Chitta a=
s the basis of sense of I-ness. Read my previous mail on "Gyan Marg" to Nar=
asimha.

Antahkaran  Dominates sense of I-ness
            
Ahamkara - domi=
nant in Physical body/Cosmos [Adhibhautik]
Manas    - dominant in Astral bo=
dy/Cosmos   [AdhiDaivik]
Chitta   - dominant in Causal body/Cosmos   [Adhya=
tmic]

  Medulla, the 6th Chakra - presiding consciouness ISHWAR or Causal =
Macrocosmic consciousness.

r that the material 
> carrier is some combination of the 5 tattwas.

  The=
re is only one framework, only the terminologies are different. That is all=
.

Regards,
Nitish

 is active (b) Does this state have Ahamkara or not/does it correspond to a=
ny well known chakra?

  The first light is the pure mind, the mind ether or Isvara. Its modes man=
ifest as objects. Because it contains all these objects within itself it is=
 called the mind-ether. Why ether? Like ether containing objects it contain=
s the thoughts, therefore it is the mind-ether.

the physical ether though accommodating all the gross objects (the whole un=

 Were it pure, original Light, there would be no modification in it. The ma=
nokasa (mind-ether) is reflected as bhootakasa (element-ether) and objects =
are seen as being separate from the subject.

Whereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb, i.e. consciousness, then th=

Patanjalis' Chitta Vrittis' correspond to the 5 tattwas and are all happeni=
ng on the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tattwa. The normal-hu=
man- experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (finest =
