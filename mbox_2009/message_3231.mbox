Sorry to sidetrack the main issue,
but my Astrology teacher says about long=
evity of a Native is determined by past Karma and Brahma allots a count ( s=
ay a few billion life forms) for the native to kill in this life time be it=
 bacteria, microbes etc. etc. Thus a person breathing in, taking food ( kil=
ls these bacteria, microbes etc. ) fulfills his quota in this life time whi=
ch determines longevity of the native. So, a person who takes mita ( modera=
tion) in everything lives longer, less number of breaths /per minutes, less=
 food etc... But then why is the saying "Paapi Chirayu" !!! Can't seem to m=
ake sense of this saying!

Dear Rajarshi,
Do not think that I'll be offended or=
 misunderstand you to be a cruel hearted etc...
In this message, i am givin=
g only what i feel right=C2=A0as per=C2=A0me and how i think about the whol=
e issue myself. =C2=A0so pl. take that in consideration.
But to say that it=
 is=C2=A0 immoral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegeta=
rian food, is illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.
In my previous message,=
 i've clarified some points.=C2=A0 i put it=C2=A0again below:
Please do not=
 consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspective of
Spiritual/Material, G=
ood/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point in
Vegterianism is related to=
 Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)
against Adharama (Killin=
g Innocent creatures).
***
Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is goo=
d to eat totally=C2=A0vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially=
 things like havans,=C2=A0or else it conflicts with your system badly.
In m=
y opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain=
 Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not right then for me it'll r=
emain=C2=A0*Not right in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in f=
uture i succumb to challanging conditions and start eating meat but even th=
en it'll not justify and make it proper thing.
***
Dear Rajarshi, Now i hop=
e you don't get offended=C2=A0by my message. i apologise in advance for my =
bluntness.
=C2=A0your second Para and some writings in your earlier message=
 gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal=
 etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest.=C2=A0
In my opinon, if one c=
an justify eating=C2=A0popular meat of=C2=A0chicken, etc..=C2=A0then anythi=
ng under the Sun is eatable.=C2=A0 with that logic, those people who choose=
 to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even peopl=
e who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing any=
thing wrong as per the 'their' thinking.
To talk about Karma, Conditioning,=
 Culture=C2=A0etc..., and=C2=A0try to=C2=A0make quality judgements by the l=
ogic of 'Direct killing' and 'eating meat of already dead' does not go well=
 with me.=C2=A0it is=C2=A0just a philosophy to cover up.
Poeple born in Tho=
se cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I ga=
ve an example of one such person and there are few more i know. howvever th=
ey are very very very rare.
***
The above arguments are incorrect. I know s=
ome non-vegetarian people who provide such arguements,=C2=A0 but these argu=
ments=C2=A0are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of argumen=
ts.
=C2=A0I agree completely. it is childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Th=
ats how i also take it when such people talk such nonsense.
***
Lastly, i'l=
l add a=C2=A0philospohical thought. If so much of killing every hourly basi=
s, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the p=
rime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have a peacefull world wit=
hout blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect) will=
 find=C2=A0many ways=C2=A0to give it back to (in)Human societies.

<DIV>but my Astrology teacher says about longevity of a Native is determin=
ed by past Karma and Brahma allots a count ( say a few billion life forms) =
for the native to kill in this life time be it bacteria, microbes etc. etc.=
 Thus a person breathing in, taking food ( kills these bacteria, microbes e=
tc. ) fulfills his quota in this life time which determines longevity of th=
e native. So, a person who takes mita ( moderation) in everything lives lon=
ger, less number of breaths /per minutes, less food etc... But then why is =
the saying "Paapi Chirayu" !!! Can't seem to make sense of this saying!<BR>=

<DIV>Dear Rajarshi,</DIV>
<DIV>Do n=
ot think that I'll be offended or misunderstand you to be a cruel hearted e=
tc...</DIV>
<DIV>In this message, i am giving only what i feel right a=
s per me and how i think about the whole issue myself.  so pl. ta=
ke that in consideration.</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>But to say that it is  im=
moral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetarian food, i=
s illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.</STRONG><BR>In my previous message,=
 i've clarified some points.  i put it again below:</DIV>
<DIV>Pl=
ease do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspective of<BR>Spiritu=
al/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point in<BR>Vegterian=
ism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)<BR>agai=
nst Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).</DIV>
<DIV>***</DIV>
<DIV><STRON=
G>Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally veg=
etarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, =
;or else it conflicts with your system badly.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>In my opi=
nion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Inco=
rrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not right then for me it'll remain=
 *Not right in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future=
 i succumb to challanging conditions and start eating meat but even then it=
'll not justify and make it proper thing.</DIV>
<DIV>***<BR>Dear Rajarshi, =
Now i hope you don't get offended by my message. i apologise in advanc=
e for my bluntness.</DIV>
<DIV> your second Para and some writings in =
your earlier message gives me impression that you are heavily philosophisin=
g. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. </D=
IV>
<DIV>In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of =
chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable.  with that=
 logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches ar=
e perfectly alright. even people who have started eating human flesh are al=
so acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the 'their' thinking.</DI=
V>
<DIV>To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and tr=
y to make quality judgements by the logic of 'Direct killing' and 'eat=
ing meat of already dead' does not go well with me. it is just a =
philosophy to cover up.</DIV>
<DIV>Poeple born in Those cultures have becom=
e Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an example of one s=
uch person and there are few more i know. howvever they are very very very =
rare.</DIV>
<DIV>***</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>The above arguments are incorrect. =
I know some non-vegetarian people who provide such arguements,  but th=
ese arguments are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of=
 arguments.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV> I agree completely. it is childish, L=
aughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such people talk su=
ch nonsense.</DIV>
<DIV>***</DIV>
<DIV>Lastly, i'll add a philospohica=
l thought. If so much of killing every hourly basis, mostly for the sole pu=
rpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the prime mover is Human socie=
ty, then how we hope to have a peacefull world without blood shed and massa=
care. unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect) will find many ways&=
nbsp;to give it back to (in)Human societies.</DIV>

 I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share th=
em. Call me cruel hearted. <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> When the question =
of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is mos=
lty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may no=
t affect another. Same rule cannot be used to
 judge everyone.=C3=82  =
<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watchi=
ng discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts of the wor=
ld eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, "Why?". If you c=
an eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an ins=
ect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a c=
ertain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed t=
o must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be b=
orn in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slight=
est doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own cond=
itions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we th=
ink our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and the=
refore we wonder why don't others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. N=
ature has created the world diverse, and so it is.
 Everything is desh-kaal=

in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non-ve=
getarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I kn=
ow=C3=82 people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors=
 who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can=
 be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82=
 a universal logic applicable to all.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> A f=
ar better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someon=
e can make sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live =
animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generate=
d can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 =
does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetari=
an food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is quite
 acceptble =
IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you woul=

hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. T=
