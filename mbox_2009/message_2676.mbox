Namaskaram Narasimhaji,
I would like to share with you and the group my fir=
st Ganapathi homam experience. I planned to do the homam weekly on every su=
nday and finished two weeks so far.

Here is how it went.

1st Homam :  Was=
 extremely nervous on whether I will be able to sucussfully complete my lon=
g cherished dream of performing Ganapathi homam. committed lot of mistakes =
in mantras ,did not say Svahaa at the right places, lighting fire etc may b=
e because of my nervousness probably , burnt my finger while putting ahuti =
into the fire (surprisingly unlike most of the other burn wounds , this did=
 not last for more than 3 hours.. usually a burn would stay for more than 2=
-3 days...and also i realised that i had burnt my finger only when my wife =
pointed it to me.. i assume this is a good sign  :) ).. I sincerely prayed =
during the Homam conclusion to be forgiven for all the mistakes commited du=
ring the homam..

2nd Homam: This time I was very relaxed and took my owm t=
ime to make sure that I dont make any mistakes.. the homam fire burnt peace=
fully and I did not hurt myself..I was told by my wife that the room was fu=
ll of smoke which made breathing difficult and we even had couple of neighb=
ours at our doorsteps enquiring about the smoke. But again surprisingly I n=
ever felt the slightest of discomfort even though I was nearest to the homa=
m... 

So as told by many members in the group , its only practice that mak=
es one perfect.. I am very happy that I have come across this group and und=
er ur guidance I am sure eveybody will be benefited in  sadhana through hom=
am.

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
