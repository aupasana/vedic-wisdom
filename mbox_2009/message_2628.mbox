              Om Namo Narayanaya

Dear Biswajitji,

       You are right. Y=
our Lagna lord is also AK ie planet Mercury.
AK is in Kanya rasi in D9, aga=
in in own house and exalted. As per the Sages and SJC , it is seen that pla=
net Venus is posited in Simha  the 12th from AK amsa.

  Hence Goddess Maha=
lakshmi is your Ishta DEvata(ID.

May God bless you

Regards,
Mohana rangan=
