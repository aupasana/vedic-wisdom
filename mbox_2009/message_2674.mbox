Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete.

Dear Sundeep,
=A0
Let=
 me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self r=
ealized Yogi of the highest order)=A0- it maybe of some help to you.=A0He d=
id mention in details about the process of creation as he saw it.
=A0
As pe=
r him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there ca=
me the "vidhyut" of Akash. As this "Vidyut" interacted with the chaos, it p=
roduced some universal energies which are more commonly known as the univer=
sal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the "Vidyut" of vayu ( no=
ne of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the ess=
ence of the element, hence his use of the word "vidyut" and " taranga") who=
se interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in=
 this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous=
 and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in=
 33 crore possible=A0states of energy.
=A0
=A0
=A0
=A0
There is some lesson=
 in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be =
some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super strin=
g theory too, but I get ahead of myself..
=A0
=A0
This is a nice idea and I=
 would like to know more about it.
=A0
As much as I could fathom (I am no p=
hysicist, neither do I have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the=
 M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half formed. There being multiple=
 theories of the String variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-T=
heory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which 'claim to explain' in p=
arts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a correlation between this=
 and the idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetc=
hed. I can understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at=
 least the Copenhegan Interpretation),=A0non-locality etc, and the ideas of=
 Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta?!..
=A0
W=
ell, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about=
 how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited under=
stand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since=
 the M-theory is yet in a very=A0nascent stage.
=A0
The other thing one mus=
t think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics desc=
ribe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are differen=
t. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exact=
ly as reality is. 
Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that e=
veryone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really i=
s!
=A0
The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of=
 everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing=
=A0 more left to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.

Dear Rajarshi,

Not sure if I get the thrust of your point. Y=
es, sadhana is the only way to know this for sure. And so also for everythi=
ng else that is below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira e=
tc). But we do read about them (all these things e.g Atma etc), and about t=
he significance of the vedic gods anyway, dont we? They do offer a mild com=
plement to sadhana, dont they? They do help make the mind more receptive to=
ward the benefits of sadhana..

Also wanted to assure you that I really wan=
t to know the answer to the question. I am not interested in a he-said/she-=
 said type game (if perhaps that is what you were hinting at?). I am extrem=
ely curious as to why there is an order and not a parallelism, for e.g. why=
 are the mahabhutas not simultaneously formed. There is some lesson in ther=
e (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some cor=
relation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory=
 too, but I get ahead of myself..

Regards,

Sundeep
