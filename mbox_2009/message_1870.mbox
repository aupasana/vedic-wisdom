Namaste PVRji,

In your Lakshmi Homam manual, you mentioned only the first =
15 verses of Sri Suktam, while in parayana purpose, I note that there are 3=
2 verses, as per books published by Sri Ramakrishna Mutt. In the audio CDs,=
 I found that scholars have sung only the first 15 or 18 verses and rest of=
 the verses are left out.

Is that only the first 15 verses are important. =
Can you please advise? 

Thanks and Regards,
Shankar
