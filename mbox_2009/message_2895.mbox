I have an energised Sri Lakshmi yantra and thought of sharing my experience=
 with you. I have been told to keep it facing east. In my practical experie=
nce I=A0have seen sincere prayers,naivedyam is a must daily. Some websites =
mention that soon after getting an yantra; for the initial period of 40 day=
s one should do=A0 a minimum japa of one lac to see permanent good results =
(wealthy). As goddess Mahalakshmi is always seen as the goddess of wealth I=
 felt if I do the rigorous japa for 40 days that would mean I am greedy for=
 money so I didn't do it within the time frame. Rather I do a japa daily fo=
r whatever time I get.=A0Other than that I treat it just like we have a rea=
l mother at home respect,love and care.=A0Also madugu acharam (=A0I don't k=
now how to say it=A0but utmost cleanliness ) is a must.

There's a drop=

Dear Guruji, 

Namaste.

I seek your kind advise and guidanc=
e on the care and pooja for yantra.

I obtained a Sri Mahalakhmi yantra aft=
er a homam dedicated to Sri Lakshmi. And I have been told that yantras need=
 pooja to keep them energised.

I would really appreciate your kind advise =
as to:-

1. pooja procedures
2. mantras to be recited
3. general care instr=
uctions (e.g. placement of yantra etc.)

Thank you very much.

Om Shanti Om=
 Shanti Om Shanti
