Namaste Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
Normally when we give ahutis for 108 times, do w=
e use the vausat on the 108th ahuti or start vausat from the 100th ahuti? K=
indly clarify.
=C2=A0
Vishnu sahashranama homa and homa of lord Shiva would=
 be wonderful. I would be very keen on doing homas for lord shiva after som=
e time. I had this strong desire as in a temple one day for doing the same =
but then I have no clue how to do it.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi



The=
 upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste,

I am =
glad. Good luck for future.

(1) Yes.

(2) Yes. If you say atharva seersham=
 8 times, you are putting 8x10 aahutis. 
First 79 aahutis are with swaaha a=
nd the final aahuti in the 8th time 
chanting (80th aahuti) is with vaushat=
.

(3) Yes, flower petals and fruits or fruit slices can be offered. But ma=
ke 
sure that your fire is big enough to burn them. I am not sure the what =
they 
signify.

(4) Yes, you can. You can give give different items as aahu=
ti in each 
swaahaa.

(5) Vishnu sahasra naamam (1000 names of Vishnu) is a=
 very powerful prayer. 
It was revealed to the world bu Dharmaraja and Bhis=
hma just before Kali yuga 
came, because it was to play an important role i=
n Kali yuga. My guru asked 
me to spread Vishnu sahasra naama homam. That w=
ill come soon. I will give 
one for Shiva also.

Best regards,
Narasimha
