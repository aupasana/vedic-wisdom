pronounced as "gong".

 However, the problem with the former is that most people cannot
pronounce =
it correctly. The correct pronunciation is to start saying
"hreeng" and sto=
p just when you are about to say "g". The sound "g"
should not be explicit =
at all. To pronounce that nasal "n(g)" correctly,
you have to think that yo=
u are going to say "ng", but stop just short of
"g". It is not easy. Most p=
eople end up pronouncing the "g" sound a bit.
Instead of making that mistak=
e, it is better to just stick to "hreem".
