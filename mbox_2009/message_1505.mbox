Namaste Narasimhaji,

I understand that you have been receiving several req=
uests for several tasks, including Homa manuals and Puja manuals. I also un=
derstand that there is only so much time that one can dedicate to any task,=
 particularly when the number of tasks keeps on growing exponentially. 

I =
am sorry to be bothering you with one more such request, this for a Sri Ram=
a Taraka Homa vidhi for this upcoming Ugadi and Sri Rama Navami. I am plann=
ing for a Sri Rama Taraka Homa on Chaitra Shukla Dashami day. But please do=
 not feel obligated to do this task for me. Please take as much time as you=
 want for this, even if it goes beyond the Chaitra month. It is a noble tas=
k and I appreciate your contributions very much. Thank you.

Regards,
Naras=
imhaswamy Banavara

Namaste,
=A0
I will try to make it available in future. In fact, there =
are many requests for a Satya Narayana vratam manual also. With His blessin=
gs, it should happen this year.
=A0
I am glad you are performing Mahalakshm=

BTW, another gentleman called Arnab has been asking for some m=

suggest doing the laghu paddhati.

Best regards,
Narasimha

atyanarayana Homa Vidhi

Namaskaram.

I was wondering if there is available=
 a homa vidhi for Satyanarayana to be performed on Purnima. I know that oft=
en, alongside the puja, a separate homa is conducted for Sri Satyanarayana,=
 and while I have the puja vidhi I do not have the homa vidhi.
=A0
I have j=
ust joined the group and am enjoying learning so much from all of the sadha=
kas on the list. 

My humble and deeply grateful prostrations to Shri Naras=
imha on this divine seva he is performing. I have been learning and=A0condu=
cting=A0the Lakshmi Homa for the past few months, and it is a very fulfilli=
ng puja and I am so grateful that this auspicious and potent form of sadhan=
a is being made accessible to the public in such a clear and authentic form=
.

Warm regards,
Aditi
