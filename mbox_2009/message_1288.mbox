Na=
maste friends,

Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snipp=
ets from an 
interview posted on her website. Please see below.

It is inte=
resting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
is inte=
resting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
show =
what is truth" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
is s=
imilar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
him =
during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

She told him that many people are an=
d will be born who will perform a short 
fire ritual on a regular basis, es=
tablish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
world and also make quick spiritu=
al progress individually in that process. 
Shree Maa's statement about what=
 Ramakrishna told her is along similar 
lines.

My guru was also told by Mo=
ther that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
should be established arou=
nd the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day. These places do no=
t need to be near any temples or famous places and 
can be anywhere. The ri=
tual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
need to offer silk sa=
rees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
offerings is enough, b=
ut it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
few such centres are =
established, it will apparently lead to a chain of 
events that will help r=
e-establish sanatana dharma.

Though not 3 times a day, these people have d=
one a Chandi homam everyday for 
3 years in the same place and finished 100=
0 such homas. That is fantastic! 
It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas =
that creates energy and brings 
deities to a place. While several ancient t=
emples are without any divine 
presence these days, new places of divine pr=
esence may be created by pure 
souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establ=
ishing dharma in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Sh=
ata Chandi homam during which 
Mother appeared and gave instructions to my =
guru on spreading homam was 
taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and =
the time of sankalpa was within 
a few minutes from the actual Tithi Praves=
ha time of the birth anniversary. 
All of this was a coincidence and we wer=
e unaware of this significance when 
we decided the muhurta. It is interest=
ing to know that Ramakrishna did 
mention fire ceremonies specifically to s=
omebody and that his words are 
similar to the words of Mother.

Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha
