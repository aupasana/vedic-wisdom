He who has destroyed the ego is alone the true Sannyasin and the true
Brahm=
in; but, hard indeed is the complete destruction of the heavy burden of
the=
 ego borne by those Sannyasins who feel =93I belong to the highest ashrama=
=94
and by those brahmins who feel =93I belong to the highest caste=94.

Sa=
dhu Om: The true Sannyasa is the renunciation of the ego and the true
Brahm=
inhood is the realization of Brahman [i.e., the Self],and thus both the
wor=
ds Sannyasin and Brahmin mean one who has destroyed the ego. But as
ashrama=
s [orders of life] and varnas [castes] pertain only to the body, only
those=
 who identify themselves with their bodies can feel that they belong to
the=
 highest ashrama [known as Sannyasa] or to the highest varna [known as
Brah=
minhood]. Such feelings naturally create pride and strengthen the ego,
and =
therefore the higher the ashrama or varna, the heavier the burden of the
eg=
o, and the harder its eradication.

One who sees otherness and multiplicity=
 cannot become a Parppan merely
because he has learnt the four Vedas. But o=
ne who sees his own [ego=92s] death
is the true Parppan; the other one [i.e=
. the caste Brahmin] is inwardly
shamed, being despised by the Wise.

Micha=
el James: Parppan literally means =91a seer=92, that is, one who knows the
=
truth, but it is commonly used to mean a caste brahmin.

The complete eradi=
cation of the ego is indeed very hard when even in the
case of Kannappa, wh=
ose love for Lord Shiva was so great that he plucked out
his own eyes and p=
lanted them on the Lord=92s face, there remained [until that
moment] a trac=
e of body attachment [i.e. ego] in the form of his pride
concerning his bea=
utiful bright eyes.

Sadhu Om: At times Sri Bhagavan used to reveal some in=
formation which was
not given by the scriptures and Puranas such as:

a) ho=
w, in the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna began His teachings with the
doctrines=
 of Ajata and Advaita, but then condescendingly came down to
various stages=
 of Dwaita, and how He carefully used words which, though
suited to Arjuna=
=92s limited grasping power, also gives room for well-ripened
aspirants to =
discover, even now, the motive behind those words.

b) how at first, Sri Da=
kshinamurti answered His disciples=92 doubts with wise
and convincing repli=
es before he took to his method of teaching through
Silence.

c) the follow=
ing variation on the story of Kannappa: Kannappa was proud of
his eyes, whi=
ch were very beautiful, so, according to the divine saying, =93I
will forci=
bly deprive my true devotee of all his possessions so that his
mind may alw=
ays cling to me=94,

Lord Shiva tested Kannappa by making him offer even hi=
s treasured and
enviable eyes to the Lord. Thus even his slight attachment =
to his body was
removed and he was absorbed in Shiva. As this information a=
bout Kannappa=92s
attachment to his beautiful eyes was not revealed by the =
Puranas, but only
by Sri Bhagavan Ramana, we can infer that He is none othe=
r than Shiva, who
faced Kannappa at that time.
