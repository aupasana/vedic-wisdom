Om Gurave Namah

Namasthe Narasimha Garu

I just performed my first Ganapathi Homam using elements of the long and the
laghu padhathi. Thank you for the manuals.

Have a few questions:

1. When doing the Anujnaa, I had thought about you among the Gurus, since
you have provided this knowledge to everyone. I hope it is OK.
2. Does the count matter when giving the ahuthi, I counted mentally upto 120
or so but did not keep track after it. I was thinking keeping prepared
myself the next time with
 say 108 almonds.
3. I have been inspired by your words lately, and have been reading your
posts from 2002 Nov/Dec. I have also met you at the 2006 SJC West Coast
conference.
Can you accept me as your sishya. Here is my birth data - August 10, 1972
6:33 PM Bangalore, INDIA.

Respectfully

Srinivasa Sunchu
