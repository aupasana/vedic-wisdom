Disassociating from lowercast people ...
If my understanding is correct, th=
ere is lowercast. There are 4 casts.
Brahmana - The knowledge seekers and k=
nowledge preachers
Kshatriya - The protectors
Vaisya - Business
Sudra - The=
 laborers

None of these were talked as lowercast people.

Untouchability i=
s not advocated by our Rshis!
We ready commenteries written in English and =
make our judgements.
I am not sure of the original verses (and I am not tha=
t qualified to interpret them even if I knew them), but, Manu may have mean=
t, a Brahmin who associates with other cast people (here association is not=
 merely by touching or talking with them but doing what they do and behave =
like them) may not be fit to be called a brahmin.

How ever, I see exceptio=
ns ever for this. Parasuram did behave like a kshatriya. How ever, we still=
 consider to be a great brahmin.

Best regards,
Vijay
