Namate 

Very True, Tinitus can give humming sound, I also strongly recomme=
nd a consult with ENT specialist and may be CT Scan of what the doctor may =
want to check.

I know in one instance the doctor did go for CT Scan of bra=
in to make sure nothing is wrong. The native does have Tinitus and his doct=
or did suggest hearing loss too. I am not sure of the cure, if there is one=
 I can also recommend to this native.

Does Tinitus have any relationship w=
ith Naad Yoga or yoga or sound?
The sounds are like bee hum or water flowin=
g or oozing out in stream etc.

As Narasimha suggests it is also some signs=
 of elevated pran too, but
one should always check with doctors to be very =
safe.

Best Regards
Mitesh
