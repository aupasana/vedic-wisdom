Dear Rajarshi,

Thank you for the information about the Yogi.

Next, regard=
ing the connection between physics and mahabhutas: You have to proceed care=
fully and logically to understand the correlation. You have to think like a=
n atheistic scientist to anticipate how the correlation between physics and=
 mahabhutas will manifest itself to him! First, let's take the core axiom o=
f all science. Science takes it as an axiom that since all perception is th=
rough the senses, the universe is composed *solely* of that which can be se=
nsed (and nothing else). We sense space, we sense time, we see, we feel, we=
 taste, we smell, we hear. So all these percepts are real, nothing else is.=
 If the grand superset of all percepts can be shown to follow a strict set =
of laws, then science can actually rest pretty easy, no? If everything fits=
, then why adopt any new-fangled more complex theories of reality when ever=
ything is fully explainable using a simpler theory.

So the question before=
 all physicists has long been - Can they actually explain everything about =
the grand superset of all percepts? First there was Newton who showed the v=
ery clear laws of motion (so no magic there, he showed). Then there were a =
whole bunch of chemistry types who saw that no matter how much you divide m=
atter, it's still there. It combines with other matter and makes different =
compounds, but atoms are not being messed with. Are atoms perceivable - no =
they're not, but collect them in a huge bunch and you'll see them, divide t=
hem into individual atoms and you cant see them, but they're still there be=
cause you can collect them all over again. And then Einstein came along and=
 showed the equivalence of energy and matter, thereby leading even more cre=
dence to the fact that the sum total of energy and matter is always conserv=
ed, and that too according to strict laws. Where is the need to construct a=
n imaginary God or listen to the outdated Vedas which clearly say - there i=
s more to it than the senses can perceive?

(Still in the atheistic scienti=
st frame of mind) The remaining frontiers to complete the understanding of =
all nature were the big bang (how did it come about?), black holes (what la=
ws are active inside them?), and a theory of particles that unifies gravity=
 with the rest of matter. Regarding this third part, try as they might, the=
y just have not been able to come up with some common denominator that allo=
ws gravity and the rest of matter to follow the *same* set of strict laws. =
Then, along come these string theorists and show that if the underlying thi=
ng is assumed to be this teensy weensy string, then maybe we can make thing=
s work (i.e. have a uniform set of laws for gravity and matter). But the ho=
w of that is what makes this discussion interesting to this forum. They nee=
ded to give this string no less than 11-dimensions(!) to make things work.
=


Now lets zoom in and carefully analyze this point. 11 dimensions? What is=
 a dimension that is not part of the 4 perceivable ones? If you listen care=
fully to some of these scientists, the reason they created the remaining 7 =
is that that they needed to "give" these strings 7 extra degrees of freedom=
. They didnt actually see any dimension, but they needed to postulate these=
 "degrees of freedom". A degree of freedom is simply a *non-perceivable* di=
mension i.e. where their string, or parts of it, can exist without followin=
g laws of these 4 dimensions, yet obey some higher laws (e.g. conservation =
of matter/energy). The interesting and most crucial part is right here - th=
ey have finally been forced to give these matter-subdivisions (strings) non=
-sensory reality. In other words, they have been forced to admit to the exi=
stence of a non-sensory reality, which is precisely what the Vedas have bee=
n harping about all along - that Prakriti gets perceivable by the jnanendri=
yas only after panchikarana of the tattwas into the mahabhutas but neverthe=
less, it maintains non-sensory existence even at the tattwa level!

So in e=
xactly this sense, I am saying that physics is being led the way of the ved=
ic text, if only through their equations!!

Hope this makes sense,

Regards=
,

Sundeep

 The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical ph=
ysics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality=
? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reali=
ty. It need not be exactly as reality is.
