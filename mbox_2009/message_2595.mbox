Namaste, 
=A0
There are few questions that are lingering in my mind for qui=
te sometime.=A0I hope this is the right forum to discuss about avataras and=
 dharmas restored by these avataras. If not, please ignore my mail and re-d=
irect me (if possible) to a right forum. =A0
=A0
Question 1: (Lord Ramachan=
dra's dharma)
=A0
Lord Ramachandra has followed the orders of His father an=
d accepted to go on exile to Vanavasa. 
Bring a kshatriya, shouldn't He hav=
e said to father that His dharma is to rule Ayodhya than spending his time =
in aranyas? 
=A0
(The great warrior Arjuna wanted to take to do Tapas for h=
e had felt that he is not doing the right thing by killing his near and dea=
r ones...but was prevailed over by Lord Krishna on Kshatriya dharma argumen=
t)
=A0
How is it that Lord Ramachandra has fulfilled his dharma by going to=
 forests and Arjuna neglected his dharma by not killing his relatives?
=A0
=
Question 2:
=A0
Whenever dharma is being abused, Lord comes over to Bhu Lok=
a and sets things in order. egs...Lord Rama of Treta Yuga, Lord Krishna of =
Dwapara yuga and when they leave after performing their duties, dharma is s=
et right and they have achieved their objectives. 
=A0
Does that mean that =
before they depart, the dharma of THAT yuga is restored rather than FULL dh=
arma? e.g, Lord Krishna before departing, restored 2-padas of dwaparaYuga d=
harma and left, instead of restoring the dharma completely? Do avataras hav=
e to CONSIDER yuga-dharma also when restoring dharma? Can't they restore it=
 COMPLETELY? If so, do Kalki have to restore the dharma of Kali-Yuga rather=
 than restoring it completely? 
=A0
Question 3:
=A0
Why did avataras have t=
o happen only in Bharatavarsha? 
Why did they not happen anywhere else in t=
he world? 
=A0
=A0
Thanks & Regards,
--Murahari
