My mail may be out of context in this thread. I noticed few statements, whi=
ch I thought, I will understand a bit more deeper.

I remembering seeing a =
statement similar to "Agni has I-ness too. Otherwise, Agni does not do what=
 he does" (from Narasimha).

I thought, Agni is a deva. Is Agni aware of th=
e ultimate truth? Does he get entangled in the karma? If Agni, is a jeevan =
muktha, then, even if he shares the same I-ness of the Brahman, can not he =
act and do things since he knows Brahman wants him to do those?

 about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as "=
I". In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even "see=
" onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happenin=
g to "me". So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, the=
re is still a notion of "I am this" (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara o=
r I-ness or ego principle.

etween the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense =

of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (R=

ra including all other ideas.
> > > > > > 
> > > > > > Individuality of a c=
ausal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because "What exists =
as a part cannot be the whole". Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of th=

t of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring a=
nother idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere w=

 are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each ot=
