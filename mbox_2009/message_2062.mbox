Dear Narasimha,

Namaskar.


Thank you for graciously answering  my questi=
ons. I understand that you are not able to type out (Phonetically or otherw=
ise) the Gayatri mantra, however does this prohibition apply to the "Pre Ga=
yatri" ? This is actually something I was most confused about as to pronunc=
iation:

"Om bhur bhuva swaha",  I have also seen as "Om bhu bhuvaha swaha"=
.  Does the "r" in "bhur" get vocalized? Is "bhuva" correct or is it the la=
ter and in both instances regarding "bhuva" or "bhuvaha" is the "u" pronoun=
ced like "boo" or more like in "but".

Thank you very much.
