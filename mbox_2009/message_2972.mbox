 24th May, 1949

You remember, till 1943, in the old hall there used to be =
a door on the
southern side opposite to where Bhagavan used to sit on the s=
ofa and a
window in the southern wall
which is now converted into a door.

=
Devotees used to enter by the southern door, have a darshan of Bhagavan who=

is the incarnation of Dakshinamurthy and go out by the northern door.

Som=
e ladies used to sit on the southern side opposite to Bhagavan. As time
pas=
sed, the number of visitors increased and ladies with their children
began =
sitting there. The children naturally began to create some
nuisance.Besides=
 that, from 1943 onwards, the number of visitors of all
types increased sti=
ll more.

Moreover, some poor ladies were coming with their children to pro=
strate and
the children were urinating there. The mothers do not get even a=
 cloth to
wipe it out; and even if a cloth was given, some of the modern la=
dies would
not take the trouble to clean the place. Therefore, Bhagavan=92s=
 attendants
had to clean it up.

They were tired and vexed at this and thou=
ght of preventing such uncivilised
people from coming into the hall. Bhagav=
an, however, would not, under any
circumstances, agree to it.

Hence, they =
began thinking of preventing ladies from sitting in the hall and
making
arr=
angements for their sitting in the verandah only.

At last, one day, they w=
ent to Bhagavan and told him that they would make
seating
arrangements for =
ladies outside. Bhagavan thereupon asked why men should sit
in the hall if =
women could not sit there.

The attendants stated the difficulties they wer=
e experiencing in looking
after the ladies that come and go. Bhagavan said,=
 =93What work is there in the
hall even for Bhagavan? It will be all right =
if he sits under the almond
tree, which is opposite.

There will then be no=
 trouble or worry for anybody, whatever the children
may do.=94 When he sai=
d that, they gave up all their attempts to isolate the
ladies.

Instead, th=
e window on one side was replaced by the door on the other side
and vice-ve=
rsa. After that, the ladies got their seating place opposite to
Bhagavan=92=
s feet.

A similar incident happened in 1946.The people used to wander abou=
t the town
and so when they came to Bhagavan=92s presence very much tired, =
some used to
squat on the floors with legs outstretched; some used to discu=
ss their
affairs in loud voices and some used to lie down and snore.

That =
used to happen between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Mothers used to sleep while
breas=
t-feeding the children and the other children used to wander and play
about=
 everywhere. When attempts were made to send such people away, it seems
Bha=
gavan said, =93Poor people! They must have wandered about a good deal. They=

are now taking some rest. How could you drive them away? Let them stay on.=
=94

Krishnaswami and others had to clean the places themselves. Unable to =
put up
with that nuisance any longer, Krishnaswami was requesting Bhagavan =
to sit
in the hall only. Bhagavan did not agree.

Krishnaswami: =93Who will=
 tidy up the nuisance committed by the children?=94

Bhagavan: =93It should=
 be all right if their mothers are asked to clean it up
themselves and are =
requested to be careful thereafter.=94

Bhagavan: =93Poor people! They come=
 here only to see Swami; and they get all
the required conveniences here.=
=94

One day, Bhagavan saw a poor man struggling under a tree as he could n=
ot get
his share of the food. Next day, when the gong was struck,Bhagavan g=
ot up
and went to the tree where the poor people had gathered, stood there =
and
said, =93If you do not give them food first, I will not come to the din=
ing
hall at all.

I will stand under the tree along with these people, stre=
tch out my hands
for food like them, and when I am given a ball of food, I =
will eat it, go
straight to the hall and sit there.=94 From that day onward=
s, it is only after
food is sent to the poor, they strike the gong in the d=
ining hall.
