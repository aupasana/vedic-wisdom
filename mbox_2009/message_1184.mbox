,it also seen
with my kids.When they preparing for exam for next day they g=
etting
sleep very earlier than regular day,but watching a interesting film
=
they did not got sleep even up to 2am.

What are the reason?Lack of interes=
t in the subject or some thing
else?It is related to concentration power an=
d ability how to over come
from this sleepiness at the time of concentratio=
n?

Thanks,

M.S.Bohra

Just become aware of them and tell yourself to focus on the
mantra. It is *=
natural* for the mind to be thinking of those bad
thoughts. By being aggrav=
ated or frustrated, you are only increasing
the distraction. It is like pic=
king fight with a heckler who
interrupts a speech you are giving or a song =
you are singing. Become
aware and move on. If you pick a fight with the hec=
kler it does more
harm than the original heckling!

Of course, the distraction will keep coming a=
gain and again. But the
best option is to tell your mind to focus on the ma=
ntra each time you
are aware of the distraction. Do NOT get frustrated. As =
you keep doing
this over and over and over, the heckler may decide to shut =
up.
Similarly, as you ignore distractions of the mind, eventually oneday a

pleasant accident will happen and mind will achieve absolute focus on
the m=
antra, with no other thoughts! THAT is when you experience the
mantra and d=
eity. Until then, it is a rehearsal.

That one thing can be the sound of the mantra or an ima=

you have in your mind or a thought that "so and so deity is=
 supreme. I
am an insignificant servant" etc. Try to focus your mind on tha=
t one

any frustration or sadness or anger or disappointment.

also agree with this mail. I feel I have double minds. One
is reading Chand=
ipath or doing Japam and other mind is thinking on
various thoughts. Is it =
possible that we have two minds at a time?
Because when we think on other i=
ssues while reading Chandipath, the
first mind reading Path is not at all s=
topped. Path is going on mentally.
