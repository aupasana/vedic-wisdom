Namaste Rajarshi,

i am compel to write on your message!. my free wheeling =
thoughts are hereunder.

Let us take case of Ramanmaharshi in nutshell. He =
chose the path to find out "Who am i?" ("Naan Yaar?"). in other words -self=
 realisation. he finally realised the self and understood personally that t=
here is nothing but self. it only is. one without second which Adi Shanka a=
nd many others have equivivocally stated earlier.

Now one important point =
to note in case of Raman Maharashi which can easily go unnoticed by some. I=
've read that one person came to Ramana's Ashram and stayed with him for so=
me time in the hope that he will be able to see live form of his chosen dei=
ty which was Bhagavan Shree Ramchandra. It is mentioned that when he was ta=
king leave of Maharshi, he finally saw Shri Rama in Maharshi and was overjo=
yed and satisfied. (I've given this episode out of my memory so please excu=
se me if some details are not exactly correct)

If we scrutinise this incid=
ent with more intrest than it suggests us few very important things.
* Thou=
gh Raman Maharashi is generally regarded as Self Realised saint and chiefly=
 taught self realisation to people, he was not UNAWARE of "Forms of GODS" i=
n the plane of Duality. or else he would not have satisfied the devotee by =
showing him the form of Sri Rama.

Who knows?....during the mind-blowing Sa=
adhana which Maharshi did for many years for Self realisation, he would hav=
e by all chances, also realised many aspect of the self such as Forms of Go=
ds and goddesses, and many other aspect which we even haven't heard of.

no=
w can we say hear that Raman was only a Self Realised and NOT God Realised.=


***

If we look at Thakur's life chronolgy, He seems to have first Realis=
ed 'Kali' in her Human form. we can say that he realised God (If we conside=
r form of Mother Kali as God). same way he realised Gods in different forms=
 such as Rama and Krishna.

Just turn our attention to his Advait Sadhana u=
nder guidance of Totapuri ji and we know that he was established in Brahman=
 aspect in just 3 days and remain in that state for almost 6 months afterwo=
rds. so he experienced the 'Ekmevaadwitiya'.

so now can we say that he was=
 God Realised and not self realised?. actually in my thinking it is not cor=
rect to imagine for Spiritual giants like Shankara, Budhha, Ramana, Thakur,=
 Jesus, Gnyaaneshwar etc..knew only one aspect of supreme. i think they kne=
w many aspects which are poular amongst us and may be some more also which =
are yet not known to us. for them These two words (GOD & SELF) may not make=
 any sense at all.

But for ordinary mortals like me, i think that there is=
 some difference still and the difference may remain. what i mean here is s=
uppose i am Shiva Bhakta or Mahalakshmi Bhakta and i do intense saadhana to=
 meet them, see them, talk to them in person and i may eventually realised =
them with their popular forms BUT if i, for any reasons stopped there then =
for me Self Realsiations will still be far away. like Thakur said do not st=
op and keep going forward and you will find one after the other more precio=
us wealth.
may be END is self realisation or merging in to Brahman. I don't=
 want get dragged in to Dwait, Adwait and vishistaadvait debate.

My Thakur=
 used gto say Kali-Krishna and Brahman are the same !

Warm Regards,

Utpal=
