Respected Narasimhaji,
I pray to Jagadajanani to enable us to fructify the =
vision now unfolding through the culture of Homam.
As Pujya Ashwinji,Mitesh=
ji and other seekers will agree-Gujarat (and Maharashtra,too) never disappo=
ints Saadhakas.....I have thought of some 'Sankalpam'... 
Humble regards,

Namaste Ashwin ji,
=C2=A0
My guru's idea is to start=C2=A0fou=
r such centers 
in east, west, north and=C2=A0south parts of India and then=
=C2=A0establish one 
in Ujjain.
=C2=A0
The idea with each center is as foll=
owing: It 
should be in some peaceful and calm place that is easily accessi=
ble by modern 
transportation and yet a little away from the hustle and bus=
tle of modern life. 
There need not be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a=
 few acres of land (for 
possible expansion in future) and construct a homa=
 kundam built in open space 
with four pillars on the four sides and a high=
 roof on the top to protect from 
rain. The area is open on all the four si=
des and covered only on the top. Close 
to it, a small one or two room stru=
cture is built to store 
materials.
=C2=A0
A priest or a sadhaka is employe=
d. His main 
qualification is that he should be a sincere devotee of the Mo=
ther and 
interested in a simple lifestyle dedicated to Her. His job is to =
do one Chandi 
homam in the morning, one more in forenoon, have lunch, rela=
x in the afternoon 
and do one more Chandi homam in the evening. Keep doing=
 it day in and day out. 
There are no idols to worship and no other rituals=
 to do.
=C2=A0
This=C2=A0will pretty much take up all his time and 
hence e=
nough money should be arranged to take care of the priest and his family. 
=
If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi homam, that is no probl=
em. 
He can be trained. But, the most important thing is that he should be =
committed 
to this and devoted to the Mother. If one has the basic simplici=
ty, innocence, 
devotion=C2=A0and purity, other things will fall in place b=
y 
themselves.
=C2=A0
Buying of the land and construction of room and 
homa=
 kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Salary of the priest=
 
and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing expense. This =
project 
requires a good amount of money and energy.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
 *
=C2=A0
After a center is established and sadhana 
progresses in each cen=
ter, slowly the presence of Mother will be established 
there. Once that ha=
ppens, the sadhaka will start making faster progress. As he 
becomes purer =
and purere, the sadhana will generate more and more 
energy.
=C2=A0
After e=
stablishing 4 other centers, a center in 
Ujjain is to be started. The sadh=
ana being done at the Chandi homam centers will 
have a catalytic influence=
 on the homam movement and many many people will start 
doing different kin=
ds of homas around the world. This will have a major impact 
on dharma in t=
he world. That is what he was told.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
I did no=
t want to force or impose on anybody. So 
this has waited. When the time co=
mes, people who will make this happen will come 
and take charge.
=C2=A0
Ti=
me has probably not yet come for Ujjain. But if 
there is a village in Guja=
rat or Maharashtra where you can do this, please 
consider. But please real=
ize that this requires money commitment and also a 
committed sadhaka.
=C2=
=A0
Best 
regards,
Narasimha

                              Please see below.=


It is interesting that 
                              she considers Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa as her guru. 
                              It 
is inter=
esting that Ramakrishna told her 
                              she had to =
"do fire ceremonies and 
show what 
                              is truth"=
 and "at that time the whole world will 
                              be p=
eace". This 
is similar to what my guru was 
                              =
told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
him 
                          =
    during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.

She 
                           =
   told him that many people are and will be born who 
                    =
          will perform a short 
fire ritual on a regular 
                 =
             basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
           =
                   
world and also make quick spiritual progress 
         =
                     individually in that process. 
Shree Maa's 
          =
                    statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along 
   =
                           similar 
lines.

My guru was also told by 
     =
                         Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam =

                              
should be established around the world, whe=
re 
                              Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day. Thes=
e 
                              places do not need to be near any temples =
or 
                              famous places and 
can be anywhere. The r=
itual 
                              need not be elaborate. For example, th=
ere is no 
                              
need to offer silk sarees etc in =
fire. A 
                              simple ritual with bare minimum 
off=
erings is 
                              enough, but it needs to be perform=
ed 3 times 
                              everyday. When a 
few such centre=
s are 
                              established, it will apparently lead t=
o a chain of 
                              
events that will help re-estab=
lish sanatana 
                              dharma.

Though not 3 times a =
day, these 
                              people have done a Chandi homam e=
veryday for 
3 
                              years in the same place and f=
inished 1000 such 
                              homas. That is fantastic! =

It is the sadhana 
                              and purity of sadhakas th=
at creates energy and 
                              brings 
deities to a p=
lace. While several 
                              ancient temples are with=
out any divine 
                              
presence these days, new pla=
ces of divine 
                              presence may be created by pur=
e 
souls engaged 
                              in selfless sadhana for est=
ablishing dharma in the 
                              world.

As I mention=
ed earlier, the sankalpa 
                              of the Shata Chandi=
 homam during which 
Mother 
                              appeared and gav=
e instructions to my guru on 
                              spreading homam=
 was 
taken on Ramakrishna' s 
                              birth annivers=
ary and the time of sankalpa was 
                              within 
a f=
ew minutes from the actual Tithi 
                              Pravesha ti=
me of the birth anniversary. 
All of 
                              this wa=
s a coincidence and we were unaware of this 
                              =
significance when 
we decided the muhurta. It 
                            =
  is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
                            =
  
mention fire ceremonies specifically to 
                              s=
omebody and that his words are 
similar to the 
                           =
   words of Mother.

T=

with four pillars on the four sides and a high roof on the top to pr=

t my guru was 
                              told by Divine Mother when she=
 appeared to <br>him

imum <br>offerings is 
                              enough, but it needs t=
o be performed 3 times 
                              everyday. When a <br>=
few such centres are 
                              established, it will ap=
