There is no difference in the number of threads in  yagnopaveetams.
Brahmac=
hari wears one single yagnopaveetam. married people(Grahastas)
wear two. A =
third yagnopaveetam is  worn by  some married people in
place of the third =
peace of cloth required to be worn by grahastas. 
There could be difference=
 in the quality of thread such as thickness
etc. Sanyasis discard yagnopave=
etham at the time of entering Sanyasa
ashrama.
