I was wondering what is the basis to prohibit close relatives of a dead per=
son from doing religious activities?

What are scriptures that prescribe it=
 and what are the levels of this (in Telugu we call it maila. Basically for=
 few days after death of a clsoe relative, one should not perform pujas etc=
.).

Also, can we do Japam/Homam/Go to temple etc.

If I touch a person in =
maila, should I take bath? Why?

Also, during Grahanam, we are advised not =
to eat any thing cooked before grahanam unless it was covered with darbhas.=
 Any sceintific explanation for this?

Best regards,
Vijay
