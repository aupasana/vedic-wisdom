namaste,

To tell you my version, I did CP (Chandi Paath) recitation for co=
nsecutive 108 days. That included everything as described in the most books=
 for instance "Gita Press". 108 Times Navaarna Mantra (Twice) is also inclu=
ded.

after that I found my Guru and started Havan since the Navaraatri sam=
e year and doing it on regular basis since then (if one considers that a gr=
eat benefit). I met a kind priest (a kali bhakta) during the Navaraatri who=
 suggested that 13 chapters are suffice if one recites every day and accept=
ing that i recite 13 chapters every day since some 8 months now. That is my=
 Daily Food. Appetizers and deserts, i take occasionally!

Not to boast any=
thing here. Just to put an example in front of you if it is of any help at =
the risk of my own loss.
Just to wrap it off - Even one chapter each day wi=
ll also do. i find nothing compulsary except enthusiasm and dedication and =
love for Jagadambaa. every other detail is secondary.

Best Regards,

Utpal=
