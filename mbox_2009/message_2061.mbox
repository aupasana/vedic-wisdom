I liked your analogy of multiple versions of a movie however my u=
nderstanding is that there is nothing called Free will in truest sense. eve=
rything is pre-ordined. anything and everything is shoot in advance. even i=
f multiple versions are recorded, which version is actually going to be pla=
yed is also fixed. it is all FIXED.

bestest regards,
