Hello Rajarshiji,
                 U said in your post about - "karmas burn=
s away 
which r represented by wood and offerings one make".

             =
     What do u mean by karmas represented by wood ? Are 
this special karma=
s ? It means one have to do offerrings of such 
things which r based on one=
s karmas, like i have brahmin curse and 
very bad Grahamallika yoga, so i h=
ave to add something special 
ingredients to offer in agni inorder to get r=
id of that 
sufferrrings.What are your ways and Shri Narsimha's thinking on=
 this 
topic ? please write me few things.

                  BY the way ka=
rmas in itself indicates sort of 
debt, akind of negativities so it must be=
 washedoff. On otherhand 
its actually dharma which is positive thing to ac=
quire.

please all scholars present here, write few lines on this topic.

t=
hanks,
dheeraj
