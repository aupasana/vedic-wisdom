Pranam Narasimhaji,

thankyou for your response and insights.

Some days ba=
ck...in fact soon after writing the message...i went thru the detailed proc=
edure on mahaganapati homam and found many useful tips on rituals...includi=
ng tarpana. Before that i went thru the detailed procedure for tarpana in t=
he manual and found it quite daunting. But for some reason i wanted to pour=
 water on my hand. Sometimes one cannot explain these urges...sometimes the=
y appear to be too irrational. i read about the tarpanam with milk in the h=
omam manual and have already started doing this.

you are right that the at=
titude with which we invite the atithi is what is important...the way we in=
vite him / the rituals are secondary.

why i asked the somewhat stupid ques=
tion about invoking the deity is that i have not felt the atithi walk into =
my home. i may not have invited him sincerely enough. maybe as the purifica=
tion takes place and the heart opens up more to these things the atithi may=
 start coming even when he is not invoked / invited thru rituals :)

till s=
uch time i think i will continue waiting...and watching....even if it takes=
 many lifetimes!

thankyou.


p.s.

what i have definitely felt is the kind=
ness of the thoughts of the members of this forum.
