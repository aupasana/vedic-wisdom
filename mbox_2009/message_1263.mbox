Namaste Rajarshi,

for sure i don't have answer for your question. I just f=
inished the 
Chani Paath. What i read is 13 chapters and then 'Kunjika Stot=
ra'to 
conclude.

Kunjika Stotra says two things which creates some confusi=
on if you go 
by letral menaing:

* Yen Mantra Prabhaven ChandiJapo Shubho =
Bhavet:
  (With the power of this mantra, Chandi Path becomes     
Auspicio=
us/Fruitfull)

* KunjikaPaathMatren DurgaPaatham Phalam Labhet:
(Only by re=
citing Kunjika Stotra, one can get Fruit of Chandi paath)

The former one s=
ays that Kunjika Stotra will make Chandi Paath a 
Success which means that =
it is a recitation in addition to the Chandi 
Paath while later one indicat=
es that Kunjika Stotra can be a 
replacement of Chandi Paath.

***

Honestl=
y, I am not reading Kunjika Stotra because it says that you 
don't need to =
recite Argala, Kavach, Kilakam, Rahsyaas etc.. not 
because Shiva says that=
 it is a effective shortcut But becuase i 
really really like the rhydhm of=
 Kunjika stotra. it give me great Joy 
to recite it--

specially the verses=
 such as 
Dham Dhim Dhum Dhurjate Patni, Vaam Vim Vum Vaagahishwari
Kraan K=
rin krun Kaaika devi, Shan Sahin Shun me Shubham Kuru
Bhram Bhrim Bhrum....=
Dhijagram Dhijagram....Paam Peem Pum

I love to read it loudly.

Jay Jagada=
mba!!!

Happy MahaShiv Raatri to allthe members and thankyou to Narasimha f=
or 
Shiva Manual at the Right time

Warm Regards,

Utpal
