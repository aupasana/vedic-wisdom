  Yes my friend=
, i too feel very bad and sad, may it is Lankapuri, or our Karma Bhumi. or =
in the north side of India,  we are listing and watching news of distructio=
n all over the world. And news chanals are telling that the year 2012 is th=
e END of Kali Yuga. may it is real? and all this are the hints before endin=
g of Kali yuga. If it is so, what is our right now duty? may i expect any s=
uggestion form Narsimharao Guru.
Regards,
Harikishan.
