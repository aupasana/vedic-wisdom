Narasimha garu,

Is it okay to close the homakundam once the fire goes off=
,
to avoid the smoke spreading in the house? I know the smoke is very good =
for health but I live in an apartment in USA and my American neighbor compl=
ained a couple of times on the burning smell, even after I used just a litt=
le ghee as ahuti.  

Regards,
Lakshmi
