isnt these type of stories teach us abt faith, love and
hardwork.....althought these are myths and legends...these type of stories
encourage our children to belief in god and in a same way knows what is
family values.....even chinese have their stories abt monkey god and his
journeys and children love to read them....i think its okay to read this
kind of stories.
