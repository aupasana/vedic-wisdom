Namaste,

1. Yes.
2. You can combine them together. Infact you can use the =
Idol as part of the Homam.
3. Yes. But, when you can combine the pooja & ho=
mam together.
4. I guess if you are performing  the pooja & homam separatel=
y, please divide the prasadam (before offering) and offer them separately.
=

Please go through  the homam procedure manual and follow it. You can see t=
hat you can easily combine the two.

Regards
Narayan
