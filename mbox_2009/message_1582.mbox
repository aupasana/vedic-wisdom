    This is called 'samputam' (Lit. meaning a covered box or enclosing with=
 folded palms as in anjali). The given mantra in this case is enclosed with=
 praNava and respective beejakshara. Some traditions do so for gAyatri enca=
sing it in praNava and vyAhrutis. I don't know the significance of this sam=
putam but we do encounter it in a few different places (mahanyAsam for exam=
ple). If there are any mantra shAstra scholars on the forum they'll be able=
 to shed more details.
