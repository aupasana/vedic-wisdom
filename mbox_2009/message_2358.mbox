THE COMMON BASES OF HINDUISM
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora

Let=
 them talk of India's regeneration as they like. Let me tell you as one
who=
 has been working =97 at least trying to work =97 all his life, that there =
is
no regeneration for India until you be spiritual. Not only so, but upon =
it
depends the welfare of the whole world. For I must tell you frankly that=
 the
very foundations of Western civilisation have been shaken to their bas=
e.

The mightiest buildings, if built upon the loose sand foundations of
ma=
terialism, must come to grief one day, must totter to their destruction
som=
e day. The history of the world is our witness. Nation after nation has
ari=
sen and based its greatness upon materialism, declaring man was all
matter.=
 Ay, in Western language, a man gives up the ghost, but in our
language a m=
an gives up his body. The Western man is a body first, and then
he has a so=
ul; with us a man is a soul and spirit, and he has a body.
Therein lies a w=
orld of difference.

Do not be in a hurry, do not go out to imitate anybody=
 else. This is another
great lesson we have to remember; imitation is not c=
ivilisation. I may deck
myself out in a Raja's dress, but will that make me=
 a Raja? An ass in a
lion's skin never makes a lion. Imitation, cowardly im=
itation, never makes
for progress. It is verily the sign of awful degradati=
on in a man. Ay, when
a man has begun to hate himself, then the last blow h=
as come.

When a man has begun to be ashamed of his ancestors, the end has =
come. Here
am I, one of the least of the Hindu race, yet proud of my race, =
proud of my
ancestors. I am proud to call myself a Hindu, I am proud that I=
 am one of
your unworthy servants. I am proud that I am a countryman of you=
rs, you the
descendants of the sages, you the descendants of the most glori=
ous Rishis
the world ever saw.Therefore have faith in yourselves, be proud =
of your
ancestors, instead of being ashamed of them. And do not imitate, do=
 not
imitate! Whenever you are under the thumb of others, you lose your own=

independence. If you are working, even in spiritual things, at the dictati=
on
of others, slowly you lose all faculty, even of thought. Bring out throu=
gh
your own exertions what you have, but do not imitate, yet take what is g=
ood
from others.

We have to learn from others. You put the seed in the gro=
und, and give it
plenty of earth, and air, and water to feed upon; when the=
 seed grows into
the plant and into a gigantic tree, does it become the ear=
th, does it become
the air, or does it become the water? It becomes the mig=
hty plant, the
mighty tree, after its own nature, having absorbed everythin=
g that was given
to it. Let that be your position. We have indeed many thin=
gs to learn from
others, yea, that man who refuses to learn is already dead=
.

Declares our Manu: -
"Take the jewel of a woman for your wife, though sh=
e be of inferior descent.
Learn supreme knowledge with service even from th=
e man of low birth; and
even from the Chand=E2la, learn by serving him the =
way to salvation." Learn
everything that is good from others, but bring it =
in, and in your own way
absorb it; do not become others. Do not be dragged =
away out of this Indian
life; do not for a moment think that it would be be=
tter for India if all the
Indians dressed, ate, and behaved like another ra=
ce.

Religion in India must be made as free and as easy of access as is God=
's
air.
