Dear Utpal

Atleast we all feel there is some changes in Narashima recently=
 
external,unless he did a makeup for the video shoot :-) I hope not.
His i=
nternal changes only he knows I am sure they are fantastic.

For one to do =
severe sadhana, one needs blessing of god and guru, so 
that no obstacles c=
rop up and also preparation for previous birth and 
this birth including in=
tense desire. It is a pleasure to know that
Narashima seems to have these. =
All of us I hope get there and lot 
further.

Best Regards
Mitesh
