Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the e=

perspec=

His parts an=

unknown to Him. Past, p=

you and others, this poss=
ibility, that possibility and yet another
possibility - all are accessible =
and fully "known" to His
self-awareness.

field of duality also contains planes of consciousness where differ=

in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of

 Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum
may be 1 year in anothe=
r space-time continuum. Time is not as
straight-forward an entity as one ma=

duality contains infinite space-time conti=

depends on the plane of consciousness that one=

relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each

 that.<BR>> <BR>> Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly major=

such a self correcting option is already negated out.<BR>> <BR>> Well=

/ 761<BR>> <BR>> This boy was born and brought up in US and is not pr=
oficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of t=
he ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who an=
d a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white=
 clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and =
he hadn't come yet.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> This boy is usu=
ally playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning,=
 I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the epi=
sode mentioned in the above mail.<BR>> <BR>> I asked what he was thin=
king. He said, "it is not that the future that is to come has not already h=
appened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when =
the time comes. You know what I mean?" I guessed what he was getting at, bu=
t pretended not to know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"<BR>> <BR>> H=
e said, "I don't know how to say what I am thinking." This boy is not known=
 to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he=
 is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However,=
 he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.<BR>> <BR=
>> I helped him, "do you mean to say that future has already happened at=
 some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. =
A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may ha=
ve already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it =
is happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?"<BR>>=
 <BR>> He exclaimed, "exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is=
 going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody =
may be able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.=
"<BR>> <BR>> Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking=
 along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision =
over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. G=
iven his age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seem=
ed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. =
So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important co=
nclusions about "time" in his own way.<BR>> <BR>> Time seems linear a=
t the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of consscious=
ness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when o=
ne is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.<BR>> <BR>> *=
 * *<BR>> <BR>> The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam =
with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before =
name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and =
powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel normally. Th=
is intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling th=
at can be loosely expressed in words as "I am done here. I have nothing mor=
e left to do. Time to leave" filled my entire consciousnss.<BR>> <BR>>=
; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once=
 I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my gur=
u Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had =
an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous te=
mple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanc=
tified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was t=
he same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intens=
e shakti.<BR>> <BR>> Interestingly, after we finished meditation and =
opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all the different homas I did so fa=
r, this is the bestest homam." I asked him why. He said, "I don't know how =
to say it, but it just felt awesome and different."<BR>> <BR>> * * *<=
BR>> <BR>> This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, sh=
orter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in =
making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal pu=
rity is the most important thing.<BR>> <BR>> Rituals help purify one =
and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an eg=
g and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through=
.<BR>> <BR>> Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do =
pay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The o=
nly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your=
 ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external=
 things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealos=
y etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is "I=
" and this is "mine" - is the root cause of all problems.<BR>> <BR>> =
* * *<BR>> <BR>> Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively chall=
enging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - incl=
uding your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god'=
s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these propertie=
s of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion "thi=
s is mine". A faithful servant takes very good care of his master's propert=
ies, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.<BR>=
> <BR>> Realize that thinking of things as "mine" is not necessary fo=
r taking good care of them. A servant who loves one's master takes the best=
 care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant doe=
s not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master'=
s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best j=
ob with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or=
 what is out of one's control.<BR>> <BR>> Developing the attitude of =
a servant who takes care of master's properties will help one wade the ocea=
n of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.<BR>> <BR>>=
