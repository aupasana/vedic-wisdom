Respected Sudha,
The ghee and camphor =C2=A0etc., to be used properly so th=
at the offerings in the homa should be burnt completely,if at all any resid=
ue it should be placed where no body walks or under a tree or safely it can=
 be buried under the soil.it should not be reused.even the left over ghee i=
n the ajya patra also to be poured in the fire.with regard to the Raksha th=
e excess quantity can be mixed with water and poured to the trees

     Hi Sudha,
=C2=A0
If the purnahuti does not burn or some offering is le=
ft unburned, then use it=C2=A0the next time you do homa. 
=C2=A0
As for the=
 Raksha/Ash left, collect it=C2=A0for a few months=C2=A0and=C2=A0 then idea=
lly throw it in flowing water - river, sea etc. Or I guess bury it if you d=
on't find a way of disposing it off in flowing natural water. 
=C2=A0

Hi all,

During homam s=
ome of my offerings don't get burnt properly. There are leftover halfburnt =
coconut pieces, half burnt naievdyam etc. Is it ok to collect all these lef=
tover halfburnt pieces and use it for the next homam or will it be like giv=
ing stale food to god. I have lot of raksha accumulating what do you all do=
 with so much raksha. 

Thanks,

Sudha
