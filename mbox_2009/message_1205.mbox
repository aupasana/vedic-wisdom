Namaste ray.siya1@... !

As everybody knows, traditionally Lord Shiva=
 (In Linga form) is 
mostly worshiped with Water/Milk Abhishek.

Technicall=
y speaking, Fire worship would be better, in my opinion as 
you know that F=
ire is the un-currepted element left besides Ether. 
i.e. Fire element is m=
ore purer than water element in the current 
times.

Let's try worshiping h=
im with 'Fire'.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
pS: Vo to Bhole Baba hai. Jyada Nakha=
re nahi dikhate. bhakto ne 
Dhature ka phul chadhaya to usise khush ho jate=
 hain. Chahe Agani me 
bulao ya Paani me snaan karao, He'll be always happy=
 :)
