Namaste,


 



  








I am a firm believer of Veg being satwik food an=
d consider non-veg as hurdle to spiritual growth. But, a friend of mine who=
 otherwise is trying to make some spiritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. =
In our arguments over non-veg food, he has put a counter argument. He says =
that if I can find him a single shloka on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would g=
ive up.=A0
So, if anybody on this group can help me find the quote, it woul=
d be great. He considers Geeta as the absolute reference and believes if Lo=
rd Krishna has not spoken about it in Geeta, it is actually not worth discu=
ssing whether or not you take non-veg. If anyone finds it, le me know so th=
at 1 guy on this earth can become vegetarian.
He also quotes Sai Baba, Jesu=
s and Mohammed Prophet adhering to non-veg. If any of you know the counter =
argument, please help.
Best Regards,Sriram
