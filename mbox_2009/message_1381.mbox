Yes, the ashram 
name is Nareshwar. It is one of those ashrams that is still away from money and 
power games. Shri Rang Avadhoot Maharaj worshipped Lord Datta. He wrote 
"Dattabawani". Another interesting fact is that this is "Amrut Mahotsav" year(75 
years) of  Dattabawani creation and many 
many "Avadhoot parivars" around the world are reciting Dattabawani to reach a 
certain number. I believe Mumbai parivar is going to do 75 lakhs. In New Jersey, 
Chicago and Toronto avdhoot parivars are also very active and doing their part. 
    I am Chicago area and very fortunate to get blessings from "Shri 
Prem Avadhoot Maharaj" who is shishya of Rang Avhoot and visits us in summer. 

Namaste,
Rucha

Namaste

Interesting information about the region, in recent years there was a 
great Saint by name of Ranga Avadhoot Maharaj who settled on the 
river banks of Narmada near Bharuch.
