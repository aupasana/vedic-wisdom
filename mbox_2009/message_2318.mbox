Volume 2, Jnana-Yoga
CHAPTER XII THE COSMOS The Microcosm (Delivered in New=
 York, 26th January
1896)

We do not look at our own faults; the eyes do no=
t see themselves, they see
the eyes of everybody else. We human beings are =
very slow to recognise our
own weakness, our own faults, so long as we can =
lay the blame upon somebody
else. Men in general lay all the blame of life =
on their fellow-men, or,
failing that, on God, or they conjure up a ghost, =
and say it is fate. Where
is fate, and who is fate? We reap what we sow. We=
 are the makers of our own
fate. None else has the blame, none has the prai=
se. The wind is blowing;
those vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, a=
nd go forward on their
way, but those which have their sails furled do not =
catch the wind. Is that
the fault of the wind? Is it the fault of the merci=
ful Father, whose wind of
mercy is blowing without ceasing, day and night, =
whose mercy knows no decay,
is it His fault that some of us are happy and s=
ome unhappy?

We make our own destiny. His sun shines for the weak as well =
as for the
strong. His wind blows for saint and sinner alike. He is the Lor=
d of all,
the Father of all, merciful, and impartial. Do you mean to say th=
at He, the
Lord of creation, looks upon the petty things of our life in the=
 same light
as we do? What a degenerate idea of God that would be! We are l=
ike little
puppies, making life-and-death struggles here, and foolishly thi=
nking that
even God Himself will take it as seriously as we do. He knows wh=
at the
puppies' play means.Our attempts to lay the blame on Him, making Him=
 the
punisher, and the rewarder, are only foolish. He neither punishes, nor=

rewards any. His infinite mercy is open to every one, at all times, in all=

places, under all conditions, unfailing, unswerving. Upon us depends how w=
e
use it. Upon us depends how we utilise it. Blame neither man, nor God, no=
r
anyone in the world. When you find yourselves suffering, blame yourselves=
,
and try to do better.

This is the only solution of the problem. Those th=
at blame others =97 and,
alas! the number of them is increasing every day =
=97 are generally miserable
with helpless brains; they have brought themsel=
ves to that pass through
their own mistakes and blame others, but this does=
 not alter their position.
It does not serve them in any way. This attempt =
to throw the blame upon
others only weakens them the more. Therefore, blame=
 none for your own
faults, stand upon your own feet, and take the whole res=
ponsibility upon
yourselves.

Say, "This misery that I am suffering is of m=
y own doing, and that very
thing proves that it will have to be undone by m=
e alone." That which I
created, I can demolish; that which is created by so=
me one else I shall
never be able to destroy. Therefore, stand up, be bold,=
 be strong. Take the
whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know t=
hat you are the
creator of your own destiny. All the strength and succour y=
ou want is within
yourselves. Therefore, make your own future. "Let the dea=
d past bury its
dead." The infinite future is before you, and you must alwa=
ys remember that
each word, thought, and deed, lays up a store for you and =
that as the bad
thoughts and bad works are ready to spring upon you like ti=
gers, so also
there is the inspiring hope that the good thoughts and good d=
eeds are ready
with the power of a hundred thousand angels to defend you al=
ways and for
ever.
