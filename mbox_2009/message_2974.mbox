Namaste, 
=A0
a) Are avataras born with only dridha karmas only? i.e., to s=
ay that if we look at the chart of Sri Rama, we should be able to identify =
"Hanuman as vayu putra helping him" (Mars in 7th house), Eka patni vrata (v=
enus in 9th) etc. 
Astrologers usually=A0try to map the actions of avataras=
=A0to the chart and justify avatars actions vis-a-vis chart. If so, can we =
also say that the avataras have never used their free will in their lives a=
nd are into this world to experience dridha karma only?

b) Are the stories=
 of Sage Dronacharya born in pot and Rishi Veda Vyasa becoming an adult as =
soon as he was born, a mythical stories with some spiritual significance? I=
f they are myths, what is the meaning in it?

Thanks & Regards,
