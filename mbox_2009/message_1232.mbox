Namaste Garu!

I read somewhere that you are of the opinion that 20/30 minu=
tes Homa 
is equivalent to 4/5 hours of Meditation. I didn't understand it.=
 
some 3 or 4 days back, i suddenly realise, while in the midst of 
homa ac=
tivities that i've always forgotten about the surroundings 
whenever i sit =
for homa. (from preparation to conclusion). this i 
realised suddenly. for =
example - After taking bath, i empty all 
ashes of previous day in a bag, w=
ash & clean homa-kund with liquid 
detergent, wash other utensils, and othe=
r such required preparation, 
start the actual procedure and conclude. duri=
ng all theses 
activities, the surroundings are almost forgotten (i also ma=
ke sure 
that i switch on the silent mode in cell phone).

no w i am gettin=
g some glimpses of what you meant but still wish to 
understand more on tha=
t from you. take your time as i know that you 
have your hands-full.

warm =
regards,

Utpal
