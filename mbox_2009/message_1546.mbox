Brihatsamhita gives out the duration of each Yuga. We can perhaps find the =
duration in other literature as well.

Brihat Samhita gives the duration of=
 a Devine day in terms of human years etc. How ever, there will be two unre=
solved issues:

1. What is the definition of year (360 tithis, 360 sun rise=
s, etc.)
2. What is the starting point of Kali yuga.
Best regards,
Vijay
