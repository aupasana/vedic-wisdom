Namaste,
 
It is in my "to do" list.
 
Yes, the stories are for increasing =
the faith. They are also for some subtle messages. For example, you can see=
 that the stories cover a Brahman, a shoodra (wood-cutter), a vaishya (busi=
nessman named Sadhu) and a kshatriya (king names Tungadhwaja). The shoodra =
and vaishya learned the procedure and did it themselves (instead of hiring =
a priest like people do these days). It means that anybody can do this ritu=
al and do it by themselves, to the best of their ability.
 
The businessman=
 tried to do business with god. Instead of performing the ritual with a des=
ire in mind, he asked for his desire and took a vow that he will do the rit=
ual IF a child is born. He asked god to first give a result. Even after he =
got a child, he postponed it saying he will do it at his daughter's marriag=
e. He tried to haggle with god and extract the most. If you have a vaishya'=
s temperament, you should guard against the tendency to do business with go=
d.
 
The king was arrogant and egoistic. He ignored the ritual performed by=
 cowboys because they were using clay idols and clay pots and he did not th=
ink much of them or their ritual. He did not bow to the god and rejected th=
e prasad given by them. If you have a kshatriya's temperament, you should g=
uard against the tendency towards arrogance, ego, pride and belittling of o=
thers.
 
Like this, there are some hidden messages that you can get by pond=
ering on the stories.
 
Of course, when I mention the castes here, I do not=
 necessarily mean the caste of birth. In the old days, people got their cas=
te from father, but it became clear in time as their own temperament and ap=
titude developed. One interested in only knowledge is a braahmana. One inte=
rested in power, authority and control over others is a kshatriya. One inte=
rested in money and more money is a vaishya. One interested mainly in physi=
cal pleasures is a shoodra. One's caste is decided by one's attitude and ap=
titude. Valmiki was born as a shoodra, but became a braahmana later and als=
o a maharshi. Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became a braahmana l=
ater and also a maharshi. In the old days, the concept of caste mobility wa=
s very much there and caste was not a rigid concept like today. What I said=
 above regarding the weaknesses that people of different castes should try =
to overcome should be seen in that context and not from the context of a fi=
xed caste based on birth in a family.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimha garu,

        Is it possible to create a=
 manual on the procedure for Satyanarayana pooja, just like the Homam manua=
ls ? 

        What is the significance of reading the stories glorifying t=
he Satyanarayana Vratam at the end of the pooja? This some how seems to be =
unique only for this pooja. 

        Is it just meant for deepening the fa=
ith in the pooja ?

        Regards,
        <deleted>
