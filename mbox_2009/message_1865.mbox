Namaste,

Yes, it is perfectly fine. The goal of sadhana is to purify self and repay 
debts by engaging in actions without much ego. Without repaying karmik 
debts, one cannot realize. But the trick is that you do not know who you are 
indebted to. So, when you see some natural signals pointing to giving 
something to someone, do not think much and just give it. If you get an 
instinct to give some money to someone or help someone or do something for 
someone or just pray for someone, just follow the instincts and do it. But 
do it like a guileless small child and do not entertain any afterthoughts 
like "I am helping" or "I am a good person and so I did this". Leave out ego 
and pride to the extent possible.

As you succeed more in being a guileless small child who goes with the flow, 
your instincts will become sharper and Nature will show you the right 
actions to repay all your blocking debts.

After you do what you think you need to do, do not be caught in it, leave it 
and move on.

Best regards,
Narasimha
