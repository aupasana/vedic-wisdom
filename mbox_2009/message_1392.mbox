Namaste,
 
I have seen this done by many priests, though some priests do th=
e right thing and make it a point to have a separate homa kundam for each p=
erson.
 
When you give things and take things and when you do things togeth=
er, there is already an intertwining of karmas. However, fire worship ampli=
fies things.
 
If five people together are cooking some food for their dinn=
er, it takes one person putting a bad ingredient in it to spoil it. It leav=
es a bad taste in all their mouths. It is a good idea for them to cook sepa=
rately.
 
Similarly, one person having bad thoughts while making offerings =
in fire can spoil things for everyone. Of course, whatever happens happens =
for cleansing only. But, why share somebody else's dirt and then get it cle=
aned?
 
When some groups of people who are very similar in attitude and thi=
nking do a homam together, it may be fine. But, it is better to be conserva=
tive with this.
 
Of course, if you are a realized person with no distincti=
on of opposites, all this is irrelavent. But remember one thing: A tree can=
 share its flowers and fruits with all. But, when young as a plant, it shou=
ld be protected. Then it can give more to the world later.
 
Best regards,
=
Narasimha

  Namaste,

  In our local =
temple here in upstate NY, several people sponsor a homa. All the sponsors =
(say, 4 or 5 persons - most unrelated to one another) gather around the hom=
a kundam and offer ahutis. How does the concept of intertwining of individu=

  Namaste,
   
  It is=
 fine to do multiple homas in the same fire, if the persons doing it have i=
ntertwined karmas.

  If one starts a fire and makes offerings, an associat=
ion is made between one's internal fire and that fire. It will continue to =
some extent even after homam finishes, as long as the fire keeps going. If =
another person makes an association between the same fire and internal fire=
, then there is some karmik interchange between the persons. If the other p=
erson is someone that you do not mind sharing some of your karmas and karma=
phalas with, then it should be fine.

  Usually, karmas of parents and chil=
dren, wife and husband etc are anyway strongly intertwined in many ways. It=
 should be ok for them to do homam in the same fire, either together or one=
 after the other.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

  Dear Narsimhaji,
   
  Today with you=
r inspiration and help, we did the short version of the MahaGanapathy Homam=
. After completion of the Homam, my mother felt like doing Sri Ganapathi Ar=
tharvashirsa so she sat down and contined in the same agni. 
  Is it advisa=
ble to do multiple pujas in the same agni or should we start over again (re=
kindling) ? She did do the sankalpa again.
