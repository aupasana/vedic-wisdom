Namasthe

Some of mine on the first experience -

1. I put the Homa Kunda (Copper) on an Aluminium foil under which I put a
thick plastic sheet.
   Foolish of me, this did not stop the fire god from making a nice square
burnt shape on the Carpet( live in USA).
   "Burnt my fingers" by remembering to get some bricks from Home Depot.
2. Wife got freaked out with the carpet and the smoke. Observed that if we
use dry coconut, it burns nicely but the amount of Agni is low. Wooden
sticks give out more smoke.
