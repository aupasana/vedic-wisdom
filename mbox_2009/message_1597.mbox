Hi,

Outside in Open space is better for doing Homam. Backyard would be one=
 of the idle place instead of inside House.

sitting direction: Facing East=
ern Direction and Havan Kundam should be in front of you.

Important DONT -=
 Do not eat 2 to 4 hours prior to Homam. stomach should be empty.

for othe=
r details, please refer to user manual at
http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =
homam


Warm Regards,

Utpal
