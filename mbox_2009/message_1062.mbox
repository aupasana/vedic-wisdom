Dear Amitji
=C2=A0
Thank you for the mail. Indeed the contribution of the S=
ikhs are immense. There is no doubt about it. Specially the supreme sacrifi=
ce done by Guru Teg Bahadur.=C2=A0 And rightly said, we all owe a debt to t=
hem, all of us.
=C2=A0
Some months back I was reading a book on Sri Ramakri=
shna in Bengali, and there it was mentioned Thakur, during a conversation h=
ad said, the Sikh Gurus were Rishis who had incarnated.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=
=A0Rajarshi



The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Dear Rajarshiji/Utpalji,
Namaskaaram,
Though Shivaaji Mahaaraja's contrib=
ution to Hinduism is sterling and undebatable- he had Samrtha Raamdaasa as =
his guru who kindled in him an ambition after explaining him the Kshaatra D=
harma -this Commentary is a very famous Grantha : Daasa Bodha in Maraathi.
=
Of course-Shivaaji Mahaaraja's mother Jeejabai was no less inspiring !

IMH=
O- Hinduism in places like=C2=A0 Northern Indian region like Mathura,as men=
tioned by Rajarshiji were saved from the Islamic tirade by Sikh Gurus like =
Guru Gobind Singhji who fought the iconoclasts at a very tender age of Nine=
 years ! Just Nine years !!! While assuming leadership of Sikhs after his f=
ather Guru Arjan Devji was executed while trying to save Hindus of Kashmir =
and the then undivided Punjab.He sacrificed Four Son trying to save Sikhs a=
nd Hindus from forcible adoption of another religion.His father Arjan Devji=
. As a Hindu I feel very sad when people jest at Sikhs forgetting the debt =
we owe to the Sikh Gurus. 
But again that is God's and Guru's will !
As Utp=
alji passionately writes: we have a history of centuries falling prey to th=
e divide and rule policy adopted by all foreign invaders.
Like Paarasis(Jar=
thosti or Zoroastrians, as they are called)-=C2=A0 ask any Jew or=C2=A0 Ben=
e Israeli and She will tell that India is the only land where they were not=
 persecuted but allowed to settle down peacefully !
May we all be guided to=
 tolerance and live a life of " Sahanaavavatu Sahanau Bhunaktu.... 

humble=
 regards

Yes you are so correct. I consider Shivaji Maharaj to be one of the =
best things that happened to Hinduism when it was needed most. A blessing f=
rom Ma Durga Herself.
=C2=A0
Infact recently I had been reading on some his=
tory of India and I realized that had it not been for Shivaji Maharaj inspi=
red by his Guru Swami Ramdas, places like Kasi, Prayag and Mathura would ha=
ve become Mecca and Medina.
=C2=A0
And you are also correct that we must al=
l do out part to see that this glorious tradition of Sanatan Dharma is neve=
r diminished. But the question is, what is it that one can do at an individ=
ual level? How does one know what is the best course of action? 
=C2=A0
I k=
eep pondering over these things and I get confused and frustated. Infact si=

Namaste !

>Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders=
. To Hindus, the correct term 
>is "sanatana dharma", i.e. perennial spirit=
 of righteousness

Intrestingly, last week i was in Oman and i had a same d=
iscussion 
with one of the client's representative. He was Aarab national a=
nd 
wanted to know something about Hindu religeon. First thing i told him 
=
that 'Hindu' is a foreign word and none of our scripture uses this 
word.

=
***

This is my long time belief that Sanaatan Dharma will never perish. 
m=
y logic is simple. in the recorded history, People from Sanaatan 
Dharma ha=
s never attacked the other religion. The glorious example 
(which i am very=
 proud of quoting) is Paarasi Community. They came to 
India for saving the=
ir community and religeon and our people niether 
rejected them nor influen=
ced them to convert in to our religeon. they 
flourished in our country in =
trade.

***

When Sanaatan Dharma was in great danger, Lord sent Shivaaji t=
o 
control it. earlier Addi Shankara camedown for it. Now it is our 
respon=
sibility to see to it that we live its value in our life.. and 
we need not=
 forget the famous assurance "Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!"

but is everybody's d=
uty to do their bit so that this glorious 
Tradition of Sanaatan Dharam nev=
er gets diminished.

best Regards,

Utpal

<BR>> <BR>> Namaste,<BR>> <BR>> Modern religions like Christian=
ity and Islam almost completely <BR>wiped out <BR>> native religions whe=
rever they went (e.g. countries in Africa, <BR>South <BR>> America, Amer=
ica etc). However, despite foreign invasion and <BR>complete <BR>> forei=
gn control of India for a millennium, Hinduism
 is still <BR>basically doin=
g <BR>> ok. True, some damage has been done, but it is still standing ta=
ll <BR>and firm <BR>> enough. Isn't it amazing?<BR>> <BR>> In fact=
, Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the <BR>correct term <=
BR>> is "sanatana dharma", i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By <B=
R>definition, <BR>> it is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it canno=
t be destroyed. <BR>Even if <BR>> it seems close to extinction, it will =
come back up. That is the <BR>nature of <BR>> this dharma. I am not worr=
ied about Sanatana dharma being damaged <BR>or <BR>> destroyed.<BR>> =
<BR>> I will continue to discharge what *I* believe nature expects from =
<BR>*me* and <BR>> what I believe is *my* dharma, without any worry what=
soever that <BR>sanatana <BR>> dharma is in some kind of danger of extin=
ction. However, such a <BR>belief is <BR>> vital for some people to disc=
harge *their* dharma and hence we have
 <BR>some <BR>> people driven by =
that sense of danger and the resulting fear and <BR>anger. That <BR>> is=
 ok too.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Sadguru Samartha Ramadas i=
s not an ordinary soul. He is born with <BR>an amsa of <BR>> Lord Hanuma=
n. His words may be slightly misunderstood.<BR>> <BR>> To somebody li=
ke him, it would not matter whether a nation calls <BR>itself <BR>> Hind=
u or secular or whatever. What would matter is whether dharma <BR>is <BR>&g=
t; followed or not.<BR>> <BR>> Right now, we do not have sanatana dha=
rma being followed in any <BR>country, in <BR>> secular India or in Hind=
u Nepal or in many other countries <BR>following <BR>> secularism or var=
ious religions.<BR>> <BR>> If it is indeed God's wish that sanatana d=
harma be established in <BR>the world, <BR>> it will happen when its tim=
e comes.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> ---------=
