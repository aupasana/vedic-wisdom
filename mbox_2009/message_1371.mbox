If one is ready, the best is to not think of the energy as "mine". Who is 
robbing, what is he robbing, and from whom is he robbing? All is god's 
anyway. What is not really yours, despite being perceived by you to be 
yours, may be taken away from you. But what is really yours cannot be taken 
away.

However, one may not be ready to think that way, perhaps because one still 
has many karmik debts to pay back and need to *hold on* to things that help 
one with that. In that case, some prcautions may be taken. I recommend Devi 
Kavacham (also known as Chandi Kavacham). Chanting it once or several times 
every morning for a duration will form a subtle shield around one that will 
protect one from this kind of people.

Narayana kavacham is another powerful shield mantra. Depending on one's 
taste, one may try Narayana kavacham or Devi kavacham.

But the key is to do it regularly.

Best regards,
Narasimha
