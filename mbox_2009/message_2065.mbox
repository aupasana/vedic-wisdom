Dear Utpal Bhai , Rajarshi ji and all,

Namaskar.
I think free will is also=
 a part of Divine Will being orchestrated.=A0The extent of free will is to =
realise that Divine Will is all that prevails and matters and once you * re=
alise* that is freewill, nothing else but unequivocal submission to Divine =
Will=A0 matters. 
As The Mother said in one of her teachings that the human=
 'soul' ( some of them I think) has the free will to choose to take birth i=
n particular mother's =A0womb and have experiences in =A0certain realms. Wh=
en the experiences manifest the human being is unaware that it their own fr=
ee will that *opted* for those experiences and blames others for it, 'why m=
e' syndrome as I would prefer to call it. It is what you have asked for....=
 It takes a lot of realisation to unravel the mystery... maybe some thousan=
ds of lives when it dawns that free will is what the Divine=A0 Will and sub=
mit to *it* fully and unconditionally.. It may seem fatalistic, ambivalent =
but it can help accept the fact that nobody else is to be blamed but your *=
 action* with attachment as Narasimha ji would call it, is responsible for =
what you experience.
My two cents,
Nalini
=A0

I liked your analogy of multiple versions of a=
 movie however my understanding is that there is nothing called Free will i=
n truest sense. everything is pre-ordined. anything and everything is shoot=
 in advance. even if multiple versions are recorded, which version is actua=

 so far, this is the bes=

ernal practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and puri=
ty is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist =
attraction to external things better and you
 can resist internal enemies l=
ike lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - t=

pouse, children and your own body - is god's property and that you are a te=
mporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you ca=

akes very good care of his master's properties, but without thinking of all=
 those things as his or her belongings.<BR>> > <BR>> > Realize =
that thinking of things as "mine" is not necessary for taking good care of =
them. A servant who loves one's master takes the best care of things entrus=
ted to one. When a thing is taken
 away, a servant does not waste time worr=
ying and crying. A servant will accept that is master's property and can be=
 taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one poss=
esses and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one's=
 control.<BR>> > <BR>> > Developing the attitude of a servant w=
