 Letter 143

Last month, Niranjananandaswami sent a bull, born and bred in =
the Ashram to
the Meenakshi Temple, Madurai, as a present. People there nam=
ed it Basava,
decorated it nicely and took a photo of it along with Sri Sam=
basiva Iyer who
had accompanied it. Sambasiva Iyer returned with a copy of =
the photo besides
an old fashioned silk-fringed shawl, some vibhuti, kumkum=
 and prasad 1 given
to him by the temple authorities.

Due to the great cro=
wd of visitors since August 15th, Bhagavan has been
spending the days out i=
n the Jubilee Hall.

Sambasiva Iyer came into Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence w=
ith the shawl, vibhuti, etc.,
on a large plate. The brahmins who had accomp=
anied him recited a mantra
while all of us prostrated before Bhagavan, then=
 rose. Looking at me,
Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9COur bull has been sent to the=
 Meenakshi Temple, did you
know?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CYes, I knew,=E2=80=9D I =
said. =E2=80=9COn the day it was going, I saw it decorated
with turmeric, 2=
 kumkum, etc. and came to know of the purpose when I asked
the cattle-keepe=
r.=E2=80=9DHolding the plate reverentially and smearing the vibhuti
and kum=
kum on his forehead, Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CSee, this is Meenakshi=E2=80=
=99s gift.=E2=80=9D
And his voice quivered as he said it.

Sambasiva Iyer s=
pread the shawl over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s feet, and when Bhagavan,
deeply mov=
ed, removed it with evident feeling of reverence, the attendants
took it an=
d spread it over the back of the sofa. Adjusting the shawl
properly with hi=
s hands, Bhagavan, looking towards us, said, =E2=80=9CMother 1
Vibhuti: sac=
red ash. Kumkum: vermilion powder. Prasad: any flower or food
consecrated b=
y being offered to the Deity.

2 Turmeric: a bright yellow powder of the tu=
rmeric root.

Meenakshi has sent this. It is Mother=E2=80=99s gift.=E2=80=
=9D And, choked with emotion, he
was unable to say more and became silent.
=

His eyes were full of tears of joy and his body became motionless. Seeing
=
this, it seemed to me that Nature herself had become silent. When, as a boy=
,
Bhagavan was in Tiruchuli and someone had been angry with him, he had gon=
e
to the temple and wept, sitting behind the image of Sahayamba.

He alone =
knows how the Mother consoled him and what hopes she gave him.

Three years=
 ago, the Ashram doctor said that hand- pounded rice would be
good for Bhag=
avan=E2=80=99s health.

Thereupon the Ashramites approached Bhagavan with a=
 request to take such
rice, which would be specially cooked for him. When B=
hagavan asked them
whether the same rice would be served to all, they said =
that it would not be
possible, as the supply of such rice was limited. Bhag=
avan therefore would
not agree to having it however much they tried to pers=
uade him. At last they
said that they would use the hand- pounded rice for =
the daily offerings to
the deity in the temple, for which rice is usually c=
ooked separately and
they requested Bhagavan to partake of that rice. =E2=
=80=9CIf that is so, it is all
right.

I will take it because it is Mother=
=E2=80=99s prasadam,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.

And from that day onwards, th=
ey have been cooking hand- pounded rice
separately and, after offering it t=
o the goddess in the temple, have been
serving it to Bhagavan, giving what =
was left over to all others in his
company.

Last summer, Ramaswami Iyer=E2=
=80=99s son got married and for the occasion there was
a feast here. That d=
ay, Iyer noticed that there was white rice on the leaves
of all, whereas th=
e rice on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s leaf was reddish, and he enquired the
reason. =
Bhagavan smiling, said, =E2=80=9CThis is Mother=E2=80=99s prasadam.

What i=
s wrong with it? It is cooked specially as an offering to Mother.=E2=80=9D =
He
then related the above incident. He once again said, =E2=80=9CThis is Mo=
ther=E2=80=99s gift;
I have accepted it only because of that.=E2=80=9D

Is =
this not a great lesson to those who say that they have given up visiting
t=
emples and such things?
