 3rd April, 1947

=93In the early days when Mother came to stay with me in =
Virupaksha Cave,
there was no cooking. If Echamma or anybody else brought h=
er any food she
used to eat it, clean
the vessels and then go to bed. That =
was all.

One day she thought I had nothing special to eat and as I was fon=
d of the
twin appalams, she thought it would be a good idea to make some fo=
r me.
Being well experienced, she could not refrain from making them.

With=
out my knowledge she asked the Mudaliar old lady, Echamma and some
others t=
o get
everything ready and one evening she set out, saying that she was goi=
ng to
the village. I wanted to see where she was really going, and so when =
she
left, I waited silently under the tree outside.

She thought I did not =
know anything. She went to several houses, collected
all the required thing=
s in a big vessel and returned. I closed my eyes and
pretended
complete ign=
orance. She put them away carefully in the cave till all the
visitors left.=


After nightfall, I had my usual meal and lay down pretending to sleep.
Le=
isurely, she took out the wooden roller, wooden seat, loose flour and the
b=
alls of paste and commenced making appalams. There were about two to three
=
hundred to be made. She could not prepare them all single-handed. I knew th=
e
job.

So she quietly began telling me, =91My boy, please help me with it.=
=92 I got the
opportunity I was waiting for. If I were lenient in this, she=
 would start
something else. I wanted to put a timely stop to it. I said, =
=91You have
renounced everything and have come here, haven=92t you? Why all=
 this? You
should rest content with whatever is available.

I won=92t help =
you. I won=92t eat them if you prepare them. Make them all for
yourself, an=
d eat them yourself.=92 She was silent for a while and again
started saying=
, =91What, my dear son, please help me a little.=92

I was adamant. She con=
tinued to call me again and again. Feeling it was no
use arguing any more, =
I said, =91All right. You make these appalams; I will
make another kind=92,=
 and I started singing this =91Appalam Song=92. She used to
sing a rice son=
g,soup song and other such songs, all with Vedantic meanings.

None appears=
 to have written an appalam song. So I felt I should compose
one. She was v=
ery fond of songs. So she felt that she could learn another
song.

By the t=
ime the preparation of the appalams was over, my song also was
finished.

=
=91I will eat this appalam (the song about the appalams),and you eat those
=
that you have made,=92 I told her. That happened sometime in 1914 or 1915.=
=94

Once, while she was coming to the jungle at this side, her saree got i=
n a
thorny bush. It was only then that this path was cleared of all bushes =
and
the like.

She said she would not leave me and go anywhere else. If she=
 went anywhere,
she was afraid that she might die there. She was particular=
 that she should
die in my arms.


When Alamelu (Bhagavan=92s younger siste=
r) built a new house in their village
near Manamadurai, she begged mother j=
ust to go over there and see the house.
She said it was enough if she (moth=
er) just set her foot in it. But she
never went.

She declined because she =
was afraid that in case she fell ill there, there
might not be trains runni=
ng properly at that time to bring her back here and
in that case, she might=
 not die in her son=92s arms.

She used to say, =91Even if you were to thro=
w away my dead body in these
thorny bushes I do not mind but I must end thi=
s life in your arms.=92=94

As he was saying that, his voice began to falte=
r through emotion.
