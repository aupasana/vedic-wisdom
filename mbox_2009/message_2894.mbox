Dear Guruji, 

Namaste.

I seek your kind advise and guidance on the care a=
nd pooja for yantra.

I obtained a Sri Mahalakhmi yantra after a homam dedi=
cated to Sri Lakshmi. And I have been told that yantras need pooja to keep =
them energised.

I would really appreciate your kind advise as to:-

1. poo=
ja procedures
2. mantras to be recited
3. general care instructions (e.g. p=
lacement of yantra etc.)

Thank you very much.

Om Shanti Om Shanti Om Shan=
