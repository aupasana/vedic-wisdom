Namaste,

I too had similar worry earlier. I got this advice from el=
ders.

1) Donate to only really needed persons. 
2) When you donate, thi=
nk that you are offering it to the God saying "Krishnaarpanamastu" in the m=
ind.=A0 (Just like how we think when we put money in the temple Hundi).
3) =
Don't entertain the thought that you donated something to someone. Think th=

it.

Namaskaram Sri Narasimha Garu,

I have once heard=
 from one of your Astrology classes (mo3 files) that when you donate money =
to the beggars you might get bad karma (becasue of the misuse of that money=
 by them), i have stopped giving money to all those road side beggars now.
=

But, in my mind i'm having a bad feeling for not giving them money wheneve=
r i see them asking me for alms. Again the thought of accruing unnecessary =
karma..is stopping me. Can you plese clarify which is a big sin / karma of =
these two. (karma of not giving alms to those beggars vs getting karma of t=
heir misuse).

Thanks
Krishna Kanth

P.S: I totally agree with your point o=
f the bad karma becuase of misuse of the money we donate, but this is putti=
ng in a fix with the thought that probably i'm not able to help the really =
needy guys (i typically only use to give money to very disabled and elderly=
 people).
