Namaste Rajarshi,

Saattwik scriptures are for people who are mostly sattwik. Raajasik 
scriptures are for people who are mostly raajasik. Taamasik scriptures are 
for people who still have a good amount of tamas in them.

One will be wrong to assume that this implies supriority of one scripture 
over another or one god over another.

A teacher who teaches a class of dull and dumb-witted people is not 
necessarily inferior to a teacher who teaches a class of people who are 
smart and fast. They just need different qualities and do different jobs. 
Teaching a dumb person and making him get good marks needs different 
qualities compared to teaching a smart person. Please note that the goal of 
people in either class is the same - to study well and pass the exam with 
very good marks. People in either class can achieve the goal if they listen 
to their respective teachers well.

Best regards,
Narasimha
