Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I am absolutely not writing against the gui=
dance given in the mail below. Only telling how I do things differently on =
two points in my own spiritual sadhana everyday.

I am always alert towards=
 my physical body. I do a lot more than bare essentials to keep it going. I=
 am always listening to its need. I try to lessen its pain and suffering us=
ing sattvic means so that it remains strong. I am respectful towards it and=
 do not show mental disregard towards it. After all It is my vehicle toward=
s salvation.

Having lived with sadhu/holy men for several years I am well =
aware that many of them are in lot of different physical pain and discomfor=
t and they are still doing their spiritual sadhana.It is good as many peopl=
e are strong and they can endure pain and still do meditation.

=A0But I ha=
ve noticed when my physical body is in=A0 pain and I am doing my everyday s=
adhana there is a deep subtle current of pain also flowing towards Divine M=
other=A0 which I find very upsetting. Few times I have said to DivineBeings=
 that instead of love, today's offering is full of pain.

I know from my di=
rect personal experience people who have used bare essential to keep their =
body alive.And when it takes its revenge, there are doctors and hospitals a=
nd hospitals and more pain and misery.Their spiritual sadhana gets broken a=
nd my own are deeply disturbed. Then there is excuse that it is past life k=
arma.

If I will not=A0 properly care for my physical body when there is ti=
me to do so and it falls ill what will Divine Mother will think?

The secon=
d thing is that although I am not a yogi my prayers/puja/meditations/japa a=
re not dress rehearsal. They are real things.I am not doing them for my las=
t moments. I am doing them for Divine Mother Who is EverPresent. She reside=
s in Her Dham but She=A0 lives in this material world as well.It is her cre=
ation and for those who are in this world who constantly calling Her, She i=
s present with them.

=A0What will She think if after doing deep loving med=
itation/japa or ordinary puja, I offer it to her and also add that it is on=
ly a dress rehearsal. She might think there seems to be loose screw, has he=
 gone on ganja without me knowing it..

I do not even think that only after=
 leaving my body I will get libreation. Our devotion cannot bring Her, only=
 Her Grace can make Her give us Her Bliss. Many times I have said, Mother w=
hole day have passed . When will you appear to me again? I am sure She will=
 come.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Namaste,

Your friend is essentially correct -=
 body has no use or meaning after death. 
However, your friend is not entir=
ely correct. If one has a deep attachment 
to the body, mind may be attache=
d to the body even after death, even after 
the connection of the karmendri=
yas and jnanendriyas of the mind to the 
physical body is cut off. Then wha=
t happens to the body does affect the mind 
and its further
 progress.

*=
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

When one takes sannyasa, i.e renounces =
material world, the last rites are to 
be done symbolically. After that, on=
e is dead symbolically. However, if one 
does not have true renunciation an=
d detachment from body, relatives and 
other material objects, there is no =
point in taking sannyasa or doing 
symbolic last rites. Even if one does it=
, mind may still be attached to the 
body. If last rites are not done after=
 death, even a sannyasi's mind may 
have problems. On the other hand, a tru=
e sannyasi who is absolutely detached 
from the body even when alive will f=
ly high when mind is finally freed from 
the body at death.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =
=A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

One cannot control what others do with one's body a=
fter one leaves it. So 
the wisest course of action would be to develop det=
achment even when alive.
 
Divert the concern for the well-being of the bod=
y towards other people. Do 
bare minimum to keep the body alive and not be =
overly concerned about it. 
When you meditate, think only of god and try to=
 forget that there is a body 
that you occupy. Even if leg hurts or neck it=
ches, try to forget about it. 
If you ignore body for a while, it will cry =
out for attention, like an 
immature child who needs attention. If you give=
 it attention, you cannot 
experience god. But, as you ignore body more, bo=
dy will try more to get your 
attention (like an immature child who needs a=
ttention)! However, if you 
persist, body will have to eventually give up! =
THAT is when one can absorb 
the mind fully in god.

If one experiences tha=
t often while alive, that experience helps immensely 
at death. When the mi=
nd leaves the body for the last time, one can focus 
mind on god and ignore=
 the attention grabbing cries for help from the
 body. 
One who successfull=
y focuses mind on god when the last moment comes is 
liberated and gets saa=
yujya or moksha. On the other hand, one who wavers 
from the focus on god a=
nd lets mind turn towards the plight of the dying 
body gets stuck.

To a y=
ogi, each session of deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the 
last=
 moment! Death is not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment 
o=
f final liberation. Life is meant to be a practice for it!

Instead of worr=
ying about body and its last rites, let every ritual be a 
last rite! I sug=
gest that one should practice detachment and develop the 
ability to absolu=
tely ignore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as 
one tries to fo=
cus the mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god 
when meditati=
ng. If one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and 
what rites=
 becomes irrelevant.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0
 =A0 =A0 *

Of course, one =
who performs brilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget 
one's lines =
or put a wrong expression when playing the drama finally on the 
big stage.=
 Similarly, a yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and 
absorbed th=
e mind perfectly in god many times may still waver at the last 
moment and =
think of body or something else that is impermenant and be 
reborn.

Howeve=
r, all that is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last 
mome=
nt.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

You are lucky. There are many Hin=
dus who do not experience anything like 
what you described. Keep doing sad=
hana and overcome the little rawness that 
may still be left in the conscio=
usness.

Best regards,
Narasimha
