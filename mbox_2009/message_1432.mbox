Namaste,

this is a very good question by Krishna Kanth. i remember one of =
my friends discussed with me about the same in good old malgudi days.

I am=
 sure that this dilemma is faced by many many more.
as our narasimha said, =
refrain from giving if you know before that it will be misused. It is ideal=
 NOT TO feel that you are giving or helping or favouring. it is best to thi=
nk that "Maa ka tha, maa ne merese leke kisi aur ko diya" then i think bala=
nce sheet will tally.

but most of us are yet to reach that exalted state a=
nd therfore I have a good proverb (Excellent proverb in my opinion for such=
 tricky situation) for such dilemma

"Neki Kar aur Dariya me dal" 

Warm Re=
gards,

Utpal
