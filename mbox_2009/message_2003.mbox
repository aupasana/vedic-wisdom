Namaste,

This list is NOT for offering astrological guidance to people. There are 
many yahoogroups for that purpose, like vedic-astrology. Please stop sending 
mails like this here.

This list is devoted to discussions on spirituality and spiritual sadhana 
for self realization. People's material problems are quite important to 
them, but this list is NOT the forum to address them. Please stick to the 
charter of this list.

Best regards,
Narasimha
