Thanks! I am amongst the many clamoring for a manual to conduct the Satya N=
arayana vratam. However, I'm curious as to the tradition of homam accompany=
ing the Satya Narayana vratam ritual. It seems the custom of a homam after =
the puja is well established in the eastern part of the country (India). Bu=
t many a priest of south indian origin from the local Balaji temple here ha=
s looked askance at me when I have asked about the homam after the puja. No=
ne of them are aware of it. After some discussions we finally reached a con=
clusion that it is probably a cultural variance unique to the eastern and p=
robably northern regions of the country. I am curious as to what do you per=
sonally do after your Satyanarayana Vratam. And what is the origin of the c=
ustom of Homan accompanying the puja?

Warmest Regards,
Alok.
