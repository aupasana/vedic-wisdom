Perhaps you are getting cold feet. Do not worry. What is beauty after all? A decent human being with integrity, honesty and good values is the most beautiful of all. Why are you after external beauty? How long do you think external beauty with a hollow core and arrogant attitude will give you any happiness in life? If you want a supermodel, be prepared for the baggage that she will come with.

Do not live with any mask. Clear your mind off all these nonsensical things you are thinking of. If any of your friends has put this particular concept of beauty in your mind, then stay away from that person. 

You are going to marry that girl with the everlasting Agni as your witness. Make sure your mind is clear and you do this procedure of marriage honestly. And please look at yourself. Are you the most handsome man on earth? You may think so, and your mother will definitely think so. But in reality, you are not, if other women are asked the question. A million women will find a million other man better looking than you are. 

Please stop this concept of external beauty in your mind. Over time, you will really feel the true beauty in your life blossom, but only if you follow your Dharma. If you have given your word (which you have as per your engagement), then follow it until your last breath.

Good Luck.

Dr. Narasimhaswamy Banavara

I seem to have 2 options as part of my choice:

1. Marry the girl as I made a mistake in saying 'yes' - give her all the comfort as post marriage I would have taken marriage vows - Even though I internally feel she is not sufficiently good looking, live with that feeling for life - basically wear a "mask" for life

2. Cancel the marriage - even engagement is over - marriage is there next week. Bring defamy to myself and the family and harm the girl's psyche.

Exceptional circumstances made me say 'yes' and I am regretting the decision. Do I have to live with a mask for ever?
What does Dharma say I should do?

PVRji and others, pls. tell me
