Dear all,

Namaskaram.

I recently had the good fortune of visiting the Nan=
-Tien buddhist pagoda in Sydney. I found a rare sense of calm and immense p=
eace in front of the four huge=A0idols of Buddha, symbolising the four dire=
ctions with one in the centre. Each one with specific mudras and the huge h=
all had intense peaceful vibrations.=A0I am attaching the serene picture wh=
ich does not measure up to the actual experience but is still very beautifu=
l.

Kind regards
Nalini
=A0

Namaskaram Nalini Garu,

I'm glad you liked the article. 

Infact m=
ost of the points mentioned in the article were already said by Sri Narasim=
ha Garu in his various mails in this forum. It was like a refresher to go t=
hrough all of them at one place via this article.

Thanks and Best Regards
