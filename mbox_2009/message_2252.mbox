Hi,

I have a question. People say that if a ganesh chaturthi vrat has been=
 started in your family (father's side) then it must continue in the family=
. It can not be stopped for whatever reason. e.g. in my uncle's (mother's b=
rother) family ganesh chaturthi vrat is there. My uncle passed away las yea=
r. My mami and my sister are not in favor of continuing this vrat.

I want =
to know what does shastra says on this.

regards,

Jagmohan
