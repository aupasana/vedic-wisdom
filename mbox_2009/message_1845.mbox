Dear Narayan,
 
Nice understanding! You should write more often.
 
*       =
 *        *
 
Kaala is time personified. Kaali is the shakti of Kaala, i.e.=
 Kaali is the animator of Time. It is She who causes time to flow (or even =
to stop).
 
The concept of time and its flow are behind the entire delusion=
 of duality. As per vedanta, there is nothing called past or future, here o=
r there, I or you. There is Brahman at all places and all times. The object=
ification of Brahman into various objects is possible due to the play of Ka=
ala and Kaali and the creation of a concept of "time". One absorbed in non-=
dual Brahman wihtout any concept of time or objectification is immortal. Ti=
me, the great devourer, catches up with anyone stuck in duality, sooner or =
later.
 
BTW, Kaala and Kaali are inseparable. Without the "flow of time", =
there is no "time" itself. Similarly, without time, there cannot be a flow =
of time. Thus, time and its flow exist together and cannot exist without ea=
ch other.
 
*        *        *
 
Dakshina not only means south, but it als=
o means right. Tantra texts talk of Dakshina Kaali and Vaama Kaali. Dakshin=
a Kaali is propitiated using dakshinaachaaraa (right-handed practice), whil=
e Vaama Kaali is propitiated using vaamaachaara (left-handed practice). The=
 former is worshipped in temples, while the latter is worshipped in shmasha=
ana (cemetaries). The latter is also known as Shmashaana Kaali. Symbolicall=
y these two versions are depicted with right foot and left foot forward, re=
spectively.
 
Right side is associated with Pingala nadi, Surya (Sun) and d=
evatas (gods). It is also linked to the left brain and structured thinking.=
 Left side is associated with Ida nadi, Chandra (Moon) and pitris (manes). =
It is also linked to the right brain and emotional and intuitive thinking.
=
 
Dakshinaachaara attempts to reach the supreme using a structured approach=
. One does not try to destroy layers of deep conditioning of the mind in on=
e shot and takes an orderly and structured approach. It is appropriate for =
temples (places of public spiritual practice) and for general public too. V=
aamaachaara (left-handed path), on the other hand, attempts to nuke the lay=
ers of deep conditioning of the mind by throwing the mind into dark alleys =
that force the mind to realize the non-distinction between light and darkne=
ss. Of course, there is a chance one will fall and settle down in the darkn=
ess.
 
The tools and imagery used by dakshinaachaara followers worshipping =
Dakshina Kaali and those used by vaamaachaara followers worshipping Shmasha=
ana Kaali may be different, but they are searching for the same primordial =
energy that results in the flow of time.
 
Thus, Dakshina Kaali and Shmasha=
ana Kaali are not really different and merely represent different paths to =
obtain the same realization. Different forms of Kaali represent different p=
aths to arrive at the same srealization.
 
*        *        *
 
Bhadra mea=
ns auspicious. While one aspect of Time is that Time devours all and brings=
 the end of every object in the field of duality, the flow of Time does mor=
e. Flow of time brings the fruits of various karmas, brings maturity and tr=
ansformation in various objects of the field of duality and brings them clo=
ser to liberation. When one ponders the primordial energy that results in t=
he flow of time, from these angles, this path is represented by Bhadra Kaal=
i. She is also worshipped in temples like Dakshina Kaali.
 
*        *     =
   *
 
Mahaa Kaali, Mahaa Lakshmi and Mahaa Saraswati are three parts of th=
e very initial root primordial energy that is referred to as the golden-hue=
d "Mahaa Lakshmi" in Saptashati rahasya. This very initial root primordial =
energy Mahaa Lakshmi divides Herself into 3 parts - Mahaa Kaali, Mahaa Laks=
hmi and Mahaa Saraswati, 3 distinct aspects of the primordial energy. These=
 3 energies create 3 couples - Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts. We=
 may see this very initial root primordial energy "Mahaa Lakshmi" as the ex=
pression of the supreme cosmic being, as the energy that makes the supreme =
cosmic being be, want, think and know.
 
Chandi represents a fierce energy =
that makes one battle and overcome various weaknesses and conditioning of t=
he mind and reach this very initial root primordial energy.
 
Best regards,=

Narasimha
