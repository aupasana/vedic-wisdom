Namaste Narasimha Guruji,

Thank you for your detailed video and guide on homam procedures.

I have a query on the Shodasopachara Pooja mentioned in the appendix.

When offering  pooja to MahaGanapati, I wish to include the following:-

a) Ganapathi Atharva Seersham
b) Ganesha Pancharatnam Storam
c) Sankata Nasana Ganpati Strotram
d) 108 japams of "Om Gum Ganapatiye namaha"

I would appreciate if you could kindly advise as to at which sequence  
of the pooja should these be recited.

At present I am including them just before the MantraPushpam  
samaryapami, and my thoughts turned
to getting a clarification and confirmation from you, as my guruji.

Thank you.


Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

Warmest Regards,
Narayanan
