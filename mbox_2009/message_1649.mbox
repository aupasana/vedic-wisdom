Namaste Mitesh,
      Until the video is made, here is a method that could be attempted.
      You need to have the following at your disposal :
         a) Water pot with spoon
         b) 2 small containers, one empty and other filled with fresh water
         c) Silver tray (or any other plate)
      After taking sankalpam, place a silver tray on the floor in front of you. While reciting the mantra, with a spoon take water into the palm from the water pot. When collecting the water into the palm, do not keep the hand flat (parallel to the ground) as water might drop off.  Make the hand bowl-shaped. At the time of releasing the water, use one of the 3 appropriate ways to release the water. 
     During the conclusion when you need to throw away the water from the water pot, use the empty container. You can also some fresh water from the second container to thoroughly clean the water pot. Now take the fresh water from the second container into the water pot and wrap up with the last few mantras.

Regards
Ravi

Namaste Narasimha

May I request you to do a video of tarparna also. specially how one
drops or offers water. The three positions are easy but the overall flow of water and holding of water in the right hand.

I have also seen in India where people fill a deep tray with water
and then use both hands to lift water out of the tray speak the mantra
and then using one of the appropriate of the 3 ways to pour back water from both hands again back into the same tray. 

Any suggestions or ideas

Best Regards
Mitesh
