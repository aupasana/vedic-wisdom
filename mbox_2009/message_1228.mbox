Dear Group Members,

The following is the meaning given to me by my named G=
uru Shri 
Bhooshan Priya Ji. 

'This is what the  Maha Mrityunjaya mantra m=
eans:

 Sukracharya said "The first pada is Triyambakam Yajamahe and means =
-
 we worship or sing the praise of Lord Trayambaka. Tryambaka is the 
name=
 of Lord Shiva as the father of the three worlds - bhu, bhuva 
and svarga l=
okas. He is the father and lord of the three mandala's - 
Surya, Soma and A=
gni mandala. He is Maheswara, the lord of the three 
Guna's - Satva, Rajas =
and Tamas. He is the Sadashiva, the teacher of 
the three tatvas - Atma tat=
va, Vidya tatva and Shiva tatva. He is 
the father (cause and source) of th=
e three energies (agni) - 
Aavahaniya, Garhapatya and Dakshinagni. He is th=
e father of all 
physical creation through the three murti bhuta - Prithvi =
(solid), 
Jala (liquid) and Tejas or agni (energy). He is the lord of the 
=
three heavens created by the dominance of the three Gunas - Rajas 
(Brahma)=
, Satva (Vishnu) and Tamas (Shiva). Know Him to be the 
nirakara (formless)=
 Sadashiva as He is above this physical mode and 
is their Maheswara. This =
is the first foot of the mantra (composed 
of eight syllables)."

"The seco=
nd pada of the mantra," continued Sukracharya, "is  
Sugandhim Pushtivardha=
nam. Sugandhim refers to the fragrance of the 
flower that spreads in all d=
irections, and in a similar way Shiva is 
present in the entire creation, b=
oth animate and inanimate. In all 
the bhutas (modes of existence), in the =
three Gunas (nature of 
creation as being Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the te=
n indriyas (five 
gyana-indriyas or senses and five karma-indriyas or organ=
s of 
action), in all the devas (33 devas are the source of all 
illuminati=
on and enlightenment) and the ganas (hosts of demi-gods),  
Shiva exists an=
d pervades as the illumine atma (soul) and is their 
essence. Pustivardhana=
m is now being explained. That inward dwelling 
spirit (atman), the Purusha=
 Shiva is the real sustainer of Prakriti 
(and not vice-versa as all people=
 perceive). Starting with the 
mahatatva (primordial state of matter/energy=
) to the individual 
parts of creation, the entire sustenance of the physic=
ally created 
beings (both animate and inanimate) is done by the imperishab=
le 
Purusha. You, I, Brahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & devas 
are =
maintained/sustained (by the atma and that is Him). Since the 
Purusha (atm=
a - Shiva) is the granter of sustenance to prakriti 
(body/nature), he is '=
Pusti-vardhana'."

Having explained the first two pada of the mantra, Sukra=
charya 
continued to explain the remaining two pada. He said " the next two=
 
pada (consisting of sixteen syllables) is  Urvarukamiva Bandhanam 
Mrityo=
rmukshiya mamritat meaning - Prabhu! just as the ripe cucumber 
is severed =
from the bondage of the creeper, in the same manner may 
we be delivered fr=
om death for the sake of immortality (moksha). 
Rudra deva is like amrita (=
nectar of immortality). Those who worship 
Him with good karma, penance and=
 repentance, meditation, 
contemplation, prayer or praise, will surely rene=
wed life and vigor. 
The strength of truth force (in this mantra) is such t=
hat Lord Shiva 
shall definitely free the worshipper from the bondage of de=
ath 
because Shiva alone is the giver of bondage and moksha. 

This is the =
Mritasanjivani mantra and has the power to give back 
life and rescue from =
death and great evils. You should adore Lord 
Shiva and recite this mantra.=
 Water sanctified with this mantra 
should be drunk all the time. [Authors =
note: It is well known that 
the rudraksha bead is placed in a glass of wat=
er after being held in 
the palm during the recitation of the mantra. this =
water is drunk 
during the day.]

Oblations in the sacrificial fire with th=
is mantra is very 
purifying. Now I shall teach the dhyana for the mantra."=
 Saying so, 
Sukracharya started reciting the shlokas for meditating on Lor=
d 
Shiva.'

Trust this is also available for the general viewing and clarit=
y for 
the members of the Group

Thank you all for providing your valuable =
view on the matter and 
enligten me on the subject
