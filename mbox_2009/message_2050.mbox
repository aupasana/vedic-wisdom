Pranam, Narasimha ji,

We sometimes get carried away by imagination. My que=
stion is whether there is any role for imagination or should we shut our mi=
nds to fantasies?

When we are near the real thing maybe there is no role f=
or imagination. However, when that is not the case there may be certain lon=
gings that may lead to imagination.

For me, i have not been able to imagin=
e a personal deity. u can call it my bad luck. But on your advise that one =
should begin with Mahaganapathi homam, i am trying to develop a relationshi=
p with him. 

There are many attributes of Ganapathi that i am beginning to=
 become conscious of(i looked up the wiki). what i pray to is someone joyou=
s and dancing, someone who governs intelligence (siddhi), and, of course, t=
he remover of vighna. i imagine the twists and turns of his trunk (vakra tu=
nda?) to be the twists and turns within me, my own crookendness.

i have a =
small metallic idol of ganesha that i use for the homam. Lately i have star=
ted imagining the four arms of ganesha as the arms of the flames in the hav=
ana. that makes me wonder whether the arms of various deities are a depicti=
on of sun flares...a central energy point from where these shoot out.

some=
how i like the heat of the flames on the face and imagine that maybe some p=
urification is taking place when i bend down to the fire towards the end of=
 the homam. The smoke of the agarbatti dances around the the kund and somet=
imes enters into it, almost as if it had a live presence.

today was one of=
 those rare days when i could get up early and do homam around 5 a.m.in an =
open courtyard. i imagined that the brahma muhurtam was still there. i imag=
ined that the fire got started very quickly and was bright and crackling in=
 no time. i have a habit of turning the pieces of coconut with the tongs so=
 that they would burn thoroughly. i imagine that they they are my past sins=
/karma which should reduce to ashes. Today the akshatra, the raisens and th=
e flower that i offered were taken away one by one by the ants that appeare=
d from nowhere. it was amusing to see the flower and the raisens "walking" =
away. i imagined that the ants were the ganas of ganapathi who came for the=
 offerings.

now u may ask with all these "watchings" and imaginings where =
was the mind in meditation?

the answer is obvious :)

i know the imagining=
s are distracting and my "meditation" is imperfect.

but then i have a long=
 way to go....:(
