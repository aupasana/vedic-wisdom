17th March, 1939

Talk 648.


Sri Bhagavan said that Tatva Rayar was the fi=
rst to pour forth Advaita
philosophy in Tamil.

He had said that the Earth =
was his bed, his hands were his plates for taking
food, the loin cloth was =
his clothing and thus there was no want for him.

In Maharaja Turavu (the r=
enunciation of the king) he says: He was seated on
the bare ground, the ear=
th was his seat, the mind was the chamara; the sky
was the canopy; and renu=
nciation was his spouse:

Then Sri Bhagavan continued: I had no cloth sprea=
d on the floor in earlier
days. I used to sit on the floor and lie on the g=
round. That is freedom. The
sofa is a bondage. It is a gaol for me. I am no=
t allowed to sit where and
how I please. Is it not bondage?

One must be fr=
ee to do as one pleases, and should not be served by others.

=91No want=92=
 is the greatest bliss. It can be realised only by experience.


Even an em=
peror is no match for a man with no want. The emperor has got
vassals under=
 him. But the other man is not aware of anyone beside the Self.
Which is be=
tter?
