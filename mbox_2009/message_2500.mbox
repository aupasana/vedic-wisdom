 In deep sleep and samadhi the existence of =91I=92 cannot be denied. All a=
dmit
its continued existence in those states also, because of the recollect=
ion of
the experience (in those two states).

Bhagavan Sri Sankara also say=
s that the Self, namely Chit, is always shining
as =91I=92.

In Viveka Chud=
amani it is found, =93That which constantly shines forth as =91I=92
through=
out infancy etc., waking state, etc., which are superimposed on
it....=94

=
Be not effortless in this direction Yoga Vasishta says: =93Even with hands
=
clenched and teeth ground,pressing the limbs and forcibly withdrawing the
s=
enses, the mind must first be brought under control.=94 So the utmost effor=
t
must be made.

Also the breath must forcibly be controlled, if necessary,=
 by means of
pranayama (regulation of breath). One-pointedness must be gain=
ed at all
costs. How long is effort necessary? Until direct experience is g=
ained.

Only the natural bliss of the Self prevails at the instant of relie=
f of
one=92s burden and in deep sleep. This means:

As soon as one is relie=
ved of one=92s heavy load, one surely feels refreshed;
this cannot be denie=
d; but here there are no objects to give pleasure, and
how could it be felt=
 unless it is from within, i.e., from the Self?

In deep sleep there is no =
strain to be removed and yet there is the bliss of
sleep. This cannot be de=
nied because there is the recollection of the bliss
of sleep after waking f=
rom it. This bliss cannot but be of the Self.

HE MYSTERY BEYOND THE TRINITY Translated by

I (Munagala S. Venkataramaiah)

Tripura Rahasya is an ancient prime text on=
 Advaita in Sanskrit and was
highly commended by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Mahars=
hi for study by seekers. There
was no English translation of this scripture=
 until the present one was made
by Munagala Venkataramiah (Swami Ramananand=
a Saraswathi) in 1938.
