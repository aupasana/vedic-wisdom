No, I won't agre=

t merely as an act to glue my son to the seat. How ever, my son pour the wa=
ter fast and hence I end up get lots and lots of water. I usually drink the=
 water after he finishes the abhishekam. If I should not reuse the water, I=
 won't be able to drink up all the water. May be I can use it for bathing t=

using the water seem to simplify the whole thing.

Thanks for your kind responce.

I treated Siva as a kid (if my son is in=
 sofa watching TV, I won't hesitate to move the sofa - in this case I had m=
entally requested Siva not to mind; but in the end my son started doing it =
himself, (once the bowl was full, he took the siva lingam out and put it in=
 the other container and continued that way. That is what made me think if =
I am misdirecting him.

How ever, strangely I felt resonating sound while I=
 was chanting mRtyunjaya mantra (felt as if there is chanting from with in =
me) and felt very well. So, I am sure Siva was not upset - but that could b=
e because he is Siva.

I will definitely try not to move the idol.
