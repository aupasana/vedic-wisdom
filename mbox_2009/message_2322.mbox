 THE WAY TO THE REALISATION OF A UNIVERSAL RELIGION
(Delivered in the Unive=
rsalist Church, Pasadena, California, 28th January
1900)


Do religions con=
tradict or supplement each other? =97 that is the question.I
believe that t=
hey are not contradictory; they are supplementary. Each
religion, as it wer=
e, takes up one part of the great universal truth, and
spends its whole for=
ce in embodying and typifying that part of the great
truth. It is, therefor=
e, addition; not exclusion.

Then, again, we also know that there may be al=
most contradictory points of
view of the same thing, but they will all indi=
cate the same thing.Suppose a
man is journeying towards the sun, and as he =
advances he takes a photograph
of the sun at every stage. When he comes bac=
k, he has many photographs of
the sun, which he places before us. We see th=
at not two are alike, and yet,
who will deny that all these are photographs=
 of the same sun, from different
standpoints?Take four photographs of this =
church from different corners: how
different they would look, and yet they =
would all represent this church. In
the same way, we are all looking at tru=
th from different standpoints, which
vary according to our birth, education=
, surroundings, and so on.We are
viewing truth, getting as much of it as th=
ese circumstances will permit,
colouring the truth with our own heart, unde=
rstanding it with our own
intellect, and grasping it with our own mind. We =
can only know as much of
truth as is related to us, as much of it as we are=
 able to receive. This
makes the difference between man and man, and occasi=
ons sometimes even
contradictory ideas; yet we all belong to the same great=
 universal truth.

In this line the Mohammedans were the best off; every st=
ep forward was made
with the sword =97 the Koran in the one hand and the sw=
ord in the other: "Take
the Koran, or you must die; there is no alternative=
! " You know from history
how phenomenal was their success; for six hundred=
 years nothing could resist
them, and then there came a time when they had =
to cry halt. So will it be
with other religions if they follow the same met=
hods.

The fact that all these old religions are living today proves that t=
hey must
have kept that mission intact; in spite of all their mistakes, in =
spite of
all difficulties, in spite of all quarrels, in spite of all the in=
crustation
of forms and figures, the heart of every one of them is sound =
=97 it is a
throbbing, beating, living heart. They have not lost, any one o=
f them, the
great mission they came for. And it is splendid to study that m=
ission. Take
Mohammedanism, for instance. Christian people hate no religion=
 in the world
so much as Mohammedanism. They think it is the very worst for=
m of religion
that ever existed. As soon as a man becomes a Mohammedan, the=
 whole of Islam
receives him as a brother with open arms, without making an=
y distinction,
which no other religion does. If one of your American Indian=
s becomes a
Mohammedan, the Sultan of Turkey would have no objection to din=
e with him.

If he has brains, no position is barred to him. In this countr=
y, I have
never yet seen a church where the white man and the negro can kne=
el side by
side to pray. Just think of that: Islam makes its followers all =
equal =97 so,
that, you see, is the peculiar excellence of Mohammedanism. I=
n many places
in the Koran you find very sensual ideas of life. Never mind.=
What
Mohammedanism comes to preach to the world is this practical brotherho=
od of
all belonging to their faith. That is the essential part of the Moham=
medan
religion; and all the other ideas about heaven and of life etc.. are =
not
Mohammedanism. They are accretions.

With the Hindus you will find one =
national idea =97 spirituality. In no other
religion, in no other sacred bo=
oks of the world, will you find so much
energy spent in defining the idea o=
f God. They tried to define the ideal of
soul so that no earthly touch migh=
t mar it. The spirit must be divine; and
spirit understood as spirit must n=
ot be made into a man. The same idea of
unity, of the realisation of God, t=
he omnipresent, is preached throughout.
They think it is all nonsense to sa=
y that He lives in heaven, and all that.
It is a mere human, anthropomorphi=
c idea. All the heaven that ever existed
is now and here. One moment in inf=
inite time is quite as good as any other
moment.

With the Christians, the =
central idea that has been preached by them is the
same: "Watch and pray, f=
or the kingdom of Heaven is at hand" =97 which means,
purify your minds and=
 be ready!And that spirit never dies. You recollect
that the Christians are=
, even in the darkest days, even in the most
superstitious Christian countr=
ies, always trying to prepare themselves for
the coming of the Lord, by try=
ing to help others, building hospitals, and so
on. So long as the Christian=
s keep to that ideal, their religion lives.
