Namaste

Kundalini Awakening is more than this, it is not very easy to desc=
ribe and do justice. It is no use to get bits and pieces.

Please read some=
 good books on it, there are quite a few good ones
from Swami Muktananda hi=
s book "Chiti Leela". Swami ShivomTirth also wrote very good books that ext=
ensively cover this in a very special way.

Best Regards
Mitesh

Apaana is the downward force. When one attains a perfect focus on a mantra =
and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from lungs/stomach an=
d apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana combine, they can move upwar=
d at a rapid speed.

feel a kind of bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one's=

 These things happen automatically without thinking about them and engaging=
 in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about them, desiring them an=
d doing specific practices may become an obstacle and delay things. If you =
surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a high level of focus, that is en=
ough. Do NOT run after any experience and think of an experience as an end =
result. The focus should be mantra and mantra alone.

ara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Provided you=

> Since you do not have any real definiti=
on of Gandanta, I am dropping that and continue with my belief of the junct=
ion between Agni and Jala rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctio=
ns. Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.

=C2=A0

long as the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Re=

=C2=A0
> Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bo=
gus and has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara an=
d others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much conseque=
nce. This sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back whose s=
tatements like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that=
 people are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.
> =C2=A0
> Statement=
 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=
=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for t=
he same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when an=
y one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take paracetam=
ol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to write a book on Man=
tra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.
