As per Nar=

 The field of duality is like a dream. Being established in Brahman or Aatm=
an is like the wakeful state. All the objects of dream disappear when one i=
s awake. They are unreal. However, they are quite real for one who is still=
 in the dream! And, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dr=
eam are so different in their nature, abilities and effect. Even though a j=
naani may tell you there is god (Brahman) in everything and all are equal, =
it is true only for one established in Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring =
lion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are equal. But, to somebod=
y still sleeping, both are so different.
