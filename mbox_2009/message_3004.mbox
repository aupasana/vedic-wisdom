 Would you keep a large water-jar and savory pickles in the same room in
which a patient with typhoid fever was lying? If you wish to cure such a
patient, you must have him removed from that room, in case it is impossible
to send away the jar and the pickles.

A man of the world is like unto such a thirsty patient;worldly attractions
are like the jar of water; sense objects are like the savory pickles; desire
to enjoy those things is the patient's thirst. The mouth waters at the mere
thought of the pickles.

We should not therefore remain near them all the time.Hence solitude is the
best remedy for worldliness.

First acquire right discrimination and true dispassion and then live in the
world. In the sea of the world there are crocodiles of passions and desires.
Rub the body with turmeric-paste if you wish to bathe in the sea, for then
crocodiles will do no harm to you. The turmeric is discrimination (of the
Real from the unreal) and true dispassion. God is the only Reality, the
phenomenal universe is unreal. Along with this another thing is needed, that
is intense devotion to God. [p. 163]
