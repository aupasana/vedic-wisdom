Namaste,

> Is not "Nama:" equivalent of NamaH?

Yes it is nearly same but=
 with a very crucial difference. I am
reproducing extract from Narasimha's =
message regarding Sanskrit grammar.
One important thing which has come to m=
y mind is that, because it is
Visarga, in Sanskrit scripts, it is denoted b=
y : and NOT by  'Ha' akshar
written in devanagari. that shows that there is=
 some important
difference in pronunciation and the sound should not be mad=
e explicitly
as Ha but one should let go the air while pronouncing it.  it =
is
different thing that apparently it sounds like Ha.

Fir=
st time i thought about Vigneshwara in line with what you mentioned.
if we =
split the word which are joined then it is Vigna + Ishwara =3D God
of Obsta=
cle. it can very well mean that the God who controls obstacles.
now if we d=
erive meaning that Ganapati (Vigneshwara) is the controller
of Obstacles th=
en what you mentioned seems quite correct because the one
who controls obst=
acle has the power to put forth the obstacle as well as
remove it.

> Furth=
ermore, is there some significance of the trunk turned to the
right as oppo=
sed to the left >or the middle?

I do not know WHY but It is a popular opin=
ion in Maharashtra and Gujarat
(may be in the other places as well) that Mu=
rti or picture of Ganapati
having Right Sided trunk are very active (Live) =
and hence they should be
handled with extreme care. i mean, the idol or pic=
ture should never
remain without Pujan etc... Generally people are afraid o=
f keeping such
a idol in their homes because they feel that if they are no =
able to
properly worship the idol then some kind of misfortune will befall =
on
them. Other thing is that, there is also belief that if the idol is
prop=
erly propitiated then it can give great fortune.

it is not out of place to=
 mention here that about a year back somebody
gave me a Ganapati idol havin=
g Right side trunk. i kept it in my small
puja place. i think i hardly ever=
 worship the idol but when i started
Homam i used to keep the idol in the h=
omam. although i knew the above
belief, i was never afraid of misfortune. a=
fterwards i came to Mumbai
for vacation and i bought another idol of metal.=
 now i had (still have)
2 idols and i used to keep only metal idol (with le=
ft side trunk) but i
had some kind of guilt feeling that i am not able to k=
eep the earlier
one idol so i decided to give the metal idol to one of my c=
olleagues who
was going to shift to a new house. i gave them the idol but t=
hey were
little hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Guru about it and he =
asked
to keep both the idols in the Homam and i started doing that. now dur=
ing
my Homam, there are both Ganapati present, one with Right side trunk an=
d
one with left side. one who is ready to punish and the one who just let
g=
o like visarga :).

but truly speaking, my fear for such things have almost=
 gone. No
trepidation by whatever beliefs. Whether it is Ganapati of Right =
sided
trunk or mistakes in rituals or wrong pronunciation of veda mantra or=

such other things.



***

I have no answers for the rest of the things yo=
u asked.

sorry if i've deviated.

best regards,

Utpal
