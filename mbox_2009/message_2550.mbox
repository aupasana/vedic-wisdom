 3rd July, 1947

A devotee, who has been coming to the Ashram off and on, y=
esterday, during
conversation regarding Bhagavan=92s stay on the hill, aske=
d him, =93While
Bhagavan was on the hill, it seems some one did abhisekham =
to Bhagavan with
coconut water. Is that a fact?=94 Laughingly Bhagavan said=
, =93Yes, while I was
in Virupaksha Cave, some ladies from the north came.
=

I was sitting on a platform under the tamarind tree with half-closed eyes,=

without particularly noticing their arrival. I thought they would go away
=
after a while.

Suddenly there was a noise of breaking something. I therefo=
re opened my eyes
and saw coconut water trickling down my head.

One of tho=
se ladies had done that abhisekam. What was I to do? I was in
mouna and cou=
ldn=92t talk. I had no towel even to wipe the water off, and so
the water d=
ried on my body as it was.

Not only that. There used to be lighting of cam=
phor, pouring of water on the
head, thirthas (sacred waters), prasadas, and=
 several such troublesome
performances. It used to be quite a job stopping =
such things.=94

I myself have seen similar instances some four or five yea=
rs back. In the
room where Bhagavan takes his bath, there is a hole through=
 which the water
that is used drains out.Below that, a gutter was construct=
ed to drain off
the water.

At the time of his bathing, some devotees used =
to gather at that place,
sprinkle on their heads the water that came out of=
 the room, wipe their eyes
and even use it for achamaniyam (sipping drops o=
f water for religious
purposes).

That was going on quietly and unobserved =
for some time. But in due course
people began bringing vessels and buckets =
to gather that water and soon
there was a regular queue.

That naturally re=
sulted in some noise which reached Bhagavan=92s ears. He
enquired and found=
 out the facts. Addressing the attendants,he said, =93Oh! Is
that the matte=
r? When I heard the noise I thought it was something else.

What nonsense! =
Will you get this stopped or shall I bathe at the tap
outside? If that is d=
one, you will be saved the trouble of heating water for
me,and there will b=
e no trouble for them either, to watch and wait for that
tirtha. What do I =
want? Only two things, a towel and a koupinam.

I can bathe and then rinse =
them at the tap and that completes the job. If
not the tap, you have the hi=
ll streams and the tanks. Why this bother? What
do you say?=94

When Bhagav=
an thus took them to task, they told everything to Sarvadhikari
who thereup=
on put a ban on any one going to the side of the bath room during
the bathi=
ng hour.

Another thing happened during those days. Bhagavan used to go to =
the hill in
the hot sun after taking meals in the forenoon.

On his return,=
 when he came to the platform near the hall, the attendants
used to pour wa=
ter on his feet from the kamandalu (wooden bowl) and he used
to wash his fe=
et
and then go in.

Some used to hide somewhere there and, as soon as he we=
nt into the hall,
they used to collect that water and sprinkle it on their =
heads.

Once an enquiry starts, all faults come to light, don=92t they? Bha=
gavan
appears to have noticed that also. One afternoon he saw through the w=
indow
an old and long standing devotee sprinkling this water on his head.

=
Seizing that opportunity, he began saying, =93There it is! See that! As I h=
ave
not been taking any special notice of it, it is going beyond all limits=
.
However long they are here and however often they hear what I say, these
=
ridiculous things do not stop.

What is it they are doing? I shall hencefor=
th stop washing my feet, do you
understand?=94 He thus reprimanded them sev=
erely. That devotee was stunned,and
with shame and grief, went to Bhagavan =
immediately and begged to be excused.

Not only did Bhagavan admonish him l=
ike that, but from the next day onwards,
Bhagavan refused to wash his feet =
there even though the attendants pleaded
with him to retain the existing cu=
stom.
