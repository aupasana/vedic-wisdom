 THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS JNANA
Volume 9, Lectures and Discourses

It need no=
t be proved that we are in bondage. For instance: I would be very
glad to g=
et out of this room through this wall, but I cannot; I would be
very glad i=
f I never became sick, but I cannot prevent it; I would be very
glad not to=
 die, but I have to;I would be very glad to do millions of things
that I ca=
nnot do. The will is there, but we do not succeed in accomplishing
the desi=
re. When we have any desire and not the means of fulfilling it, we
get that=
 peculiar reaction called misery. Who is the cause of desire? I,
myself. Th=
erefore, I myself am the cause of all the miseries I am in.

To understand =
reincarnation, we have first to know that in this universe
something can ne=
ver be produced out of nothing. If there is such a thing as
a human soul, i=
t cannot be produced out of nothing. If something can be
produced out of no=
thing, then something would disappear into nothing also.
If we are produced=
 out of nothing, then we will also go back into nothing.
That which has a b=
eginning must have an end. Therefore, as souls we could
not have had any be=
ginning. We have been existing all the time.

Then again, if we did not exi=
st previously, there is no explanation of our
present existence. The child =
is born with a bundle of causes. How many
things we see in a child which ca=
n never be explained until we grant that
the child has had past experience =
=97 for instance, fear of death and a great
number of innate tendencies. Wh=
o taught the baby to drink milk and to do so
in a peculiar fashion? Where d=
id it acquire this knowledge?

In the same way, the question was why these =
tendencies are in the child. Why
should it have fear of death if it never s=
aw death? If this is the first
time it was ever born, how did it know to su=
ck the mother's milk? If the
answer is "Oh, it was instinct", that is simpl=
y returning the question. If a
man stands up and says, "I do not know", he =
is in a better position than the
man who says, "It is instinct" and all suc=
h nonsense.

Let us look a little closer into the matter. Say, for instance=
, here is a
father. A child is born to him. We see that the same qualities =
[which the
father possesses] have entered into his child. Very good. Now ho=
w did the
qualities of the father come to be in the child? Nobody knows. So=
 this gap
the modern physicists want to fill with the big word transmission=
. And what
does this transmission mean? Nobody knows.

Someone takes advant=
age of the light of the sun to break into your house and
rob you. And then =
when he is caught by the policeman, he may cry: "Oh sun,
why did you make m=
e steal?" It was not the sun's fault at all, because there
are thousands of=
 other people who did much good to their fellow beings under
the light of t=
he same sun. The sun did not tell this man to go about
stealing and robbing=
.

Each one of us reaps what we ourselves have sown. These miseries under w=
hich
we suffer, these bondages under which we struggle, have been caused by=

ourselves, and none else in the universe is to blame. God is the least to
=
blame for it.

The natural desire of man is to go towards the senses. Turni=
ng away from the
senses takes him back to God. So the first lesson we have =
to learn is to
turn away from the vanities of the world.

We are slaves in =
the hands of nature =97 slaves to a bit of bread, slaves to
praise, slaves =
to blame, slaves to wife, to husband, to child, slaves to
everything. Why, =
I go about all over the world =97 beg, steal, rob, do
anything =97 to make =
happy a boy who is, perhaps, hump-backed or ugly-looking.
I will do every w=
icked thing to make him happy. Why? Because I am his
father. And, at the sa=
me time, there are millions and millions of boys in
this world dying of sta=
rvation =97 boys beautiful in body and in mind. But
they are nothing to me.=
 Let them all die. I am apt to kill them all to save
this one rascal to who=
m I have given birth. This is what you call love. Not
I. Not I. This is bru=
tality.

There are millions of women =97 beautiful in body and mind, good, =
gentle,
virtuous =97 dying of starvation this minute. I do not care for the=
m at all.
But that Jennie who is mine =97 who beats me three times a day, a=
nd scolds me
the whole day =97 for that Jennie I am going to beg, borrow, c=
heat and steal
so that she will have a nice gown.

Do you call that love? N=
ot I. This is mere desire, animal desire =97 nothing
more. Turn away from t=
hese things. Is there no end to these hideous dreams?
Put a stop to them.

=
So when you have realized the misery of this physical existence =97 when yo=
u
have become convinced that such a life is not worth living =97 you have m=
ade
the first step towards Jnana.
