Thank you Utpalji. I was asking about Devi Suktam itself. As per Narasimhaj=
i's advise I have told the person to carry on homas of devi suktam (which s=
he is comfortable with) instead of anything else. I will check the Chandi h=
oma manual. Thanks.



The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva S=
utra

namaste,

if you were asking about Devi Sukt, then the Additi=
on of Swaha is 
mentioned in The Chandi Homa Manual.

Warm Regards,
