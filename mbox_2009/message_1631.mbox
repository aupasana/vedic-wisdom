Are you into any sort of business right now or do you have plans to do so.
=
Your 7th house is much stronger than the 6th house. The 6th house is the ho=
use of career wherein you need to work for somebody but here it is not so. =
Your 6th house lord Mercury is with Sun and is combusted and also it with o=
ther malefic like Venus and Saturn.

So your career would always have some =
issues and other thing is in your d-10 chart the sun which is the giver of =
job is sitting in 12th house hence again as said earlier you would have pro=
blem relating to career.=A0 Your career would not be stable

I suggest you =
get into business.=A0 Career does not suit you

You will do good in busines=
s as Mars the lord of 7th house is sitting in 9th house and exalted. And 9t=
h house is the house of=A0 Vishnu who would be protecting you in your busin=
ess

In the mean time I suggest you to kindly have your kala sarya yog reme=
died by visiting srikalahasti temple and get the rahu and ketu pooja done i=
n the first house.=A0 Follow the instructions of the temple priests and eve=
rything would be find


Regards
