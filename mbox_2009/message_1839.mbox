Thank you for your reply.=A0I had missed=A0out on=A0Daks=

auspicious.

I=A0found out from a =
local book=A0that She is named Dakshina because even Yama - the God of deat=

One more query I have is about the difference bet=
ween Ma Kali and Ma Chandi. How are they different?
=A0
With my little unde=
rstanding, I know Chandi is a fierce deity of war, then what is Kali?
=A0
T=

Namaste Rajarshiji,

As you may know, Kali is time personifi=
ed and deals with death and destruction, which is what the concept of time =
does. What is future today becomes present tomorrow and past later. Hence t=
he concept of time is inevitably synonymous with death.

Dakshina also mean=
s south-facing or the realm of death, and Bhadra means auspicious, as the g=
reat Mother Kali through death reminds of the truth of the ephemeral nature=
 of our life/lives and grants us moksha, thereby relieving us temporary dea=
th and hence fear!

Since the concept of death has to be dealt by tantric p=
ractitioners on their path, they are first introduced to Kali, who is the f=
irst among the Dasa (10) Mahavidyas.

Hope this helps.

Thanks
Narayan
