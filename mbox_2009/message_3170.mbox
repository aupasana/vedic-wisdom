Dear Sri Narasimha Garu, 
 
I was able to perform the Homam last couple of =
sundays and plan to practise it as often as I could. Now some more question=
s. 
 
1. Your document says that the Kalasam should be established to the N=
orth East of the HomaKundam. My fireplace is situated on the eastern side o=
f the house and I will be facing east as I sit, just like how it is preferr=
ed. My homakundam is small enough that I can establish the Kalasam also wit=
hin the fire-place to the North East of the Homa Kundam and The Ganapathi I=
dol also right in front of the Kalasam, within the fireplace. Is it okay to=
 do it this way or should the Kalasam and Ganapathi Idol should be out side=
 of the fire-place? If they should be outside, then there is no way the Kal=
asam could be to the North East if the HomaKundam. 
 
2. In the poorvagam (=
preliminary offering) on page 17, the second mantra, "Om Indraya Swaha! Ind=
rayEdam Namama" should be done pouring the ghee from the SouthWest to North=
East, according to the document. This should be done with the Shruk (Big Sp=
oon) according to the system that I learnt for our Sharmaji. Other than thi=
s, everywhere else I am just using the small spoon only, even in that syste=
m. I did not know that these (Shruk and Shruvam) are representing the male =
and female elements. Can you shed more light on the subject, as to what is =
the inner meaning of using these two spoons etc? 
 
3. One other small aspe=
ct that I noticed is there is a certain kriya where the water in the Shuddi=
 Patra should be pushed from west to east (three times) with the pavitram a=
nd pavitram is eventually made knot-free and put in the fire after dipping =
in the ghee. This is something I did not find in your document. Could you p=
lease explain the meaning of this and why this was skipped in the document.=
 In fact, your document does not mention the suddhi patra separately other =
than the Kalasam. Or is it that the Kalasam and the Shuddhi Patra are same?=
 I am a bit confused. The Shuddi patra, the Aajya Patra, the Shruk and Shru=
vam make it Chatushpatra Prayogam, as I understand. Is there a different na=
me for the prayogam that you documented? I know you tried to simplify the w=
hole thing, but anyway, if I understand these finer aspects, I feel better.=
 
 
I hope you will be willing to answer these simple questions and if not,=
 please let me know why not! 

With Regards, 
 
 
Nagraj
