Namaste

Thanks a lot for sharing this, Bhaktmaal is all full of stories li=
ke
this, the author "Saint Nabhaji" happened to live in Galtaji near Jaipur=
, in rajasthan, in the lineage of Swami Ramananda. His own story is also ve=
ry fascinating.

The place in Galtaji has great vibrations. In ancient time=
s there was ashram of Galav Rishi and then Swami BalaKrishna Paihari Baba l=
ived there too.

Thanks once again for this.
Best Regards
Mitesh

his mind. Vahaamyaham? Can it really be true? God lugging provisions on His=
 own back? How can that be? He believed in God's words in the Gita, but jus=

became very disappointed with himself. He stopped writing and got up, with =
a sad heart that he just broke his vow. What could he do? After a while, he=
 got back some of his composure and said a prayer to Sri Krishna in all hum=
ility, "Please teach me, O Madhava! I am ignorant and foolish and I do not =
know what you mean by vahaamyaham. Please teach me, and guide me so the com=

or the alms. In those days, people considered it an honor to give food grai=

 Arjun Mishra was distraught from the morning, so he thought that he would =
go to take a dip in the holy Rohini kunda first. He set out from home, the =
kunda was a little distance away.
>

 he remembered the story of the old crow in the Skanda puran. When the crow=

in the water and then looked devotedly at Lord Jagannatha on the temple alt=
er. Soon afterwards, it died and became free from life. Arjun Mishra though=
t that taking a dip in such a holy water will help him as well.

> While =
he was gone, two young boys arrived at the Mishra home with big sacks on th=
eir backs, huffing and puffing from the load. They looked miserable and wer=
e crying loudly. Arjun Mishra's wife was sitting on the verandah, looking o=
ut for her husband. When she saw the boys, she came down the steps running,=
 very concerned. She was an extremely kind lady.

young boys. Who is making you carry such heavy sacks? Where are you going?"=

s. Blood was oozing out from their scars. "Oh! What kind of heartless perso=

 them down on wooden seats they had in the verandah, and ran inside. There =
was no food in the house, so she brought two cups of cold water for them. A=

ari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ran to it and broke a fat leaf. Then=
 she mashed the leaf with her masala-grinding stone and collected the expre=
ssed resin. She was now ready to dress their wounds. She cleaned their woun=

ghritakumari resin soothed their wounds and the boys were feeling a lot bet=

 answers and let them go. Then her thoughts turned again to her husband. Sh=
e just did not understand how her gentle husband could have hurt those boys=
. Anyway, she did not have time to think too much. She needed to start cook=
ing. So she picked up the groceries and started cooking. Her husband should=
 come back any time now.

. He called out, but nobody was home. People had left for higher ground. So=
 he came back home empty-handed. When he got home, he found his wife was co=

the word vahaamyaham with red ink. That mark Sri Krishna carried as injury.=
