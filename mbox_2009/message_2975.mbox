Namaste Everyone,
=A0
=A0
If a person is left handed, is it ok for him to =
do homas? I mean he has to give his ahuti with left hand if he does homa.

=A0
=A0
Also, normally we consider the right hand to be for auspicious acti=
vities, and most people indeed are right handed. But then some left handed =
people are also born. Is there any spiritual/karmic reason for this, why a =
small percentage of people happen to be left handed?
=A0
-Regards
