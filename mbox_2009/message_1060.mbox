Dear Rajarshiji/Utpalji,
Namaskaaram,
Though Shivaaji Mahaaraja's contribut=
ion to Hinduism is sterling and undebatable-he had Samrtha Raamdaasa as his=
 guru who kindled in him an ambition after explaining him the Kshaatra Dhar=
ma -this Commentary is a very famous Grantha : Daasa Bodha in Maraathi.
Of =
course-Shivaaji Mahaaraja's mother Jeejabai was no less inspiring !

IMHO- =
Hinduism in places like=A0 Northern Indian region like Mathura,as mentioned=
 by Rajarshiji were saved from the Islamic tirade by Sikh Gurus like Guru G=
obind Singhji who fought the iconoclasts at a very tender age of Nine years=
 ! Just Nine years !!! While assuming leadership of Sikhs after his father =
Guru Arjan Devji was executed while trying to save Hindus of Kashmir and th=
e then undivided Punjab.He sacrificed Four Son trying to save Sikhs and Hin=
dus from forcible adoption of another religion.His father Arjan Devji.. As =
a Hindu I feel very sad when people jest at Sikhs forgetting the debt we ow=
e to the Sikh Gurus. 
But again that is God's and Guru's will !
As Utpalji =
passionately writes: we have a history of centuries falling prey to the div=
ide and rule policy adopted by all foreign invaders.
Like Paarasis(Jarthost=
i or Zoroastrians,as they are called)-=A0 ask any Jew or=A0 Bene Israeli an=
d She will tell that India is the only land where they were not persecuted =
but allowed to settle down peacefully !
May we all be guided to tolerance a=
nd live a life of " Sahanaavavatu Sahanau Bhunaktu.... 

humble regards

Namaste Utpal ji

Yes you are so correct.=
 I consider Shivaji Maharaj to be one of the best things that happened to H=
induism when it was needed most. A blessing from Ma Durga Herself.
=A0
Infa=
ct recently I had been reading on some history of India and I realized that=
 had it not been for Shivaji Maharaj inspired by his Guru Swami Ramdas, pla=
ces like Kasi, Prayag and Mathura would have become Mecca and Medina.
=A0
A=
nd you are also correct that we must all do out part to see that this glori=
ous tradition of Sanatan Dharma is never diminished. But the question is, w=
hat is it that one can do at an individual level? How does one know what is=
 the best course of action? 
=A0
I keep pondering over these things and I g=

It was ni=
ce reading your mail.

Namaste !

>Hinduism is a word =
coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the correct term

e. perennial spirit of righteousness

Intrestingly, last week i was in Oman=
 and i had a same discussion 
with one of the client's representative. He w=
as Aarab national and 
wanted to know something about Hindu religeon. First=
 thing i told him 
that 'Hindu' is a foreign word and none of our scripture=
 uses this 
word.

***

This is my long time belief that Sanaatan Dharma wi=
ll never perish. 
my logic is simple. in the recorded history, People from =
Sanaatan 
Dharma has never attacked the other religion. The glorious exampl=
e 
(which i am very proud of quoting) is Paarasi Community. They came to 
I=
ndia for saving their community and religeon and our people niether 
reject=
ed them nor influenced them to convert in to our religeon. they 
flourished=
 in our country in
 trade.

***

When Sanaatan Dharma was in great danger, =
Lord sent Shivaaji to 
control it. earlier Addi Shankara camedown for it. N=
ow it is our 
responsibility to see to it that we live its value in our lif=
e. and 
we need not forget the famous assurance "Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!"

b=
ut is everybody's duty to do their bit so that this glorious 
Tradition of =
Sanaatan Dharam never gets diminished.

best Regards,

Utpal

 it would not matter whether a nation calls <br>itself <br>> Hindu or se=
cular or whatever. What would matter is whether dharma <br>is <br>> foll=
owed or not.<br>> <br>> Right now, we do not have sanatana dharma bei=
