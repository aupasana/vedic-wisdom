Namaste,
      The general rule is that any mantra chanting during a homam should be
loud, atleast there should be little sound. However, this rule
does not apply to Gayatri Mantra.
      You can chant Gayatri mantra while offerings are made in any Homam, Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Srikrishna etc, but in mind only. You can infact do a seperate homa for Savitru Gayatri consisting entirely of Gayatra Mantra. 
      When you offer naivedyam, when you do praanayama etc also, do it mentally. That's what I meant when I said to keep it to oneself at all times.
      Hope it's clear now.

Regards
Ravi

Dear Ravi:

However in the Mahaganapati homam audio, Shri PVR recommends
offering  Gayatri mantra  to the fire. I was wondering how
one would do that if one cannot say it aloud. 
Are you saying it is not recommended to offer it?

Regards
