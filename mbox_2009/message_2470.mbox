 The individual encompasses his own creation with his ego (as =91I=92); so =
does
the Lord play with the universe. Just as the dreamer is not to be conf=
ounded
with the dream so is the Lord not to be confounded with the creation=
. Just
as a man survives his dream, so does the Lord survive the dissolutio=
n of His
creation. Just as you remain ever as pure consciousness apart from=
 the body,
etc., so is the Lord, unbounded consciousness apart from the uni=
verse, etc.
Is it not after all only a picture drawn by Him on His Self? Ho=
w can this
unique creation be apart from Him? There can indeed be nothing b=
ut
consciousness. Tell me of any place where there is no consciousness; the=
re
is no place beyond consciousness. Or can anyone prove in any manner anyt=
hing
outside consciousness? Consciousness is inescapable.

Moreover, this c=
onsciousness is the only existence,covering the whole
universe, and perfect=
 all through.Just as there cannot be breakers apart
from the ocean and ligh=
t without the Sun, so also the universe cannot be
conceived without conscio=
usness. The Supreme God is thus the embodiment of
pure Consciousness.

The =
universe has thus originated only as an image on the surface of the
mirror =
of the Absolute. This conclusion is in harmony with all facts.

Creation is=
 like a magician=92s trick, and is a city born of divine
imagination. O Par=
asurama, you are aware of the mental creations of
daydreamers which are ful=
l of people, life and work, similar to this. There
are also doubts,tests, d=
iscussions and conclusions =97 all imaginary arising
in the mind and subsid=
ing there. Just as castles in the air are mental
figments of men so also is=
 this creation a mental figment of Siva. Siva is
absolute Awareness, withou=
t any form. Sri Tripura is Sakti (energy) and
Witness of the whole.That Bei=
ng is perfect all round and remains undivided.

The world cannot stand inve=
stigation because of its changing unreal nature.
Just as the owl is dazzled=
 and blinded by bright sunlight, so the world
parades in glory before ignor=
ance and disappears before right analysis.

[Note: The man sees by sunlight=
 and is helpless in its absence. The owl sees
in darkness and is blinded in=
 sunlight. Whose sight is the better of the
two? This cannot be determined =
satisfactorily so that investigation becomes
lame.]


As long as the ignora=
nce of the self lasts, so long will there be misery.

The Sun helps all to =
see, but blinds the owls; water is the abode of fishes,
but drowns man; fir=
e burns a man, but is food to tittiri (a species of
bird); fire is ordinari=
ly put out by water, but it flourishes in the middle
of the ocean at the ti=
me of dissolution. Similar discrepancies are evident
elsewhere.

Men and an=
imals engage in activities with their limbs and senses, whereas
spirits do =
so with the bodies of others. Instances like these are
innumerable.

Sight =
is of the eye and cannot be without it.A jaundiced eye sees everything
yell=
ow and diplopia produces a double image of a single object.

Abnormal visio=
ns are thus the direct result of abnormal eyes. The
Karandakas, in an Easte=
rn island, are said to see everything red; so also
the inhabitants of Raman=
aka Isle see everything upside down.

One hears many more strange stories o=
f the kind, all of which are based on
abnormalities of vision. They can all=
 be remedied by proper treatment. The
same applies to other senses,includin=
g the mind.

The relation between space and objects and between time and ev=
ents is
according to your estimate of them; there is no intrinsic relations=
hip
between them.

Just as the mirror remains unaffected by the passage of =
different images and
yet continues to reflect as clearly as before, so also=
 the one consciousness
illumines the waking and dream states which can be v=
erified by proper
meditation.

Therefore recognise the fact that the world =
is simply an image on the mirror
of consciousness and cultivate the contemp=
lation of =91I am=92, abide as pure
being and thus give up this delusion of=
 the reality of the world.


True experience of the Self is the unawareness=
 of even =91I am=92. Can the world
persist after such unawareness? Second-h=
and knowledge is no better than the
recollection
of a dream.

Just as the a=
ccession of treasure in a dream is useless, so also is
second-hand knowledg=
e.

The whole world is manifested in it like a city in a mirror. Such is th=
at
transcendental state. On realising it, one becomes immortal; there is no=

place for doubts and uncertainties, as there is none at the sight of a
ref=
lection in a mirror; there is no more reason for ignorance as at the
sight =
of innumerable reflected images; and there will be no more room for
desire,=
 because transcendence is then experienced.

Just as a prince labours under=
 a misapprehension that the string of pearls
still clinging to his neck has=
 been stolen away by another and is not
persuaded to the contrary by mere w=
ords but only believes when he finds it
around his neck by his own effort, =
so also, O youth, however clever a man
may be, he will never know his own s=
elf by the mere teaching of others
unless he realises it for himself. Other=
wise he can never realise the Self
if his mind is turned outward.


Everybo=
dy fails in this investigation however learned and proficient he may
be, be=
cause his mind is not bent inward but restlessly moves outward. As
long as =
thoughts crop up, so long has the turning inward of the mind not
been accom=
plished. As long as the mind is not inward, so long the Self
cannot be real=
ised. Turning inward means absence of desire. How can the mind
be fixed wit=
hin if desires are not given up?

You are not the body, nor the senses, nor=
 the mind, because they are all
transient. The body is composed of food, so=
 how can you be the body?

Concentration on a particular item is necessary =
for the perception of
external things. But since consciousness is the Self =
and not apart from the
mind, concentration on it is not necessary for its r=
ealisation.It is enough
that other perceptions (namely,thoughts) should be =
eliminated from the mind
and then the Self will be realised.

Therefore it =
was also said that the sole necessity for Self-realisation is
purity of min=
d. The only impurity of the mind is thought. To make it
thought-free is to =
keep it pure.

The mind is truly abstracted in sleep. But then its light is=
 screened by
darkness, so how can it manifest its true nature? A mirror cov=
ered with tar
does not reflect
images, but can it reflect space also? Is it=
 enough, in that case, that
images are eliminated in order to reveal the sp=
ace reflected in the mirror?
In the same manner, the mind is veiled by the =
darkness of sleep and rendered
unfit for illumining thoughts. Would such ec=
lipse of the mind reveal the
glimmer of consciousness?

Moreover, pursue th=
e analogy of a tarred mirror. The tar may prevent the
images from being see=
n, but the quality of the mirror is not affected, for
the outer coating of =
tar must be reflected in the interior of the mirror. So
also the mind, thou=
gh diverted from dreams and wakefulness, is still in the
grip of dark sleep=
 and not free from qualities.This is evident by the
recollection of the dar=
k ignorance of sleep when one wakes.

Sri Sankara has said in Soundarya Lah=
ari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He
cannot even stir in Her absence.Siv=
a should not therefore be considered to
be a mere inexpressible entity depe=
nding for His movements upon Maya (like a
man on his car). Sri Sankara cont=
inues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to
His true being. Therefore a bles=
sed few worship Thee as the endless series
of waves of bliss, as the underl=
ying basis of all that is, as the Supreme
Force, maintaining the universe, =
and as the Consort of Transcendence. Thus
the identity of Siva and Sakti wi=
th each other or with Transcendence is
evident.

When the pictures on a wal=
l are erased, the original wall remains. No other
work is necessary to rest=
ore its original condition.

Similarly, the mind remains pure when thoughts=
 are eliminated.Therefore the
unqualified state is restored if the present =
disturbance is ended.

Therefore rule out creation as a mere thought or ser=
ies of thoughts and
realise the non-dual, residual, pure intelligence as th=
e Self.

Second-hand knowledge of the Self gathered from books or Gurus can=
 never
emancipate a man until its truth is rightly investigated and applied=
 to
himself; direct Realisation alone will do that. Therefore, follow my ad=
vice
and realise yourself, turning the mind inward.

To imagine that the Se=
lf is shackled by mental projections is to imagine
that the fire reflected =
in a mirror can burn it. There is absolutely no
bondage beyond the foolish =
certainty that you are bound and the difference
of entity created by mind. =
Until these two blemishes are washed away by the
holy waters of investigati=
on into the Self, neither I, nor Brahma the
Creator, nor Vishnu, nor Siva, =
nor even Sri Tripura, the Goddess of Wisdom,
can help that person to be ema=
ncipated.
