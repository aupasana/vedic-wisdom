Namaste Rajarshi bhai,

I also agree with you. you can try only on Fruits/s=
alads in dinner for a couple of weeks. please try some digestive also. Rice=
 or 'Khichadi' can also be one more option.
i have no idea if Homam can hav=
e such effects. Narayana or ravi or narasimha or some others who are perfor=
ming homa for couple of years can give some valuable information out of exp=
erience.

warm regards,
utpal
