  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Some queries on Homam

       =
 Dear Sir,
        My one mail is still unanswered. Can I give Ahutis for  =
Ratri Suktam, Devi Suktam, 4th Chapter and 11th Chapter independantly? I me=
an any of these four independantly ?
        While Chandi Homam you have om=
itted Devi Suktam and Ratri Suktam from Ahutis in your Manual. This reading=
 has created this question in my mind.

        r.Ashwin Rawal
          Na=
maste,

          Ravi and Utpal have replied to you. I will leave the ques=
tions they have 
          already replied too. As Ravi said, the amount of=
 materials you need depends 
          on how big a fire you maintain. You =
will learn and fine-tune with 
          experience.

          There may b=
e a tradition in some parts of India to offer a drop of ghee in 
          =
water after offering it in fire. But it is not necessary. When doing Chandi=
 
          homam, some people invoke the Mother in an idol and offer water=
 to the idol 
          with each mantra along with offering ghee in fire. =
Again, it is not 
          necessary.

          Managing ahutis and readi=
ng is difficult, but one can master it with 
          practice. It is real=
ly advisable for you to do both reading and offering 
          ahutis your=
self.

          Wooden spoon is perfectly alright.

          Best regards=
,
          Narasimha
