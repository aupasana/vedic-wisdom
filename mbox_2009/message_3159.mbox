Dear Sir,
    I am grateful for your concern. My faith in Sri Sri is both b=
lind and based on my personal experiences. I am grateful to have an discuss=
ion with a sincere sadhak and scholar like Shri Narasimha and other sadhaks=
 on this thread. 

The more I think about anything related to Sri Sri, the =
more chance I get to contemplate on Guru and his tattva. For that I am grat=
eful.

Love,
-Siva.

e clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully =
Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guid=
ing millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to be =
near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had=
 that experience twice), some in person and several via various other ways.=
 However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is ess=
ential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri's elaborate and =
in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guide di=
sciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be establi=
shed.

 It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieved hi=

urses: AOL is world's largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teach=
ers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proc=
eeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the f=
ull time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth i=
n property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neith=
er needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went=
 through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Know=
ledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be =
revealed to maximum number of people.

Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow =
the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri's guidance that no deserving p=
erson should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a vol=
unteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand ma=
ny cases where people took courses for free and were also provided free acc=
ommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there p=
aying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provid=
e healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.
