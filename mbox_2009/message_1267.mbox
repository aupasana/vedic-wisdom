This is a closing argument. Yes, you've made a really good point 
tha=
t a person can deside and follow what is the best method suited 
to him/her=
. it is futile to keep on arguing. One can say Naardiya 
Prescription (Naam=
 Japa) is the best or Yoga Path or Homa or ...

the most important is to st=
art something and have a faith in the 
power of the ultimate reality. It'll=
 guide and bring one to a right 
path suitable for oneself over a period of=
 time.

What makes one thoughtless (or with very less thoughts), what makes=
 
one internally happy and transforms internally for good. THAT is 
what is=
 suitable path for one.

I'll write about one intresting little point for H=
oma later today if 
possible.

Warm regards,

Utpal
