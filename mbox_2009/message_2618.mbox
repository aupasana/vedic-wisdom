Namaste,

Whether it is meditation after homam or normal meditation without homam, the 
purpose of meditation is to focus the mind on a mantra and/or a deity and 
forget body and other pre-occupations of the mind. So many conscious, 
sub-conscious and super-conscious thoughts are always running in the mind 
and they stop the mind from becoming absolutely still. When mind lets 
everything go and becomes still, then the deity can fill the mind. That 
bliss is indescribable and far higher than any normal happiness one may have 
experienced. That is what one is chasing when one meditates.

When mind is getting withdrawn a little from body and some of the conscious 
thoughts, it is possible that some sub-conscious thoughts lying beneath the 
surface come to the fore. It is not that you are attracting anything. It is 
just a thought or impression or memory stored in the sub-conscious mind. As 
mind's awareness of body and other things it is normally conscious of 
decreases, it may become more aware of some sub-conscious thoughts. If you 
negotiate those and learn to ignore those, then mind's awareness of some 
super-conscious thoughts may increase. As you refuse to be distracted by all 
these and try to focus the mind on the mantra and mantra alone, eventually 
mind will reach a state of stillness. There is no thumbrule to success, 
except trying.

As meditation after homam is more effective, it is possible to make progress 
faster. However, one still needs to work hard and long to achieve perfection 
in focus. Even great saints and yogis took many years. Just keep trying.

Next time such a thing happens, do not think much about it and be 
distracted. Keep the mind focused on the mantra. Nothing is to be feared and 
nothing is to be despised. All that is there is the deity you are praying 
to. The deity fills the entire universe. If you see or hear or perceive 
something other than the deity (e.g. "my body", a ghost trailor), it is 
because of mind's faulty perception. When mind perceives correctly, there 
should be nothing existing in the universe other than the deity. Fix this 
thought in your mind and keep trying.

Best regards,
Narasimha
