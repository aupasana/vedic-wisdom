Namaste,
 
1. That is ok. I am willing be to be thought of as a guru for th=
e homam procedures.
 
2. Don't worry. Keep a target and try to make it or c=
ross it. Numbers are there just for having targets. It is ok to not keep tr=
ack.
 
3. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, Sachchidananda is the real Guru.=
 I do not think of myself as a spiritual guru. I was blessed by my guru tha=
t I will be able to give good answers to the questions of genuine spiritual=
 aspirants. As I was chosen as a voice of my guru, some of my writings may =
come out really nice and sublime. But, I myself am in the middle of my sadh=
ana and not ready to be anyone's guru.
 
I explicitly agreed to be the guru=
 of one person on being asked by my guru, but that was an exception.
 
I am=
 sorry, but I cannot entertain your sincere request at this time.
 
*      =
  *        *
 
Guru is one who removes the darkness of limited I-ness and f=
ills one with the light of true Self. In other words, guru is one who leads=
 a sishya to self-realization. It is not a joke to lead people towards libe=
ration. One cannot bite more than what one can chew.
 
However, please reme=
mber that Nature WILL send the correct guru to you sooner or later, if you =
are sincere in your desire to progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Om Gura=

  Namasthe Narasimha Garu

  I just performed my first Ganapathi =
Homam using elements of the long and the laghu padhathi. Thank you for the =
manuals.

  Have a few questions:

  1. When doing the Anujnaa, I had thoug=
ht about you among the Gurus, since you have provided this knowledge to eve=
ryone. I hope it is OK.
  2. Does the count matter when giving the ahuthi, =
I counted mentally upto 120 or so but did not keep track after it. I was th=
inking keeping prepared myself the next time with
   say 108 almonds.
  3. =
I have been inspired by your words lately, and have been reading your posts=
 from 2002 Nov/Dec. I have also met you at the 2006 SJC West Coast conferen=
ce.
  Can you accept me as your sishya. Here is my birth data - August 10, =
