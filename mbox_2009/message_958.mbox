Respected Gurus,
Namasthe!!

I would appreciate if you can take 5 mins of y=
our time and read this..

I liked a girl from the past 7 years and wanted t=
o get married to her. 
Both my parents and the girl's parents have agreed a=
nd in the process, 
they happened to show both of our horoscopes to some kn=
owledgeable 
astrologers.
Whoever looked at the horoscopes(I should say 90%=
 of them), said that 
IT DOES NOT MATCH AND IS REALLLY BAD. 10% of them sai=
d frankly that - 
If I marry the girl, she will become a widow soon. (you k=
now what I 
mean..!!!). That fear has been distilled completely in both our=
 
families and they are persuading us to let go this relation.

We both are=
 in a state of shock and dilemma as to what needs to be 
done and what is t=
he next step to take. But, we love each other truly 
and never in this 7 ye=
ars we lost love for each other.

This is a real overturn of things which w=
e never ever expected. I just 
would want to know -

a. How much weightage =
must be given to their prediction based on the 
horoscope? 

b. Will the ev=
ent actually take place if I get married to her?

Kindly provide an insight=
ful answer as this is a crucial decision in 
my life.

Thank you
