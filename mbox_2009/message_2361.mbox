Yes! it is possible that we may not underst=
and something because of our own limitations. it is equally possible that f=
ew things said by spiritual giants in some context may not be applicable in=
 present time & environment we live in(Your example of Cooked and Raw rise =
is a guiding light for me).

There is no question of even an iota of disres=
pect when it comes to Naren & Thakur, even few quotes are not digested.

Wa=
rm Regards,

Utpal
