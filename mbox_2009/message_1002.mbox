Namaste,
=A0
Mars can give disea=
ses, debts (including financial 
debts), enemies, litigation, quarrels, war=
s=A0etc and also the energy to 
fight and overcome those problems. Propitia=
tion of Mars is useful to a lot of 
people these days.
=A0
Compared to medi=
tating with the mantra of any deity 
or worshipping an idol or a kalasha, i=
t is more powerful to offer the mantra in 
fire. I was instructed by my spi=
ritual master, 
who was told by the divine Mother, to teach simple procedur=
es for worshipping 
various deities in fire and spread the ritual of homam =
in the world. As the 
world goes through an interesting phase in the coming=
 years, it will be good to 
have a large number of people performing homam =
to various deities on a regular 
basis around the world.
=A0
Several manual=
s for doing homam (fire ritual) to 
various deities in 30-40 minutes are al=
ready there on my website. More manuals 
will be added in the course of tim=
e.
=A0
Now, I have added a manual for a short Kuja homam 
for Mars that can=
 performed everyday or once every week (Tuesday or some other 
day) or once=
 every month. It is hoped that some people will take advantage of 
this man=
ual, get some relief from the material troubles given by Mars that block 
t=
heir spiritual progress, make some spiritual progress=A0and also contribute=
 
to the well-being of the world in a small way.
=A0
Best 
regards,
Narasim=
