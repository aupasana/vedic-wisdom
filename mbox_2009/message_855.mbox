Dear Utpalji,
You=C2=A0have taken initiation from=C2=A0Narsimhaji and you h=
ave really gained the knowledge. Your answers are also convincing and you a=
re also explaining elaborately. Can I ask one question? Why you are address=
ing Narsimhaji as Garu instead of Guruji? 
How much time is consumed to per=
form daily Chandi Homam? In simple=C2=A0chanting of only 13 chapters I take=
 complete one hour.I am chanting mentally only. But if I do Homam, I think =
mentally it is not possible. Isn't it? Homam is to be done by uttering loud=
ly only, I think. What do you say?
Dr.Ashwin Rawal

Dear Dhira=
j Bhai,

following are answers for most of your questions to the best of my=
 
expereince of Chandi Homam. these are for 'One time' Chandi Homam 
only.
=

1) 1 kg Dry Coconut Halves are sufficient. You can break each 
coconut Hal=
f with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.

2) A very small bowl of=
 Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is 
sufficient as 'Ghee Aahutis' are =
to be given as only a single drop 
whenever it is mentioned in the Manual.
=

3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can offer 
Aaahut=
is of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya 
etc... Now o=
ne can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for 
offering as aahuti o=
r can use single stuff.

to elaborate, at each Swaha, one can take One Kish=
mis or Few Mamara 
or one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer =
to Agni.

If you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuf=
f 
which can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as 
Aah=
uti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take 
very little=
 'Havan samgri powder and offer it.

Thus one person can easily perform hom=
am as explained above because 
firstly, one doesn't need to give Aahutis of=
 Ghee and other stuff 
simultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can=
 be done with 
left fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.

2 kg of =
Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms 
will be sufficien=
t if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..

4) The Homa Fire represen=
ts Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. 
hence it is suggested that Aahutis=
 are only offered by You alone 
while mother and others can sit beside you =
and concentrate. they 
will gain lot of spiritual benefit just by attending=
.

5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one can 
also=
 be used.

6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who offer ghee 
=
aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i've also seen 
that =
during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it 
also must b=
e one of the right ways. however i have complete faith in 
what Narasimha h=
as given in Manual and that also must be the other 
right way of many ways.=
 although you can choose between the above 
two, i recommend to go as per t=
he Manual if you are going to do as 
per the manual given by him.

Lastly, =
i would suggest not to bother yourself with much 
technicalities and burden=
 of perfection. in the first few runs, 
there are many things during Havan =
which can go imperefct. do as per 
manual and enjoy you Homam with your mot=
her & others and offcourse 
with the mother of universe !!!

I hope, i gave=
 you the answers - Beautifully.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
