Namaste,

I recently joined this group after having been forwarded some int=
eresting posts by a colleague. As an introductory post, I would like to add=
ress a theme that is most pressing in my current worldview, namely the prob=
lem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with what appears to =
be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory and the Aghori pa=
th throughout most of the world. I don't think this is as simple as recongn=
izing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in constant balance, be=
cause the focus of the argument seems more oriented toward an almost uncons=
cious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddhism is planting o=
r has planted roots. 

For some time I have struggled with the unsettling s=
uspicion that Buddhism is a terrible trap for the mind to stumble upon. Eve=
r since I heard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurti saying that Buddhism introduced=
 the concept of conversion into the world, and perhaps before, I have been =
plagued by this suspicion. It appears that Anatman theory merely creates a =
a playground for various forms of absurdity which manifest themselves as a =
culture's obsession with sex and death, which result in the economy of many=
 parts of the world being driven by war and prostitution. 

Now the Aghori =
path is what is is for most people: a path of self-destruction which is als=
o a form of Goddess worship. But I would maintain that such naive practitio=
ners of this path have used, consciously or unconsciously, the prevalent An=
atman-related theories as excuses to perpetuate the endless cycle of imperi=
alism, heroin-trafficking and prostitution that generally drives world econ=
omy. Because of this fatal misunderstanding of Shaivic energies, along with=
 the corresponding fascination with the lingo of Anatman theory, most of th=
e world has become a wasteland of dispersed energy, prematurely sacrificed =
to Kali without a shred of taste or sophistication. 

It is here that I sup=
pose one could get into some kind of nirvikalpa/savikalpa samadhi debate re=
garding whether the Buddha, by renouncing his family, actually created the =
disintegration of focus which is symbolic of the state of the world, in tha=
t Atman theory, represented by Hinduism is left holding down the homestead =
while Anatman theory actually creates suffering by attempting to remove it =
through meditation. I would submit that the current state of world dharma l=
ocked in some kind of identity crisis over who is supposed to be holding Ka=
li's left leg and who the right. This is the essential problem, Shiva just =
lay there.

Thanks,
Jeff Berger
