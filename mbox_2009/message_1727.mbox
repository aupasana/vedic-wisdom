I think I understood the mistake I was making in my=
 understanding on how karma works. So basically, there is no escape. With w=
ill power I can postpone it, but cannot avoid it. So the idea is to postpon=
e it untill I can achieve a state of ddetachment, however many lifetimes it=
 may take.

Namaste,

First, answer to Rajarshi: If =
A gets an opportunity to pay back a bad thing 
to B but resists the temptat=
ion, then the payback is postponed. A will get a 
similar opportunity later=
 (possibly in another life). At that time, he can 
either do the bad thing =
to B or resist the temptation again and postpone 
further. If A becomes a j=
eevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is liberated while 
living and engaging in=
 actions without any sense of I-ness, then he can pay 
back the bad thing w=
ithout incurring further karmas. If A got moksha and got 
out of the game, =
then A is fine but B still has that karma pending. Nature 
will find a stub=
stitute to pay back this karma to B. That person will get an 
opportunity t=
o do the bad thing to B.

When I say paying back, please note that the acti=
on and reaction are not 
necessarily identical, but they are compatible.

N=
ow, answer to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he accepted what happened and B 
=
has a bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back tha=
t 
bad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an 
o=
pportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.

You do something to=
 someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If they 
identified with th=
e action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You 
will again get a c=
hance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify with 
the action), yo=
u are back in the cycle. And so on.

It is quite complex. But the key to ge=
tting out of the cycle is: accepting 
what happens to you, being good to ot=
hers and overcoming ego and the sense 
of "I am doing".

* * *

Karma is no=
t just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the 
thoughts entert=
ained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think "how 
I wish I had =
such a car". Any action or thought that has some force behind 
it becomes a=
 karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance 
is suffici=
ent in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or 
not you =
want it in that life! You may not know why you got it, but you got 
it beca=
use you asked for it earlier.

Nature is like a bank which keeps track of y=
our wish list and your debt 
list. It automatically withdraws from your kar=
ma account to pay back your 
debts and it automatically withdraws from your=
 karma account to pay for 
things on your wish list.

Best regards,
Narasim=

Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,=


I wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different words.

Please Cons=
ider this -

A Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)
Next =
time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does it 
with=
 sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.
Now if A accepts it calmly and natura=
lly without any sadness and without any 
emotions of hatred towards B -Now =
then i feel that A is out of the 
perticular cycle but what about B. B did =
the cheating revengefully and 
enjoyed it although it was the reaction only=
. SO WHAT ABOUT B? is he out of 
cycle.

What i am thinking in the above ca=
se is that Though B is also out of that 
specific cycle in relation to A bu=
t here he Unconsciously gets the 
Impressions stamped in his Chitta due to =
his/hers egoistic reaction 
(Cheating A) and that Samskaar will some time i=
n future triggered by some 
opportunity will compel or tempt him/her to che=
at or do some wrong things to 
some other person and get entangled in to ne=
w chain.

I feel that Egoistic reactions gets accumulated in to Samskaaras =
(Mental 
conditioning) which then never allows most people to break free fr=
om the 
chain of cause & effect web.

Have i understood correctly?

Warm Re=
gards,

Utpal

><BR>><BR>><BR>> Namaste,<BR>><BR>> If someone is cheatin=
g you or hurting you now, there are two things<BR>> happening simultaneo=
usly:<BR>><BR>> (1) You cheated or hurt that person in a previous lif=
e. Nature has created <BR>> a<BR>> situation where it can be paid bac=
k. In other words, Nature has placed <BR>> that<BR>> person in a posi=
tion to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do
 so.<BR>><BR>> (2) Th=
at person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the<BR>> opp=
ortunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in <BR>&=
gt; the<BR>> action while identifying with the action ("I am doing it"),=
 he now gets a<BR>> new karma. He will be paid back later.<BR>><BR>&g=
t; Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identificati=
on<BR>> and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are =
being paid<BR>> back for what you did before.<BR>><BR>> * * *<BR>&=
gt;<BR>> In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody do=
es <BR>> something<BR>> to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourse=
lf. Don't think "why does it<BR>> have to happen to me". Think only abou=
t your current action ("what is the<BR>> best thing for me to do NOW?") =
and do NOT think about what happened, why <BR>> it<BR>> happened, who=
 did it and how things happening to you
 are unfair.<BR>><BR>> The tr=
icky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back<BR>> some=
body else's bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do <BR>>=
; so.<BR>> You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to s=
omeone! But<BR>> remember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense =
of doership ("I am<BR>> doing") will create a new karma, even if the oth=
er person brought it on<BR>> himself with a previous action.<BR>><BR>=
> If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and <BR>>=
; surrendering<BR>> the action to the Lord completely, you will not incu=
r karma. But that is<BR>> very very difficult - almost impossible for mo=
st. Of course, you can also<BR>> postpone the payback through the use of=
 your *will power*, i.e. avoid the<BR>> temptation and not do the bad th=
ing to the other person. As long as we <BR>> live<BR>> in a body, som=
e karmas will need to be
 incurred. But good discretion,<BR>> self-contr=
ol and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most<BR>> troub=
lesome karmas to a later time.<BR>><BR>> When the reactions to your p=
revious karmas are paid back and through who <BR>> is<BR>> not in YOU=
R control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So <BR>> you=
<BR>> can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to=
 a large<BR>> extent under your control. Use your will power to do the r=
ight things.<BR>><BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> ------=
