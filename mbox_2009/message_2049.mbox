Namaste Narasimha Garu,

One question has come up in my mind. Specifically =
in Spiritual Journey, should one consider ones Guru's word or instructions =
as final?
I am actually asking for the situation were Guru's wish is not th=
e same as one's own feeling. this is the situation which can create uncomfo=
rtable, guilt in tme mind for the disciple.

One more thing! is it required=
 in the intrest of Shishya, that he/she discuss all the mental blockages wi=
th Guru (spiritual doctor).

Yours,

Utpal
