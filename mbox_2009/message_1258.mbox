Namaste

For someone who cannot speak sanskrit or is not even very fluent w=
ith 
any of the Indian lnaguges, can such a person do a homa of the Kunjika=
 
Stotra instead of the actual full Durgasaptasati. Specially since in 
the=
 beginning of the Kunjika, it says Kunjika path is almost 
equivalent to Du=
rgasaptasti.

-Regards
