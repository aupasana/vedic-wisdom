Namaste,
=A0
Two points:
=A0
(1) In some rituals done in tradition (e.g. a =
traditional pumsavana ceremony), pregnant lady sits next to fire.
=A0
(2) V=
arious scriptures mentioned that all dharma karyas, including fire rituals,=
 should be done by a person accompanied by wife (e.g. "ayaGYo vaa eSha apat=
nIkaH" - Taittiriya Braahmana).
=A0
However, it may become necessary to do =
it alone when wife cannot sit with one. Exceptions were specifically mentio=
ned by a smriti text called "Vadhula Smriti" by Vadhala Muni on when one is=
 allowed to sit alone and do it:
=A0
yasya bhaaryaa vidUrasthaa patitaa vaa=
 rajasvalaa.
aniShTaa pratikUlaa vaa tasyaaH pratinidhau kriyaa..
=A0
If wi=
fe is far away or fallen or menstruating or disinterested or non-cooperativ=
e, then one can do it alone. These conditions do not include a pregnant wif=
e, implying that pregnant wife can sit next to one during a homam!
=A0
If a=
 pregnant woman can sit next to husband and do homam with him, a pregnant w=
oman sit alone and do homam too.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Now, a more fundamental question is whether a woman can do =
homam by herself. Manu Smriti specifically says that a man can do yajna and=
 other rituals and a woman can get heaven by serving husband. If a woman is=
 lucky enough to find a very dhaarmik husband, just serving him may be suff=
icient as Manu Smriti says. (In fact, the other side may also be true, i.e.=
 if a woman is doing great sadhana, her husband may get heaven by merely se=
rving her.)
=A0
Unfortunately though, most women today are not lucky enough=
 to have husbands who do good spiritual sadhana and they have to take care =
of their own spiritual upliftment.
=A0
Scirptures seem to assume that a hus=
band and wife together do all rituals includes yajnas. However, times have =
changed. One of the two being interested itself has such a low probability =
that there is no point in talking about both being interested and insisting=
 on both doing it together.
=A0
Upasani Maharaj, an authority on four Vedas=
 and one whom Sai Baba called "God Himself in a human body", showed the way=
 by teaching Vedas and yajnas to women and making them do it alone. Gods an=
d rishis come to earth now and then to modify and re-establish customs that=
 are appropriate for that age.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *
=A0
There is no mention of a pregnant woman above certain number o=
f months in scriptures. My conclusion is that a woman at an advanced stage =
of pregnancy can also do homam, provided she is physically comfortable and =
mentally able to focus on god.
=A0

Narasimha

      Namaste,
=A0 
A pregnant woman can perform =
homam. If sitting cross-legged is a problem, one can sit on a raised platfo=
rm (e.g. a small stool). Homa kundam can also be on a raised platform and e=
nsure that homa kundam is on a platform that is a couple of inches higher t=
han your seat, or atleast the same height but not lower.
=A0
What homam are=
 you doing?
=A0
My guru called me when I was thinking about replying to you=
. His intuition is that some homam for Lord Vishnu is beneficial to you and=
 your child (e.g. homam with Vishnu Sahasranaam or a homam with Vishnu's 8 =
or 12 lettered mantra). I thought I'd mention it.
