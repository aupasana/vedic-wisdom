 3. Right.

y people do not do homam. When related people who you do not know well pass=
 away, it has no effect really. On the other hand, there CAN be a strong ef=

ings change based on desa-kaala-paatra.

in a perfect state. But a homam performed with surrender, for spiritual pro=
gress, can be performed in my humble opinion always, irrespective of the st=
ate of mind. Regarding the former, please note that minds of most people ar=
e not in a "perfect state" these days, even when there was no death in fami=

results.
