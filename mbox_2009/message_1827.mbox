Namaste,

> * How come the number of human beings keeps on increasing? Is it that the 
> animals are doing more and more good to be reborn as humans

An animal can be reborn as a human being (1) if it does some good karma to 
be reborn as a human being, or, (2) if some human beings have done it such 
bad things that it can pay it back only if it is reborn as a human beings. 
As human beings eat more meat and treat animals more cruelly and start 
messing with nature more, many animals may be reborn as human beings for 
reason (2). Such a thing will increase the number of human beings with more 
animalistic instincts.

> * Are the number of souls in the world finite or infinite?

When universe is in Kaalaraatri state, all souls return to Brahman and have 
no separate/individual existence, i.e. there is only Brahman. In other 
words, the number of individual souls is zero. Later, during the world 
cycle, the number of goes on increasing, as more and more parts of Brahman 
are separated with individualized self-awareness.

Many souls we see around us are separated from Brahman in Kali yuga. But 
some souls around us were separated from Brahman in Dwapara yuga or Treta 
yuga and are more evolved.

Best regards,
Narasimha
