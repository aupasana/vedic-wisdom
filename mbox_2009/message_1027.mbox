Dear Utpal Bhai, Hari ji and all,
Namaskar.
If the word "rama" uttered impr=
operly as "mara" by a dacoit=C2=A0make him a great saint can the Taraka man=
tra go in vain???
Even when chanted that way but with steadfast devotion, s=
hraddha can work wonders!!!
IMHO the underlying=C2=A0unrelenting devotion i=
s the secret of the success of mantras,
Kind regards
Nalini
=C2=A0
