THE FREE SOUL (Delivered in New York, 1896)

Philosophy is no joke or talk.=
 It has to be realised; this body will vanish,
this earth and everything wi=
ll vanish, this idea that I am the body or the
mind will for some time vani=
sh, or if the Karma is ended it will disappear,
never to come back; but if =
one part of the Karma remains, then as a potter's
wheel, after the potter h=
as finished the pot, will sometimes go on from the
past momentum, so this b=
ody, when the delusion has vanished altogether, will
go on for some time. A=
gain this world will come, men and women and animals
will come, just as the=
 mirage came the next day, but not with the same
force; along with it will =
come the idea that I know its nature now, and it
will cause no bondage, no =
more pain, nor grief, nor misery. Whenever
anything miserable will come, th=
e mind will be able to say, "I know you as
hallucination." When a man has r=
eached that state, he is called Jivanmukta,
living-free", free even while l=
iving. The aim and end in this life for the
Jn=E2na-Yogi is to become this =
Jivanmukta, "living-free".

He is Jivanmukta who can live in this world wit=
hout being attached.He is
like the lotus leaves in water, which are never w=
etted by the water.

If we have known the =C2tman as It is, if we have know=
n that there is nothing
else but this Atman, that everything else is but a =
dream, with no existence
in reality, then this world with its poverties, it=
s miseries, its
wickedness, and its goodness will cease to disturb us. If t=
hey do not exist,
for whom and for what shall we take trouble? This is what=
 the Jnana-Yogis
teach.Therefore, dare to be free, dare to go as far as you=
r thought leads,
and dare to carry that out in your life. It is very hard t=
o come to Jn=E2na. It
is for the bravest and most daring, who dare to smash=
 all idols, not only
intellectual, but in the senses. This body is not I; i=
t must go. All sorts
of curious things may come out of this.

A man stands =
up and says, "I am not the body, therefore my headache must be
cured"; but =
where is the headache if not in his body? Let a thousand
headaches and a th=
ousand bodies come and go. What is that to me? I have
neither birth nor dea=
th; father or mother I never had; friends and foes I
have none, because the=
y are all I. I am my own friend, and I am my own
enemy. I am Existence-Know=
ledge-Bliss Absolute.I am He, I am He. If in a
thousand bodies I am sufferi=
ng from fever and other ills, in millions of
bodies I am healthy. If in a t=
housand bodies I am starving, in other
thousand bodies I am feasting. If in=
 thousands of bodies I am suffering
misery, in thousands of bodies I am hap=
py. Who shall blame whom, who praise
whom? Whom to seek, whom to avoid? I s=
eek none, nor avoid any, for I am all
the universe. I praise myself, I blam=
e myself, I suffer for myself, I am
happy at my own will, I am free. This i=
s the Jn=E2ni, the brave and daring.
Let the whole universe tumble down; he=
 smiles and says it never existed, it
was all a hallucination. He sees the =
universe tumble down. Where was it!
Where has it gone!

In the vulgar form =
the question becomes, "How did sin come into this world?"
This is the most =
vulgar and sensuous form of the question, and the other is
the most philoso=
phic form, but the answer is the same. The same question has
been asked in =
various grades and fashions, but in its lower forms it finds
no solution, b=
ecause the stories of apples and serpents and women do not
give the explana=
tion. In that state, the question is childish, and so is the
answer. But th=
e question has assumed very high proportions now: "How did
this illusion co=
me?" And the answer is as fine. The answer is that we cannot
expect any ans=
wer to an impossible question. The very question is impossible
in terms. Yo=
u have no right to ask that question. Why? What is perfection?
That which i=
s beyond time, space, and causation =97 that is perfect.

Then you ask how =
the perfect became imperfect. In logical language the
question may be put i=
n this form: "How did that which is beyond causation
become caused?" You co=
ntradict yourself. You first admit it is beyond
causation, and then ask wha=
t causes it. This question can only be asked
within the limits of causation=
. As far as time and space and causation
extend, so far can this question b=
e asked. But beyond that it will be
nonsense to ask it, because the questio=
n is illogical. Within time, space,
and causation it can never be answered,=
 and what answer may lie beyond these
limits can only be known when we have=
 transcended them;therefore the wise
will let this question rest. When a ma=
n is ill, he devotes himself to curing
his disease without insisting that h=
e must first learn how he came to have
it.
