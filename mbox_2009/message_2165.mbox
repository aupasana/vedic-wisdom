Namaste,

The actual Narayana kavacha is from the verse that starts with 
"harirvidadhyaanmama sarva rakShaam" and till the verse that ends with 
"svatejasaa grasta samasta tejaaH".

The verses before it are instructions (nyaasa etc). The verses after it are 
results (phalasruti etc). The exact kavacha is the verses above.

What Robert Koch mentioned are three very good mantras for Narayana, but 
they are NOT Narayana kavacha. They are used in the nyasa (placement) before 
reciting Narayana kavacha. With each of the three mantras, there is a way to 
place each letter of the mantra in a body part and create the environment 
for the kavacha to work optimally. You say the three mantras while focusing 
mind fully on different body parts while saying different letters of the 
mantras.

However, like I said before, the nyasa done by people before mantras is just 
a formality and people do not know how to place a letter in a body part. I 
am not saying it is a secret that needs to be learnt. It is not a matter of 
"technique". It is a matter of mental focus. Placement of letters in several 
body parts is an act of mental focus. These days, people cannot focus their 
mind on anything. Thus, nyasa is just a formality with no real meaning.

Thus, my advice is: Do what you feel like or are taught, before and after 
the above verses, but make sure you read the verses I identified above. That 
is the real kavacha.

Any kavacha works over long time. If you chant it regularly with good mental 
focus, it forms an invisible protective shield around your subtle body. 
Narayana kavacha is a very powerful mantra.

Best regards,
Narasimha
