Dear Narasimha,

   The debate is not over, it is over wit=
h you as I said that I wouldn't reply on this topic anymore on a mail to yo=
u.
   In my opinion and experience, You simply didn't catch up with the ide=
as being conveyed :).

Regards,
nitish

 You did deny it quite vehemently. Kindly check yourolder mails. You make a=
 statement A then in the course of discussion you conveniently change it to=
 B and then jump around assuming ridiculous airs. At least, try and remembe=
r what you yourself speak. Go back and re check you own mails here.
