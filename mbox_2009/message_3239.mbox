Namaste All,

I again give link to my Initial message which wasn't respond=
ed to.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/411
<http://grou=
ps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/411>

I repost some later part of t=
he message below:

But am I wrong in thinking this way? Am I wrong in my ef=
forts to make
them understand my view point? Though I never pressurize or i=
rritate
anybody on the issue.
Some times I feel that if most of the humans =
on earth eat meat, fish
and eggs then is there any fundamental misconceptio=
n about it? can
there be so many people wrong in their food habits. But in =
any case,
for me I=A1=A6ll stick to veg food simply.....
***

I got the Fin=
al conclusive Confirmation to my view point yesterday in
quite an interesti=
ng way. Yesterday evening i went to a mall along with
some family friends. =
Occasion being my marriage anniversary.  One senior
friend, whom i respect =
very much, who is also a vegetarian, suddenly
started arguments with me on =
the same topic. He was arguing from the
Nonveg point of view. In short, he =
was saying by giving examples that
People who meat are also very gentle, po=
lite and good natured.  They are
not Tamasik and such arguments.  I again r=
eiterated my view. I told him
that i do not say that the people who eat mea=
t are *Bad* people. I do
not also claim that Pure veggies are all and alway=
s *Good* people. 
Infact, i have a couple of very good friends who are meat=
 eater and they
are really good human beings.  I only say that the people w=
ho eat meat
are not doing the right Karma because the act results in to col=
d blooded
killing/ butchering / massacre of innocent Creatures. I only say =
that
for eating (actually satisfying cravings of palate), one has no right =
to
harm the other life.

We both kept quite for a while and then i suddenly=
 saw a advertisement
poster of Mont blank pen on which Mahatma Gandhi's pic=
ture was shown
with one of his thought and signature. I had earlier seen th=
is poster
but never felt like going near and reading it. but yesterday i we=
nt near
that to read the thought of Mahatma in his own handwritings and Lo!=
 It
was written:

"The path of Truth is through Ahimsa (Non-Violence)....".=
 I called my
friend near and showed him that. he also starred for a while t=
o that
thought. The discussion ended.  He got the answer probably and I got=
 my
confirmation!

***

I always recite a  prayer at conclusion of my daily=
 Homam (I prefer this
prayer over "Sarve Janaha Sukhino Bhabantu...)which g=
oes like this:

Sarve Bhavantu SukhinaH, Sarve Santu NiraamayaaHa

Sarve Bh=
adraani Pashyantu, MaaKaschidDukhaBhagbhavet !!!

Om Shanti.. Shanti... Sha=
ntiHi


yours,

Utpal

Death is part and parcel of natural law. One cannot avo=
id it however
much one tries. The Abrahamic religions are heavy on non-veg =
food. The
areas where they grew, arid, desert land, you need to have (at le=
ast
during those days) animal flesh to survive specially considreing
irriga=
tion options were so scanty.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 If you live in the
Artic =
region, you need to have fish oil to survive the cold.
The=C3=83=E2=80=9A=
=C3=82 point is, death is a part of life. One does not
survive without deat=
h. That is how the world has been designed by the
grand designer.

bsp;yesterday in quite an interesting way. Yesterday evening i went to a ma=
ll along with some family friends. Occasion being my marriage anniversary.&=
nbsp; One senior friend, whom i respect very much, who is also a =
vegetarian, suddenly started arguments with me on the same topic. He w=
as arguing from the Nonveg point of view. In short, he was saying =
;by giving examples that People who meat are also very gentle, polite and g=
ood natured.  They are not Tamasik and such arguments. <SPAN> </S=
PAN>I again reiterated my view. I told him that i do not say that the =
people who eat meat are *Bad* people. I do not also claim that Pure veggies=
 are all and always *Good* people.  Infact, i have a couple of very go=
od friends who are meat eater and they are really good human beings. <SPAN>=
 </SPAN>I only say that the people who eat meat are not doing the righ=
t Karma because the act results in to cold blooded killing/ butchering / ma=
ssacre of innocent Creatures. I only say that for eating (actually satisfyi=
ng cravings of palate), one has no right to harm the other life.<o></o></SP=

<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">We both ke=

killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be hand=
led easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to d=
eal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amoun=
t of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easi=
ly handled.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some si=
mple daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man wh=
o has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcuss=

 - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eate=

 am a firm believer of Veg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle=
 to spiritual growth. But, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make=
 some spiritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-ve=
g food, he has put a counter argument. He says that if I can find him a sin=
gle shloka on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would give up.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=
 <BR>> > > > > So, if anybody on this group can help me find=
 the quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta as the absolute reference=
 and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about it in Geeta, it is actua=
lly not worth discussing whether or not you take non-veg. If anyone finds i=
t, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can become vegetarian.<BR>> &g=
