>From boyhood I was spiritually inclined. Although coming from a meat-eating=

family, I turned vegetarian while still a boy. I was mainly a worshipper o=
f
Shiva but learned about Christ and Buddha too and revered them. Twice I
v=
isited the great Muslim shrine at Nagore, and I understood that Allah was
o=
nly another name for God. My one ambition in life was to see God face to
fa=
ce. This was granted to me while still a schoolboy in March of 1917 when I
=
first went to Skandashram and set my eyes upon Bhagavan. Reclining on the
c=
ouch, he looked indescribably majestic. Since then he has been God in human=

form for me, my God, Guru and All. I did not ask him for anything. I was
f=
illed to overflowing by just seeing him. He turned on me that look of heart=

melting Grace that he so often bestowed on newcomers. After a few days I h=
ad
to return home. There I learned the "Marital Garland of Letters" and spe=
nt
my time reciting it either mentally or aloud and even writing it out.


=
It was on my second visit to Skandashram that I first made pradakshina. A
v=
isitor from Madurai whom I knew wanted to go round the hill with Bhagavan
a=
nd I joined him. At that time the lower slopes were still forested and we
t=
ook the forest path for a good part of the way before coming out on the
roa=
d. Next day I had a sudden urge to go round by myself. I started out as
bef=
ore but soon lost my way on the forest track. As I started I had noticed
th=
at one of the Ashram dogs was following me. Now it ran in front and began
t=
o lead. At once it flashed on me that this was Bhagavan's work. With tears
=
of gratitude and joy I followed my guide. He took me by the same path as th=
e
previous day until we came to the road and then disappeared; and I saw hi=
m
at the Ashram when I got back. At the time I told nobody about this. It w=
as
my first experience of my spiritual relationship with Bhagavan and I was=

more than ever convinced that he would guide me through the unknown paths =
of
life. Such an incident may appear trivial to the reader, but when it
act=
ually happens it strengthens one's faith in Bhagavan, who alone can help
by=
 his infinite Grace in opening one's inner vision.


For a whole year at Sk=
andashram Bhagavan took only one meager meal a day. I
was on a visit there =
the day he broke this fast. I had decided to stay the
night even though the=
re was no food for an evening meal for the rest of us.
I didn't feel hungry=
. At about 7:30 one of the devotees, Ramanatha
Brahmachari, came back with =
some pieces of broken coconut and some rice that
he had been given at a cer=
emony he attended in town.

Bhagavan suggested that we should boil it up on=
 the charcoal stove we had
there and share it, as was the usual custom. He =
told us to see whether there
was any sugar or sugar candy left from gifts b=
y earlier visitors to flavor
it with. We looked but there was nothing at al=
l. It was dark and raining
outside and we could not go into town for anythi=
ng. I was near to tears that
Bhagavan should ask for something =E2=80=94 so=
 rare an event =E2=80=94 and we should not be
able to provide it. At that v=
ery moment the door opened and two students
came in with a bag of sugar can=
dy and a bunch of bananas that they had
brought to present to Bhagavan. The=
 meal was cooked and eaten, the two
visitors also being invited.

Bhagavan =
remarked that we had asked for sugar candy and got bananas also,
which coul=
d be cut up and served like a pickle with the food. After eating
he said th=
at it was just a year, 365 days exactly, since he had limited
himself to on=
e meal a day and that from now on he would eat in the evening
also. That wa=
s how things happened with Bhagavan. He did not work miracles,
things just =
happened right.

Miracles are generally thought of as deliberate acts wille=
d by a person, but
happenings like this are the result of spiritual forces =
naturally and always
at work. The Jnani is God Himself in human form. He ne=
ver wills anything but
things happen in his presence and the ignorant attri=
bute them to him. His
state is pure awareness. It is a matter of experience=
. One may get a glimpse
of it in his presence.
