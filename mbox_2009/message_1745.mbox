Namaste Friends,

I am trying to purchase the havan kund from the following=
 online store, but they dont sell 'stand' for keeping the havan kund. 

I l=
ive in a rented apartment which has carpet floor.

One suggestion was to pu=
rchase a concrete slab from Home depot and place the havan kund. 

The onli=
ne shop people also advised me that they would try to get havan kund with s=
tand, as a special case but it can take few months.   

I am eager to find =
out how our US friends are performing homa in their residences?

Another po=
int is that, these people do not sell wooden spoons and they are offering c=
opper spoons for ahuti. Is it adviseable to use copper spoons? I look forwa=
rd for your advice.

Thank you,
Shankar 
Detroit, MI, USA
