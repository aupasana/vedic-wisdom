Utpal Bhai and others

Namaskar

I have often had the same feeling when I v=
isit temples and fail to find any 'stirrings of heart/mind'. Some places wh=
ere I have often found less people and were less 'prasiddha' I have found t=
hat serenity and joy. Some exceptions for me=C2=A0were the temple for Rahu =
among the famous Navagraha temples around Kumbakonam and the Lakshmi Narasi=
mha Temple in Namakkal near the Namakkal Anjaneyar. The Mahalakshmi here is=
 called the Namagiri Lakshmi and the deity, Lakshmi Narasimhar is so vibran=
t that I could feel strong vibrations and energy fields whenever I visited =
the temple ( almost once in a year while I was in India) The palms of Swami=
 are also red tinged from the blood of Hiranyakasipu as per sthala purana.
=
The Rahu temple I always can smell strong flower especially Mogali (or tazh=
ampoo as it is called in=C2=A0Tamil)=C2=A0=C2=A0scents when I visited=C2=A0=
 the temple at night. The Girikuchambal sannidhi=C2=A0 depicts 'sachaamara =
ramaavanee sevitha' form of Mother. There is also a sannidhi of=C2=A0Piriya=
ni nayaki where=C2=A0I recollect that on Ashtami day the rays of chandra fa=
ll exactly into her sannidhi, I think at her feet. I have forgotten the det=
ails. The whole temple for me has very strong vibrations and I could feel t=
hem and though sometimes I have been late to other Navagraha temples around=
 the Kumbakonam, I have always reached here just as there is either the aft=
ernoon or the night puja before closing. I do not know but I have a strange=
 affinity to this temple, Namakkal Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple and Mantr=
alayam. 
I also do not know why any aspect of Her is to be feared??? Even a=
t her most fierce she is the most benevolent Mother who would never harm He=
r child. I have always felt even the 'destructive' aspect full of love and =
can never imagine My Mother harm or frighten me. But there have been instan=
ces when people have experienced 'negative energies' in homes and places of=
 worship. We have in our teens lived in a house (our own) which had many pi=
ctures of Gods and Goddesses, infact a separate room for puja and my mother=
 has always been a very spiritual person. I have experienced negative vibra=
tions in that house for years and it was with great difficulty that we sold=
 that house . I still cannot fathom how in a house where there is regular p=
ooja, homams and prayers that negative energy could still exist. It is stil=
l not very clear to me after decades. Apologies as I have digressed a littl=
e..

Kind regards
Nalini

Whatever you say is absolutely correct and =
have experienced the same .As i live in kolkata i am very much acquainted w=

I think u can feel the spirituality=
 in a way that i have found very effective.The method is after your perform=
ance of all regular rituals and offerings are completed just unblinkingly g=
aze the face of the idol then slowly focus at the eyes i am sure you can fe=
el something.You can do your gazing even from far off but give time i mean =
it can happen in 1 min or it can take 5 or maybe 10 mins.I am definite u wi=

 face(i mean all smiles are not happy smiles).U will come to know whether t=

(HE or SHE is satisfied or not).
The same technique applies to the deities =

hey have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I recently visited few (no=

<P>Namaste,<BR><BR>Holy places - i a=
m thinking about how to decide if a certain place has good spiritual vibrat=
ions or not? Whenever i see writings from Narasimha or from others which ta=
lks about spiritual vibrations, i wonder! If it's a feel good factor within=
 or without?<BR><BR>If we go to the famous temples of India today, it is al=
most sure that one will find lot of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, bus=
iness, cheating, discrimination etc... etc...<BR>can that be criteria for j=
udging the spiritual energy of the place?<BR><BR>my two distinct experience=
s (external):<BR>1) i went to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when i entere=
d to take Darshan of all the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the dogmatic =
behavior of the Pandas standing there near the Idols. they almost commanded=
 me to put some money in front of the Idol. one can imagine my condition. I=
nstead of focusing on the lord, i was angry at them and refused to oblige.<=
BR><BR>2) Once we (group of
 friends) went to 'Mota Ambaji' (in Gujarat nea=
r Mount Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entranc=
e of the famous temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made a=
 mistake by not asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he as=
ked us to pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. we=
 have to bargain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja sa=
amgri whenever i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temp=
le of Mumbai, i'll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalaksh mi-MahaSaras=
wati and that is all.<BR><BR>However I must say that the above two bad expe=
riences did not discourage me.<BR><BR>Such things as well as few other thin=
gs like General atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=E2=80=A6 are e=
xternal things IMHO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many =
pure hearted visitors.<BR><BR>Warm regards,<BR><BR>Utpal</P>

ote:<BR>><BR>> Namaste Narsimhaji,<BR>> <BR>> Thanks for sharin=
g your thoughts. They have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I recent=
ly visited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2 from your list) p=
laces with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I could see lot o=
f commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there including those i=
n position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could feel=
 spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main building and cro=
ws) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would not have=
 been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and ener=
gised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then
 why did "=
locals" who have always been here, are getting corrupted. But, then probabl=
y the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have overpowered or as=
 you say visitors have made the incense disappear over the period of time.<=
BR>> <BR>> I have one experience to share, which is somewhat on simil=
ar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certain "Amavasya". After =
taking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fort=
unately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a cer=
tain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to fee=
d them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per =
their "Custom". Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who a=
lready had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or=
 food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed=
 the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad
 about it.<BR>> =
<BR>> In general, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly foun=
d it spiritual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always h=
appen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that to ke=
ep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these pla=
ces. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.<BR>> <BR>> Best Regard=

Krishna temple <BR>
<DIV class=3Dim>> in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is =

<DIV class=3Dim>=
<BR>> There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was <BR>> taken=

ard of that <BR></DIV>> temple before and it seemed like a small temple.=
 The name of the=C3=82 form of <BR>> the divine Mother=C3=82 p=
resent there was a Tamil language name and I did not <BR>
<DIV class=3Dim>&=
gt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed =
my eyes <BR>> and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol=
, I was dazzled by a <BR>> vision of a very fierce goddess whose face wa=
s emiting rays like Sun. I felt <BR>> that there was a powerful presence=
 there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the <BR>> name of the place or =
the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the <BR>> goddess. The=
y tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof <BR>> c=
ame down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the god=
dess <BR>> likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and le=

<DIV class=3Dim><BR>> Like this, I am sure there =
are many temples with a <BR>> powerful divine presence across India.<BR>=
</DIV>> =C3=82  
<DIV class=3Dim><BR>> Apart from the Kaali temp=
