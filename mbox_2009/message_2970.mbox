 "After attaining God one forgets His external splendour; the glories of His
creation. One doesn't think of God's glories after one has seen Him. The
devotee,once immersed in God's Bliss, doesn't calculate any more about outer
things.When I see Narendra, I don't need to ask him: 'What's your name?
Where do you live?'Where is the time for such questions?

Once a man asked Hanuman which day of the fortnight it was. 'Brother,' said
Hanuman, 'I don't know anything of the day of the week, or the fortnight, or
the position of the stars. I think of Rama alone.' "
