For those who have more time to perform Homam and would like to perform a 1=
6 upchaara puja to Ganapati idol prior to the Homam where again you can per=
form a 16 upchaara puja to Ganapati in the fire, I found a link on the inte=
rnet which gives very basic instructions to do such a puja. I tried this pr=
ior to the Homam and got good results.   

I am not an expert in rituals so=
 if any learned members feel that this document is incorrect then please le=
t me know
