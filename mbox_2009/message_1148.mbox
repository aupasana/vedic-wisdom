Namaste Narasimhaji,



I=
 recently started doing tarpana using your manual.I have couple of queries
=



1. In tarpana why is specific importance given to Sesame?



2. As I kno=
w it one cannot do puja for some days when somebody in the family has expir=
ed. Similarly can one do Japa during that period? 



3. I collect water us=
ed during tarpana in a vessel. Now can that water be taken inside the house=
. The reason I am asking this is because I throw that water on plants and f=
or that I have to go through rooms in the house as the plants are kept else=
where.



4.Restrictions are mentioned in the documents for certain days, w=
hat happens if we could not follow that by mistake?



5. In one Gita press=
 book it is mentioned that those desiring servants, children and female sho=
uld not do tarpan. I see that you did not mention this.

Is this really app=
licable ?



Thank you for the manuals !!



Thank you,

Manish
