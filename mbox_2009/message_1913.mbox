HINDU RITUALS AND ROUTINES - 
WHY DO WE FOLLOW THOSE? 
=A0 
Parijat=

=A0 
Nyctanthes arbor-tristis (sometimes incorrectly cited as =
Nyctanthes arbortristis or Nyctanthes arbor tristis) is commonly known as 
=
	* Night-flowering Jasmine 
	* Coral Jasmine 
	* Parijat (also spelled Paar=
ijat or Paarijaata [4]) 
	* Harsingar [4] 
	* Shephali 
	* Maramalli or Pav=
azha malli in Tamil (Also spelled pavaza malli or pavala malli) 
The tree i=
s sometimes called the "tree of sorrow", because the flowers lose their bri=
ghtness during daytime; the scientific name arbor-tristis also means "sad t=
ree". The flowers can be used as a source of yellow dye for clothing. The f=
lower is the official flower of the state of West Bengal, India , and for K=
anchanaburi Province, Thailand . 
Mythology
Parijat appears in several Hind=
u myths. In one myth, which appears in Srimad Bhagavatam, the Mahabharata a=
nd the Vishnu Purana, Parijat appeared as the result of the Samudra manthan=
 (Churning of the Milky Ocean). In another myth,
=A0
=A0
Once a royal princ=
ess fell in love with the sun god-Surya Dev. She was enamored of his brilli=
ance and beauty as he daily passed through the sky from east to west in his=
 fiery chariot. Her devotion attracted his attention and for a while he fav=
ored her with his attention but after awhile he was distracted with other i=
nterests and she was deserted. In despair she killed herself and from her c=
remated ashes the parijatak tree arose. Since she was rejected by Surya Dev=
, the flowers of the tree only bloom at night. Then before the sun rises th=
e flowers fall so its rays will not strike her. Based on this story the tre=
e was given the species name =EBarbortristis=ED which means =EBtree of sorr=
ow=ED 
=A0 
Another story surrounding the trees=ED origin is found in sever=
al ancient Indian scriptures called the Puranas. It is said that when the c=
elestial beings, at the behest of Hari-the Preserver of the Universe, churn=
ed the cosmic ocean to obtain certain boons that would help alleviate suffe=
ring and protect the powers of good from the powers of evil one of the pari=
jatak tree appeared as one of the divine treasures. Its perfume was said to=
 permeate the entire universe. Because the tree holds such a elevated place=
 in India=EDs sacred lore, the tree is revered by devote Hindus. The story,=
 on one level, clearly illustrates that trees, flowers and fragrance repres=
ent some of the finest boons for humankind. 
=A0 
After the parijatak tree =
emerged from the ocean of existence it taken to the heaven worlds and plant=
ed in the pleasure garden of Indra- the lord of the gods. One day a great s=
age of ancient times named Narad Muni visited this garden in his meditation=
s visited this garden and saw this lovely tree emitting its divine perfume.=
 Using his yogic powers he gathered up some of these ethereal blossoms and =
brought them back to the physical plane and gave them to Rukmini, the favor=
ite wife of the renowned avatar of Vishnu, Lord Krishna, who was at that ti=
me dwelling in Dwaraka in north India . The flowers were so lovely and the =
fragrance so delicate that Satyabhama another wife of Lord Krishna became d=
esirous of possessing that celestial tree and having it planted in her own =
garden. She was jealous of the attention Krishna was showing to Rukmini and=
 wanted him to give more time to her. She implored him to obtain the tree f=
or her. To satisfy her desire he entered
 into a state of deep meditation a=
nd in that state plucked up the tree from the garden. Before leaving that p=
lace he was accosted by the keepers of the garden and was told he would inc=
ur the wrath of Indra as the tree belonged to his wife Sachi.. But Satyabha=
ma would not be put off by any obstacle and said that the tree was the comm=
on property of all and had as much place on earth as it had in the heavens.=
 As a result Krishna waged a great war with Indra and his celestial army. I=
n the end Krishna=EDs strength prevailed and Indra was forced to retreat. A=
t that time Satyabhama taunted him as being a coward but decided to give ba=
ck his celestial tree. Krishna also consented to return the tree to its cel=
estial abode. But Indra said that there was no shame in being defeated by t=
he avatar of Vishnu and that the tree should be taken to earth and planted =
in Dwarka where its fragrance could be enjoined by all the people of the ea=
rth. Thus the first parijatak tree
 was planted and its divine fragrance wa=
s said to spread for three furlongs. Its aroma was charged with so much pow=
er that it would help people enhaling it to remember events of their past l=
ives. In this instance also we can see that the sages were explaining to th=
e people that fragrance was a valuable means of accessing stored memories. =
In the East memory has a much more comprehensive meaning than in the West a=
s it can include past lives as it is believed that the soul takes countless=
 births on its journey to perfection but the same basic principal is explai=
ned in this story as is encountered in western literature regarding how fra=
grance stimulates memories of past events in ones life.

The fresh leaves of the plant prepared in the form of juice, infusions o=
r decoctions and in combination with other herbs are found to be useful in =
treating inflamations, sciatica, pruritis(itching) fever, bronchitis, asthm=
a, cough, dyspepsia(difficult y with digestion associated with pain, flautu=
lence, heartburn and nausea), constipation as the active principals contain=
ed within them are found to have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, digesti=
ve, expectorant, sudorific, diurectic and laxative properites. The leaves w=
ere also considered antidotal for reptile venom.Various preparations of the=
 fresh flowers were found useful in treating diseases like colic, dyspepsia=
, flatulence, greyness of hair and balness as they wer astringent, stomachi=
c, and carminative in nature. The bark when chewed with betelnut and leaf w=
as eaten to promote expectoration of thick phlem. The seeds when powdered a=
nd prepared as a paste are used to cure scurvy and affections of the
 scalp=
