Dear Narasimhaji



I was reading the tarpan manual. I am plannaing to star=
t doing 
tarpan, actually initially I did not have a place to do it. I live=
 
in a one room house with no balcony or courtyard. Now I found an 
outside=
 place where I can do it.

1) Why is this place restriction given for tarpa=
na?

2) In the Rishi tarpana, is it always necessary to do tarpan for the 
=
nine Rishis whos name is mentioned? Or can I do it for the Rishi of 
my Got=
ra and do it more number of times at one sitting?

3) I am planning to do o=
nly the Rishi and Dev tarpana, is that ok? 
Also after saying the mantras, =
and it is finished what to do with 
the water pot and durvas?

4) Seamease =
seeds should be used only for pitri tarpan or also for 
RIshi and Deva tarp=
an?

5) In the deva tarpan can I take the name of my Devata for tarpan?

-R=
egards
