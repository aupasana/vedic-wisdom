If I may ask you humbly, are you writing all of this

what has been w=

many of us have been inspired by=
 the personal spiritual accounts 
of a few. If you could share yours, it wo=

inspiring to us.

Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact wi=

 various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and te=

 Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the S=

 the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not relate=

on of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two=
 of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not "contro=

e mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) =
is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal =
body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bod=
ies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind)=

pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not rea=
