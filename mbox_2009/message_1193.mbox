Namaste Mitesh
=C2=A0
The Mandukya Upanish mentiones of the seven tongues =
of Agni. I just did a google search. Also I had asked Narasimhaji for his v=
iews on the same, the mystical significnace. The explanations=C2=A0 that he=
=C2=A0gave, I feel were wonderful and can come either through direct sadhan=
a or when you are told by someone who has realized it through sadhana. I do=
n't think these explanations are there in such details in our scriptures. I=
 was not really looking for scriptural references. I understand and appreci=
ate your views, but I feel it is unfair to blame Narasimhaji in this regard=
. A sadhak does not necessarily=C2=A0have to be scholar at all.

Dear Narasimha

Namaste

Yes=
 I am little disappointed, I did not expect this from you. I feel 
that whe=
n we put things out on internet, they should be backed up 
with appropriate=
 reference and should try to stick to our scriptures, 
as there is lot of d=
epth. We can interpret them as per our abilities 
and state that too.

For =
one when information posted on internet, we donot know when, how 
and who w=
ill use the information. This leads to a lot of 
bastardization and eventua=
lly lead to wrong practices for the wrong 
reason. We practice many even to=
day without understanding or if we 
need.

Why coin new fancy names and def=
initions as there may already be 
appropriate names and definitions in our =
scripture.

You always question Pt Sanjay Rath and ask for source parampara=
 or 
himself or other, I appreciate that.

I hope you take this in a positi=
ve way. There a lot of good things 
that you have done and are trying to do=
, please keep it up and as 
time goes on, you need to be more vigilant and =
careful.

I recommend take some time to get your references straight and th=
en 
share as that would also improve the quality greatly. If you donot 
hav=
e time, give pointers to others to research and come up. 
Collabrating is a=
lways good.

Why do you want to share something and tell please accept it w=
ith a 
pinch of salt, types of agni, we definately should have definition i=
n 
black and white.

Best Regards
Mitesh
