Dear Utpal,
 
Kundalini reaching sahasraara and remaining there for a limit=
ed time is not moksha. Kundalini remaining in sahasraara forever is moksha.=

 
The four internal instruments (antahkaranas) are manas, buddhi, ahamkaar=
a and chitta.
 
Manas (sensory-motor mind) lies in manomaya kosha (the ment=
al sheath) and buddhi (intellectual/discriminating mind) lies in the vijnaa=
namaya kosha (the knowledge sheath). These two sheaths, along with the praa=
namaya kosha (the vitality sheath) form the so-called sookshma sareera (sub=
tle body). Now, apart from the gross physical body and subtle body, there i=
s a causal body (kaarana sareera). This contains the fifth sheath called aa=
nandamaya kosha (the bliss sheath).
 
The antahkaranas that lie in this lay=
er are chitta and ahamkaara. Chitta (conditioned/remembering mind) stores a=
ll previous observations of manas and judgments of buddhi and retrieves the=
m when needed. What is stored to/retrieved from chitta is based on I-ness o=
r ahamkaara.
 
Please note that ahamkaara and chitta influence each other. =
While one's I-ness influences which experiences are added to the layer of c=
onditioning in chitta, also the mental conditioning represented by chitta i=
nfluences what entity one can identify with. If there is too much heavy con=
ditioning, one's ahamkaara cannot rise above the five elements and one cann=
ot identify with a deity for example.
 
Normally ahamkaara or I-ness binds =
itself to an entity that has several dense properties. If chitta becomes li=
ghter and one can make ahamkaara bind to something with lighter and lighter=
 properties and if one finally succeeds in making ahamkaara not bind itself=
 to anything, i.e. one has no I-ness, then one is established in Brahman wi=
thout a sense of "this is I", "this is something else" etc. This is nirvika=
lpa samadhi. However, at that stage, the other properties of the previously=
 individualized consciousness still remain, e.g. 5 jnaanendriyas, 5 karmend=
riyas, 5 praanas, manas, buddhi and chitta. However, ahamkaara is not ident=
ifying with *anything*, not even with a manifested deity or some energy, an=
d hence one is established in Brahman.
 
Some conditioning may still be lef=
t in chitta when one's Kundalini reaches sahasraara. It may have been subtl=
e enough to let ahamkaara become silent and not identify with any entity fo=
r a while. But it may not be empty yet and suddenly it may spring into acti=
on and not let ahamkaara remain silent anymore. So some thought may be retr=
ived from the conditioned mind and that may provoke the silenced ahamkaara =
into returning to action. One may come out of samadhi and regain individual=
ization.
 
DRAM (dynamic random access memory) used in computers needs to b=
e refreshed now and then. Otherwise, data in it is erased. If the CPU is ac=
cessing DRAM now and then and refreshing it, the data stays there. If CPU d=
oes not access the data for too long, then the data is erased. Similarly, i=
f one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi long enough, all the conditioning in chit=
ta is erased. Then one becomes free. If one stayed in nirvikalpa samadhi fo=
r a little time, it makes chitta lighter but not empty.
 
To give a simple =
analogy, imagine ahamkaara to be the CPU of a computer. Imagine chitta to b=
e the DRAM (memory). Imagine buddhi to be the ALU (arithmetic and logical u=
nit) of the CPU. Imagine manas to be the I/O (input/output) interface unit.=
 Though imperfect, this analogy will help you understand the basics well.
 =

Best regards,
Narasimha

tanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The f=

 ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, ear=

IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body=

ity? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathem=
atics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as rea=

ey? They do help make the mind more receptive toward the benefits of sadhan=

 curious as to why there is an order and not a parallelism, for e.g. why ar=

at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correl=
