Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 For several week/months before I did the=
 AOL=A0 course, I had a friend who was a healer/medium. Once she went back =
to her country Austria and said some simple prayers in her church for me. I=
 did not know about it and also had not asked her. 

One night Jesus Christ=
 appeared to me in dream. He was very tall and there were others=A0 with hi=
m as well. He asked me to follow him. I completely refused him and said, th=
at I am following the Path Of Love.He smiled and left.

In the morning I wa=
s very puzzled why I had this dream. Then the post card from from my friend=
 solved this mystery for me.

Then the 4 day AOL course started. In the gro=
up was man wearing the priest collar. I do not know which was his church. O=
n coming back home on the train, in my innocence I told him the above story=
. He did not say a word but did not come for the rest of course.So did not =
learn Kriya. 

The facilitator was a Indian man who was quite aggressive. A=
s he was a lawyer, he thought he knows best and his language and manners we=
re full of anger. The rest of group were middle age white people. The energ=
y in the room was so tense without any outward reason. Also they would not =
give or sell that tape which was played during kriya so you could practise =
at home.They gave no reason for their refusal.
All these things stopped my =
contact with them.

I hope you will become a kind and caring sort of facili=
tator who respects other human beings.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Dear Jitender,

I am a me=
mber of the Art of Living Foundation for about 4 years now. I have done alm=
ost all the courses (few many times over) and listened to the spiritual dis=
courses tapes by Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar.
I'm currently working on becom=
ing a teacher/facilitator.

You can consider such spiritual organization(s)=
 or groups as a Hand Rail while climbing the staircase. 
If its dark around=
 you and you have no clue about how many steps there are etc., - You can do=
 it without holding on to anything, bump into something, etc., - or you can=
 reach to hold the hand rail and go where it takes you.
At some point you'l=
l also have to let go the hand rail and continue your path as well.

Art of=
 Living gives you a set of tools and techniques to help be yourself - open =
yourself to the world around you. Have a company of good people, good sattw=
ic practices, rich wisdom and knowledge, good tips to a healthy body,mind a=
nd productive life.

Many people do get caught up in the course fees and do=
ubts about where the money is being used/funneled etc.,
Art of Living does =
not have any deep pocketed donors who can fund the immense amount of humani=
tarian projects. Every dollar comes from contributions from members who hav=
e taken the courses.

Yes, all these courses can be free or inexpensive - b=
ut how do we view schools or colleges that are inexpensive. We become bette=
r learners, when we actually invest in the courses, take ownership and be r=
esponsible. You can pay for it or in olden days, the students would do some=
 work at the ashram to "pay" for the knowledge.

I'll leave you with a fina=
l thought.

Meditate now or Medicate later.

Shrikanth
