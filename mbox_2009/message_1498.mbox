Dear Raju,

Few Ramblings a=
s they say!

Co-relation of Demons described in Durga Saptashati (Chandi Pa=
ath)

Shumbha -> Ahamkaar (I ness - Ego)
Nishumbha -> Aasakti (Attachment -=
 Which hangs on Ego)

Both are brothers who are inseparable. both are fond =
of each other so much that they can not live without each other. I ness and=
 Attachment are the same.

When Chandika attacks Shumbha he becomes unconsc=
ious. at that time Nishumbha attacks her. It indicates that the final war f=
or realisation is with our Ahamkaar & Aasakti (I ness & Attachment -me, my,=
 mine). it may seem that Ahamkaar is dead but it can be a deception. it may=
 have been hiding (like Shumbha became unconsious for some time). Aasakti (=
Nishumbha) is ready to attack even if I ness is temporarily sleeping.

When=
 mother completely destroys Nishumbha (Aasakti), Shumbha is furious and eve=
n challenges the mother with the abuses such as Dushte, Anyasa Balamaashrit=
a. he is furious because he lost his brother which is like a soul mate. Ins=
eparable. once aasakti is finished, Ahamkaar becomes weaker and then mother=
 finally mounts concluding attack on the demon Shumbha to finally liberate =
the soul. 

***
Raktabeeja -> Vaasanaas (Desires, mental conditioning)

Rak=
tabeeja is veru dangerous and powerful. He has a capacity to multiply and m=
ultiply and feel the entire universe. Our desires are also like that. they =
multiply in no time. they are never finshes even if we satisfy them. they k=
eep increasing and multiplying.

The most powerful demon after Shumbha & Ni=
shumbha is Raktabeeja. it is so powerful that all the various forms of moth=
ers (such as Indriyaani, Naarasimhi, Vaaraahi, Maaheshwari, Brahmaani) atta=
ck him simultaneously but still he is not finished. The multiplication abil=
ity of his, ceates danger for the whole world and Devas becomes worried (li=
ke Good virutes feel scared of danger from endless desires, like saintly pe=
ople are always at danger from onslaught of materialistic and wicked people=
).

seeing that Devas are really worried, Chandika and Chaamunda both attac=
k him and destroy him. Chaamunda (Kali) actually sucks the blood of the dem=
on and destroys all the multiplied demons instantly to the point that Rakta=
beeja becomes bloodless and then detroyed completely. Hence Kaali has capac=
ity to destroy all the vaasanaas and the beeja of vaasanaas.

***
Chanda an=
d Munda are like Greed & Appeasement. they both fan the Ego (Shumbha). they=
 lure him to go for possesing everything in the world.
They successfully tr=
igger Ahamkaar and propell us to go for the wrong things/desires/ possessio=
n.
***
DhumraLochan -> Krodha (Anger/fury which is unmindful but very weak)=


Dhumralochan (Krodha) is aggressive but has feet of clay, that is why Dur=
ga destroys Dhumralochan with just as 'Hunkaar' (just by a word 'Hum') and =
the chapter no.6 is over in few verses.
****

confused! not your fault. i c=
ouldn't explain it properly :)

Warm Regards,

Utpal
