Namaste,

Could someone tell me the title of the mp3 (for the CD from Giri =
Trading)? 
I got one from Raj Audio, but this version has some differences =
from the Gita Press book. I'd like to order the mp3 from Giri Trading websi=
te, but need the title for the same.

Warm Regards
Anup

I would also like to add that I was able to reduce the time by practicing i=
t regularly and very importantly, listening to an audio by S. Prakash Kaush=
ik's Durga Saptashati. It was a big help, his chantings were awesome, has a=
 great voice, does it slowly, so that beginners like myself can pause and r=
epeat it. I tried listening to Narasimha's mp3, but found it a bit fast for=
 my liking.
