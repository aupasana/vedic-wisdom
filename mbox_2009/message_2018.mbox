Dear Jitendra,

Narasimha has already given the answer in second para of hi=
s email. I am reproducing the same slightly below.

In general, every email=
 group has a home page. For example, this egroup has the home page at http:=
//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/

When you ready the decription of th=
e group, you will generally understand the basic purpose of the group. Requ=
est you to take out time and read the group description and validate your i=
ntended mail against the purpose of the group.

I wish you had time to read=
 through Narasimha's email in full. Afterall, his email is much shorter tha=
n the one I am typing now!

Here is the part you may have overlooked:
This =
list is devoted to discussions on spirituality and spiritual sadhana for se=
lf realization. People's material problems are quite important to them, but=
 this list is NOT the forum to address them. Please stick to the charter of=
 this list.

Best regards,
Vijay
