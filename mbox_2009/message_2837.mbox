Namaste Krish Bhai,

>I dont know whether i can make u understand what i wa=
nt to mean but >i have tried myself hard to express myself in words.   

No=
 need to worry about expressions. i mention Narasimha's inspiring words for=
 the benefit of all.

[Don't worry about mundane things like respect, disre=
spect, silliness, smartness, eloquence, disorganized writings etc. We are n=
ot here to impress anyone, including our gurus or sishyas. We are here to d=
o sadhana, become pure, realize our mission, finish the mission and then gi=
ve up the body.]

the above words says it all. I understood completely what=
 you said in your message. That also may be one way to get the feel if one =
has developed the faith that Idol is not mere lifeless structure but a real=
 god.

a personalnote:

you stay in Kolkata and i wish to visit that place =
again, atleast one more time. i stayed in Rorkela for 2 years during 95 & 9=
6. i visited Kolkata a couple of times during those 2 years but at that tim=
e i had no idea of dakshineshwar. i sometime regret that i wasn't aware of =
Thakur's abode or else i would have had visited that place so many times. n=
ow there lies a wish to visit an only holy place and that is Dakshineshwar.=
 i wish to see and feel the entire area where Tahkur and his disciples play=
ed a divine drama.


best Regards,

Utpal
