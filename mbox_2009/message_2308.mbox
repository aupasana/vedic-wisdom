(Delivered on March 25, 1900, in the San Francisco Bay Area)

Mohammed [as]=
 a young man ... did not [seem to] care much for religion. He
was inclined =
to make money. He was considered a nice young man and very
handsome. There =
was a rich widow. She fell in love with this young man, and
they married. W=
hen Mohammed had become emperor over the larger part of the
world, the Roma=
n and Persian empires were all under his feet, and he had a
number of wives=
. When one day he was asked which wife he liked best, he
pointed to his fir=
st wife: "Because she believed [in] me first." Women have
faith.... Gain in=
dependence, gain everything, but do not lose that
characteristic of women! =
...

Mohammed's heart was sick at the sin, idolatry and mock worship,
super=
stitions and human sacrifices, and so on. The Jews were degraded by the
Chr=
istians. On the other hand, the Christians were worse degraded than his
own=
 countrymen.

We are always in a hurry. [But] if any great work is to be do=
ne, there must
be great preparation. ... After much praying, day and night,=
 Mohammed began
to have dreams and visions. Gabriel appeared to him in a dr=
eam and told him
that he was the messenger of truth. He told him that the m=
essage of Jesus,
of Moses, and all the prophets would be lost and asked him=
 to go and preach.
Seeing the Christians preaching politics in the name of =
Jesus, seeing the
Persians preaching dualism, Mohammed said: "Our God is on=
e God. He is the
Lord of all that exists. There is no comparison between Hi=
m and any other."

God is God. There is no philosophy, no complicated code =
of ethics. "Our God
is one without a second, and Mohammed is the Prophet." =
... Mohammed began to
preach it in the streets of Mecca. ... They began to =
persecute him, and he
fled into the city of [Medina]. He began to fight, an=
d the whole race became
united. [Mohammedanism] deluged the world in the na=
me of the Lord. The
tremendous conquering power! ...

You ... people have v=
ery hard ideas and are so superstitious and prejudiced!
These messengers mu=
st have come from God, else how could they have been so
great? You look at =
every defect. Each one of us has his defects. Who hasn't?
I can point out m=
any defects in the Jews. The wicked are always looking for
defects. ... Fli=
es come and seek for the [ulcer], and bees come only for the
honey in the f=
lower. Do not follow the way of the fly but that of the
bee....

Mohammed m=
arried quite a number of wives afterwards. Great men may marry two
hundred =
wives each. "Giants" like you, I would not allow to marry one wife.
The cha=
racters of the great souls are mysterious, their methods past our
finding o=
ut. We must not judge them. Christ may judge Mohammed. Who are you
and I? L=
ittle babies. What do we understand of these great souls? ...

[Mohammedani=
sm] came as a message for the masses. ... The first message was
equality. .=
.. There is one religion =97 love. No more question of race,
colour, [or] a=
nything else. Join it! That practical quality carried the day.
... The grea=
t message was perfectly simple. Believe in one God, the creator
of heaven a=
nd earth. All was created out of nothing by Him. Ask no
questions. ...

The=
ir temples are like Protestant churches. ... no music, no paintings, no
pic=
tures. A pulpit in the corner; on that lies the Koran. The people all
stand=
 in line. No priest, no person, no bishop. ... The man who prays must
stand=
 at the side of the audience. Some parts are beautiful. ...
