NAMASKAR

Dear Narasimha Ji,

This topic answered many previous doubts of m=
ine, so attachments (body or mind) are only create those sufferings in our =
mind...Asking the followup question...whether responsibility is also a atta=
chment? If so, how could we live socially along with spiritual sadhanas?

b=
est regards,
Biswajit
