Namaste,

1)What should be done with the pieces of coconuts that remain aft=
er the homam.Shall i flow them in the water or use them again in the next h=
omam??

2)And sometimes the pieces are neither too hard nor too soft.If i a=
pply a little effort they get crushed easliy.So, How to deal with them plea=
se clarify.

Regards
Jitender
