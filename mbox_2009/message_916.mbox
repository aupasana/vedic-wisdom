Dear Sir,
My one mail is still unanswered. C=
an I give Ahutis for=C2=A0 Ratri Suktam, Devi Suktam, 4th Chapter and 11th =
Chapter independantly? I mean any of these four independantly ?
While Chand=
i Homam you have omitted Devi Suktam and Ratri Suktam from Ahutis in your M=
anual. This reading has created this question in my mind.

r.Ashwin Rawal

=




Namaste,

Ravi and Utpal have replied to you. I will leave the question=
s they have 
already replied too. As Ravi said, the amount of materials you=
 need depends 
on how big a fire you maintain. You will learn and fine-tune=
 with 
experience.

There may be a tradition in some parts of India to offe=
r a drop of ghee in 
water after offering it in fire. But it is not necessa=
ry. When doing Chandi 
homam, some people invoke the Mother in an idol and =
offer water to the idol 
with each mantra along with offering ghee in fire.=
 Again, it is not 
necessary.

Managing ahutis and reading is difficult, bu=
t one can master it with 
practice. It is really advisable for you to do bo=
th reading and offering 
ahutis yourself.

Wooden spoon is perfectly alrigh=
t.

Best regards,
Narasimha
