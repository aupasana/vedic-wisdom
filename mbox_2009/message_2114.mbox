Namaste,Utpalji,

i really liked your mail.

my ganapati too has his trunk =
turned to the right. for a long time he was confined in a box with lakshmi =
ji and taken out only on diwali for the puja.

after starting the homam pra=
ctices i now keep him in my mother-in-law's puja cupboard. there are other =
gods too with him and i feel he is happier in this place.

:)

love and bes=
t wishes
