Narasimha acknowledges the tradition of reversing the mala, but, 
advises u=
s not to be bogged down. Mala is part of external practice 
and is of less =
importance than the intention itself.

In your case keeping the tradition l=
imit to session is the simplest 
solution. I suggest you to not to complica=
te. Don't force yourself to 
do it even number of times.

If you ask techni=
cally, if there is a way to mark the first beed, then 
you can note down wh=
ich direction you ended in a session and then 
resume the reverse in the ne=
xt session. This how ever, is a overhead 
which you may not really want.

est regards,
Vijay
