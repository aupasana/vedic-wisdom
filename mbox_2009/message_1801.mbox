http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha=
>

i don't know how reliable is the material posted in wikipedia, but it
fo=
rms interesting reading nevertheless.

Do deities assume the form we give t=
o them? Are they an amorphous energy
that we can shape anyway we like?

Bit=
s and pieces on who is Ganesha and what he signifies are given in the
above=
 link. What fascinated me were the following pieces of information:

Some c=
ommentators interpret the name "Lord of the Ganas" to mean
"Lord of Hosts" =
or "Lord of created categories", such as the
elements.[21]

Another story s=
ays that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's
laughter. Because Shiva co=
nsidered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the
head of an elephant and a pr=
otruding belly.[49]

  The Brahmanda Purana says that Ganesha has the name =
Lambodara because
all the universes (i.e., cosmic eggs
<http://en.wikipedia=
.org/wiki/World_egg> ; IAST: brahm=C4=81=E1=B9=87=E1=B8=8Das)
of the past, =
present, and future are present in him.[

The serpent is a common feature i=
n Ganesha iconography and appears in
many forms.[61] According to the Ganes=
ha Purana, Ganesha wrapped the
serpent Vasuki <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki=
/Vasuki>  around his
neck.[62] Other depictions of snakes include use as a =
sacred thread
(IAST: yaj=F1yopavita)[63] wrapped around the stomach as a be=
lt,
held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne.

Many examples of=
 color associations with specific meditation forms are
prescribed in the Sr=
itattvanidhi
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sritattvanidhi> , a treatise on =
Hindu
iconography <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_iconography> . For
ex=
ample, white is associated with his representations as
Heramba-Ganapati and=
 Rina-Mochana-Ganapati (Ganapati Who Releases from
Bondage).[67] Ekadanta-G=
anapati is visualized as blue during meditation
on that form.[68]

He is po=
pularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though
traditionally he also =
places obstacles in the path of those who need to
be checked. Paul Courtrig=
ht says that "his task in the divine scheme of
things, his dharma <http://e=
n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma> , is to place
and remove obstacles. It is his =
particular territory, the reason for his
creation."[83]

The concept of bud=
dhi is closely associated with the personality of
Ganesha, especially in th=
e Puranic period, when many stories stress his
cleverness and love of intel=
ligence. One of Ganesha's names in the
Ganesha Purana <http://en.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Ganesha_Purana>  and the
Ganesha Sahasranama <http://en.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Ganesha_Sahasranama> 
is Buddhipriya.[

Ganesha is identified with=
 the Hindu mantra
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra>  Aum
<http://en.wik=
ipedia.org/wiki/Aum>  (=E0=A5=90, also called Om). The term
o=E1=B9=83karas=
varupa (Aum is his form), when identified with
Ganesha, refers to the notio=
n that he personifies the primal sound.[92]
The Ganapati Atharvashirsa
<htt=
p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapati_Atharvashirsa>  attests to this
associat=
ion. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:

(O Lord Gan=
apati!) You are (the Trinity) Brahma
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma> =
, Vishnu
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu> , and Mahesa
<http://en.wiki=
pedia.org/wiki/Shiva> . You are Indra
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra> =
. You are fire [Agni
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni> ] and air [Vayu
<h=
ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayu> ]. You are the sun [Surya
<http://en.wiki=
pedia.org/wiki/Surya> ] and the moon [Chandrama
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wi=
ki/Chandra> ]. You are Brahman
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman> . You=
 are (the three worlds)
Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and Swarg=
aloka
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarga>  [heaven]. You are Om. (That is=
 to
say, You are all this).[93]
 
[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co=
mmons/thumb/f/f6/Ganesha-aum.jp\
g/180px-Ganesha-aum.jpg] 
<http://en.wikip=
edia.org/wiki/File:Ganesha-aum.jpg>    
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:=
Ganesha-aum.jpg> Ganesha (Devanagari
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanaga=
ri> ) Aum jewel
Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha=
's body in
iconography and the shape of Aum in the Devanagari
<http://en.wi=
kipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari>  and Tamil
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil=
_language>  scripts.[94]

According to Kundalini yoga
<http://en.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Kundalini_yoga> , Ganesha resides in the
first chakra <http://en.w=
ikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra> , called Muladhara
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/=
Muladhara>  (muladhara).
Mula means "original, main"; adhara means "base, f=
oundation". The
muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestatio=
n or outward
expansion of primordial Divine Force rests.[95]



Given such =
an array of choices, isn't it entirely upon us what we
meditate upon during=
 homam???
