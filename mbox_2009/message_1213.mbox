Dear RJ

Namaste

Interesting, My goodness, what a mess!

Dear RJ I suggest=
 you need to be a silent reader in both priase and 
lighter moments or exch=
ange of disagreements,
 
it really takes time :-).....

What good is observ=
ing Narasimha for long time .....

I am just kidding here, camn down!

We a=
re all grown ups we donot need to give gentle reminders to 
ourselves and o=
thers...

We need to enjoy the moment, be joyful, laugh atleast 20 times a =
day 
and most important make others laugh too. We all need to be less 
sens=
itive and more accomodating, this one is for me, be joyful in 
pleasure and=
 pain or praise and criticism. I am trying now to do this 
and learning to =
be the best.

Please you or others don't shoot miseales at me from whereeve=
r you 
are :-) and please don't butt me too :-), I have one wife who does i=
t 
full time and I have no more quota in my karma bank balance to the 
best=
 of my knowledge, ouch it seems now that there may be more ...

I am not go=
ing to be defensive but now I shall shed more light on 
things for the bene=
fit of all.

When anyone does more sincere sadhana and is progressing, a st=
ate of 
joyfullness engulfs that person internally and externally. He non-
=
voluntaryly starts sharing it

I am afriad to state that atleast I fail to =
see in Narasimha many of 
the times.

I wanted to influence him indirectly =
about that and all of us, He and 
all of us need to be more joyful and chee=
rful. Also we do a lot of 
things mechanically like drinking water, taking =
shower etc. you know 
what I mean. So all I was trying to influence indirec=
tly to Narashima 
that
for quoting shastras i.e. where the names are descri=
bed one does not 
need mother's direction, it is for the sake of completene=
ss and it 
also helps others  if they want to do more research. One can alw=
ays 
describe their own experiance or teaching acquired from others.

As Na=
rasimha states our email exchange was confusing to him first and 
his respo=
nse to me, am not sure about others or you, more confusion 
to ....

Now I =
have added even more confusion, but I promise on this subject 
it is the la=
st one from my side.

Have a joyful day.
Best Regards
Mitesh
