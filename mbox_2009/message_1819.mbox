Namaste,

Dharma means the right thing to do. However, one's dharma towards various 
people and objects can pull one in different directions. One has to balance 
one's dharma towards various people and objects and make the right decision. 
Any action taken now with a self-identification with the action (i.e. mind 
thinking "I am doing it") becomes a karma for future and will give its 
fruits (good or bad) in future.

Though we are not the body, we temporarily live in a body for a few decades. 
This body is like a house we live in and its sense organs (eyes, ears etc) 
are like windows in the house. When we live in a house, we have the 
responsibility to take care of it and keep the house and its surroundings 
nice. Similarly, we have some duty to make the body happy. Give it food, 
water etc, nourish it well, take good care of it, make sure it is healthy, 
make sure its pleasures are taken care of and make sure it is gratified.

However, we also have duties to other people, like parents, elders, 
relatives, friends etc. In addition, there may be persons with strong debts 
with us who come into our life later. We have duties towards them. Moreover, 
we have some duties towards the society we live in, the country we live in 
and the entire universe.

These various duties can pull one in different directions. One has to 
balance them all and do the best possible action. Arjuna's duty towards his 
guru Drona was to respect him and obey him. But his duty to his brother (and 
also to the universe) required him to kill his guru who was on Duryodhana's 
side.

Usually, one's duty towards one's own body and its gratification is a very 
small part of one's dharma and one's duty towards others should receive a 
higher priority. The larger the number of people impacted, the higher the 
weightage.

If one's only motivation for doing something that would hurt many people is 
self-gratification, one is on a shaky basis. With such self-centered 
actions, one is likely to create far more new karmas than the old karmas one 
is getting rid of. Of course, if not hurting others now leads to something 
else later that will hurt all those people even more, then that is worse. A 
lot depends on one's self-control. Choosing the lesser evil is a difficult 
exercise when one of the evils is not visible yet...

Nobody can make the right decision for you. You are responsible for your 
actions and will face the reactions to those actions later. For example, if 
you have a debt to this girl and escape it now by calling off the marriage 
for looks, you will have to pay it back later with interest. For example, 
you may be born with terrible looks and many may reject you. Or the girl may 
be born with more undesirable qualities and yet you may have to marry her. 
So many possibilities are there and one cannot know for sure what is in 
store.

Whatever you decide, good luck to that girl, to your elders and also to you!

BTW, this forum is for spiritual discussions and matters related to 
spiritual sadhana. Your request is only marginally related. This kind of 
discussions can derail the forum from its primary purpose. So I request 
members to show some discretion.

Best regards,
Narasimha
