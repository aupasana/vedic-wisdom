Hello All,

Narasimha ji often mentions that out of the 5 elements only Agn=
i is unpolluted .

Here is the explanation that I found on one of the web p=
age at http://ignca..nic.in/ps_03015.htm

Hope this is useful to people in =
understanding why Homam is so important.
=A0
      The question to be asked=
 is what are the diverse components of the
      disturbance, the ecologica=
l imbalances and what are the diverse components
      of the disturbance, =
the ecological imbalances and what methodologies and
      strategies were =
adopted in the past to sustain these balance. Can we, even
      at this st=
ate, learn any lesson from the past for equipping ourselves to
      face t=
he human predicaments today?=A0 
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0
      Let us begin by enumerating the principal components of the
  =
    environment=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
      most polluted, species mos=
t threatened and how each disturbs the
      ecological balance. Thereafter=
, we can return to the worldview of the
      historical past, the myth, ri=
tual and art of this country or for that
      matter, practically all cult=
ures, pre-renaissance. The worldview is
      mercifully sustained by so-ca=
lled primitive societies, be it in India,
      Africa, Australia or Americ=
a. At the philosophic speculative level, the
      living continuities can =
be seen only in India.
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
    =
  So today, this moment where four-fifths of humanity lives (i.e.,
      In=
dia and Asia), what is threatened? What are we polluting, destroying,
     =
 thus bringing forebodings of the annihilation of Man on earth? What is the=

      quality of life we can hope for?
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0
      First and foremost it water, the basic sustaining princi=
ple - clean
      water or to use a traditional phrase 'pure or unpolluted =
(=BFuddha)
      water' - is becoming scarce. Water systems are increasingl=
y over-exploited
      and polluted. Any India is familiar with the daily r=
ituals which serve as
      reminders of the concept of pure and, therefore=
, holy water. No daily,
      monthly, annual ceremony is complete without =
ritual purification with
      water. At birth, marriage, death, this conce=
pt is articulated and yet we
      have polluted these waters of life
     =
 
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
      Next, the pollution of the=
 earth - Mother Earth, floating free ball
      beneath the most gleaming m=
embrane of bright blue sky. And what have we
      done to it? Arid lands h=
ave increased, soil which was venerated has been
      eroded and infertili=
ty, sand and salt have taken over. It is estimated
      that in this part =
of the world, a million hectares are being desertified
      each year. Des=
ecration of the bowels of the earth through excessive
      quarrying is co=
mmon. Man's power has hollowed the still centre of life. P=A4thiv=A2,
     =
 the eternal mother, has been polluted and desecrated.
      
      
      =
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
      Related to the pollution of water and ear=
th is the massive
      unprecedented deforestation. The Indian sub-contine=
nt has been
      progressively deforested: the soil's ability to absorb an=
d hold water has
      diminished. Severe floods have occurred more frequen=
tly and deforestation
      has affected most adversely the eco-system of t=
he Himalayas where our
      major river systems - the Indus, the Ganges an=
d the Brahmaputra -
      originate. Each day we learn of the increase in w=
astelands and the
      consequent effect upon rural life, be they the fore=
sts of Bastar or the
      hills of the Himalayan range. In the language of=
 Indian myth, this is the
      rape of the tree and river goddess, the V=
=A4k=C0ik=A1s,
      and the destruction of the gods of the woods, the Vana=
devat=A1.
      No wonder the Chipko Movement and Protect the Silent Valley=
 is a cry of
      anguish. Most of all, the present destruction is a dange=
rous play with the
      mythical centre - Sumeru, the
      world axis, th=
e Himalayas.
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
      The dist=
urbance in water, earth, vegetation, river and mountain
      ecology syste=
ms has naturally threatened all manner of life - aquatic,
      terrestrial=
 and celestial. Mythically, =E1e=C0an=A1ga
      upholds the earth, the Ga=
=B4g=A1 rides the crocodile, Yamun=A1 the tortoise
      and each is threat=
ened. Boars and elephants upheld the earth; they too are
      dying. So wh=
o upholds the earth now? The birds of heaven, the Swan, the
      Garu=B7a =
and other who carried the gods are vanishing. So who sustains the
      mor=
al and cosmic order? There can only be chaos.
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
      And worst of all, there is the pollution of the ho=
ly space - the
      air, V=A1yu and the sky which
      permeates and enve=
lopes all life. The tragedy of Bhopal is too close for
      comment, but e=
qually demonic are the =A1suric chimneys of black t=A1masic
      forces wh=
ich pollute the 'lungs' of life. Acid rains are common elsewhere
      and =
man looks in vain for the purity of the water to flow from the
      rain-f=
illed clouds. Destruction is writ large on the balmy skies, once
      azur=
e blue, today smoke grey.
      
      
      =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
 =
     Finally, we have polluted holy sound, the primeval Nada, through
     =
 the chaos of our life. Noise pollution makes Man deaf to the inner voices
=
      of his wisdom.And so Man aspires higher
      and higher, beyond the =
pollution of his making, to that one source which
      sustains all and is=
 yet beyond his reach, namely, the Sun - =CBditya - the
      giver of ligh=
t in the sky and fire on earth - Agni - the source of energy
      which ap=
pears unpollutable unlike the fuel of his making. This energy,
      physic=
ally and metaphysically, is Man's only ray of hope for the
      continuanc=
e of life.


Thank you,
Manish
