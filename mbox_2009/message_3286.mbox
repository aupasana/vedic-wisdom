Namaskara!

I have some very basic questions and was not convinced by answe=
rs that are usually given.

1. How can milk be considered pious? I understa=
nd that Cow is a divinely being and is worshiped as `Kamadenu'. But in actu=
al sense we are extracting milk and preventing the calf from having its sha=
re of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a young calf from having milk from i=
ts mother?

2. How can silk cloth be considered sacred for worship? Silk is=
 obtained by killing thousand's of cocoon. Using a product which is obtaine=
d by killing so many living beings and we being a cause for such an action.=
..Are we not doing sin?

3. I tell my daily prayers but I have not learnt S=
anskrit and don't understand the meaning of many prayers that I say everyda=
y. Why is it necessary to say the slokas in Sanskrit and not other language=
??
Will our Supreme Lord not understand other languages ?? or is it just bc=
os Sanskrit has been used from the very early times it is still in practice=
.
