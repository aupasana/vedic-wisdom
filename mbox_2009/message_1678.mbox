once again, thankyou, narasimhaji.

yes, we are all realising the value of =
thankyou.

frankly, there was something within that often "revolted" agains=
t rituals.

this sometimes comes from too much of "thinking/doubting". as i=
 took/am taking the first baby steps i realise how important it is to suspe=
nd "thinking" or rather all the nonsense that goes on in the mind and just =
follow.

the rituals prescribed by you did appear onerous to me...specially=
 since my knowledge of sanskrit is very limited. probably if one is to reci=
te mantras one should know the correct meaning, the correct intonation, the=
 correct chandas, etc. etc....i thought.

i am now attracted to the idea, t=
hanks to this forum, that there are dimensions within dimensions...for inst=
ance, when yagna is performed at the physical level there is also some thin=
g going on at a more subtle level....that agni is one of the purest element=
s...that offerings/sacrifice is so essential to us....as is burning of the =
prarabhda.

maybe for the realised like adi shankracharya..."na mantro, na =
yagna" is required to experience chidananda swaroopa, shivoham, shivoham...=
but for most of us sadhana, sadhana and more sadhana is required.

your muc=
h abbreviated vidhi for performing yagna left an impression (almost as if t=
he message had been written for me :)) and i am now looking for a place whe=
re i can buy a havana kundam. 

your directions that one should think of a =
deity and recite a mantra as one of the final steps in the yagna put me in =
bit of a quandary, though. 

then on this very forum there was a post on mr=
itunjaya mantra....so i went looking for a recitation of the same. have bee=
n listening to an mp3 version of this again and again and like it very much=
.

see how everything connects so beautifully!!!!!!!!

so i want to say tha=
nkyou again and again and again....

p.s.

i would like to know more about =
the fire in/near chennai...is it in any way connected with arunachala?

ers to small children. For example, we tell small children to say "thank yo=
u" when someone helps or say "I am sorry" when they do something wrong. A r=
eally small child does not even understand what those words mean, but repea=
ts them out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the t=
rue meaning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what =
they truly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually u=
nderstood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture=
 of a mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As =
a child accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the ex=
ternal world through senses), the child's thinking expands and one gets mor=
e clarity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says =
sorry, one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a c=
ertain emotion (sadness and compassion).

rituals like homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without ful=
ly understanding or appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many=
 years without fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to und=

ntras and spiritual truths are actually understood from experience alone. O=
ne can never fully understand what one has never experienced. As we accumul=

of the symbolism is often useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if =
you explain to a one year old child what the word "sorry" means in detail, =
the child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just get the chil=
d into the habit of saying "I am sorry" in approapriate situations. Slowly,=
 the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience and the correc=
t emotions will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyd=
ay - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and visualizati=
on in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.

ligions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing phi=
losophy and the final truths. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, =
the former helps one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs to set foo=

 some external practices in order to realize internal truths. Of course, it=
 is good to remind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest one should g=
et stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate=
 the first steps. Just saying "you are That. Just realize that you are That=
" is not an action plan. It does not work for most. One has to take some ba=
by steps.
