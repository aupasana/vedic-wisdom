Respected PVR ji,

I have been a avid follower of this group and=
 learning many things. My father passed away on 02/02/2009 in India and I, =
being the eldest son, completed all the final rites and ceremonies, in the =
most religious possible way, observing all thithis. 

I have been wanting t=
o do homam for my own peace of mind. My mother is of the view that homam sh=
ould not be performed at home and she also says that I should not also part=
icipate in any homam (taking sankalpam), while family priest is of the opin=
ion that he will do the homam for me in a temple premises. 

I would be tha=
nkful to have your advice on the subject.

2. I am doing Yajur Vedhi 'Brahm=
a Yagnam' (Bothayana Sutram, which I belong to) every day, which is offer o=
f tarpana to Deva, Rishi's and Pitru. Is this the same thing you mention as=
 Pitri Tarpana in Tarpana manual? Please advise. 

Thanks and Regards,
Shan=
kar
