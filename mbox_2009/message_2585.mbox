Subject: Do Mantras Work Magically?

Oops, sent the last one prematurely..
------------------
Namaste,

I am assuming that you read the mention of this mantra in "Kundalini (Aghora 
Part II)", where Vimalananda talked about starting fire without a
matchstick.

*        *        *

The question is: Do mantras have power in them? If you know a specific 
combination of syllables and repeat it, will things happen magically? The 
answer is both yes and no. I will explain this using a simple analogy.

Suppose a king is giving away expensive gifts at some place and you are 
interested in going there and getting a gift. Suppose someone gave you some 
directions to go to that place. Suppose the directions are complicated. Now, 
getting directions to that place is not the same as getting a gift. You have 
to walk carefully, resolve confusions in the way, overcome obstacles and 
reach the place. If you finally reach the place, then you will receive the 
gift from king. If you get confused or get lost or give up, you will not get 
the gift. If someone who has gone there before gives you directions to the 
place (as opposed to someone who has never gone to that place and only heard
the directions from someone else), it is helpful as such a person may give 
clearer guidance in potentially confusing areas. But, still it is possible 
to get lost on the way. Especially, one who is not smart enough or strong 
enough to overcome the obstacles on the way may not reach the place even if 
given directions.

In the analogy, experiencing a mantra is like the place where king is giving 
away gifts. God is like the king. The result of the mantra is like the gift. 
The letters/words of the mantra and other details of its sadhana are like 
the directions to the place. Just as somebody who wrote down directions to a 
place is not guaranteed to reach that place successfully, one who knows a 
mantra is not guaranteed to experience it and get its results. One who has 
weaknesses is less likely to succeed.

*        *        *

If one got a mantra from a guru and repeated it a few times and got a 
result, that must be because (1) the person is already quite pure, has a 
rina with that mantra and ready for the results of the mantra or (2) he 
derived from the shakti accumulated by his guru with that mantra (kind of 
like a person who gave directions to a place also giving you an intelligent 
vehicle that was driven by him before, which remembers the way and can take 
you there easily).

In general, please realize that getting the result of any mantra requires 
some purity and some sadhana. Nothing comes free. At the same time, no 
effort is wasted.

*        *        *

For now, I am afraid most people will have to carry matchsticks or atleast 
stones that can generate sparks, if they want to start fire for a homam. 
What Vimalananda said will not work right away, even if you know the exact 
letters of the mantra that he chanted.

Best regards,
Narasimha
