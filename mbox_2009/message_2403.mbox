Dear all,
 I write this in continuation of my mail to Shri Venkatachalapath=
i in regard to  effectt of Sade Saati and  Saturn`s Transitin general.  To =
minimise the ill-effects of the transit( Sanichaaram), I would propose chan=
ting of certain Stotras and Mantras which many of you might be already know=
ing and chanting also. Nevertheless,I shall state them here for the benefit=
 of others.
SANI STOTRAM
Neelanjana Samabhasam Raviputram Yamagrajam
Chaaya=
a Maartanda Sambhootham Tam Namaami Sanaischaram

SANI GAYATRI
Kakadvajaaya=
 Vidmahe  kadga hastaaya  dheemahi     Tanno     mandah  Prachodayaat
 
Han=
uman GAYATRI
AAnjaneyaaya vidhmahe Vaayuputraaya  Dheemahi Tanno  Hanuman p=
rachodayaat

Hanuman Stotras
1.Raama Dhoota Mahadheera Rudra Veerya sadbhav=
a
Anjanaagarbha sambootha Vaayuputra Namostute
2.Sarvakalyaana dhataaram sa=

3.Bud=
dhirbalam yasodhairyam nirbhayatvam arogataam
   Ajaadyam vaakpatutvam cha =
Hanumat smaranaat bhaveth

There could be many more such Stotras on  Sani B=
hagawan and on Hanuman. In addition to the parihaarams   suggested in earli=
er mail,constant chanting of these and other  Stotras with devotion, lighti=
ng of  oil wicks  with sesame(til oil) on Saturdays  either at temples or a=
t home before offering the prayers will be effective in reducing the fear o=
f adverse effects of Sani`s transit. Chanting the Lord`s name with faith an=
d devotion and unconditional  surrender to the Lord with sincere prayers wi=
ll  definitely help.
G.Balasubramanian
  





Dear PathiSir,
Thanks foradd=
ing  the footnote"Pl. Note" at the end. Thanks for acting on my suggestions=
 in this regard.  The bad effects of Sani`s transits are the effects of bad=
  karmas in this very or past janmas.Sufferings during this period can be m=
inimised by worshipping Sani Bhagawan, Tirupathy Venkatachalapathy and Hanu=
man on Saturdays  by chanting relevant stotras and or Mantras and by distri=
buting  Rice preparation  mixed with sesame seed (Ellu sadam)    to poor an=
d physically challenged people,especially lame.Chanting of Hanuman Chalisa =
is stated to be effective.
G.Balasubramanian

Transit Results of Saturn in Virgo (Kanya)=
 Rasi
General
	1. When Saturn passes through Janma Rasi of Kanya, those bor=
n in stars of Uttara-Phalguni =E2=80=93 Hastham =E2=80=93 Chittirai may liv=
e frequently separated from family. They could wonder in foreign lands. The=
y could feel lonely. They could feel undecided in plans in domestic front. =
 They may pick up quarrels in least provocation. Some could suffer with phy=
sical troubles, or ailments. Some could run pillar to post without any aim.=
 Some could be troubled by unwanted problems =E2=80=93 being (second) move =
of two and half years in =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 in the house=
 where the Moon is deposited in the Natal =E2=80=99s Birth Chart. Transit i=
n this house is the secvond part of three parts of Sade Sati. 
	2. For many=
 it will be bereft of good appearance, happiness, pride and short of adequa=
te earning to meet basic demands in life, when Saturn passes through 2nd  H=
ouse  from Simha =E2=80=93  in Stars Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uttara Phalguni =
the last part in three  parts of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99. Some has to m=
eet excess expenditure, and could easily become tired in work place. For on=
e cause to another, some could be persistently in grief, and have commercia=
l losses. One should avoid in total, gambling any form, share market stakes=
, to avoid financial loss as well as avoidable humiliation. Certainly they =
should avoid bad company, association, illegal connections with opposite se=
x, some could harm educational progress, realize virility falling down, get=
 across to avoid the temptation of earning through illegal means. Many will=
 be forced borrow amounts beyond means to repay them, due to domestic unexp=
ected needs. 
	3. Those born with Moon in Cancer =E2=80=93 Kataka =E2=80=93=
 Rasi - in Stars Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha will have the most profitable,=
 progressive, and satisfactory period of next Two and half years, with plen=
ty and prosperity.  They will be free from any type of ailments. They will =
succeed in heroic efforts.  Fortunes shines on this native, They will have =
many travel to gain. Their spouse will be happy in all expectations from th=
e partner through this period of next two and half years. This period will =
shine to bring prosperity and popularity to all politicians in public life =
with birth Stars of Pumarpoosam, Pusam and Ayilyam. The bed time desires wi=
ll be fully satisfactory. Auspicious events, hither to delayed, will culmin=
ate to the satisfaction of all. Friends will help the native and siblings w=
ill progress. 
	4. The mood and act of native having Moon in Gemini =E2=80=
=93 Mithuna =E2=80=93 in Janma Kundali, in Stars Mrigasheera, Arudhra, and =
Punarvasu will be far from social norms, and he becomes vindictive in react=
ions, when Saturn transits in 4th house.  That person will be separated fro=
m friends.  Some may lose properties and quarrel with spouse leading to irr=
eparable results.  One could lose a dear and near relative. Body ailments b=
ased on colic with flatulence, along with mental distress and fear could tr=
ouble many. (This is called Ardhashtama Sani or Kantaka Sani)  For some, in=
 their Birth Chart findings, if life span is near its end, this period coul=
d cause extreme anxiety resulting in death of that person. A few, may not f=
ind a comfortable shelter.  Some could develop fear that about something or=
 other. 
	5. Those born with Moon in Taurus =E2=80=93 in Stars Karthika, Ro=
hini, and Mirgasheera, Saturn, during this period, will be moving in 5th ho=
use from the position of Moon in the Birth Chart. One should be careful to =
avoid any confrontation with his children.  Expenses on them will increase,=
 more than normal. Problems due to their wrong involvements could cause anx=
iety, waste of money, and related confrontations. Some could fail in their =
undertakings, and incur money loss. One could invite troubles due to union =
with mean partner in sex. One could be forced to move away from family with=
out repute. Accumulated assets may dwindle during this period, in undesired=
 involvement. 
	6. Moon should be in Aeries =E2=80=93 Mesha =E2=80=93 in hi=
s birth Stars Aswani, Bharani and Karthikai ,to know that in this period Sa=
turn is moving in 6th house to the place of Moon in birth chart.  One will =
overcome suddenly all his enemies =E2=80=93 a last ball =E2=80=98sixer=E2=
=80=99 to win a cricket match! The spouse, must be floating in joy and comf=
ort and be proud of the partner. Lady can get a long waited pregnancy and b=
ecome proud of her child. Financial status increase unexpectedly. The perso=
n will find that appreciation never could ever come from a known person, wi=
ll pour in abundance from that person to create a flood of growth in popula=
rity. All sickness will disappear and health will be blooming. All desired =
luxuries and comforts will be there for asking! 
	7. Saturn, going into the=
 7th house for next two and half years, to the position of Moon, - Pieces =
=E2=80=93 Meena - for those born in Stars Poorvapathrapada (poorattathi) , =
Utharapathrapada (Uttirattathi) , Revathi in the birth chart will cause hea=
lthy separation from family frequently, while putting all efforts and hard =
work with dedication in work to invite appreciation and reward from all. So=
me could have minor ailments during this period. However, one has to be car=
eful in expenses. Those traveling in speedy vehicles could either commit an=
 accident or involve themselves to put them away on bed for some time. Abso=
lute careful driving is recommended. One should not invite perennial proble=
ms due to illicit relations with opposite sex, which could damage the reput=
ation of the person. Here Saturn could give malefic effects more that what =
is detailed above when he passed through the fourth house to the position o=
f Moon in the birth chart. 
	8. One would be dragged to extreme and damagin=
g temptations during this period for those having Moon in Aquarius =E2=80=
=93 Kumbha =E2=80=93 Born in the stars of Dhanishta (Avittam), Sathabhisha =
(Sathayam),Poorvabh adrapada (Poorattathi) , he will be away from family of=
ten.  (This position  of transit is termed as =E2=80=98Ashtama Sani=E2=80=
=99).   One has to be careful with the company in which he associates to av=
oid bad repercussions and heavy loss of earnings. Consequently, the good fr=
iends and relatives will be put to trouble.  Decrease in wealth, troubles d=
ue to ill health, obstacles to various undertakings could cause mental depr=
ession during this period. There could be eye trouble.  Acute shortage of m=
oney would be felt by many. Some sort of mental agony will always persist. =
 Certainly please avoid any bad physical relationship during this period in=
 emotional involvement with one, which could bring in perennial problem all=
 life. 
	9. Having transit of Saturn in the 9th house from the position of =
Moon in Capricorn =E2=80=93 Makara =E2=80=93  born in Starsof Utthirashada =
(Uthiradam), Sravana (Thiruvonam), Dhanishta (Avittam) in the birth chart, =
one has to watch out for enemies to harm him in least excuse. One has to wo=
rk very hard which normally he could finish it easily and early. Lose of fi=
nance is imminent, unless this condition is offset by other Planets, positi=
oned or in transit, in birth chart, which are in favor.  Distress concernin=
g spouse and progeny will also exist. Money will be spent in unwanted and u=
seless purposes. Keep away from any unknown opposite sex.  If the judged li=
fe span coincides with Maraka Desa, at this time, many related disappointme=
nts could become confronted by the Jathaka.  The sources of income will be =
obstructed. Saturn transiting in 9th house is generally not safe and satisf=
actory a period. 
	10. When Moon is positioned in Sagittarius =E2=80=93 Dha=
nush =E2=80=93 Moolam, Poorvashada (Puradam), Uthrashada, (Uttirsadfum) and=
 Saturn is transiting in the 10th house (Kanya), it could bring in sudden e=
xpenses and fall in reputation.  One could cause distress, loss of work, me=
et obstructions and objections to decisions, to cause bewilderment.  Many c=
ould not satisfactorily complete the education.  One could have meager inco=
me for hard work.  Avoid agitations, violent involvement for public cause a=
nd enter to peace with fighting groups, which could result in never ending =
litigations and sufferings. One could lose respect and gain humiliation. It=
 is firmly said that the native will undergo ordeals when Saturn is in 10th=
 from Janma Rasi. 
	11. The Moon in Scorpio =3D Vruchika =E2=80=93 Rasi in =
the stars of Visakam, Anuradha (Anusham), Jyesta (Kettai), Saturn is in the=
 11th house to the position of Moon in Birth chart. One gets pleasure, mone=
y, and comfort from spouse. One will find success in all endeavors in which=
 involved. The person will get elevated status and gain appreciation.  Exce=
llent health, many financial gains, increase in happiness related to spouse=
 and children and have people with pure heart and deed around the person al=
l time. If wife is pregnant during this period a female child will be born =
to him (subject to, of course, result of many other factors in the birth ch=
art to be considered, in both partners=E2=80=99 chart, before such a pronou=
ncement is made!). One could get extra-ordinary elevations in his place of =
work.  Some could get money belonging to others! These two and half years w=
ill be very good. 
	12. When Saturn is positioned in the 12th house from Mo=
on, in Stars of Chittirai (Chitta), Swathi, Visakam, it is easily said that=
 just the opposite will result to all that is said, under item 11 above. Do=
 not possess or hold any money belonging to others! One will be plunged in =
series of miseries, as that will be the first leg of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=
=80=99, - Chittirai, Swati, Visakam Stars.  All endeavors fail. Intelligenc=
e and skill get diminished.  His reputation is affected. The person=E2=80=
=99s life span judged in the birth chart to the Desha period in effect duri=
ng this period, could cause health hazards and death, if it is Maraka Lord =
Desha period.  Intensified malefic period will be in exercise during this p=
eriod of two and half years.
 
 
Please Note:  The details given above are =
general and millions would have born in each category.  Therefore, a comple=
te study of individual charts is absolutely necessary before these comments=
 are taken as effective.  Many changes due to relations of Other Planets, b=
y its position, occupation and qualities with the movement of Saturn and it=
s position has to be studied in depth before individual results are set to =
be pronounced.
