Jai Guudev Siva ji,

>Sri Aurobindo and the Mother maintained that while no=
t yet achieved >on earth, it is still possible to reach a stage beyond even=
 Sahaja >Samadhi..

This is extremely perplexing.

*THERE is a stage in spi=
ritual realm which is not yet achieved on Earth. It means that Rama, Krishn=
a, Ramakrishna, Mahavatara Babaji, Raman Maharashi, vivekananda, Gnyaneshwa=
r, Adi Shankaracharya... also could not achieve THAT state. 

*Stage beyond=
 sahaj samadhi...

would you please elaborate on the above when you find ti=
me. i am really eager to know of this.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 perceive (the word kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence=

 oneness with that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous =
thing and many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.

 a variety of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.
