8th January, 1946

A few days ago, a lady, a recent arrival, came into the =
hall at about 3 p.m.
and sat down. All the time she was there,she was tryin=
g to get up and ask
something of Sri Bhagavan.

As Bhagavan appeared not to=
 have noticed her, and was reading a book, she
waited for a while.

As soon=
 as Bhagavan put the book aside, she got up, approached the sofa and
said w=
ithout any fear or hesitation, =93Swami, I have only one desire.

May I tel=
l you what it is?=94 =93Yes,=94 said Bhagavan, =93What do you want?=94 =93I=

want moksha,=94 she said. =93Oh, is that so?=94 remarked Bhagavan. =93Yes,=
 Swamiji,
I do not want anything else. Is it enough if you give me moksha,=
=94 said she.

Suppressing a smile that had almost escaped his lips, Bhagav=
an said,
=93Yes,yes, that is all right; that is good.=94 =93It will not do =
if you say that
you will give it sometime later.

You must give it to me he=
re and now,=94 she said. =93It is all right,=94 said
Bhagavan.
=93Will you =
give it now? I must be going,=94 said she. Bhagavan nodded.

As soon as she=
 left the hall, Bhagavan burst out laughing and said, turning
towards us, =
=93She says that it is enough if only moksha is given to her.

She does not=
 want anything else.=94 Subbalakshmamma, who was seated by my
side, took up=
 the thread of the conversation and quietly said, =93We have come
and are s=
taying here for the same purpose.

We do not want anything more. It is enou=
gh if you give us moksha.=94 =93If you
renounce, and give up everything, wh=
at remains is only moksha.

What is there for others to give you? It is the=
re always.That is,=94 said
Bhagavan. =93We do not know all that. Bhagavan h=
imself must give us moksha.=94
So saying she left the hall.

Looking at the=
 attendants who were by his side, Bhagavan remarked, =93I should
give them =
moksha, they say. It is enough if moksha alone is given to them.
Is not tha=
t itself a desire?

If you give up all the desires that you have, what rema=
ins is only moksha.
And you require sadhana to get rid of all those desires=
.=94

The same bhava (idea) is found in Maharatnamala:

It is said that the=
 complete destruction of vasanas is Brahmam and moksha.
