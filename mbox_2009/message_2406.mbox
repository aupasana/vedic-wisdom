Namaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoji,
 
I am a big fan of the Maha Ganapathi Homa=
m and I have seen it being performed at our home as a kid many times. I alw=
ays wanted to perform this homam on my own and after seeing your video and =
the Laghu padhati document I am sure I can do it myself. I have couple of r=
equests from my side: 

1) Is it possible to create a document for the full=
 fledged Ganapathi homam ? This will be immensely helpful for people who ha=
ve the time and intrest to perform such a homam. 

2) There are some other =
important homams particularly the following in which I am deeply intrested =
: 
a) Sudarshana Homam 
b) Navagraha Homam 
c) Purusha Suktha Homam 

I wou=
ld request you to kindly create documents similar to the Maha Ganapathi Hom=
am PDF so that the larger population is benefited. 

Swami Sharanam. 
Thank=
s and Regards, 
Girish Sundaram
