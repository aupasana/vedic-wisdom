Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
I hope you or others won't get offended by my mails. Ple=
ase take them in the right vein. I am merely discussing. Now some points:
=
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
But I have often feel that they are themselves are not convin=
ced when they argue. they are 'hollow' arguments. However , I'll honestly s=
ay that i have no answers for 'life in a Plant'.

When I used to eat non-ve=
getarian food many of my friends who were=C2=A0vegetarian people would give=
 me a similar logic, as you mentioned in your first writing. My point is, a=
s a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to=
 plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C2=A0 this logic that m=
any vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit ea=
ting non-veg, does not hold good.
=C2=A0
I personally can not look at butch=
ery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their=
 excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and t=
hen take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or =
a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook =
the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a di=
sturbing site. Panting for water (i don't have proper English word to descr=
ibe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is s=
o tasty.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I pers=
onally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted. 
=C2=A0
When the question =
of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is mos=
lty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may no=
t affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0=

Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where th=
ey showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends se=
emed disgusted. I asked them, "Why?". If you can eat a chicken or a fish, w=
hat is wrong=C2=A0if someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a =
certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the b=
elieve that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if=
 in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they would gladl=
y keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans =
are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinion is all r=
ight. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are the only pos=
sible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don't others s=
hare similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse=
, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a
 vegetaria=
n in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/family in a later lifeti=
me which=C2=A0eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid wh=
ile eating the same. I know=C2=A0people who faint at the sight of blood, bu=
t there are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, perso=
nal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C2=A0ca=
nnot be=C2=A0a universal logic applicable to all.
=C2=A0
A far better angle=
 of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure=
 he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be ki=
lled, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handle=
d easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C2=A0does not want to deal=
 in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount o=
f karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily =
handled.=C2=A0It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple=
 daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who ha=
s cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions=
 in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - b=
roiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten be=
cause they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What kar=
ma does one get for consuming that? God knows.
=C2=A0
An average non-vegeta=
rian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His stapl=
e diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg.=
 From a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who fe=
ed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to =
serious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biolo=
gically good.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0If we don't eat fish then sea will be ful=
l of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaff=
ordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not,=
 put up such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are themsel=
ves not convinced.


The above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-veg=
etarian people who provide such arguements,=C2=A0 but these arguments=C2=A0=
are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of arguments.
=C2=A0
=
Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally=C2=A0veget=
arian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans,=C2=A0o=
r else it conflicts with your system badly. 
=C2=A0
But to say that it is=
=C2=A0 immoral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetaria=
n food, is illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.I know a devotee of Krishna=
 - not just a devotee but one who sees Krishna=C2=A0during his=C2=A0meditat=
ions and have experienced samadhi many times over, who is=C2=A0omnivorous.=
=C2=A0For any average person, not engaging himself/herself in specific sadh=
anas, I see no harm in having an omnivorous diet with a 80/20 vegetarian/no=
n-vegetarian combination. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Dear Rajarshi,

As you have said, Most o=
f these are sure shot arguments from the people who eat Meat/fish. But I ha=
ve often feel that they are themselves are not convinced when they argue. t=
hey are 'hollow' arguments. However , I'll honestly say that i have no answ=
ers for 'life in a Plant'.

The people who argue such as': Most eat meat in=
 the world, Egg is vegetarian, Plant also has life, One will not get requir=
ed nourishments only with vegetarian food, If we don't eat fish then sea wi=
ll be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will bec=
ome unaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often =
than not, put up such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they ar=
e themselves not convinced.

Vegeterian people have their own arguments but=
 all these are mere arguments. I personally can not look at butchery shops =
where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their excitemen=
ts stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take a=
way that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or =
a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice =
of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing s=
ite. Panting for water (i don't have proper English word to describe the co=
ndition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.

=
The bottom line is that "They cannot overcome" the cravings for the meat, f=
ish and eggs. This is a naked reality.

Dear Rajarshi, However i try, i am =
not convinced with arguments in favour of Nonveg food. Only at the cold pla=
ces and deserts where survival was the main consideration, i can slightly a=
gree but that too during ancient days. not now...Now everywhere Veg food is=
 easily available.

***
Few months back, a young girl from Germany came to =
work in my office for 6 months. once i casually asked her as to what she ea=
ts during lunch. what she said was not at all expected. she said that she i=
s pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food since 3 years now and wants to con=
tinue that way whole life. As expected, i was very happy and i further aske=
d the reason. The answer she gave so much happiness. She said that She does=
 not want to kill to eat. Vow! I salute her from my heart.

Best Regards,

ut all these are mere arguments. I personally can not look at butchery shop=

 stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then tak=

or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voi=
ce of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbin=
g site. Panting for water (i don't have proper English word to describe the=
 condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty=
.<BR><BR>The bottom line is that "They cannot overcome" the cravings for th=

 as=

ears now and wants to continue that way whole life. As expected, i was very=
 happy and i further asked the reason. The answer she gave so much happines=
