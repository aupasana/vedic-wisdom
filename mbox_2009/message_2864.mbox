Namaste, 
=A0
1) For lord Shiva, there is no concept of time. However in =
the story of "Birth of Ganesha", it's mentioned that Shiva cuts off Ganesha=
's head for he "fails" to recognize Ganesha as his Son. Why did Shiva, who =
is the Lord of Kaala, fail to recognize Ganesha? 
Is it anything to do with=
 Shiva, tacitly trying to re-design Ganesha, who has been created by Parvat=
i, with an Elephant Head and there-by telling all of us that to evolve spir=
itually, the mortal beings require elephantine memory or something like tha=
t? 
=A0
Is there any hidden meaning in that story? 
=A0
2) In Ksheera Sagar=
a manthana story, when halahala comes out of churning the ocean, Shiva cons=
umes it and stores it in his throat. Why throat only? Why not stomach or an=
y other part of parama purusha? 
=A0
Are our spiritual masters any way sayi=
ng that Throat is somehow linked to Visuddha, which is inturn linked to ove=
rcoming of sadness and hence when one evolves spiritually, sadness is overc=
ome. Is there=A0any spiritual signification to=A0this story of consuming po=
ison and holding it in "Throat"?
=A0
3. =A0Lord Rama is a purna avatara and=
 he could have easily distinguished between Vali and Sugriva. If so, why di=
d Rama ask Sugriva to wear a mala to distinguish between Vali and Sugriva a=
nd also why did Rama have to kill Vali while hiding behind the tree? (Vali =
having a mali which can weaken the opponent looks very trivial)
