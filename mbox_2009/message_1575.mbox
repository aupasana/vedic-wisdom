Namaste Utpal ji,

   This is called 'samputam' (Lit. meaning a covered box=
 or enclosing with folded palms as in anjali). The given mantra in this cas=
e is enclosed with praNava and respective beejakshara. Some traditions do s=
o for gAyatri encasing it in praNava and vyAhrutis. I don't know the signif=
icance of this samputam but we do encounter it in a few different places (m=
ahanyAsam for example). If there are any mantra shAstra scholars on the for=
um they'll be able to shed more details.

Regards,
-Prasad

derstood that All the Three charitras are Attributed to Mahaakali, MahaLaks=
hmi and MahaSarswati respectively and hence Aim beeja, Hreem Beeja and Klee=
