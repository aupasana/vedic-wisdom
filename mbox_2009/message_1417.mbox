Namaste Krishna Kanthji,

If you are feeling a kind of reluctance/Uneasines=
s within while switching off the Audio, i've one quick suggestion.

As your=
 travel time is fixed, you can match the duration of say VishnuSahastranaam=
 Stotra with your traveling time. For example if VSNS takes around 1 hour, =
then start is approximately at the time during travel when an hour is left =
to reach the destination.

If still not finished due to some wrong time cal=
culations, then sit for some time in you car and hear the stotra completely=
 :). We can surely do that if we really like listening to that. But that wi=
ll be too much for asking.

People like you need to be congratulated who li=
sten to Rudram and Sahastranam instead of listening to all the other stuff.=


You surely know what I recommended. Kindly bear with me.

Warm Regards,

=
Utpal
