Hi,

I would not comment on the maturity part since if we look back we all=
 would have been like Rajesh at his age.

But yes, after experiencing that =
age, I can surely say that we create a frame of mind and suspect the upcomi=
ng things especially when it is concerned with would be spouse. Most of the=
 times, these thoughts are vague and get sorted itself with time which in t=
his case shall be Rajesh going ahead with the marriage. I wish girl is othe=
rwise a match for him in terms of IQ level and so.

Good luck Rajesh and en=
joy your marriage celebrations, is what I would like to say right now.

reg=
ds
Devinder
