Dear Amitji
=C2=A0
Well the ghats are no doubt a marvel. Each one of them. =
There are in total 84 ghats, of which Dashashwamedha is the most famous and=
 most populated. Dont miss the arati of Ma Ganga every evening.
=C2=A0
I fe=
lt Kasi to be a generally safe city if can ignore the pandas and random pur=
ohits. Just keep walking on the ghats, its a marvellous experience. Every g=
hat is unique and exciting. You will find lots of foreigners too living in =
Kasi. One of the best ghats I found was the next to manikarnik ghat. I dont=
 recall the name right now, but if you walk from Dashashmedh towards Manika=
rnik ghat, there is a ghat which is a little isolated. There are some struc=
tes made of cement which jut out inside the the Ganges from the ghat. Durib=
ng evening, after 6. its generally less populated area. So you can actually=
 go and sit on the banks of this ghat and do your japa/meditation. Its wond=
erful. No disturbance at all. I used to do that everday. 
The name of the d=
asashmedh ghat is so because Brahma himself had done ten ashwamedha yagjas =
on this ghat to invite Lord Shiva in Kasi. That is why the name is Das-ashw=
amedha which has become Dashasamedha.
=C2=A0
In the kasikhanda, it is descr=
ibed that Lord Shiva took Ma Parvati along with him and showed to her what =
is called teh Abhimuktashetra. In the Jaballa Upanished this Abhimuktashetr=
a (Kasi - the area between Varuna and Ganga) has been described as the area=
 between the two eyebrows of a man. Here Lord Shiva established himself as =
Abhimukteshwara, that is Vishwanath, and recided in Kasi. Immediate hudreds=
 of Pashupata Siddhas came into the area in astral bodies and rejoiced in t=
he glody of Shiva as=C2=A0 the Supreme Lord of pure light.
=C2=A0
While bat=
hing in the ghats, I would suggest be a little careful because some places =
are very slippery. What you can do is take a boat to teh otehr bank and the=
n take a dip in the water. The boatman can charge you anytring between Rs10=
0 to Rs250 (depending on your bargaining skills).
=C2=A0
Then among the tem=
ples I would stronly suggest goign to Sankataji Temple. On fridays, the tem=
ple gets over crowded, there is a well in the temple called chandra kupa. 
=
=C2=A0
Then the famous Durga Kund temple. Inside the temple, apart from teh=
 main deity Ma Chandi, there are also three other deities on the sides of t=
he temple complex. Saraswati, Mahalakshmi and Ma Kali. This is one of the M=
OST unique Ma Kali partimas I have ever seen. She stands in a defiant tone =
with her head pointed upwards and her tougue jutting out towards the sky. W=
hen I looked at Her, the first thought that came to my mind was to ask for =
forgiveness. All I could say was Ma kshama karo. Do sit infront of her and =
pray/meditate/do japa.
=C2=A0
Then you can hire a car and visit Vindhyachal=
 where there is a famous temple of Ma Vindabashini. This is one of the Shak=
ti Pithas. Its about a couple of hours journery from Kasi in the neighbouri=
ng district called Mirzapur.
=C2=A0
Actually there is so much to write abou=
t Kasi, I can go on and on. Just have an open mind from teh time you land i=
n Kasi. Take every experience, good or bad as a gift from the Almighty/Isth=
a Devata and you will surely cherish every bit of your stay there.

Dear All

First of all, wish every one of you a very very wonderful and=
 
fullfilling year ahead.
 Last week I had been on a trip to Kasi. It 
turn=
ed out to be a terrific trip for me. That city has a strange 
spiritual atm=
osphere unlike any other place I have been to. Just in 
case someone is pla=
nning on a trip to Kasi any time in the future, 
do not miss out of the fol=
lowing places/temples apart from the 
regular temples. The following are le=
sser know but really powerful 
places of worship which I came across during=
 my trip last week:

1) Chausat Yogini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temp=
le has one 
idol for the 64 Yoginis and an idol of Ma Kali. 

2) Temple of =
Lord Shiva as Kedareshwar in Kedar Ghat. An amazing 
temple. 

3) Sankata T=
emple near Schindhia Ghat. 

4) Bindu Madhav temple 

5) The temple of Gopa=
l where Anandamayi Ma used to worship. 

6) Kinnaram Baba's Ashram. There i=
s a dhuni in the ashram which was 
lit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a fune=
ral pyre and has been
 
burning continuously since then. The deity in Agni =
Rudra. Regularly 
wood from the mahasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordin=
ary people 
are not allowed to give any ahutis in that fire but one can sit=
 
close to it and meditate. I felt that ashram to be one of the most 
power=
ful places I had ever been to. 

Just thought of sharing the names of these=
 places I came across 
during my visit this time. 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
