Namaste Rajarshi, Narasimha and respected members,

Amazing messesges from =
Rajarshi and Narasimha. 14th may seems to be an important day:)

my 2 cent.=
..

My order of reading was first Gospel and then Leela Prasanga. The uniqu=
eness of Gospel is that its almost a day to Diary.

No book i've read gives=
 me the same feeling as Gospel. why? because, It instatntly takes you to Da=
kshineshwar and makes you sit in the sabha of the unbelievable Man. I feel =
Indebted to M for this work.
In my opinion 'The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna" =
is the most Authentic Autobiographical kind of account in the World.

***
A=
 person walking in Dhoti in Bangoli stayle and sometimes strolloing without=
 even that cloth, Asking Bangles and other jewellery to immitate Gopi, Jump=
 like a monkey to imbibe Hanumaan in his very being, cleaning ground with t=
he beard can easily make us belive that he is a Mad Man, a Phsyco, a crazy =
Man and then again he starts teaching which overpowers super brain of Vivek=
ananda. starts instructing the Scholars like VidyaSagar, Mahendranath Gupta=
. He removes the pride of Gauri without even debating. Then again he cries =
like child and asks everybody as to what will happen to his twisted arm. if=
 he will be cured or not, then again he dances like a storm in the kirtan a=
t Balaram's house, Then he cries when he doesnot see Naren even for few day=
s, he simply walks out of his room when asked by Authority of Temple and co=
mes back in the same manner without any noise when requested to come back, =
Tears rolls from the eyes of He and Naren when later one is about to ask th=
e permission for sanyaas, to whom even prositiutes salutes and curse Matur =
for planning to corrupt such a man, the man who explains deepest mystic tru=
ths in such a simple manner (for e.g. Brahma and Shakti are not different. =
they are like Milk and its whiteness, like Fire and its burning power, like=
 snake and its wringling motion), the man who looks with child's enthusiasm=
 and wonder, the crowd, the carriages etc.. on the street of calcutta, and =
again in the Samaadhi, frequently, unaware of the world and objectification=
s...

The Son of Kali, The man with uncountable moods and yet the most simp=
le.

The Kumbha Lagna with Sun, Moon and Mercury. All the 3 most important =
Lagna coinciding in the Philosophical Kumbha and who can be more focussed t=
hen such a person? and again complimented immensly with exalted Mars and ex=
alted Venus from both the sides. and Jupiter and Saturn from the Trines.He =
is also the delight of Astrologers.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

 after he mocked the Vedantic statement that all is god, in front of Ramakr=
ishna). Even his guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwaita and experienced =
nirvikalpa samadhi several times was, for the first time in his life, intro=
duced to the power of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri considered faith =
in saguna forms of god as childish and believed only in the formless Brahma=
n. But he left Dakshineshwar with a healthy respect for the Saguna forms. H=
e actually went inside the temple and prostrated before the idol before he =
left Dakshineshwar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when people started ex=
periencing different levels of spiritual bliss just by touching him. Everyo=
