 Q: Sri Bhagavan often says that maya [illusion] and reality are the same.
=
How can that be?

A: Sankara was criticised for his views on maya without b=
eing understood. He
said that

(1) Brahman is real,
(2) the universe is unr=
eal, and
(3) The universe is Brahman.

He did not stop at the second, becau=
se the third explains the other two. It
signifies that the universe is real=
 if perceived as the Self, and unreal if
perceived apart from the Self. Hen=
ce maya and reality are one and the same.

Q: So the world is not really il=
lusory?

A: At the level of the spiritual seeker you have got to say that t=
he world
is an illusion. There is no other way. When a man forgets that he =
is
Brahman, who is real, permanent and omnipresent, and deludes himself int=
o
thinking that he is a body in the universe which is filled with bodies th=
at
are transitory, and labours under that delusion, you have got to remind =
him
that the world is unreal and a delusion. Why?

Because his vision which=
 has forgotten its own Self is dwelling in the
external, material universe.=
 It will not turn inwards into introspection
unless you impress on him that=
 all this external, material universe is
unreal. When once he realizes his =
own Self he will know that there is
nothing other than his own Self and he =
will come to look upon the whole
universe as Brahman. There is no universe =
without the Self.

So long as a man does not see the Self which is the orig=
in of all, but looks
only at the external world as real and permanent, you =
have to tell him that
all this external universe is an illusion. You cannot=
 help it.

Take a paper. We see only the script, and nobody notices the pap=
er on which
the script is written. The paper is there whether the script on=
 it is there
or not.To those who look upon the script as real, you have to =
say that it is
unreal, an illusion, since it rests upon the paper. The wise=
 man looks upon
both the Paper and script as one. So also with Brahman and =
the universe.

Q: So the world is real when it is experienced as the Self a=
nd unreal when
it is seen as separate names and forms?

A:Just as fire is o=
bscured by smoke, the shining light of consciousness is
obscured by the ass=
emblage of names and forms,the world. When by
compassionate divine grace th=
e mind becomes clear, the nature of the world
will be known to be not the i=
llusory forms but only the reality.

Only those people whose minds are devo=
id of the evil power of maya, having
given up the knowledge of the world an=
d being unattached to it, and having
thereby attained the knowledge of the =
self-shining supreme reality, can
correctly know the meaning of the stateme=
nt `The world is real.' If one's
outlook has been transformed to the nature=
 of real knowledge, the world of
the five elements beginning with ether [ak=
asa] will be real, being the
supreme reality,which is the nature of knowled=
ge.

The original state of this empty world,which is bewildering and crowde=
d with
many names and forms, is bliss, which is one, just as the egg-yolk o=
f a
multi-coloured peacock is only one. Know this truth by abiding in the s=
tate
of Self.
