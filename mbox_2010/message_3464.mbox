Namaste,

If the logic of real numbers is used for complex numbers, no wond=
er one will have a "logical quandary".

You said "matter i=
s all that can be sensed (by the 5 senses)". I want to make a clarification=
 on this from the Upanishadic perspective.

In Vedic paradigm, senses do no=
t mean physical senses. Sensory organs (jnaanedriyas) are not part of the p=
hysical body (annamaya kosha), but part of the mental body (manomaya kosha)=
.

I may "see" a picture of Sri MahaLakshmi in front of me now. When I clos=
e my eyes and meditate, I may "see" something else. When I sleep and get a =
dream, I may "see" something else. The jnaanendriya of vision is a part of =
the mind and not body. It may connect to the physical eye and "see" some ob=
jects or connect to something else and "see" some other objects. In Upanish=
adic paradigm, we do not consider one of them to be superior to the other.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Instead of using the terms matter and proto-matter=
, let us use the word "dual consciousness" to describe all objects in the f=
ield of duality. This includes objects that can be perceived by the physica=
l senses ("matter" in your terminology) and objects that cannot be perceive=
d by the physical senses ("proto-matter" in your terminology).

The abstrac=
tion in Upanishadic paradigm is this:

There exists "non-dual consciousness=
", which is sat-chid-aananda (pure truth, pure awareness, pure bliss) as yo=
u say. This is represented by Shiva. Then there exists "dual consciousness"=
, which is represented by Shakti. Dual consciousness has boundaries and inf=
inite objects in it, while non-dual consciousness is undivided.
=C2=A0
Howe=
ver, if one takes the dual consciousness in its entirety, it is non-differe=
nt from non-dual consciousness. This fact is also represented by saying tha=
t Shiva and Shakti are in reality one and not two. If one self-identifies w=
ith the ENTIRE "dual consciousness", then one is absorbed in the dual-consc=
iousness in its entirety, which is non-different from non-dual consciousnes=
s. In other words, one is absorbed in non-dual consciousness. That is Nirvi=
kalpa Samadhi.

The problem is not dual consciousness. Dual consciousness i=
s identical to non-dual consciousness in the absence of self-identification=
 with any limited objects of dual consciousness. Hence the problem is not d=
ual consciousness, but the self-identification or I-ness or egosense or aha=
mkaara or asmitaa, to a limited aspect of dual consciousness.

=A0 *

A normal person's self-identification is symbolized by one's Kundali=
ni shakti. When Kundalini is asleep, one is instinctively identifying with =
a body-name-entity and stuck in the delusion of duality. As Kundalini wakes=
 up and starts rising, one's self-identification is refined further and fur=
ther. Some also say that one's shakti is getting purified further and furth=
er. Even when Kundalini is at Ajna or one of the chakras between Ajna and S=
ahasrara, one's self-identification is with a subset of dual consciousness =
and nor with the entirety of dual consciousness. There are still notions of=
 I and others, current time, past, future etc. When Kundalini is at Sahasra=
ara, we say that Kundalini shakti is perfectly purified. In other words, on=
e's self-identification is with the entire dual consciousness and there is =
no I and others, current time, past and future etc. One identifies with the=
 entire field of duality. Such a perfectly purified Shakti is non-different=

 from Shiva. This is depicted as a union between Shiva and Shakti.

I see no logical quandary. If you show the logical quandary in=
 the abstraction I presented, I can try to analyze and help.
=C2=A0
The pro=
blem is that nirvikalpa samadhi and Brahman were portrayed by some yogis (e=
.g. Buddha) in the past as a great void. Though that is true in a way, it c=
an also be described as "encompassing all" instead of "void".

      =

      
      Dear Narasimhaji,

 Thank you for your reply. I already know =
all this that you say - I am simply trying to draw you into explaining the =
logical quandary that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibly becaus=
e of my poor presentation) . Let me try once more to communicate more effec=
tively, this time I'll start from the basics as I understand them (please f=
eel free to negate/correct them).



To me, as I have understood whatever t=
exts I have read, that the ONLY source of consciousness, is Brahman. This h=
as exactly 3 attributes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is unconditional) , it =
is pure awareness and it is pure bliss. There is absolutely nothing else. T=
here is no sense of time, no sense of space, no sense of any boundary of an=
y kind (spatial, temporal etc). Because boundaries would mean duality (at t=
he very least). Consequently, there is no thought either - because thought =
has objects, and objects are objects because they are a boundary between so=
mething that is the object and something that is not the object.



So how =
do boundaries (e.g. thought) come about in the first place? See, Western th=
inking believes (and we unknowingly mix concepts) in matter and consciousne=
ss, where matter is all that can be sensed (by the 5 senses), and conscious=
ness is all that cant (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking goes deeper, and ef=
fectively divides consciousness into proto-matter (non-(5)-sensory matter -=
 everything from the gunas upto the mahabhutas) and pure/essential consciou=
sness (brahman). 



So, if you want to use Western thinking, you can say -=
 my sense of I and all my thoughts are in my consciousness. And you can get=
 away with this statement, no one in the Western style of thinking will eve=
r contradict you. But if you are to think the Vedic way, you cant say my se=
nse of I and my thoughts are in Brahman. Due to the above definition of Bra=
hman, every single thought or every single boundary you perceive or identif=
y, has to have a corresponding unique signature in proto-matter. Do you see=
 where I'm going with this? There is no thought or feeling or identity or u=
niqueness that's "just in the mind". Every single one must have a signature=
 i.e be a particular "configuration" of proto-matter. Consequently, at the =
immediate moment before you enter NVKS, when you say "I" went into NVKS, th=
e statement is a contradiction in itself. Because that "I thinking of enter=
ing NVKS" is nothing but a configuration of proto-matter - it is simply a p=
articular
 state of the sookshma sarira. When NVKS is achieved, all you can=
 say is - "I" disappeared - you cant say "I got a feeling of enlightenment"=
 . You will now say - that is exactly what I am saying with salt water doll=
 analogy. But I say to that - then how can you say "I" reappeared. If pure =
consciousness is just as I said above, when the "I" disappears, the entire =
sookshma sarira - essentially nothing but a configuration of proto-matter d=
isappears. Who can bring that back? Pure consciousness has no memory, no mo=
tive, no increase, no decrease, no identity, nothing - it is INVARIANT. The=
n, if that configuration of proto-matter (sookshma sarira) is to reappear (=
even if in a changed form "I got enlightened" ), it means there must be a m=
emory of it somewhere, which acted as the agent for "reincarnating" it. The=
 only logical place for that memory (according to the argument presented ab=
ove) is proto-matter itself. So unless there is some kind of new construct
=
 that I dont know about, it isnt possible for that very sookshma sarira to =
reappear. Consequently, if the physical body were to remain, it must mean a=
 brand new sookshma sarira got instantly attached to it. 



So I hope you =
get the point I'm trying to make - it is easy to sweep things under the rug=
 by doing a "deux ex machina" (http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Deux_ex_machi=
na), but this going in and out of NVKS isnt logically consistent with what =
NVKS is portrayed to be.



Please tell me how I am wrong



Regards

deep

ase answer this question (if you have the time) - I am going to ask it in a=
 very technical "computer sciencey" way so that you get the import of the q=
uestion I am trying to ask (which so far you have never answered): Lets say=
 you have a hypothetical camera that can take snapshots of everything mater=
ial (material in the vedic sense i.e. gunas and higher), then what has chan=
ged in a snapshot of a person immediately before they enter Nirvikalpa sama=
dhi (NVKS for short) and after, assuming the eventual goal is to "return" f=
rom NVKS? I do not include Brahman in any "snapshot" since it is non materi=
al and invariant anyway.

      <p>Dear Narasimhaji,<br>
 Thank you for your reply. I alrea=
dy know all this that you say - I am simply trying to draw you into explain=
ing the logical quandary that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibl=
y because of my poor presentation) . Let me try once more to communicate mo=
re effectively, this time I'll start from the basics as I understand them (=
please feel free to negate/correct them).<br>
<br>
To me, as I have underst=
ood whatever texts I have read, that the ONLY source of consciousness, is B=
rahman. This has exactly 3 attributes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is uncond=
itional) , it is pure awareness and it is pure bliss. There is absolutely n=
othing else. There is no sense of time, no sense of space, no sense of any =
boundary of any kind (spatial, temporal etc). Because boundaries would mean=
 duality (at the very least). Consequently, there is no thought either - be=
cause thought has objects, and objects are objects because they are a bound=
ary between something that is the object and something that is not the obje=
ct.<br>
<br>
So how do boundaries (e.g. thought) come about in the first pl=
ace? See, Western thinking believes (and we unknowingly mix concepts) in ma=
tter and consciousness, where matter is all that can be sensed (by the 5 se=
nses), and consciousness is all that cant (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking=
 goes deeper, and effectively divides consciousness into proto-matter (non-=
(5)-sensory matter - everything from the gunas upto the mahabhutas) and pur=
e/essential consciousness (brahman). <br>
<br>
So, if you want to use Weste=
rn thinking, you can say - my sense of I and all my thoughts are in my cons=
ciousness. And you can get away with this statement, no one in the Western =
style of thinking will ever contradict you. But if you are to think the Ved=
ic way, you cant say my sense of I and my thoughts are in Brahman. Due to t=
he above definition of Brahman, every single thought or every single bounda=
ry you perceive or identify, has to have a corresponding unique signature i=
n proto-matter. Do you see where I'm going with this? There is no thought o=
r feeling or identity or uniqueness that's "just in the mind". Every single=
 one must have a signature i.e be a particular "configuration" of proto-mat=
ter. Consequently, at the immediate moment before you enter NVKS, when you =
say "I" went into NVKS, the statement is a contradiction in itself. Because=
 that "I thinking of entering NVKS" is nothing but a configuration of proto=
-matter - it is simply a particular
 state of the sookshma sarira. When NVK=
S is achieved, all you can say is - "I" disappeared - you cant say "I got a=
 feeling of enlightenment" . You will now say - that is exactly what I am s=
aying with salt water doll analogy. But I say to that - then how can you sa=
y "I" reappeared. If pure consciousness is just as I said above, when the "=
I" disappears, the entire sookshma sarira - essentially nothing but a confi=
guration of proto-matter disappears. Who can bring that back? Pure consciou=
sness has no memory, no motive, no increase, no decrease, no identity, noth=
ing - it is INVARIANT. Then, if that configuration of proto-matter (sookshm=
a sarira) is to reappear (even if in a changed form "I got enlightened" ), =
it means there must be a memory of it somewhere, which acted as the agent f=
or "reincarnating" it. The only logical place for that memory (according to=
 the argument presented above) is proto-matter itself. So unless there is s=
ome kind of new construct
 that I dont know about, it isnt possible for tha=
t very sookshma sarira to reappear. Consequently, if the physical body were=
 to remain, it must mean a brand new sookshma sarira got instantly attached=
 to it. <br>
<br>
So I hope you get the point I'm trying to make - it is ea=
sy to sweep things under the rug by doing a "deux ex machina" (<a rel=3D"no=
follow" target=3D"_blank" href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_ex_mach=
ina">http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Deux_ex_machina</a>), but this going in=
 and out of NVKS isnt logically consistent with what NVKS is portrayed to b=
e.<br>
<br>
Please tell me how I am wrong<br>

swer this question (if you have the time) - I am going to ask it in a very =
technical "computer sciencey" way so that you get the import of the questio=
n I am trying to ask (which so far you have never answered): Lets say you h=
ave a hypothetical camera that can take snapshots of everything material (m=
aterial in the vedic sense i.e. gunas and higher), then what has changed in=
 a snapshot of a person immediately before they enter Nirvikalpa samadhi (N=
VKS for short) and after, assuming the eventual goal is to "return" from NV=
KS? I do not include Brahman in any "snapshot" since it is non material and=
 invariant anyway.<br>

> a) Is the Ahamkar=
a gone after they enter NVKS? If so, how do they return from NVKS, and who =
is this "they" anyway?<br>
> <br>
> b) If Ahamkara and consequently s=
ookshma sarira are still there, how are they different. <br>

 c) If they are not different, what quantity is it in the person that has g=
otten enlightened/ changed?<br>
