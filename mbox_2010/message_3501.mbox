 In 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also hearing about him fro=
m
others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pondicherry. Immediately upon my
=
arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the place. On August
15=
th of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of
t=
hree times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother=

to be powerful spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability=

to work on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible
ma=
nner. All of Aurobindo's philosophical writings cannot convey his or the
Mo=
ther's power as spiritual embodiments.

While I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I =
met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed
disciple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati M=
uni. As he was now and then
visiting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to=
 me the Maharshi and his
ashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along with t=
he reading of B. V.
Narasimhaswami's biography of the Maharshi, is what pro=
mpted my first visit
to Ramanasramam in 1933.

Before this second visit to =
Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan's
biography. In it I found a passag=
e relating to the possibility of changing
one's guru. I had a doubt about t=
his and addressed it to the Maharshi. He
told me, "Yes. Certainly. One can =
change his guru. What of that?"

In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a =
large extent, was regulated and
controlled. For instance, even to take a si=
mple trip into town we had to
obtain permission. In contrast, here in Raman=
asramam it was totally
different. I experienced a liberating feeling of fre=
edom, informality and
spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the sam=
e time elevating.

Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally per=
mitted to visit all
other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Ma=
harshi and Sri
Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the powe=
r to undo years
of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo were=
 effecting on the
psyche of their followers. In other words, they considere=
d the Maharshi too
powerful an influence. Bhagavan was aware of this and on=
ce when I was alone
with him he told me, "Yes, I know of that place. They a=
re afraid of me."

Leaving Aurobindo Ashram

I had been with the Mother and=
 Aurobindo for five years. During those years
they showered me with kindnes=
s and love, while guiding me on the spiritual
path. My gratitude and regard=
 for them compelled me to obtain their
permission and blessings before leav=
ing. This turned out to be much more
difficult than I imagined.

In Aurobin=
do Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or
questions=
 to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the
letters we=
re daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with the
Mother du=
ring the nights and promptly answer them in writing. Sometimes we
would see=
 the lights burning all night as they were engaged in this work.

Upon my r=
eturn from Ramanasramam I wrote a letter stating my desire to
receive their=
 blessings and permission to live at Ramanasramam. In the
letter to Aurobin=
do I wrote that since your yoga begins with
Self-realization, kindly permit=
 me to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes
only Self-realization, a state =
I have not attained, or may not even be
worthy of attaining. Aurobindo's re=
ply was affectionate, but negative in
regards to my leaving his ashram. He =
wrote, "Both Self-realization and the
supra-mental state can be simultaneou=
sly developed and achieved here. There
is no need for you to go there."

I =
was extremely disappointed at his response and consequently became
frustrat=
ed, restless and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights
and fel=
t distraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same
reque=
st. Again I was denied permission. It took a long five months and a
third l=
etter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their
permi=
ssion and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and
they =
saw no other recourse but to grant my request.

In Aurobindo's final letter=
 to me he wrote, "Since you are determined to
follow a path in which you ca=
n achieve only partial realization, we give you
our blessings, though we be=
lieve it would be better if you stayed on here
and pursued your sadhana whe=
re both the Mother and I can help you."

It was the rule in Aurobindo Ashra=
m that any letter written to or received
from Aurobindo should not leave th=
e ashram premises. So, to comply with this
rule, I burnt all my letters, ex=
cept the final letter I received from
Aurobindo. This I kept with the view =
of showing it to Bhagavan.

Settling at Sri Ramanasramam

During the early =
years there were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it
was mostly jungl=
e or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a
brahmin's house near =
the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would
sometimes cook small it=
ems in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere
outside, and somehow m=
anage without feeling inconvenienced.

Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a=
.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the
hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., retu=
rn to my room, come back again to the
ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until=
 8 p.m. It went on like this during the
first year. If possible, I would al=
ways sit close to Bhagavan so I could
hear all of his precious utterances.
=

S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that th=
e
Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness. Consequently, one day he
=
travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo
describi=
ng who he was, what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and where
he was=
 then residing (Sri Ramanasramam). Cohen later showed me the reply he
got f=
rom Aurobindo. It said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be
fulfill=
ed at Sri Ramanasramam, where he was then living.

I remember during my sec=
ond visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day
reading a lengthy book r=
eview from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was
Aurobindo's Lights on Y=
oga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of
this newspaper was Bh=
agavan's devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take
great interest in t=
he review and would occasionally stop reading and comment
on what he had ju=
st read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded
reading it, some=
one who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to
Bhagavan, "Thi=
s man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book
with him." Bh=
agavan turned to me and said, "Oh, is that so? Let me have a
look at it."

=
I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over to Bhagavan.
Im=
mediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept on reading it well
in=
to the night, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he finished it.

Whe=
n I came into the hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,
t=
elling me that a certain term used in the book might look like something
ne=
w, but it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and
su=
ch ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing
Aurobi=
ndo's philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood
Aurobindo'=
s philosophy both intellectually and also from the standpoint of
experience=
.

One evening I said to Bhagavan that the major attraction of Aurobindo's
=
teachings is that it professes that immortality of the body can be achieved=
.
Bhagavan made no comment.

The next day, as soon as I walked into the hal=
l and sat down, Bhagavan
looked at me and began saying, "In Kumbhakonam the=
re was one yogi, C. V. V.
Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of =
the immortality of the
body. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Ann=
ie Besant (a
distinguished public and spiritual personality in India) would=
 have to come
to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he=
 had a chance
to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died." This brief story clearly =
illustrated his
point.

On another day, not too long after settling near Sr=
i Ramanasramam, I
approached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showe=
d him that last
letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to =
give it to him to
read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo=
's handwriting, as
it was very illegible and only those who have studied it=
 for sometime could
read it. He said, "Give it to me. Let me try."

After l=
ooking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he
returne=
d it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came
to the=
 sentence, "Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can
achi=
eve only partial realization . . .", Bhagavan stopped me and said,
"Partial=
 realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is
realiza=
tion, it is not partial."

This was the final blow that silenced all my dou=
bts. I then destroyed this
letter, like all the rest. And because of all th=
e discussions I had had with
Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in =
his teachings, having a clear
understanding of where the Maharshi's path an=
d Aurobindo's path diverged and
went different ways. When all the clouds of=
 doubts and distractions
dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then k=
new that I understood and
the foundation work had been done. The purpose of=
 all our discussions were
served and so they stopped automatically.

I beli=
eve the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan was the power of his
presenc=
e. Much of what he taught had already been transmitted to the masses
down t=
hrough the ages. In Bhagavan we found a being that was surcharged with
the =
Reality to such an extent that coming into his presence would effect a
dram=
atic change in us.
