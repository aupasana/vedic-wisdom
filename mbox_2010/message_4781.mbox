Just to add to what I wrote earlier. The Shiva refered to by Shri Guru Gora=
kshanatha is the Parabrahman. The Shakti is Mula Prakriti. The same names m=
ean different things to different people/traditions.
So this Shiva is not t=
he same Shiva as one of the Trimurti.

In general anthropomorphism( includi=
ng the male female distinction) helps in the beginning but is not the ultim=
ate reality. One can read samskrita and translate- but the understanding ha=
s to come from the heart-For that it is the grace of the Guru and the Devat=
ha alone that is responsible.

Forgive me if I speak like a big man, I am j=
ust a beginner. Much of what I say, I repeat parrot like from what my Guru'=
s grace has enabled me to read.

idea behind all the male/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wro=

 Is this correct?
