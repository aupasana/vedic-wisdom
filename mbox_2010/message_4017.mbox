It may have been already deliberated many times, but, I had a doubt lingeri=
ng in mind still.

1. Siva is also reffered to as Bhakta sulabha (easy to g=
et for devotees) where as Vishnu is expected to test the devotee.

If we lo=
ok at our mythological stories, most daemons pray to Brahma or Siva and get=
 boons easily compared Vishnu.

Why is this?

2. Animal sacrifice - does an=
y of the Gods/Goddess actually want animal/human sacrifices? Even today, an=
imal sacrifices are going on for local grama devatas (like Poturaju, Marida=
mma, Pocamma etc.)

3. Praying to multiple Gods/Goddess as opposed to prayi=
ng to a single God/Goddess
Ramakrishna Paramahansa once told a devotee, tha=
t if he digged at one place, he would have got water as opposed to digging =
in multiple places.

I look at it differently (no dis-respect to the Takur)=
.

When we are digging a well, our final goal is to get water.
Here two opt=
ions are there:
Dig in muliple places or dig in the same place using multip=
le instruments (use spade for some time, then use a spear for some time, an=
d so on so).

Here praying to different Gods should be compared to digging =
in different places or digging with different instruments?

I felt, the fam=
ous argument against praying to multiple Gods is comparing it to digging in=
 multiple places.

While Kali, Krishna, Ram, Bhairava all are different for=
ms of God, they all are the one and only Brahman and are aware of the fact.=

If I am praying to Krishna with single intension of merging with Krishna, =
then praying to Ram may perhaps do not help me. If I am praying to Krishna =
with sole goal of overcoming my short comings and spiritual growth. In such=
 a scenario, does it matter whether I pray to Krishna/Ram?

I do recall the=
 discussion about visualising the image of the God and that we get mantra s=
idhi when the thought fills out mind. How ever, not all of us are fortunate=
 to visualise a clear image. Most often when I try to visualise Rama/Krishn=
a, a famous Telugu actor who used to play those roles come to my imaginatio=
n. I feel, I may be better of with out a visualisation.

I use a Shiv ling =
to invoke any God/Goddess along with fire.

Is sticking to one God/mantra i=
s really so critical?
