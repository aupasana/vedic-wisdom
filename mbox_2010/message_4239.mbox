 The continuous quest Who Am I?, guided by the grace of Sri Bhagavan, who i=
s
always with us, will lead one to the heart center, the seat of
Consciousn=
ess, which is neither within nor without, all pervading and
eternal. This s=
upreme awareness is all that IS, and abiding therein is the
ultimate goal.
=

Let us now have a look at recent developments in scientific knowledge. At
=
one time the world around us was supposed to consist of matter, made of
mol=
ecules and atoms. Physicists chased them further and broke them down to
nuc=
leus, electrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein said that
t=
he universe of our experience consists of matter and energy in a
space-time=
-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2, where C is
a cons=
tant representing the velocity of light. Matter and energy became
interchan=
geable.
Max Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a further dimensio=
n to
this, stating that it is consciousness that is fundamental and that ma=
tter
is a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time a=
re
only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are veering round =
to
the conclusion that since every object is a sum of its qualities and the=
se
qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter an=
d
energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of
consci=
ousness.

Yoga Vashista says: "All things that exist everywhere are experie=
nced by us;
there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced b=
y us."

Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real. It is real=
 as
Brahman or Consciousness. The world we see and experience with our sens=
es is
a product of the mind; the mind is a part of the ego, which rises fro=
m Pure
Consciousness, which is the same as Reality. One has to realize That=
 and
just Be.
