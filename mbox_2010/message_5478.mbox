Namaste,
 
In tradition, all rituals are avoided during eclipse. Temples also close during the eclipse. However, answer to your question is slightly nuanced.
 
Individualized consciousness is a microcosm, while the external universe is the macrocosm. They correspond to each other. The external Sun and Moon correspond to the individual soul and mind in the microcosm. They are the eyes of the individualized consciousness, through which various objects in the field of duality are "seen". When they are closed, one is in samadhi and does not see the objects in the field of duality.
 
When Sun or Moon are eclipsed externally and do not shine, the individual soul or mind are weak and do not shine in the microcosm. Such times are conducive to activities that need the individual soul and mind to be passive and silent, and unconducive to activites that need them to be active and alert.
 
If one is doing rituals - japam or homam or abhishekam or any ritual - for material purposes, then individual consciousness needs to keep its eyes open to the field of duality, seek some objects and reject some objects etc. So the eyes need to be wide open. Just as shooting an arrow (or a gun) at a target when there is a fly in the eye and you cannot keep the eye open is a bad idea, times when Sun or Moon are eclipsed are unconducive to doing such sadhana aimed at material results.
 
If the goal of one's sadhana is spiritual progress and self-realization, then one is aiming to close the eyes of individualized consciousness and stop seeing the objects in the field of duality. Then, eclipse time is very auspicious. Thus, japam or homam or other rituals conducted at the time of an eclipse are very auspicious and can even put a nearly ready sadhaka in samadhi. Practice any ritual you want to practice (e.g. homam to your ishta) and then close your eyes, keep the back straight, stop all physical movement and meditate on your ishta.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
