Namaste friends,

First of all Happy Viashakh Pournima (Budhha Pournima) to=
 all, Secondly, Guru and Shani are closely aspecting each other while Shani=
 is perfectly stationary - so all in all a wonderful time to start some ser=
ious saadhna on regular basis during these 6/7 days.

Narasimha will surely=
 excuse me some astronomy(logy) contents.

***
I was in the land of 'Mother=
 Jagadamba' for around 10 days and that land is Gujarat. I mean it because =
during my stay at my native village in Gujarat i unfailing observer followi=
ng things:
- Every where you will find name of 'Amba' - on Shops, on Signbo=
ards, written on Public carriers.
- One finds Pictures of Kali or Amba insi=
de State Transport buses
- So many small or big temples of mother Goddess.
=
- often people greet each other with 'Jai Mataji' or 'Jai Ambe'
- So many p=
eople visit 'Mota Ambaji' (alongside with Gabbar Hill) and especially on Bh=
adrapad Pournima.

It is truely a land of Mother.

***

I was told by a per=
son to do Homam on a big scale while in India. He specifically asked me to =
do Homam with Lots of wood, Cow dung etc=85 asked me to prepare Homa Kundam=
 with Bricks and cow dung. Everything was fulfilled yesterday at my native =
on Chaturdashi day where we could perform Chandi Homam in a Kundam prepared=
 by bricks and cow dung. Lot of wood was consumed and It was a Big fire whi=
ch could consume Mangoes, Saree and even Green Coconut.

So as Narasimha sa=
id else where, i thoroughly enjoyed doing Homam in front of 'big fire'. I w=
ish i could do such Homam regularly.

Best Regards,

Utpal
