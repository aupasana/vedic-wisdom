Namaskar,

> If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) and has some con=
trol over matter, it may be possible to menifest and unmanifest perishable =
physical bodies at will. Where does physical immortality stand in that cont=
ext?!

    Let me first set a common ground.
JeevanMukta =3D Freed from Act=
ion, while living
ParaMukta =3D Supremely free from reincarnation, full pow=
er over death

   Here is my understanding:
   Reincarnation happens becaus=
e the life-force in the astral body is bound by subtle desires, synonymous =
to obstructed nadis. There are 72 main astral nadis, 36 for involution and =
evolution respectively by duality.
   One who has perfected one of the 72 n=
adis is a Siddha and has a Siddhi, while one who has done so for all of the=
m is ParaMukta,
   Sushumna is considered the main one, and it is the one t=
hat imparts wisdom to a person so that he can live as JeevanMukta. The corr=
esponding involution Nadi is what causes the divinization of Physical body,=
 that is then seen as light.
   It is important, therefore, to perfect thes=
e two nadis before the remaining 70.
   Manifesting and unmanifesting the p=
hysical body at will is caused by another pair of Nadis.
   I don't have th=
e names of each of the 72 nadis, if somebody provides that information as w=
ell as functions of each of those nadis, it would be useful.
   The idea is=
 to liberate oneself from the sense of doership through RajaSuya yagna (Eff=
acement of Ego).

regards,
Aryama

A Siddha knows whats siddhi and for him there is no extreme, whereas an A-s=

dantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body=
 is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body a=

 we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physical bod=

a physical body from time to time. But, all this is governed by one's calib=
