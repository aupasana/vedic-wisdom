Good morning Mark



[ Dick,

      Thanks for the viewing. The thing I le=
arnered from Constitutional
Law is how to stay on point when their trying t=
o make it disappear. So
while reserching Ouantum Physics I dogged the point=
 everyone was
avoiding. An experiment to maximize the observers effect is i=
t, no
scientist has denighed that and I've put it in front of a lot. And th=
ere
has been not one negative comment, now The People are a different story=
.
They've got lots of negative stuff, which means they love it. They've
all=
owed me to make tremendous gains in presentation. Now I'm looking for
the g=
roup that gets the whole idea, and has no hierarchy keeping them
from talki=
ng about it.

       Dick I'd just love anything you've got after reading. =
Talk to you
soon.

Thanks, mark  ]





Good morning Mark,



Mine is a str=
ange story, and quite lengthy. One day I had a phone call
from the guy who =
had won the Nobel Prize for uniting two of the four
fundamental forces of t=
he physical universe (the electro weak force).
His name was Abdus Salam. He=
 was the founder and director of the
International Centre for Theoretical P=
hysics in Trieste. He wanted to
know if he could come to England and meet u=
p for a day. So we did at
Oxford. It was he, and a few other physicists and=
 cosmologists who first
asked me to write prose books. I said no thank you =
very much. I am not
even a writer.  But they kept on and on so eventually I=
 did. And all
hell broke lose, I knew it would :- )



I am not a physicist=
. I am a mystic. (their word not mine). From the age
of three (now seventy =
two) I had been having spontaneous mystical and
transcendent experiences. I=
 therefore started studying myself,
consciousness, depth psychology, and ot=
her people and society. One of my
major interest has always been politics (=
also music and chess). What I
found was/is amazing, and there is a lot of i=
t. It leaves Carl Jung in
Kindergarten. But just one of the things which I =
found is that
consciousness works the same way as does physics, and specifi=
cally found
to be so in particle annihilation, symmetry breaking and symmet=
ry
establishment. Folks seem to forget that WE are a part of all this set
u=
p. We are not something on the outside looking in. WE ARE IT. Along
with th=
is the paradigm seems to teach them that we are `given'
life. We are NOT gi=
ven life, WE ARE LIFE.



As to what can be proved of any of this by way of=
 scientific
investigation and experiments I don't know, we will have to wai=
t and
see. I am sceptical, but whilst always saying go for it, and see what=

can be discovered that way. It would be foolish not to. But I do steer
cle=
ar of quasi religionists in scientific garb. One day some guy wrote
to me a=
nd said he had put me on his scientific god prize list (check it
out for yo=
urself -  http://www.godprize.org/ <http://www.godprize.org/> 
) without as=
king my permission =96 most of the others are dead so they
cannot argue bac=
k. I would not have minded had it not been trying to
substantiate jesus blo=
ody christ et al, and the Roman socio-political
set up of two thousand year=
s ago. When I asked to be taken of it they
suddenly became very angry, rude=
 and aggressive. I steer clear of
priestcraft and their myrmidons of puppet=
s that give them power. Along
with this I am aggressively active against In=
ternational Corporate
Monopoly Capitalism. My idea of how politics ought to=
 be is so way out
of the radar of existing ideas that I would place it some=
where about two
thousand years in the future.  When I was three I felt sure=
 that I had
been born either on the wrong world or the right world at the w=
rong
time. I still feel like that seventy years later :- )



So, I am not =
the most popular critter that ever walked the face of the
globe. Probably o=
ne of the most unpopular.  And like Plato said
(although I do not agree wit=
h what he said in most things) it is as
though they are living in some kind=
 of dark cave and taking shadows on
the wall as the reality.  So, there you=
 go :- )))) That is a brief
synopsis.



Why don't you get your people toge=
ther and start a chat group and
thrash out an agreeable language for starte=
rs. Everybody on this planet
speaks a different language. That is no damned=
 good. In the meantime the
world will not come right until people get thems=
elves right first.
Man's stupidities will not be eliminated until such time=
 that Man
comes into a better understanding of his mysterious consciousness=
, and
from whence it comes. The Mind and Consciousness of Man is ever tied =
to
the cross of Time and Eternity.  This is not an hypothesis or a
speculat=
ion =96 IT IS SO and it is there to be found deep within us in
the very gro=
und of our cognitive being, where Time cannot encroach upon
its encompass. =
But you try telling them these things and you will be
laughed off the plane=
t, as yet. Homo Ensophicus is coming. But not yet.
They do not want Homo En=
sophicus here, for there is no profit in that.
Tell your countrymen these t=
hings, for they are all dead over here.



Dick Richardson
