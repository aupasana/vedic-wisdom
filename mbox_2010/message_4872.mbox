|Om Brihaspataye Namah|

Dear Narasimhaji and other members, 
Namaste and H=
are Krishna, 


What is the correct sanskrit pronunciation of namah/namaha?=


I hear some priests say "namaHA" while some say "namah" Are these two sep=
erate words? Do they have different meanings? 


Any help will be much appr=
eciated. 

Best wishes,  
Bivash
