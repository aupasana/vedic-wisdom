Dear everyone, 

I have just realized that geeta in the chapter karma yoga,=
 constantly talks about yagna (homa?) as the main activity and also asserts=
 that whoever is not doing homa is just adding his karma all the time. 

Fo=
r instance, 3.9 states that 

"yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmaban=
dhanah
 tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara"

which roughly trans=
lates to "karmas other than those for yagna (homa) are only going to increa=
se the bondage and hence you should only that karma that is meant for yagna=
".

Now this in arjuna's case means that he should just do the war, as that=
 is his yagna! 

In my case, does that mean that I should leave my job as a=
 software engineer and keep doing homas, and chanting vedam as that is my v=
ihita karma as I am a brahmin by birth? 

Verse 13 also goes to say that I =
am only eating sin if I am doing something outside of vedam to get my bread=
, which I am clearly doing by working as an IT professional in the USA! Doe=
s this mean that we should all leave what we are doing and go back to our n=
ative places and keep doing our kula vritti as defined by our vihita karmas=
 as defined by our scriptures? I am very confused and need PVRjis help to u=
nderstand this better. 

Nagraj
