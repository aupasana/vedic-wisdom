Dear Hari,

I hope you'll not mind me repsonding.

Narasimha has mentioned =
following in the last post:
[>One can do pitri tarpana on everyday during t=
his fortnight and >forget all other criteria]

I remember that in one of hi=
s earlier posts, he clearly mentioned that during "Shradhdha Paksha", one c=
an do pitru tarpana everyday with Balck seasame seeds overlooking all the e=
xceptions mentioned in the manual.

Best regards,
Utpal
