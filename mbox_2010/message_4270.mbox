 18-9-45 Afternoon

A group of Bengalis have come. One of them has recently=
 lost a child. He put
the question to Bhagavan, "Why did that child die so =
young? Is it his karma
or our karma that we should have this grief?"

Bhaga=
van: The prarabdha which the child had to work out in this life was
over an=
d so it passed away. So we may call it the child's karma. So far as
you are=
 concerned, it is open to you not to grieve over it, but to remain
calm and=
 unaffected by it, being convinced that the child was not yours but
always =
only God's, that God gave and God took away. And in this connection
Bhagava=
n took out the Yoga Vasishta in English to refer to the story of
Punya and =
Pavana. Strange to say, when he casually opened the book, it
actually opene=
d at the story he had in mind. And from the book he asked me
to read out th=
e portion where Punya advises his brother Pavana not to grieve
foolishly ov=
er the death of their parents, pointing out that Pavana had had
innumerable=
 births in the past, in each one of which he had a number of
relations and =
that exactly as he is not mourning for the death of all those
relations now=
, he should not now mourn for the death of their father either.

The visito=
r asked, "When a person dies while yet a child and another lives
long, whic=
h of them is the greater sinner?"

B: I cannot say.

I told the visitor tha=
t the data he had given could not by themselves enable
anyone to judge whic=
h was the greater sinner.

Visitor: If a person lives long, he has greater =
chances of perfecting steps
to reach realisation.

B: The person dying youn=
g may soon be reborn and have in that life better
chances of striving towar=
ds realisation than the other person living long in
this life.

A visitor a=
sked, "When it is said that we must renounce all activities, is
it meant th=
at we should reduce our activities as much as possible?"

B: By giving up a=
ctivities is meant giving up attachment to activities or
the fruits thereof=
, giving up the notion `I am the doer'. The activities for
going through wh=
ich this body has come, will have to be gone through. There
is no question =
of giving up such activities, whatever one may or may not
like.
