Namaste
I read some post about Brahmacharya and feel it is as important as =
other things like being Truthful, honest, fearless, not of hoarding type, s=
urrender to God, dependent on God etc ... 

These are the things stated in =
gita sholka. It appears to me that we never talk much about other things bu=
t focus more on Brahmacharya, is it that we are very sensitive to a very na=
rrow definition of it?

May be a way to look at it is to attach less import=
ance or look more deeply and in a broader way. We need to look in the light=
 of a person whether he or she is a celibate monk or a householder and acco=
rdingly there could be slightly different ways of looking at it.

In all ho=
nesty the defination of Brahmacharya is lot more broader and deeper, it is =
just not about sex, semen and lustful thoughts in the mind. Most of the tim=
e we gravitate towards a narrow defination only.
I did read once the deeper=
 and broader definition but it escapes my mind. It has something to do with=
 the thoughts in mind.

For a householder in order to continue the kula or =
the family lineage
one needs to have children, for this there is nothing wr=
ong if breaking Brahmacharya.  

Also a house holder has some more complexi=
ty as there is a better half :-)

It is true that both celibates and marrie=
d people have realized god and overcome duality. Many Celibates have fallen=
 down due to failing to keep the vow, some are caught and some live there w=
hole life with 
Dhambha (pretension) and cheating almighty god and themselv=
es.

I do agree that for men semen and its preseravation and ojas etc
is im=
portant no arguments there ... 

may be someone more knowledgeable will she=
d more deeper and broader meaning on Brahmacharya.

Best Regards
Mitesh
