  SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI=
 SIVANANDA (MESSAGE 4)

Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.

----------=
-- --------- ---

Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of Tapas is h=
ighly deprecable.
This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is condemn=
ed by Lord Krishna
in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It i=
s an instrument for
Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body=
 is not kept strong
and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil =
as attachment to
sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana =
of Sadhus and
Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana=
 of worldly
persons.

Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult=
 to get rid of the
Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. Th=
e feeling, "I am a
great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhimana. The body =
of a Sannyasi, who
has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a publ=
ic property. He has
no claim on it because he denies the existence of body =
and tries to feel
always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public will take care =
of his body.

Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe austerities, gave u=
p food and yet
he was not able to attain the goal. He heard the song:

"Fai=
r goes the dancing when the Sitar's tuned,

Tune us the Sitar neither low n=
or high.

And we will dance away the hearts of men

The string o'erstretche=
d breaks and the music flies,

The string o'erslack is dumb and music dies,=


Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high."

Then he ate food, adopted the m=
iddle path and succeeded in achieving
Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at=
 all necessary for attaining
perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Va=
iragya born of strong
discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practi=
ce of severe
austerities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by=
 way of rigid
Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas=
. Have a
strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prep=
ared to
give it up at any time for a noble cause.

The care-taker of the ho=
rse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is
over-worked, when it is ailin=
g. Then only it is ready for further work. Even
so, this body should be inj=
ected with proper nutrition. Then only it will
turn out good work. Then onl=
y it will soon regain its lost vitality on
account of overwork or ailment. =
Work will suffer if the body is not well
attended to. When the body grows o=
ld it must be well-protected against cold
and well-looked after. If hard Ti=
tiksha is practised now, it will give way
soon. Consequently, the other sho=
re of immortality and fearlessness cannot
be reached.

O Ram, neglect not t=
his body. The society and Prakriti will extract and
continue to extract as =
much work as possible from those selfless workers who
have dedicated their =
lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to
service till the last b=
reath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs
Prahlada, "My dear Prahlad=
a! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body.
Rise from your Samadhi. Se=
rve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide."
Yoga Vasishtha speaks of =
one as a "Maha Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has
renounced the idea of "I am=
 a Tyagi" and "I am a Vairagi", who neither
accepts nor rejects things that=
 come by themselves by identifying himself
with the silent witness, the Imm=
ortal Atma, who feels always "I am Akarta
(non-doer)", "I am Abhokta (non-e=
njoyer) " even while moving amidst objects.
The Gita says, "But the discipl=
ined self, moving among sense-objects, with
senses free from attraction and=
 repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to
Peace." Chapter II-64.

Some neop=
hytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" or "Maha
Bhogins=
" and quote scriptures also: "We eat without tongues; we see without
eyes".=
 The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like
the =
people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and
quote =
Gita:=97"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam
Kleda=
yantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=97"Weapons cleave him not, nor fire
burneth=
 him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away". Sublime
philosophy ind=
eed of perverted people with perverted intellects! The gilted
ornaments can=
not shine for a long time. The crow that shines under borrowed
feathers of =
the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas
will burst o=
ut and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite without
difficulty.

A Ma=
ha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup
of m=
ilk when they come by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He
will n=
ot say, "I have enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk." If an
aspirant is=
 seriously ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if
there is =
a feeling of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to
purchase =
milk, if any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk,
he should=
 not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his
devotees by wo=
rking through the minds of various persons.

The child sometimes eats food =
at night while he is sleeping. If the mother
asks the child in the morning.=
 "Baby, you took food last night," he replies,
"I have not taken anything l=
ast night. You are playing and joking with me."
Such is the condition of a =
Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He
eats and yet he does not eat=
. He eats without a mouth and smells without a
nose. Sometimes a man talks =
at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he
comes to waking consciousne=
ss, "O Prema! Do you know that you talked last
night when you were dreaming=
?" He replies "I do not remember anything." Such
is the state of a Jeevanmu=
kta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.

Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet h=
e said, "I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do
not eat anything. I take grass juice on=
ly", because he identified himself
with the Atma who is always the witness =
and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is
regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though=
 he was with Radha, Rukmini and
Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his w=
ife, "My beloved! Say unto the
river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, =
has commanded you to give path
of way. She will at once yield and you can c=
ross it without a boat." She
repeated the words of her husband and crossed =
the river immediately. She was
quite amazed at the words of her husband and=
 asked him, "My Lord! You are
living with me and yet you say that you are a=
 Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck
with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain t=
his philosophy." Tiruvalluvar
replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have realised=
 this through direct cognition
(Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the s=
ilent witness. The senses,
body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I a=
m entirely distinct from
them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife understood the nature =
of the soul and then she
became silent.

Ordinary aspirants with delicate h=
ealth should not take recourse to the
practice of drastic austerities. He w=
ho has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any
kind of Tapas because his body is ad=
amantine. If an aspirant with delicate
health gives up food and tries to li=
ve on neem leaves alone, the obvious
result is that he will get various sor=
ts of gastro-intestinal diseases and
pass away soon. This is the fruit obta=
ined by persons who practise Tamasic
Tapas.

If you have mastery over the p=
air of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you
can bear intense heat and int=
ense cold, if you can remain without clothing
in the icy Gangotri, this is =
highly creditable indeed. But if your frame is
delicate, if you attempt to =
stand before the sun in summer for some hours,
if you throw off your clothi=
ng in the Gangotri all at once, you will die
immediately of sunstroke or pn=
eumonia. You should not attempt to take
recourse to these hard practices. W=
hat little you will gain by Japa and
meditation in this birth will be lost,=
 and you have lost one chance given by
the Lord in this birth to reach him =
by your foolish practices or Tamasic
Tapas.

An aspirant gave up his clothi=
ng all at once. He developed rheumatism,
malaria, enlarged spleen and died =
within a short time. During the period of
sickness all cravings that were t=
emporarily suppressed asserted themselves
with re-doubled force. He became =
a slave of the tongue. He craved for many
varieties of food. He could not s=
uppress them. He ate indiscriminately and
died of acute diarrhoea.

An aspi=
rant said, "I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for
some y=
ears. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, "I am immortal
Atma". I =
have got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive
is pure.=
 I will attain self-realisation. " He actually committed the
abominable act=
. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures?
Certainly not. T=
his is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea
of the nature o=
f true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of
their masters for=
 some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get
salvation by takin=
g to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure.
They cannot enter=
tain the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of committing
the act. Horrible=
 thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will
have to share obvi=
ously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).

The mind should gradually be weaned off=
 its old habits and cravings. If you
cut off all at once its pleasure centr=
es, it will get puzzled. That is the
reason why young aspirants who take to=
 too much Vairagya commit the ignoble
act of committing suicide. You should=
 train the mind in meditation gradually
and make it taste the inner bliss. =
Gradually it will leave off its old
habits and old cravings and you can get=
 yourself established in true
Vairagya.

The more the Viveka, the more the =
true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya
gradually grows in the garden of Anta=
hkarana from the understanding that the
world is a mere appearance and full=
 of miseries and that Brahman alone is
the only reality full of knowledge a=
nd bliss, and through continued practice
of meditation and association with=
 the realised souls for a protracted
period. Eventually, all objects of the=
 world appear before the dispassionate
soul as trifling or worthless things=
. He will not give up his new spiritual
life even if the wealth of the whol=
e world is offered to him.

Aspirants should give up those articles of food=
 which they like best for
some time. They should discipline all the Indriya=
s in a perfect manner. They
should always lead a simple life. They should a=
lways eat simple food. But
they should not become slaves of Vairagya. Abhim=
an Vairagya is a mental
state. The Lord infuses this in his devotees in ord=
er to get rid of the
clinging to sensual objects.

May you all become Maha =
Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from
the canker of Vairagya Ab=
himana!

May you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya!!

May you all atta=
in Kaivalya or perfection!! !

Real Vairagya

There was a Sannyasi at Benar=
es. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat
and cold. In summer he used=
 to stand in the sun for some hours. In winter he
used to stand in the Gang=
es for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of
grass. He shunned wooden co=
ts.

On one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. S=
ri Ram
provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the co=
t. He
asked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day.=
 It was
extremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed t=
o get for
the Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.

Sri Ram said: "S=
wamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is
raining now in torren=
ts. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in
any way. You are an=
 advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body
lies on a bed of gr=
ass or on a cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I must
have my usual bed=
 of grass only. You must bring it anyhow."

Attachment to Vairagya is as mu=
ch an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is
a means for attaining wisdom o=
f the Self. It is not the goal itself. A
Jeevanmukta or realised sage has n=
either Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him
a little dry bread alone, he is q=
uite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you
give him best sweetmeats, milk =
and fruits, he will not refuse, but he will
not be elated by good food. He =
always takes delight in his own Self only,
but not in external objects. Thi=
s is the test to find out whether a man has
attained realisation or not. A =
worldly man is much troubled when he cannot
get the right kind of food whic=
h he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains
palatable dishes. A realised s=
oul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes
and dislikes.

Suka Deva was =
tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate
for some days. =
He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees
served him an=
d gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.

Obviously, t=
he Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained
equanimity=
 of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even
after sever=
al years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from
all sorts o=
f attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not
attain Sahaja=
-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent
to all kind=
s of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the bed of grass or
a beautif=
ul cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.

He who is endowed w=
ith equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha
Tyagi or Maha Bhogi=
 in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but
it is extremely di=
fficult to keep the evenness of mind.

Some Sannyasins who are working for =
the public good make resolves: "We will
not travel in trains. We will walk =
only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc.
We will not use fountain pens or =
watch." These are not desirable resolves.
This is not the real nature of Va=
iragya. They are also attached to Vairagya.
This is another kind of defect.=
 They want to do service. If they move in
cars or trains, if they keep the =
body strong and healthy, they can do more
service in a short space of time.=
 Those who do much writing-work can turn
out much work if they use a founta=
in pen. Foolishness assumes various forms.
This is one kind. It does not le=
ave even educated persons or cultured
Sannyasins.

Some Sannyasins practise=
 Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and
respect. But God knows the =
motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner
Ruler. You cannot deceive H=
im.

Where is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where t=
here
is no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not
r=
enounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed=

the objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the
=
objects of the world even though he shows externally that he is a great
Vir=
akta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small
wood=
en bowl only in his hand?

Raja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People =
reported that the city of
Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affec=
ted. That is real Vairagya.
He alone can be called a real great Virakta.

Y=
oung aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take
ad=
vantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be
practi=
sed only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings.
Begi=
nners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and
Vai=
ragya to the very letter and spirit.

May you all transcend Raga and Vairag=
ya and attain knowledge of the Self.
May you all understand the true nature=
 and Swaroopa of Vairagya.

Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollabl=
e mind is restrained. Ripe
Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss an=
d strong dispassion for
anything other than Atma.

If one considers the pos=
ition and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a
cow, then only he has d=
eveloped a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting
dispassion is not Vair=
agya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainment
of Self-realisation.
=

It is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause =
or
other. But by having dispassion for all objects at all times, one will g=
et
knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the G=
uru,
by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.

Do not fall=
 a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young
and well-a=
dored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to
attain Sel=
f-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.

Devotion, dispa=
ssion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation.
Dispassion is=
 desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of
the heart and=
 so everybody has this Atma.

Light on Vairagya

Vairagya is born of Viveka=
, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal
and non-eternal) , Sat a=
nd Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa.
Viveka comes through disinte=
rested selfless service done in several births
and through Puja and Aradhan=
a, and through the Grace of the Lord. From
Viveka is born Vairagya. It give=
s spiritual strength.

A man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. I=
t is like a straw. So
Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspir=
ants. Vairagya produces
concentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates bur=
ning Mumukshutwa, strong
yearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Releas=
e.

Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, the=
re is
Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are =
one.
Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Pat=
anjali
Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoi=
sm),
Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). Firs=
t,
there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmit=
a,
and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, =
the
clinging to this life.

Vairagya is of different types or degrees=97Mri=
du, Madhyama and Teevra (mild,
moderate and intense). Intense Vairagya only=
 will help the aspirant to stick
to this path. If it is of a dull type like=
 Smasana Vairagya or Prasava
Vairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to g=
et back the objects that were
renounced previously, and the aspirant will g=
et a downfall. He will not be
able to climb again to the heights he formerl=
y reached. So aspirants should
be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a=
 mild type, they should try to
make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya =
comes through looking into the
defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is=
 not real happiness. It is
illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed wi=
th pain. So again and again
by looking into the defects of sensual life, Va=
iragya dawns. It should be
strengthened through study of spiritual books, S=
atsanga, Vichara and
enquiry.

Simply living in nudity and eating neem leav=
es, and drinking cow's urine
does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya sh=
ould be born of
discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is =
weaned from
sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=97Thanumanas=
i=97 and then
only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have t=
o make enquiry.
Physical nudity and these external things will not constitu=
te real Vairagya.
Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All thes=
e objects do not
give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorr=
ow. Such deep
enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, =
produces
lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps =
him to do
real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a=
 break to
the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards=
 objects,
at once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual =
enjoyment
is the cause
for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is te=
rribly afraid, and
gradually through intense practice, it is established in=
 real, lasting,
sustained, intense Vairagya.

Vairagya is of two kinds also=
: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para
Vairagya comes after one attains S=
elf-realisation. The whole world then
looks like a straw. That is intense s=
piritual strength. That is Para
Vairagya.

Without Vairagya there cannot be=
 any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it
is the only vital, fundamental =
Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other
virtues will come by themselves. P=
atanjali Maharshi says "Abhyaasa
vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=97"The mind=
 is controlled by meditation or
Sadhana and Vairagya." They are the two win=
gs of the aspirant to soar high
into the realm of Immortal Abode. The same =
thing Lord Krishna also says.
"Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihya=
te"=97"The mind is controlled by
practice and Vairagya, dispassion, intense=
 detachment." By Vairagya, the
mind is detached. He who works in a detached=
 way is not bound by Karma. So
it is aspirants' duty to cultivate this one =
virtue, or Sadhana-anka,
Vairagya.

Vairagya is doubtless a mental state wh=
erein the mind does not run into
sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, to=
wards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a
kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Va=
iragya. Even amidst the temptations
of the world, she had mental Vairagya t=
hrough Vichar and wisdom. So she was
not affected in the least by the attra=
ctive objects of the world, even
though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her hu=
sband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the
forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was n=
ot established in Vairagya. He
was attached to the body, he was attached to=
 his Kamandalu. A man may be
attached to any one object.

You see a Vairagi=
. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he will fight for
a rupee if he f=
inds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. This is his
mental state. So by=
 external appearance you cannot tell that one has
Vairagya. Vairagya is a m=
ental state. Sri Ramanuja does not belong to this
extreme type of Vairagya=
=97wearing only a rope around the waist. He was amidst
luxurious things, bu=
t his mind was not polluted. He had that mental state of
Vairagya, detachme=
nt, indifference, born of Viveka.

Lord Krishna says that He is not in favo=
ur of extreme asceticism.
"Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah=
, mam chaivantassareerast
ham tan vidhyasuranischayan ."=97"They torture al=
l the elements in the body
and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha=
 also tortured his body, and
later on he found out that there was not much =
spiritual progress; and then
he came to the golden medium, the middle path.=
 So we should go by the middle
path always. The body is an instrument for a=
ttaining Self-realisation.
Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the=
 bones. So you should not
torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body=
 you should have. You
should not expose the body to chill. God has given co=
mmon sense. So you
should practise "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm=
 in taking good,
healthy food. Every man has got a different physical const=
itution. You
should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and i=
f you cannot
sit for a long
time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavan=
aprash or some fruits. You
should have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya interna=
lly and at the same time
follow the middle path externally.

Generally, asp=
irants say: "I have given up umbrella."=85 "I take only one
meal." Their wh=
ole Sadhana is: "I have given up shirt."=85 "I have given up
sweater."=85 "=
I have given up shoes."=85 "I live only on bread and dhal." Their
Sadhana c=
onsists in "giving up"=97give up this, give up that. Real spiritual
life do=
es not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or
taking. Th=
e only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you
are very =
hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of
milk. Va=
iragya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It
will hur=
l you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.

At the present mome=
nt, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a
great Vairagi. For the=
 last so many years he is living without clothing in
the icy region and he =
sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a
very good descriptio=
n of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a
wonderful man and made =
him his Guru.

Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Ri=
shikesh. He was
very much liked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Mal=
aviaji once took
him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was r=
aining, and
Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi=
. Vairagi is
a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all o=
ver the body
and make the hair look golden, and they wear a very thick rope=
, of the size
used for drawing chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In La=
kshman Jhula
there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a p=
hysical body.

There is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra=
 Swami. He lived
on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves=
 that are thrown
out by others after meals. "Avadhootas" are naked people. =
They have no
clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his min=
d of all
Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. B=
rahmendra
Swami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha' s Guru and S=
wami
Krishnananda' s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food=
, and
Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to mak=
e
severe tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong bod=
y
and lived an austere life.

<p>SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANAN=
DA (MESSAGE 4)<br><br>Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.<br><br>------=
------ --------- ---<br><br>Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of =
Tapas is highly deprecable. This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This =
is condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the =
Lord. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana i=
f the body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as muc=
h an evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This=
 Abhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than th=
e Abhimana of worldly persons.<br>

<br>Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canke=
r. It is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is=
 the body-idea. The feeling, "I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi" is =
Vairagya Abhimana. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the se=
rvice of humanity, is a public property. He has no claim on it because he d=
enies the existence of body and tries to feel always: "I am Siva (Sivo=
ham)". The public will take care of his body.<br>

<br>Lord Buddha tor=
tured the body, did severe austerities, gave up food and yet he was not abl=
e to attain the goal. He heard the song:<br><br>"Fair goes the dancing=
 when the Sitar's tuned, <br><br>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high=
. <br>

<br>And we will dance away the hearts of men <br><br>The string o&#=
39;erstretched breaks and the music flies,<br><br>The string o'erslack =
is dumb and music dies, <br><br>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quo=
t;<br>

<br>Then he ate food, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achi=
eving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all necessary for attaining per=
fection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimina=
tion. All bodies are not fit for the practice of severe austerities. The bo=
dy will drop down if you tax it too much by way of rigid Tapas. Do not spoi=
l your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, b=
ut have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to give it up at any time f=
or a noble cause.<br>

<br>The care-taker of the horse feeds it with proper=
 nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. Then only it is ready=
 for further work. Even so, this body should be injected with proper nutrit=
ion. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only it will soon regain it=
s lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Work will suffer if the =
body is not well attended to. When the body grows old it must be well-prote=
cted against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titiksha is practised now,=
 it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore of immortality and fe=
arlessness cannot be reached.<br>

<br>O Ram, neglect not this body. The so=
ciety and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract as much work as pos=
sible from those selfless workers who have dedicated their lives to the ser=
vice of humanity. They are yoked to service till the last breath leaves the=
ir bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, "My dear Prahlada! Enough o=
f your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people =
now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide." Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as=
 a "Maha Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced the=
 idea of "I am a Tyagi" and "I am a Vairagi", who neith=
er accepts nor rejects things that come by themselves by identifying himsel=
f with the silent witness, the Immortal Atma, who feels always "I am A=
karta (non-doer)", "I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) " even while =
moving amidst objects. The Gita says, "But the disciplined self, movin=
g among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction and repulsion maste=
red by the Self, goeth to<br>

Peace." Chapter II-64.<br><br>Some neop=
hytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" or &qu=
ot;Maha Bhogins" and quote scriptures also: "We eat without tongu=
es; we see without eyes". The thief or the hypocrite will be found out=
 soon. They are just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to sa=
tisfy their palates and quote Gita:=97"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nain=
am Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=97&=
quot;Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor =
wind drieth him away". Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people w=
ith perverted intellects! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time=
. The crow that shines under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found=
 out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander =
can detect the hypocrite without difficulty.<br>

<br>A Maha Tyagi or Maha =
Bhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they com=
e by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He will not say, "I h=
ave enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk." If an aspirant is seriou=
sly ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeli=
ng of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to purchase milk, i=
f any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk, he should not re=
fuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his devotees by working t=
hrough the minds of various persons.<br>

<br>The child sometimes eats food=
 at night while he is sleeping. If the mother asks the child in the morning=
. "Baby, you took food last night," he replies, "I have not =
taken anything last night. You are playing and joking with me." Such i=
s the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats an=
d yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells without a nose. S=
ometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes =
to waking consciousness, "O Prema! Do you know that you talked last ni=
ght when you were dreaming?" He replies "I do not remember anythi=
ng." Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi=
.<br>

<br>Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, "I am a Nitya=
 Upavasi. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only", because he =
identified himself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjo=
yer. Lord Krishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Rad=
ha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, "My be=
loved! Say unto the river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has command=
ed you to give path of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it wit=
hout a boat." She repeated the words of her husband and crossed the ri=
ver immediately. She was quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked=
 him, "My Lord! You are living with me and yet you say that you are a =
Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain th=
is philosophy." Tiruvalluvar replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have=
 realised this through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I=
 am the silent witness. The senses,<br>

body, mind and intellect are my in=
struments. I am entirely distinct from them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife=
 understood the nature of the soul and then she became silent.<br><br>Ordin=
ary aspirants with delicate health should not take recourse to the practice=
 of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of=
 Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an aspirant with delicate health =
gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is=
 that he will get various sorts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away=
 soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.<br=
>

<br>If you have mastery over the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold,=
 if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, if you can remain without c=
lothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly creditable indeed. But if your =
frame is delicate, if you attempt to stand before the sun in summer for som=
e hours, if you throw off your clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you wi=
ll die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to tak=
e recourse to these hard practices. What little you will gain by Japa and m=
editation in this birth will be lost, and you have lost one chance given by=
 the Lord in this birth to reach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic T=
apas.<br>

<br>An aspirant gave up his clothing all at once. He developed r=
heumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died within a short time. During th=
e period of sickness all cravings that were temporarily suppressed asserted=
 themselves with re-doubled force. He became a slave of the tongue. He crav=
ed for many varieties of food. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscrim=
inately and died of acute diarrhoea.<br>

<br>An aspirant said, "I hav=
e not realised the Self though I did meditation for some years. I am going =
to commit suicide with the Bhava, "I am immortal Atma". I have go=
t full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive is pure. I will=
 attain self-realisation. " He actually committed the abominable act. =
Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. Thi=
s is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature of =
true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters for s=
ome time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taking =
to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot enterta=
in the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of committing the act. =
Horrible thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to sh=
are obviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).<br>

<br>The mind should gradual=
ly be weaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once it=
s pleasure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspir=
ants who take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing sui=
cide. You should train the mind in meditation gradually and make it taste t=
he inner bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings=
 and you can get yourself established in true Vairagya.<br>

<br>The more t=
he Viveka, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually gro=
ws in the garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a =
mere appearance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only rea=
lity full of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditat=
ion and association with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventu=
ally, all objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trif=
ling or worthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even i=
f the wealth of the whole world is offered to him.<br>

<br>Aspirants shoul=
d give up those articles of food which they like best for some time. They s=
hould discipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always l=
ead a simple life. They should always eat simple food. But they should not =
become slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord inf=
uses this in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual ob=
jects.<br>

<br>May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you al=
l be free from the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!<br><br>May you all possess =
true lasting Para Vairagya!!<br><br>May you all attain Kaivalya or perfecti=
on!! !<br>

<br>Real Vairagya<br><br>There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He wa=
s a great Titikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand=
 in the sun for some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for so=
me hours. He used to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.<br>

=
<br>On one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sr=
i Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot=
. He asked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. =
It was extremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to=
 get for the Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.<br>

<br>Sri Ram s=
aid: "Swamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining n=
ow in torrents. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way=
. You are an advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on=
 a bed of grass or on a cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I =
must have my usual bed of grass only. You must bring it anyhow."<br>

=
<br>Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagy=
a is a means for attaining wisdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A=
 Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give hi=
m a little dry bread alone, he is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If =
you give him best sweetmeats, milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he w=
ill not be elated by good food. He always takes delight in his own Self onl=
y, but not in external objects. This is the test to find out whether a man =
has attained realisation or not. A worldly man is much troubled when he can=
not get the right kind of food which he likes best. He rejoices when he obt=
ains palatable dishes. A realised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above =
likes and dislikes.<br>

<br>Suka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remain=
ed without food at the gate for some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he w=
as taken to the harem. Ranees served him and gave him best food. He remaine=
d unaffected. This is wisdom.<br>

<br>Obviously, the Swami who wanted a be=
d of grass at Mussoorie had not attained equanimity of mind and Self-realis=
ation. He was attached to Vairagya even after several years of spiritual pr=
actice. He was not completely free from all sorts of attachments because he=
 was attached to Vairagya. He did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural stat=
e wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein th=
e sage would sleep on the bed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and=
 pillow with the same feeling.<br>

<br>He who is endowed with equanimity o=
f mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasisht=
ha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it is extremely difficult to keep =
the evenness of mind.<br><br>Some Sannyasins who are working for the public=
 good make resolves: "We will not travel in trains. We will walk only.=
 We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not use fountain pens or watch=
." These are not desirable resolves. This is not the real nature of Va=
iragya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect.=
 They want to do service. If they move in cars or trains, if they keep the =
body strong and healthy, they can do more service in a short space of time.=
 Those who do much writing-work can turn out much work if they use a founta=
in pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one kind. It does not le=
ave even educated persons or cultured Sannyasins.<br>

<br>Some Sannyasins =
practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God kn=
ows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot d=
eceive Him.<br><br>Where is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in secl=
usion, where there is no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when=
 one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he h=
as not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the=
 mind for the objects of the world even though he shows externally that he =
is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keepin=
g a small wooden bowl only in his hand?<br>

<br>Raja Janaka was amidst reg=
al enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, =
he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a =
real great Virakta.<br><br>Young aspirants should be very careful and cauti=
ous. They should not take advantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Ma=
ha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal =
vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their resolves of Truth, =
Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and spirit.<br>

<br>M=
ay you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. Ma=
y you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.<br><br>Vaira=
gya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairag=
ya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything =
other than Atma.<br>

<br>If one considers the position and happiness of Br=
ahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed a real lasting V=
airagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help th=
e aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.<br>

<br>It is common to =
have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or other. But by =
having dispassion for all objects at all times, one will get knowledge of t=
he Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion =
to him, and by practice of what he instructs.<br>

<br>Do not fall a victim=
 of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and well-adored fas=
hionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain Self-realisa=
tion. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.<br>

<br>Devotion, dispas=
sion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Dispassion is =
desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and =
so everybody has this Atma.<br><br>Light on Vairagya<br>

<br>Vairagya is b=
orn of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-ete=
rnal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes th=
rough disinterested selfless service done in several births and through Puj=
a and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vair=
agya. It gives spiritual strength.<br>

<br>A man of Vairagya has no attrac=
tion for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaust=
ible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, Samadha=
na, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Em=
ancipation, or Release.<br>

<br>Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever th=
ere is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is d=
islike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important =
afflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avi=
dya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhiniv=
esha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. Fr=
om this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and fr=
om Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.<br>

<br>Vairagya i=
s of different types or degrees=97Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderat=
e and intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to stick to th=
is path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya,=
 the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that were renounce=
d previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not be able to =
climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants should be care=
ful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try to make it=
 moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into the defects=
 of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is illusory, t=
ransient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again by looking=
 into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthene=
d through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.<br>

<br=
>Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow's uri=
ne does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of discrimina=
tion, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoym=
ents and rendered thin like a thread=97Thanumanasi=97 and then only the Vai=
ragya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make enquiry. Physical n=
udity and these external things will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vai=
ragya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us l=
asting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, aga=
in and again, persisted in for a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya.=
 It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It=
 makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert te=
ndency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects, at once it will =
point out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause<br>=


for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gr=
adually through intense practice, it is established in real, lasting, susta=
ined, intense Vairagya.<br><br>Vairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya=
 and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation=
. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intense spiritual streng=
th. That is Para Vairagya.<br>

<br>Without Vairagya there cannot be any re=
al spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana=
. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjal=
i Maharshi says "Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=97"=
The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya." They ar=
e the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal Abo=
de. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vai=
ragyena cha grihyate"=97"The mind is controlled by practice and V=
airagya, dispassion, intense detachment." By Vairagya, the mind is det=
ached. He who works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspir=
ants' duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.<br>=


<br>Vairagya is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run in=
to sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai rule=
d a kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the tempta=
tions of the world, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So s=
he was not affected in the least by the attractive objects of the world, ev=
en though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to th=
e forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He=
 was attached to the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be a=
ttached to any one object.<br>

<br>You see a Vairagi. His whole body is sm=
eared with ash, but he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupe=
e to another Vairagi. This is his mental state. So by external appearance y=
ou cannot tell that one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Raman=
uja does not belong to this extreme type of Vairagya=97wearing only a rope =
around the waist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not poll=
uted. He had that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born =
of Viveka.<br>

<br>Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme a=
sceticism. "Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chai=
vantassareerast ham tan vidhyasuranischayan ."=97"They torture al=
l the elements in the body and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord B=
uddha also tortured his body, and later on he found out that there was not =
much spiritual progress; and then he came to the golden medium, the middle =
path. So we should go by the middle path always. The body is an instrument =
for attaining Self-realisation. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives i=
n the bones. So you should not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the=
 body you should have. You should not expose the body to chill. God has giv=
en common sense. So you should practise "common sense Sadhana". T=
here is no harm in taking good, healthy food. Every man has got a different=
 physical constitution. You should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you=
 are weak and if you cannot sit for a long<br>

time in one Asan, you can t=
ake a little Chyavanaprash or some fruits. You should have extreme or "=
;Teevra" Vairagya internally and at the same time follow the middle pa=
th externally.<br><br>Generally, aspirants say: "I have given up umbre=
lla."=85 "I take only one meal." Their whole Sadhana is: &qu=
ot;I have given up shirt."=85 "I have given up sweater."=85 =
"I have given up shoes."=85 "I live only on bread and dhal.&=
quot; Their Sadhana consists in "giving up"=97give up this, give =
up that. Real spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. Ther=
e is no giving up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give lenienc=
y to the mind. If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddal=
ies and a small cup of milk. Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give le=
niency to the mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally=
 vigilant.<br>

<br>At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in G=
angotri. He is a great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living wit=
hout clothing in the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai B=
ahadur Modi gave a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He fo=
und him to be a wonderful man and made him his Guru.<br>

<br>Avadhoot Kesa=
vananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much li=
ked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Muss=
oorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to=
 bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram=
 Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the ha=
ir look golden, and they wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawi=
ng chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vair=
agi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.<br>

<br>There=
 is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on =
Gomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out=
 by others after meals. "Avadhootas" are naked people. They have =
no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all V=
asanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra =
Swami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha' s Guru and Swami K=
rishnananda' s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food, =
and Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to make =
severe tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong body =
and lived an austere life.<br>
