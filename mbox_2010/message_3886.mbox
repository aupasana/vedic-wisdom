Utpal ji and Rajarshi ji

Vimalananda says in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva
=

"This is one of the many reasons I hate communism .Communists are taught t=
o forget their parents ,culture to denounce them .If you destroy your paren=
ts and culture which is your root how do you ever expect to prosper "


1.I=
 agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated entities with p=
arties hell bent on atheism which wait for a chance to use any occassion to=
 denigrate sanatana dharma. I do not wish to deviate the discussion but int=
eresting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by daya=
nidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of =
Communist ideology) and in today's speech he used the cover of this occasio=
n to once again lash out at dharma.

The same Karunanidhi also lashed out a=
t Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which =
is praised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles every day with=
 so called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That i=
s the media war of modern India controlled by vested interests who would lo=
ve to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are=
 the missionary orgs.





2.In Nithyananda's defense he never said he was =
god . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was ve=
ry simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies=
 are not involved it does not become a addiction. 

He could very well be r=
epaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. 

Two of his guru=
s were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube v=
ideo on divine consciousness and feminity.


3.Like Narasimha ji pointed ou=
t , he has a very good way of explaining higher level truths.


What he did=
 or did not do is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything fr=
om his lectures or messages.

and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When =
we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be=
 prepared when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share =
of the karma others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when ou=
r turn comes.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
