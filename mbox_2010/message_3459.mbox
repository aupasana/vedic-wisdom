Rajarshi,
Your samskaras are really good.Every spiritual aspirant dreams wh=
at you have experienced in reality.
Regarding Manish its better not to type=
 or utter anything with this foul body.But you or Narasimha pass on my shra=
dha and pranams to him.
Vedic Wisdom group got sanctified along with you.

individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are tal=
king about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora =
is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It =
is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don't. Which is o=
k. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respe=
ct for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken t=
his path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths=
 were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a m=

figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thou=
sands of years ago. But to go about it and=A0actually be able to do this sa=
dhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or r=
ules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=A0and l=
et Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patie=
nce. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature wi=
ll one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individu=
al=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=A0kind.=A0 In th=

> Back=
 to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manis=
h said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available=
 on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking t=
owards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anyw=
here on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a=
 pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wo=
ndering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally=
 chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smoo=
th. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other =
side who chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, "Some=
times a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your bre=
eches".
> =A0
> As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderfu=
l place.=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind was already=
 pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning wh=
en we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pr=
essure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and=
 said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are st=
ill here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of=
 Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=A0=
Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and th=
at person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita G=
hat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.
> =A0
> Back to=
 midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But =
this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking fo=
r a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but =
they respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the sams=
han. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different ch=
itas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of yea=
rs there has not been a single minute when there has not been a body burnin=
g in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one =
chita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega =
size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit ther=
e, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said =
let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but th=
ere is something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we
>  went to ano=
ther side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=A0k=
aun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the =
dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make=
 space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Mani=
sh said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, =
but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instruct=
ing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something ve=
ry unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected,=
 but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sa=
dhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes =
have either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and t=
hus they do not disturb. 
> =A0
> The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =
was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =
was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=
inutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=
 because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose thi=
s specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense=
 perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Eve=
ry now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently =
for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, =
everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the =
dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt =
a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being s=
uch an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of =
the Chandi path=A0I could hear
>  chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relativ=
es wailing as new bodies were being brought in. 
> =A0
> Suddenly to my rig=
ht there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting.=
 The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddes=
s was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting o=
f the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi=
 was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages of the=
=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=A0I loo=
ked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shad=
ow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept=
 chanting with more vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=A0 Manish =
later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make h=
is/her presence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination but real=
ity and this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere=
. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.
> =A0
> While offering coconuts into t=
he fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stic=
k which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece insid=
e.I wondered if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I stran=
gely felt natural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered=
 if=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I wo=
uld happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Man=
ikarkina!=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one ext=
ra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood wh=
y.
> =A0
> In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the rel=
atives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body was=
 in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait =
any more. It was already late in the night. The person did not know what to=
 say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil=
 or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the perso=
n was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relati=
ves came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Man=
ish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the =
middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corp=
se=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a =
sight to see!
> =A0
> There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=A0at the=
 end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives no=
t to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Man=
ish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=A0asked if they could pour =
some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will =
happen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of wa=
ter but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, af=
ter some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi=A0samne kha=
di hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reve=
ntially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0Manish's feet, but M=
anish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distribute=
d some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very lat=
e in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addr=
essed earlier) came
>  running with tears in his eyes asking for forgivenes=
s for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he ha=
s done no wrong, everything is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was s=
ome other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of =
tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certa=
in saint (a famous saint)=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respon=
ding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=
=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night. T=
he faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so unique,=
 that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educated=
'=A0people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the simpl=
e and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. =
Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my head to my heart, the=
re was nothing
>  below, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply float=
ing on thin=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one w=
ord reply, "Good".
> =A0
> =A0
> =A0
> As we were walking back from Manikar=
nika Manish suddenly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Ma=
nikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but d=
oes not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman t=
o come and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, u=
nless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would =
not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, wh=
en we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, =
looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me=
 that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at th=
e samshan. "She has desire, but directionless." At that time there was noth=
ing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing =
some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no go=
od,=A0so that you are ready when

=A0
> After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=A0we stood and observe=
d Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, spec=
ially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish=
 smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms r=
ecognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, won=
dering what is going on.
