Probably, Ravana is rakshasa and all rakshas are devotees of shiva (includi=

Namaste,

Is there a deeper significance to Ravana being such a great devotee of Shiv=

How much purity is enough and fo=
r what purpose ? Ravana brought the Shiva linga from Shiva himself, Baidyan=
ath Jyotirlinga, whose sacredness is sufficient proof of purity of Ravanas'=
 sadhana and his success with mantras.

There is a list of Ravanas' works:
=
http://www.ancientindianastrology.com/cmsa/index.php?option=3Dcom_content&v=
iew=3Darticle&id=3D99:ravanas-contributions&catid=3D31:general&Itemid=3D70
=

While Ravana is portrayed as a villain in an ethical sense than any other,=
 he certainly wielded more power, by virtue of his knowledge of Veda and Ma=
ntra, than all other characters in the story combined except Hanumaan who w=
as Rudra Avatara and used all his divine powers to turn the face of war.

>=
 But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in the end!

Even the cit=
y of dwarkapuri fell after Krishna, and Krishna succumbed to a mortal wound=
, but nobody decries his folly that led to this fall. Rama is no different =
than parashurama - because on earth, a great person is one who subdues his =
enemies by force.

regards,
Aryama

 There is a saying in sanskrit, "Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas ga=

 Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literally hund=
reds would benefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is what make=

of Astrology for 20+ years, and continue to use it for guidance for the fut=
ure, but do not expect predictions would come true as there are factorial 1=
2! x 9! factorial permutations and combinations to deal with, virtually mak=
ing it impossible to predict correctly. But for a trained eye and the learn=
ed gurus, and for those who have focused more on the good lord to seek the =
knowledge (with total discipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditiona=
lly), this art becomes a science as they acquire "vak-suddhi";
 AND they ar=
