 A FROG lived in a well. It had lived there for a long time. It was born an=
d
brought up there. And it was a small little frog. One day another frog th=
at
had lived in the sea came and fell into that well.

The frog of the well=
 asked the new-comer,"Whence are you?" The frog of the
sea replied, "I am f=
rom the sea." The frog of the well questioned:

"The sea! How big is that?"=
 The frog of the sea said, "It is very big." The
frog of the well stretched=
 its legs and questioned, "Ah! Is your sea so
big?" The frog of the sea sai=
d, "It is much bigger." The frog of the well
then took a leap from one side=
 of the well to the other, and asked, "Is it
as big as this,my well?" "My f=
riend=94, said the frog of the sea,"how can you
compare the sea with your w=
ell?"

The frog of the well asserted: "No, there can never be anything bigg=
er than
my well. Indeed, nothing can be bigger than this! This fellow is a =
liar, he
must be turned out."

Such is the case with every narrow-minded ma=
n.

Sitting in his own little well, he thinks that the whole world is no bi=
gger
than his well.
