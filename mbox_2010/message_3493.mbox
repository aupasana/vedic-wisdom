I must thank the owner of this group for explaining how to do homam
i was wondering how to do it and it was a blessing to find this group
as I happen to have a cow which i feed with grass from our own farm which is pure vegeterian and with out any artifical medicine
i have made cakes to size of 6 cm diameter
if anyone wants to have cow dung cakes i will send it to them at the least cost
i will start with rs 1 per cake + courier charges which will be rs 12 per kg within tamilnadu and more for other indian states + shipping cost may be rs 10 per kg
i will sell only to this group members
Maha
