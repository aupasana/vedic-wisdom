Murthy garu,

Thank you so much for the reply. You are very true. God is e=
verywhere in every atom and only our ego is blinding our eyes in seeing him=
. As you said, I will try my best not to concentrate on those trivial thing=
s and rather put my thoughts on God. Visiting Varanasi and able to spend so=
metime there is our past good karma and we shouldn't waste it with our feel=
ings. I don't hate those people who try to cheat but only the unhygienic pa=
rt makes me sick. But I will sure remember your words next time. 

Thanks a=
gain.

Regards,
Padmaja.

 Make yourself modified, transformed to contain such unclean environment, a=

w much importance should we give to the cleanliness of the holy places like=
 Haridwar, Varanasi etc? When I visited those places I find it very hard to=
 concentrate on God especially while taking bath in the sacred Ganges. I co=
uldn't bear the scenes of dead bodies floating in the river. I am not a yog=
i to be able to see God even in the trash and garbage and my mind is still =
attached to this physical world. I know how holy those places are but for m=
e cleanliness is very important. How can I change my thinking and get benef=
ited from pilgrimages?
