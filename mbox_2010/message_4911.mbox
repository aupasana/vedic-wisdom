Pranaam Narasimha,

[[[Shiva's words on Kunjika Stotra do NOT say that it =
is equivalent to
reading Chandi.]]]

Please explain the meaning of:

Na Kav=
acham Naargalaastotram Keelakam na Rahasyakam|

Na Suktam Naapi dhyaanama c=
ha na nyaaso na cha vaarchanam||

"Kunjika paathmatren Durgapaathphalam lab=
het"
***

Please do not misunderstand me here. The verse which you mentione=
d -
"Raama raameti raameti..." was the one which i have ignored and objecte=
d
till now. I have always maintained that this perticular verse can not
rep=
lace Vishnu's 1000 names. its a excuse from escaping the chanting of
sacred=
 Vishnu Sahastranaama.

If you read my previous post, I've mentioned that i=
 objected when my
father said that he would read only Kunjika instead of th=
e whole Chandi
Paatha. I had told him then that its a smart but self foolin=
g excuse
people give to escape the recitation of chandi Paatha. They would =
use
only 2 minutes in reciting Kunjika Stotra and save 1 to 1.5 hours
minim=
um which will be used for more important work such as watching a
Movie, str=
olling in a Garden with family, super-sticking to  a TV Soap
or a reality s=
hows like a worm, gossiping for hours on
Salamankhan-Katrina kaif breakup, =
 and such uncountable more important
activities.

and all that because scri=
pture adds just a one word and that is "Shiva
Uvaacha"

I still maintain an=
d it'll not change in future that there can not be
short cuts for Chandi Pa=
atha, Vishnu Sahastranaama but you need to
explain these word "Shiva Uvaach=
a" clearly. This has amounted in to a
real gross misunderstanding with peop=
le.

As I wrote earlier - That is completely true but only for a deserving =
or
it's just a corruption added for a convenience of a lazy lot which
most =
of us are when it comes to God.

Yours,

Utpal

i is correct - Shiva's words on Kunjika stotra do NOT say that
it is equiva=
lent to reading Chandi. If one wants a short version of
Saptashati, one can=

Unfortunately, there are no
shortcuts that really work. Especially one weig=

needs to put in an intense effort to remove materi=

Then
one can mentally chant the above verse or just chant "shrI raama raama=

raama". That can be done by the mind no matter where one is and what one
i=
