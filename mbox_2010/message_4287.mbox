Dear Sir,

All the great rishis and leaders of both Dwaita and Advaita are =
aware of the Vedas.  In the Vedas and Upanishads is written that God is one=
 and that only vipras say there are many--why then do all the great realise=
d ones and teachers ask us to pray to different Gods instead of the one Sup=
reme Lord - Nirguna Brahman.  Saguna Brahman is represented by the Trinity =
=3D Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.  Lord Brahma is our creator- our father- =
all the Devas, manushyas and Rakshasas being derived from him yet we do not=
 Worship our father.  Should not a son be closest to his father? 

Please c=
larify>>>>

Yours truly,

Rajendra
