Dear Dick,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Thank you very much! I know, I was jus=
t looking them over, you really stood out in that crowed. I've put it in fr=
ont of the best minds I could find, from the get go. Nobodies even trying t=
o blow any holes, and just like you there is really nothing else to say. So=
 I know this is a blueprint to get there for others also, because thought i=
s the only thing left. So have no doubt, they'll have to shut the Internet =
down to stop this, and they might already be too late. I'll find the hundre=
dth monkey or just help a lot of people, so I'm excited to have this new jo=
b=C2=A0in my sixty first year. I'll post you of any windfalls.

Thanks for =
receiving me and understanding,
mark=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0
