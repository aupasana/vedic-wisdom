I cam across this date mentioned in the Jaimini Mahabharata, Ashwamedha Par=
va, Chapter 64 of the day when Yudhisthira conducted his Ashwamedha yajna.
=

Vasant Ritu, Chaitra Month, Shukla Paksha, Dashami, Guru-vasara, Aashlesha=
 Nakshatra.

In the next chapter, Chapter 65, Krishna says that three month=
s from now (that is from the date when the yajna was performed) Kaliyuga wi=
ll begin.

The tradionally accepted date of advent of Kaliyuga is 23rd Jan =
3102 BC Gregorian calender (reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yu=
ga)

I tried to enter this date for Kaliyuga in JHora and moved back by thr=
ee months but could not come to the above mentioned date of Dashami, Chaitr=
a month, Thursday etc.

Anyone interested in commenting on the above?
