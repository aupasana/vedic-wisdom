Namaste Nagraj,

Thank you for the nice discussion so far.

Serious sadhana=
 defeats all bad tendencies eventually. Sin or no sin, liquor
is not essent=
ial for us. If you have to drink because of friends or some
other reason, j=
ust say Ram or Shiva naam before, during, and after each sip.
Apply a since=
re restriction on quantity and make no compromises. Eventually
you'll be in=
toxicated in sadhana and need no drinks at all whether to
socialize or to g=
ive excellent performances.

-Kishore
