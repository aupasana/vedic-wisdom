Yes, I mean rituals one may do individually or as a part of a group, e=
ither at home or at a temple or another public place. Archana and abhisheka=
m performed by a priest at a temple are also included.

If you want to remo=
ve a small rock blocking the road, a small amount of energy may be sufficie=
nt. If a big boulder is blocking the road, one cannot push it away just lik=
e that. One has to keep exerting force and push it persistently. Similarly,=
 small problems are easy to solve. But most people now-a-days are bogged do=
wn by serious kaarmic blockages that require a lot of effort to overcome.

=
Of course, if a superman is available to you to help, he may push the bould=
er in a second. But there are hardly any supermen anymore.

In the old days=
, many priests existed who did intense sadhana, became enlightened and were=
 like walking fire. Also, many temples existed, where such priests, great y=
ogis and rishis did sadhana and left great energy. Thus, big kaarmik proble=
ms could also be solved with one pooja, one homam, one abhishekam, one visi=
t to a temple etc.

Such priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not e=
xpect one pooja, one archana, one homam or one abhishekam to solve problems=
.

However, little bit at a time adds up over time. If you keep doing sadha=
na (pooja, archana, homam, abhishekam etc) regularly, it will slowly add up=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha

 Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikel=
y to cause any considerable material or spiritual benefit. Given the kind o=
f kaarmik blockages most people have, persistent sadhana over a period of t=
