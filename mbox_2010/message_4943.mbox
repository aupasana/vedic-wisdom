christ the redeemer voted as one of the seven wonders of the world
look at =
wikipedia says

Brazil
In Brazil there was a campaign Vote no Cristo (Vote =
for the Christ) which had 
the support of private companies,  namely teleco=
mmunications operators that 
stopped charging voters to make  telephone cal=
ls and sms messages to vote.[18] 
Additionally, leading corporate sponsors =
including Banco Bradesco and Rede Globo 
spent millions of reais in the eff=
ort to have the statue voted into the top 
seven.[3] Newsweek reports the c=
ampaign was so pervasive that:
=E2=80=9C One morning in June, Rio de  Janei=
ro residents awoke to a beeping text message 
on their cell phones:  =E2=80=

city buses and echoing on TV infomercials that featured a r=

celebrity posing next to the city=E2=80=99s trademark Christ =
the Redeemer  statue.[3] =E2=80=9D 

According to an article in Newsweek, a=
round 10 million Brazilians had voted in 
the contest by early July.[3] Thi=
s number is estimated as the New7Wonders 
Foundation never released such de=
tails about the campaign.
they made income by charging for incoming interna=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] FW: Manufacture and marketing=
 of Shoes with Hindu 
deities

   
To Whom It May Concern;

Recently, I bec=
ome aware that Your company, Converse is selling sports shoes 
with colorfu=
l images of Hindu deities which should be regarded as sacred and 
treated a=
s such on the outside of them.

These pictures you may call as =E2=80=98Hin=
du deities=E2=80=99. However, for us they are forms 
and most sacred repres=
entations of the Ultimate Truth, The absolute ideals 
through which we call=
 parabrHMam as =E2=80=98God=E2=80=99. They are the object of worship by 
mi=
llions of people whom you may call =E2=80=98Hindus=E2=80=99.  We look upon =
these deities as 
the Ultimate TRUTH, the Absolute one, in your words the =
=E2=80=9CGod=E2=80=9D Himself.

Thus, we view this latest episode of sellin=
g shoes with these pictures as a 
blatant denigration of oldest living Spir=
ituality from which all the religions 
originated. Therefore, I like to poi=
nt out to you that your actions are very 
insulting to all =E2=80=9CHindus=
=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CHinduism=E2=80=9D. It is extremely hurting the pace =

loving people, the so-called Hindus all over the world.

It is puzzling to=
 us how a reputed company like Converse can be so irresponsible 
and childi=
sh to put such pictures on the shoes. If you are very much interested 
in d=
oing so, i.e., putting pictures why do not you put a picture of Christ or 
=
Mohammad on the shoes and see what happens? I am sure you will not put a pi=
cture 
of the Cross or Jesus Christ or Virgin Mary or Mohammed on any of yo=
ur product, 
especially on shoes.

Your intention may not have been to hurt=
 us, but that is what you did. You hurt 
sentiments of a large part of the =
citizens of this world who are very peace 
loving. Your company=E2=80=99s a=
ctions victimized the adherents of the oldest 
Spirituality of the world. I=
t might have been an oversight and perhaps a case of 
an overenthusiastic m=
arketing department. 


Therefore, on behalf of the Billion-plus people of =
the world, I request you to 
do the following: 

(1) immediately stop the s=
ale of these shoes all over the world.
(2) Destroy the manufactured shoes 
=
(3) Stop future production of shoes of this nature.
(4)Train your employees=
 in cultural sensitivity training program and let them 
understand the impo=
rtance of respecting sentiments of other cultures. 

(5) Issue and Publish =
a statement of apology. Last but not least, 
(6) Teach the basics of the ol=
dest living Spirituality to at least the top 
management of your company. I=
 am willing to come and teach them that.
 
I am confident that Converse man=
agement will address this matter with utmost 
urgency.  I look forward to f=
urther word from you. 

  
Sincerely,


Rajyalaxmi
