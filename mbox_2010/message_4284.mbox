 The truth about happiness and suffering, which has been correctly
determin=
ed by the wise, is this: Outwardness of the mind is suffering; its
inwardne=
ss is happiness.

The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance wit=
h their past deeds
=E2=80=93 their prarabdha karma. Whatever is destined no=
t to happen will not happen,
try how hard you may. Whatever is destined to =
happen will happen, do what
you may to prevent it. This is certain. The bes=
t course, therefore, is for
one is to be silent. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Upades=
a to this Mother in 1898)

If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unin=
termittently, until the Self
is gained, that alone would do. As long as the=
re are enemies within the
fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if t=
hey are destroyed as they
emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands. (W=
ho Am I?)

He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most exce=
llent
devotee. Giving one=E2=80=99s self up to God means remaining constant=
ly in the Self
without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than =
the thought of
the Self. (Who Am I?)

The mind will become quiescent only b=
y the enquiry =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99. The thought
=E2=80=98Who am I?=
=E2=80=99 will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for
stir=
ring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then,
there=
 will arise Self-realization (Who Am I?).

As long as there are impression =
of objects in the mind, so long the enquiry
=E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 is =
required. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and
there in the =
very place of their origin through enquiry. (Who Am I?).

Whatever burdens =
are thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power
of God makes all =
things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to
it, constantly =
worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and
how, and what s=
hould not be done and how not? (Who Am I?)

Just as the pearl-diver ties a =
stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of
the sea and there takes the pear=
ls, so each one of us should be endowed with
non-attachment, dive within on=
eself and obtain the Self-Pearl. (Who Am I?)


Other than enquiry, there ar=
e no adequate means. If through other means it
is sought to control the min=
d, the mind will appear to be controlled, but
will again go forth. (Who Am =
I?)

Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are n=
ot
different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine
=
through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. (Who Am I?)


=
Inquiring into the nature of one=E2=80=99s self that is in bondage, and rea=
lizing
one=E2=80=99s true nature is release. (Who Am I?)

By the strength o=
f meditation (i.e, by the strength of Self attention)
abiding in the state =
of being which transcend meditation, alone is the truth
of supreme devotion=
 (pure parabhakti). (Upadesa Undhiar,9)

Through the senses=E2=80=99 gross =
desires, we have become submerged in a false world
of drams. Destroying the=
 mind=E2=80=99s resultant accumulation of suffering in the
fire of vigilant=
 awareness, the holy truth of the mantra Sivaya Namaha
establishes itself w=
ithin as we eat in joy and celebrate the blessed Pongal
festival. (Sri Rama=
nanubuthi, 240)

Enquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self, Medita=
tion consists in
thinking that one=E2=80=99s self is Brahman, Existence-Con=
sciousness-Bliss. (Who AM
I?).

Abiding in the Heart of being whence we spr=
ang is the path of action of
devotion, of yoga and jnan. (Upadesa Undhiar, =
10)

As there is no consciousness (chit) other than existence (sat) to know=

Existence itself is being consciousness. So we are verily consciousness.
(=
Upadesa Undhiar, 23)

What is called the world is only thought. When the wo=
rld disappears, i.e.,
when there is no thought, the mind experiences happin=
ess; and when the world
appears, it goes through misery. (Who Am I?)

Remai=
ning quiet is that is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to
resolve =
the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future
happening=
s and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight. (Who Am I?)

When one =
enquires the form of mind without forgetfulness or slackness of
attention, =
it will be found that there is no such thing as mind. This is the
direct pa=
th for all (types of sadhakas). (Upadesa Undhiar, 17)

It is true wisdom fo=
r the mind to twin away from worldly objects and behold
its own form of lig=
ht (its true of effulgent consciousness the real Self).
(Upadesa Undhiar, 1=
6)

Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different=E2=80=99 they are t=
he same.
Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any obj=
ect.
Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words,not seeking w=
hat is
other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the=
 Self is
wisdom. (Who Am I?)

All the texts say that in order to gain relea=
se one should render the mind
quiescent; therefore their conclusive teachin=
g is that the mind should be
rendered quiescent; once this has been underst=
ood there is no need for
endless reading. In order to quieten the mind one =
has only to inquire within
oneself what one=E2=80=99s Self is; how could th=
is search be done in books? One
should know one=E2=80=99s Self with one=E2=
=80=99s own eye of wisdom. (Who Am I?)

Rather then viewing God as differen=
t from one contemplation that is done
with the conviction. =E2=80=98He is I=
=E2=80=99 is indeed the best of all the various kinds
of meditation (Upades=
a Undhiar, 8)

Keeping the mind fixed in the Self at all times is called Se=
lf-enquiry
whereas thinking oneself to be Brahman, which is sat-chit-ananda=

(being-consciousness-bliss), is meditation. Eventually, all the one has
le=
arnt will have to be forgotten. (Who Am I?)

The Self is within the five sh=
eaths; but books are outside them. Since the
Self has to be inquired into b=
y discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to
search for it in books. Ther=
e will come a time when one will have to forget
all that one has learned. (=
Who Am I?)

Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiesc=
ent; but it
will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled=
, and when
the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and wil=
l wander as
impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for bo=
th mind and
breath. (Who Am I?)

As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly=
 a without any residue in the very
place of their origin is non-attachment.=
 (Who Am I?)

I am pure existence, I am not the body nor the senses, mind n=
or life, nor
ignorance for, all these things are quite insentient and so, u=
nreal.

We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it wh=
y should
we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead =
of putting
it down in the train and feeling at ease? (Who Am I?)

Thought, =
indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the f=
irst
thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from the whence egoity
=
originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes
qu=
iescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the
mi=
nd becomes quiescent. (Who Am I?)

Of all the thoughts that arise in the mi=
nd, the =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 is the first. It
is only after the rise=
 of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after
the appearance of the f=
irst personal pronoun that the second and third
personal pronouns appear; w=
ithout the first personal pronoun there will not
be the second and third. (=
Who Am I?)

The Self is that where there is absolutely no =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99 thought. That is called
=E2=80=98Silence=E2=80=99. The Self itself is t=
he world. The Self itself is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99; the Self
itself is God; a=
ll is Siva, the Self. (Who Am I?)

What exists in truth is the Self alone. =
The world, the individual soul and
God are appearances in it. Like silver i=
n mother-of-pearl, these three
appear at the same time and disappear at the=
 same time. (Who Am I?)

That which rises as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in this bo=
dy is the mind. If one enquires as tow
here in the body the thought =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 rises first, one would discover that it
rises in the Heart. T=
hat is the place of the mind=E2=80=99s origin. Even if one
thinks constantl=
y =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, one will be led to that place. (=
Who Am I?)

The consciousness (I am) where there is neither knowing nor not=
-knowing is
the True Knowledge. There is no object to be known (outside the=

consciousness) there. (Upadesa Undhiar, 27)


One should, with faith, hand=
 over to Iswara all of the burdens, such as the
family and the body, which =
naturally appear, and then remain without
anxiety. Otherwise, one cannot pe=
rform, with a one-pointed mind, either
devotion or Self-enquiry. (Ulladu Na=
rpadu =E2=80=93 Supplement, 17)

It is a matter of ridicule to say either I=
 have not realized myself. Or I
have realized myself. Why? Are there two se=
lves, one self to become an
object known (by the other)? =E2=80=98I am one=
=E2=80=99 is the truth that is the experience
of everyone (Ulladu Narpadu =
=E2=80=93 Supplement, 33)

In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Ju=
st as the prey which has
fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so =
those who have come within
the ambit of the Guru=E2=80=99s gracious look wi=
ll be saved by the Guru and will not
get lost; yet, each one should, by his=
 own effort pursue the path shown by
God or Guru and gain release. (Who AM =
I?)

When the triads disappear due to the destruction of the base, fooling =
ego,
and when the states of waking and dream are thus completely destroyed,=
 the
pure broad day-light (Self) that then shines like a hundred suns is th=
e
Night of Siva (Sivaratri). (The Garland if Guru=E2=80=99s Sayings, 459)

=
How is that Atma Vidya (Self Knowledge) is said to be the easiest?
Sri Bhag=
avan: Any other Vidya requires a knower, knowledge and the object to
be kno=
wn whereas this does not require any of them. It is the Self. Can
anything =
be so obvious as that? Hence it is the easiest. All that you need
to do is =
to enquire =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 (Talk 551)

Q: How is meditation to =
be practiced?
Sri Bhagavan: Meditation is, truly speaking Atmanishta (to be=
 fixed as the
Self). But when thoughts cross the mind and an effort is made=
 to eliminate
them, the effort is usually termed meditation. Atmanishta is =
your real
nature. Remain as you are. That is the aim. (Talk, 294)

Realizin=
g that which remains after the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has ceased to exist, tha=
t alone
is excellent Tapas=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 Thus said Lord Ramana. (Upade=
sa Undhiar, 30)

The way shown by the Master is final, straight and makes f=
or unity; it is
well-tried, natural free of fancy, and free from travail. W=
hen you are
following the way shown by the Master doubts will not arise, th=
ere will be
no fear. Fear and doubt are the characteristics of darkness. If=
 you follow
the path shown by the Master it will convince you that it is th=
e right One.
(All is One)

Only the one, whose mind is ripened by supreme d=
evotion to Him, can attain
Deliverance through zeal for the Quest of the Se=
lf and inward turning of the
mind. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 87)

If the d=
uties fulfilled according to the injunctions (of the scared lore)
fail to g=
enerate devotion to the Supreme Being, then all such activity is
vain; it i=
s (even) equal to sinful conduct, since it creates (fresh)
bondage. (90)

Q=
: if I go on rejecting thoughts can I call it Vichara?
Sri Bhagavan: It may=
 be a stepping stone. But really vichara beings when you
cling to your self=
 and are already off the mental movement, the
thought-waves.

The truth of =
the Supreme Being is the one Infinite Reality transcending all
relativity, =
which is the fundamental Substance of the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, which is the=

basis of the world. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 86)

<br>That which rise=
s as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in this body is the mind. If one enquires as tow h=
ere in the body the thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 rises first, one would disc=
over that it rises in the Heart. That is the place of the mind=E2=80=99s or=
igin. Even if one thinks constantly =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=
, one will be led to that place. (Who Am I?)<br>

<br>The consciousness (I =
am) where there is neither knowing nor not-knowing is the True Knowledge. T=
here is no object to be known (outside the consciousness) there. (Upadesa U=
ndhiar, 27)<br><br><br>One should, with faith, hand over to Iswara all of t=
he burdens, such as the family and the body, which naturally appear, and th=
en remain without anxiety. Otherwise, one cannot perform, with a one-pointe=
d mind, either devotion or Self-enquiry. (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 Suppleme=
nt, 17)<br>

<br>It is a matter of ridicule to say either I have not realiz=
ed myself. Or I have realized myself. Why? Are there two selves, one self t=
o become an object known (by the other)? =E2=80=98I am one=E2=80=99 is the =
truth that is the experience of everyone (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 Suppleme=
nt, 33)<br>

<br>In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the =
prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who =
have come within the ambit of the Guru=E2=80=99s gracious look will be save=
d by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should, by his own effor=
t pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. (Who AM I?)<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">How is that Atma Vidya (Self Knowled=
ge) is said to be the easiest?<br>Sri Bhagavan: Any other Vidya requires a =
knower, knowledge and the object to be known whereas this does not require =
any of them. It is the Self. Can anything be so obvious as that? Hence it i=
s the easiest. All that you need to do is to enquire =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=
=80=99 (Talk 551)</span><br>

<br>Q: How is meditation to be practiced?<br>=
Sri Bhagavan: Meditation is, truly speaking Atmanishta (to be fixed as the =
Self). But when thoughts cross the mind and an effort is made to eliminate =
them, the effort is usually termed meditation. Atmanishta is your real natu=
re. Remain as you are. That is the aim. (Talk, 294)<br>

hiar, 30)<br><br>The way shown by the Master is final, straight and makes f=
or unity; it is well-tried, natural free of fancy, and free from travail. W=
hen you are following the way shown by the Master doubts will not arise, th=
ere will be no fear. Fear and doubt are the characteristics of darkness. If=
 you follow the path shown by the Master it will convince you that it is th=
e right One. (All is One)<br>

<br>Only the one, whose mind is ripened by s=
upreme devotion to Him, can attain Deliverance through zeal for the Quest o=
f the Self and inward turning of the mind. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 87)<b=

 is vain; it is (even) equal to sinful conduct, since it creates (fresh) bo=

<br>Q: if I go on rejecting thoughts can I call it Vichara=
?<br>Sri Bhagavan: It may be a stepping stone. But really vichara beings wh=
