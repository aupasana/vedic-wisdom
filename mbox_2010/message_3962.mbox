Namast=
e Rajesh,

Let me change the track from homam to material things, in order =
to address the "god decides everything" notion.

you here is.. I was born on fix date..so
> as i am going to die on any fix =
date only.. it is all decided....
> Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, fa=

oing homam

.. i
> will get...

One can also say in the same vein: Do I have to go to w=
ork to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, success, =
failure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. It =
is like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will happen=
 to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get. W=
ill my going to work or not going to work change things?

Of course, one do=
es not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to find =
a new job so that one's family does not suffer. What happened to the logic =
that "everything about me is decided by god well in advance"?

Well, from o=
ne reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But you, I and mo=
st people (including great yogis) do not have access to that reference fram=
e. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you can engage in=
 actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to those actions.=
 From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very important and dec=
ides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performed an action o=
r skipped an action only because god had already decided so. But you do try=
 to perform what you think is the best action for you, don't you? In the pr=
evious example where one lost a job, won't one look for a new job?

Perhaps=
 god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at home and family w=
ill suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit a=
t home and yet something will happen and family will do fine. Perhaps god h=
as decided that one will look for a job, but not get a job and family will =
suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, get a job and=
 family will do fine.

It is absolutely true that whichever of the above go=
d willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have=
 a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and want to maximize the cha=
nce (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your d=
esired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to f=
igure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. However=
, given that you don't know what god willed and what will happen, you canno=
t convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL happen. So do not cry la=
ter if it doesn't. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as g=
od decides the outcome.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

Suppose you a=
re trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy =
wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you there or you can =
row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you constantly re-evalu=
ate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that you finally reac=
h the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, y=
ou cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not row well, wind =
may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may not reach the ba=
nk. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction. If wind took =
you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start crying. Then win=
d may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of the outcome, t=
he best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.

If y=
ou start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder than=
 before and you are not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, you=
 may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the sam=
e way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing wi=
ll be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes you in the correct =
direction. So, just row row row your boat...

Ponder on this metaphor a lit=
tle.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

The same logic that applies to l=
ooking for a job above applies to doing homam and other spiritual sadhana. =
Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same way looking for a jo=
b actively when you are out of one does.

Perhaps god has decided that one =
will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without any progress. Perhaps god=
 has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet something will happen and=
 one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana, =
but not make much progress in the next few years or lives. Perhaps god has =
decided that one will do sadhana and make good progress.

It is absolutely =
true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not=
 know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. spiritual progr=
ess) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in =
your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your=
 logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to ach=
ieve the desired outcome. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outco=
me as god decides the outcome.

Just as searching for a job is a good strat=
egy in general for one without a job and wanting family not to suffer, doin=
g spiritual sadhana such as homam and japam is a good strategy in general f=
or one wanting to make spiritual progress.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =
=A0 *

I want to emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up =
family and their welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma yo=
u are doing now, but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachm=
ent to a result does not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety =
regarding whether the desired result will happen or not will decrease one's=
 focus and stop one from operating at one's best. Decide your actions based=
 on a desired outcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may=
 not be achieved even though your actions seem at this point of time to be =
the best possible actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.

Such a k=
arma yogi is always doing the best possible actions and wasting very little=
 time on worrying about things not in one's control. It is a very effective=
 strategy materially as well as spiritually!

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0=
 =A0 *

> I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires

crifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can't we have
> both?

S=
piritual progress and material success can co-exist. But spiritual progress=
 and attachment to (and worrying about) material success tend to pull one i=
n different directions.

Do not see world as a place where you seek pleasur=
es or enjoyments, but see it mainly as a place where you *give* enjoyment t=
o others. Focus on giving. You may also *receive* pleasures in the bargain,=
 but do not strive for it or calculate it or focus your mind on it.

What y=
ou give now is in your hands. What you get now is in god's hands and is dec=
ided based on what you gave earlier. What you give now decides what you wil=
l receive later. Spiritual progress essentially means realizing this and fo=
cusing the mind, its thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather th=
an receiving. Even as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive =
some things. But exactly what they are is based on what you gave in the pas=
t, which is water under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it n=
ow. This is true irrespective of whether you are attached to what you recei=
ve or not.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

Just keep doing sadhana. M=
y feeling is that you are one of the people who will make very good progres=
s in coming years. Rome is not built in a day.

My intuition strongly tells=
 me that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep doing =
occasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don't you consider =
replacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra=
 naama stotra and do homam with it. Manual is on the website.

Best regards=

Narasimha
