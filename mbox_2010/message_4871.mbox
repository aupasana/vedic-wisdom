By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya
(Dr. Frank=
 Morales, Ph.D.)

ames, has been demonstrated to exist in almost every pre-Christian civiliza=
tion and culture in the world. It is thus the common heritage of a large ma=
jority of the earth's inhabitants. As expressed in the specific tradition o=
f 'Hinduism'=9D (properly known as 'Sanatana Dharma'=9D), the metaphysical =
concept of Dharma is both a spiritual path, as well as a comprehensive ideo=
logy and world-view that directly informs the realms of politics, social th=
eory, economics, culture theory, architecture, medicine, religion, aestheti=
cs, martial warfare, philosophy, ethics, mathematics, and every other aspec=
t of human concern..."
