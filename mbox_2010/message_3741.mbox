Life at the Ashram was extremely well-ordered. Tidiness, cleanliness,thrift=

and punctuality were expected from everyone. Arthur Osborne remarked,
=E2=
=80=9CBhagavan Sri Ramana was meticulously exact,closely observant, practic=
al and
humorous. In everything he was precise and orderly. The Ashram Hall =
was
swept out several times daily. The books were always in their places. T=
he
cloths covering the couch were scrupulously clean and beautifully folded=
.
The loin-cloth, which was all he wore,was gleaming white. The two clocks =
in
the Hall were adjusted daily to radio time. The calendar was never allow=
ed
to fall behind the date. The routine of life flowed to a regular pattern=
.=E2=80=9D

In the later years, when Ramana had ceased working in the kitch=
en and had
started to supervise the building projects, his timetable was as=
 follows - he
would rise at approximately 3.30 a.m., at half past five he t=
ook his bath
and at half past six breakfast was served.This was followed by=
 the first
walk on the hill. At 8.30 he read the incoming mail and at 9.45 =
he made a
short visit to the cowshed.Lunch was served at 11.30. Around midd=
ay he went
for a second walk, which this time lasted an hour and took him t=
o Palakothu.
At 2.30 p.m. there was coffee and at approximately 4 p.m. he r=
ead the
outgoing mail. Half an hour later he again went for a walk for an h=
our.
After this the Veda parayana was chanted, followed by the Tamil paraya=
na. At
half past seven the bell called everyone to dinner.Afterwards Ramana=
 went to
the cowshed again and at 8.45 p.m. all devotees retired to their l=
odgings.

It is reported that Sri Ramana slept very little at night. He als=
o never lay
down flat, but remained upright, leaning against the back of th=
e couch.
After lunch everyone in the Ashram liked to withdraw to take a nap=
 =E2=80=93 not so
Ramana. He often made use of this quiet hour to feed the =
animals or make a
round through the Ashram and inform himself of the progre=
ss of the building
projects.

In spite of the increasing numbers of visitor=
s Sri Ramana led an active
life. In addition to cooking and supervising the=
 building projects,he read
the proofs of the books which were to be publish=
ed.By now his works had been
translated and printed in a number of Indian d=
ialects. He had written his
famous hymns to Arunachala around 1914. From 19=
23 to 1929 he wrote Upadesa
Saram (The Essence of Instruction in 30 Verses)=
, Upadesa Manjari (Spiritual
Instruction) and Ulladu Narpadu (Reality in Fo=
rty Verses) with supplementary
verses. This was followed in the thirties an=
d forties by various
translations into Tamil, Malayam and Telugu of importa=
nt advaita scriptures,
such as certain parts of Vivekachudamani and other s=
criptures by Shankara,
some verses of the Bhagavad Gita and parts of Yoga V=
asishta and the Agamas.
The English translations of all these works can be =
found in =E2=80=98The Collected
Works of Ramana Maharshi=E2=80=99. So Raman=
a regularly spent a lot of time
proof-reading these publications. He also r=
ead everything that was written
about him and was very particular that ever=
ything should be accurate.When a
biography was to be published about him in=
 Telugu, entitled =E2=80=98Ramana Leela=E2=80=99,
he painstakingly went thr=
ough it correcting any mistakes.

He also did bookbinding work. Now and the=
n people would bring him old books
in poor condition. He checked whether th=
ey were complete, added any missing
pages by copying them out himself and i=
nserting them, and then repaired the
books.

Just as he never wasted any fo=
od, so he also never wasted any paper.He would
collect any paper which was =
still usable, often cutting it up into small
sheets, which he would then bi=
nd together to make notebooks. Even the pins
from the newspapers would be k=
ept. =E2=80=9CThey will otherwise be merely thrown
away. We shall use them.=
 How should we get new ones? They have to be
bought.Where is the money?=E2=
=80=9D, he would say.

In the early years Sri Ramana attempted on a couple =
of occasions to leave
the Ashram for a life of solitude. Vasudeva (the same=
 who once witnessed
Ramana=E2=80=99s second death experience at Tortoise ro=
ck) relates, =E2=80=9COnce Bhagavan
and I went round the hill during the Sk=
andashram days. When we reached near
Esanya math about 8.30 a.m., Bhagavan =
sat on a rock and said with tears in
his eyes he would never again come to =
the Ashram and would go where he
pleased and live in the forests or caves a=
way from all men. I would not
leave him and he would not come. It became ve=
ry late. We went there about 8
or 8.30 a.m. and even when it became 1 p.m.w=
e were still in this deadlock.
Bhagavan asked me to go into the town and ea=
t my food and then come back if
I wanted. But I was afraid that if I went B=
hagavan would go away somewhere.=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana also reports about tw=
o other escape attempts, =E2=80=9CAnother time too I
wanted to run away fro=
m all this crowd and live somewhere unknown, freely as
I liked. That was wh=
en I was in Virupaksha Cave. =E2=80=A6 But on that occasion my
plans were f=
rustrated by Yogananda Swami. I tried to be free on a third
occasion also. =
That was after mother=E2=80=99s passing away. I did not want to have
even a=
n Ashram like Skandashram and the people that were coming there then.
But t=
he result has been this Ashram [Ramanashram] and all the crowd here.
Thus a=
ll my three attempts failed.=E2=80=9D

Another fixed part of the daily sche=
dule was the chanting of the Veda
parayana. At first, Brahmin boys used to =
come from town to do the chanting.
Later, with the assistance of Major Chad=
wick, the Ashram opened its own Veda
school (patasala), which is still in e=
xistence today.

The chanting of the Vedas in the morning and evening laste=
d around 40
minutes. Texts from the Vedas were recited, as well as other Sa=
nskrit texts,
such as for example the Forty Verses in Praise of Ramana by G=
anapati Muni
and Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s Arunachala
Pancharatna and Upadesa Sa=
ram. This was then followed by the so-called Tamil
Parayana with other work=
s by Sri Ramana.

The Maharshi attached great importance to this chanting, =
stressing its
calming effect upon the mind. If he was asked if people shoul=
d not also
understand the texts, he would say that it was not necessary,it =
was
sufficient to use them as an aid to meditation. He himself would sit up=
right
on his couch during the chanting, his eyes taking on a faraway look.
=

Sri Ramana left the management of the Ashram to his brother.As sarvadhikar=
i,
Chinnaswami endeavoured to retain full control over everything that happ=
ened
there. This frequently led to arguments with devotees who disagreed wi=
th his
decisions. But whatever was eventually decided had to be accepted by=
 all. If
someone comRamana plained to Sri Ramana about Chinnaswami, the Mah=
arshi
protected his brother and never reversed his decisions.

There was no=
 point in complaining to Sri Ramana, as he never interfered in
such dispute=
s. When Ganapati Sastri (not to be confused with Ganapati Muni)
was banishe=
d from the Ashram, he complained to Sri Ramana, =E2=80=9CChinnaswami has
to=
ld me not to come to the Ashram. Bhagavan is just sitting like a stone
Vina=
yaka statue. I have served the Ashram for a long time. I have also
donated =
three almiras [cupboards] full of books to the Ashram. Will Bhagavan
not as=
k Chinnaswami why he is not allowing me to come to the Ashram?=E2=80=9D But=
 he
received no answer to his complaint.

Whenever someone wanted to interf=
ere in Ashram affairs Ramana would warn,
=E2=80=9CPeople walk up the drive =
to the Ashram in search of deliverance and then
get caught up in Ashram pol=
itics and forget what they came for. If such
matters were their concern the=
y need not have come to Tiruvannamalai for
them.=E2=80=9D And to enthusiast=
ic reformers he advised that it would be sufficient
for them to reform them=
selves.

There were, however, cases when Maharshi raised objections.When, f=
or
example, the Ashram management decided to close the doors of the Hall fo=
r
two hours after lunch because of his weakened health, he protested by
lea=
ving the Hall and sitting outside to welcome the visitors, commenting,
=E2=
=80=9CThe management is welcome to close the doors but I am free to meet th=
e
visitors here.=E2=80=9D In cases such as this, where the decision of the =
management
meant that his devotees were prevented from coming to him for a =
time or if
it would lead to some injustice, he could be uncompromising, say=
ing,
=E2=80=9CYou can look after your Ashram. I am going back to the hill.=
=E2=80=9D
