Namaste,
 
You are right. Perfection in external matters such as pronunciation and ritual actions is merely one factor. The intention and internal attitude is a more important factor. One with perfect pronunciation may not get results and one with a terrible pronunciation may get results.
 
To give a cricketing analogy, a batsman may have a bad technique and play cross-batted shots away from his body without moving his feet much. Still, he may have excellent eye-hand co-ordination and instincts and may score well and become a great player (like Virender Sehwag). However, most people with such style may fail and Sehwag is an exception rather than a rule.
 
Though pronunciation and external ritual actions are a small factor, one can start off trying to do a decent job with those. Slowly, disciplined performance of external actions may transform internal attitude.
 
It is much more than a "strange combination of American and Oriya/Bengali accent mixed together". Short and long vowels are mixed up. Vowels in consecutive consonants are also sometimes mixed up. Some consonants are mixed up. The length of syllables fluctuates wildly. As I said, I know Americans who read Chandipath and other Sanskrit hymns reasonably well (despite some detectable accent). This particular case is unusually off.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
