              The Power of Emptiness


	The "void" or " psych=
ological emptiness" is a strange 
							phenomenon,
	It appears spontaneou=
sly, in the pause between two 
							  thoughts,
	As the old thought ends =
its course and disappears, 
	Its end is the gate, natural silence ensues. 
=

	Insist in being with it, as much as you can, 
	The mind is completely sil=
ent, we are attentive =96 a clear 
							consciousness,
	All meanings, bou=
ndaries disappear =96 us and the Infinite  
		  				 are "One";
	Practicall=
y, we have a new mind =96 always fresh.

 	 
           Being in the pause =
=96 I become infinite!
	It separates two worlds. I leave the limited world
=
	And enter Boundlessness, through total melting;	
	The whole being is calm =
=96 a constant sparkle.

	There is no time, no space =96 just everlasting E=
ternity;
	I move in direct contact with life, in a permanent present.
 	I a=
m Pure Energy, without motivations, 
	The simplicity of existence integrate=
s us completely.

	We really encounter Life only through this "now",
	Free =
from the old, we are able to embrace the new.
	All this beauty vanishes, wh=
en another thought appears, 
	It comes from the knowing mind =96 an old rec=
ording.
	
	Let it play its game, do not oppose any resistance, 
	Encounter =
it as it is, without any purpose, 
	It will certainly disappear, and "empti=
ness" ensues again, 
	Another opportunity to encounter it practically. 

	W=
e find the real meaning of Life through this "void",
	It is a boundary line=
 between the two worlds:
	On the one side the limited, where the "ego" is t=
he 
							master. 
	On the other, the Infinite, where Love is the master.
=
	
	Emptiness also separates Light from the darkness, 
	The permanent chaos =
through struggle, contradictions and 
						      conflicts,
	From the harm=
onious being, equilibrium and joy;
	The whole egocentrism perishes, by enco=
untering the 
							  void. 
        
	Peace, divine order becomes our nat=
ure 
	It changes our way of being, without effort or will,
	Only through th=
is psychological void, we become honest 
						   and humane, 
	The Purity =
of the Energy =96 makes titans out of pigmies .


	Let this "psychological =
emptiness" be your guide, 
	In everything you encounter on your spiritual p=
ath.
	If it is not the starting point, we easily get deceived, 
	Only throu=
gh emptiness =96 we become Love!
