Above that when science will mature enough you will see that it is of the =
same opinion as Vedas. For example
We were told in old days, do no eat food=
 which is outside after eclipse. Well at that time science was of the opini=
on that there is absolutely nothing wrong. Whereas now science says there i=
s extreme high radiation during eclipse so not only eat open food but shoul=
d not go out side also which was told before.
I have many such example whic=
h proves that we have given up the palace of gold where we use to live(dhar=
ma) and running behind some mirage. Dharm is detailed science. Unfortunatel=
y, it does not get any scientist to research on any of it's topic. We can p=
roudely work in NASA but we can not take one small dharma book and sit to r=
esearch on it. Hence we have to face what we are facing...
I was reading Ab=
out the blackhole and few days later I was reading bhagavad puran. And surp=
risingly it explain the position of blackhole as it is explain by modern sc=
ience. Well science still does not explain the characteristic as it is expl=
ain in bhagavad. Well it is the time of kaliyuga so it is bound to happen!!=

der the depression. They are not the same!<br>
 <br>
If a clinical study is=
 conducted with mostly vaata people or kapha people, an anti-depressant tha=
t aggravates pitta may seem to work. But, when it is used later by pitta pe=
ople who already have accumulated anger and frustration under the depressio=
n, it may aggravate pitta, increase the aggressive streak and make them sui=
cidal. Sadly, modern medicine does not recognize ayurvedic types and does n=
ot take them into account when performing controlled experiments, drawing c=
onclusions or dispensing medicines in the field.<br>
 <br>
Science defines =
narrow (and solvable!) problems and solves them. Once a solvable problem is=
 set narrowly, science shows a perfect path from the problem to the solutio=
n. However, the issue is that real life problems are not like that. So thos=
e who apply science have to approximate the problems using a lot of unspoke=
n assumptions, in order to make them solvable and narrow. In the end, the s=
olution may or may not be correct.<br>
 <br>
It is my firm conviction that =
teachings of rishis and Indian yogis (e.g. ayurveda) are far more holistic =
than the piecemeal offerings of modern science, in the areas of physical, m=
ental and spiritual wellness.<br>

Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces=
 that are constantly pulling the universe in different directions. Nature f=
avors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but divine forces=
 in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the pa=
st. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to earth=
 said, "this is the work of natural forces and so it must be good". Instead=
, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking of this age t=
hat vegetarianism is "unnatural" and inefficient, to me, indicates a tempor=
ary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by hook or crook.=
