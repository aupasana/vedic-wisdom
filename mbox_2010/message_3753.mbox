Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s personal attendants were chosen by Chinnaswami.Ramana =
himself
never asked anyone to serve him, nor ever sent away an attendant wh=
o had
been allotted to him. It became the tradition in the Ashram that the
=
attendants were always young unmarried men. Annamalai Swami reports, =E2=80=
=9COnce,
when a woman who was a qualified nurse from North India volunteere=
d to be an
attendant, Bhagavan replied by saying, =E2=80=98Ask the people i=
n the Hall=E2=80=99.
Krishnaswami, the chief attendant, and some of the oth=
er people in the Hall
objected. =E2=80=98No! No! We cannot have ladies doin=
g service to Bhagavan. It is
not proper.=E2=80=99 Bhagavan turned to the wo=
man and said, =E2=80=98These people all think
like this. What can I do?=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=9D

One of the attendants=E2=80=99 tasks was to receive the fo=
od offerings brought by
devotees and give some of it back to them as prasad=
am.They had to be careful
that the men sat on one side of the Hall and the =
women on the other.
Whenever Maharshi left the Hall, one of them had to acc=
ompany him. The other
one stayed back to clean the Hall. The cloths on the =
couch had to be kept
clean. Washing the cloths and preparing warm water for=
 the morning bath was
also the duty of the attendants, as was accompanying =
Ramana on his nightly
walks to the toilet. There was, therefore, someone th=
ere to be helpful to
him round the clock.

Major Chadwick tells the story o=
f the betel. In this case the attendant=E2=80=99s
omission resulted in Rama=
na simply giving up chewing betel.=E2=80=9COne morning
Bhagavan was about t=
o go out and was only waiting for the attendant to give
him the betel, whic=
h was always placed by his side when it was time for his
walk. For some rea=
son the attendant did not do it, everybody in the Hall was
waiting expectan=
tly but could do nothing about it as the management did not
allow anybody t=
o attend on Bhagavan except those who had been specially
detailed. Eventual=
ly Bhagavan got up and left the Hall without it. From that
day on he never =
chewed again.=E2=80=9D

Although Sri Ramana could be very strict with his a=
ttendants, he was also
very concerned for their welfare. In summer, when he=
 used to walk to
Palakothu between midday and 1.30 p.m., the sandy path was=
 so hot that
walking barefoot could be very painful.Ramana always walked at=
 the same
steady pace, whether it was raining cats and dogs or whether the =
sun was
blazing down, but he used to say to the attendant walking behind hi=
m, =E2=80=9CRun,
run and take shelter under that tree. Put your upper cloth=
 under your feet
and stand on it for a while.=E2=80=9D

Similarly Ramana=E2=
=80=99s concern was extended to Rangaswami, when he had to copy
out several=
 pages of a book. =E2=80=9COne day Bhagavan asked me if I had completed
the=
 job. =E2=80=98I do not have the time for it=E2=80=99, I said. =E2=80=98Wha=
t are you doing now?=E2=80=99
he queried. =E2=80=98I am going to Palakothu =
to wash your cod-piece=E2=80=99. Bhagavan said,
=E2=80=98Okay, you do my jo=
b and I will do yours=E2=80=99, so saying, he copied the
remaining pages.=
=E2=80=9D

He insisted that all others had to be served first and that he s=
hould be
served last. One day when Suri Nagamma was handing out fruit from =
her nephew
in the Hall, she served Sri Ramana first, then everybody else. A=
t the end it
was found that there was not enough fruit for everyone. So one=
 of the
attendants cut the remaining bananas into small pieces. Ramana said=

indignantly, =E2=80=9CThis is what I don=E2=80=99t like. Why do you serve =
when you cannot
give the same quantity to all people?

There are lots of di=
ning hall stories which make clear how fiercely Maharshi
resisted any prefe=
rential treatment of his person, as,again and again,
devotees tried to serv=
e him a special delicacy or a larger share than
others. The cook Santamma a=
lso had to learn her lesson. At the beginning of
her stay at the Ashram she=
 served Sri Ramana an extra portion on his leaf,
which he at once noticed s=
aying angrily, =E2=80=9CWhy did you serve the Swami more
of the curry than =
the rest? Have you come all the way here to learn this? If
you serve more t=
o others and less to me I would be happy. Do you want to
purchase grace by =
serving extra? If you show the devotees the same love as
you have for me, t=
hen your love for me too will grow.=E2=80=9D

For the Brahmins=E2=80=99 sak=
es a certain importance was attached to the observation
of caste rules. Bra=
hmins are only allowed to eat together with members of
their own caste. To =
enable them to obey this rule the dining hall was
separated in two by a bam=
boo screen.On the one side the Brahmins had their
place, on the other side =
the non-Brahmins. Sri Ramana sat in the opening of
the screen on the non-Br=
ahmin side and was visible to all. Again and again
Brahmins tried to sit on=
 the non-Brahmin side and circumvent their own caste
rules in the Ashram. T=
hey argued that with Ramana there were no caste
differences. But he did not=
 accept their arguments as long as they continued
to apply caste rules at h=
ome.
