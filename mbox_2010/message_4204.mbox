In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am "Japa" amongst all Yajnas. Thi=
s statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all other kinds of ritua=
ls. I have the following queries regarding Japa.

1) Many a times while doi=
ng japa the mind wanders. The chanting done at these instants are done with=
out any "bhavana" or sense of devotion in the mind and are merely a physica=
l chanting. Are such japas unfruitful?

2) Is there some way to validate th=
at the japa shall actually bring certain merits or nullify the targeted evi=
ls? 

3) How can an ordinary person determine whether the japa he is doing =
(or has done) is being done in a proper manner? For example if there was so=
me error in pronunciation or some nyasa was not performed correctly which i=
nvalidated the japa - can it be detected by the sadhaka himself by some mea=
ns? 

4) There is a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras =
where deities are invited on various body parts. Do those deities actually =
come and protect the entire process of Japa? Can one perceive their presenc=
e in anyway - say maybe by observing a change in the aura around the sadhak=
a?

with regards
