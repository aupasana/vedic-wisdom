      While, I am not as learned as others, I wan=
ted to add my view on top of what Utpal has written.



If my understanding=
 of God is correct, God is happy when an offering is pure. Whether the prie=
st has accumulated spiritual sakthi or not, if he is sincere and has the co=
rrect attitude it may be worthwhile.



When I do my homam, some times, my =
son joins and does abhishekam to Shiv linga. One day, we went to attend hou=
se warming function of my sister and I carried my basic stuff for my homam =
but did not carry Shiv ling. My son felt like joining and he asked if I hav=
e the Shiv ling. He was not happy when I answered in negative and kept argu=
eing that I should have brought it too. I told him, God is every where and =
he can even treat a stone as Shiv ling. I told him, if you are sincere and =
pure at hearth and assume Shiv is infront of you, Shiv will accept your off=
ering.l Well, I know this is true. Is there any place where Shiv is not the=
re? Whether or not, I invoked him or not, Shiv or any God for that matter i=
s just by our side. My son, went out, found a round shaped stone and did mR=
tyunjaya mantra japa along with abhishekam. As far he is concerned, he beli=
eved me and there are no questions in his mind. When such believe is bestor=
ed in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME
 PURE momentarily and what ever you offer=
 in full trust that god is accepting it, is accepted by God. There is no do=
ubt in it.



As per the impact it create, what impact you want? If you wan=
ted an impact, they you attempted business with God. When you do not want a=
ny thing in return, then you are already getting the impact. Otherwise, how=
, living in this material world, you did not expect any thing for what you =
do?



The result, you will get is to improve your attitude. That WILL happ=
en if you offered sincerely.



The mythology is full of stories that sugge=
st, in complete surrender or otherwise, if the call to God is sincere, God =
will always answer the same. It is another thing if we realized that God ha=
s already answered us!



The very fact, that we are finding time to read/w=
rite message like this shows that we are trying to correct our attitude and=
 seek god. This itself is the result of what ever little sadhana we are doi=
ng.



Best regards,

Vijay

      <p>While, I am not as learned =
as others, I wanted to add my view on top of what Utpal has written.<br>
<b=
r>
If my understanding of God is correct, God is happy when an offering is =
pure. Whether the priest has accumulated spiritual sakthi or not, if he is =
sincere and has the correct attitude it may be worthwhile.<br>
<br>
When I =
do my homam, some times, my son joins and does abhishekam to Shiv linga. On=
e day, we went to attend house warming function of my sister and I carried =
my basic stuff for my homam but did not carry Shiv ling. My son felt like j=
oining and he asked if I have the Shiv ling. He was not happy when I answer=
ed in negative and kept argueing that I should have brought it too. I told =
him, God is every where and he can even treat a stone as Shiv ling. I told =
him, if you are sincere and pure at hearth and assume Shiv is infront of yo=
u, Shiv will accept your offering.l Well, I know this is true. Is there any=
 place where Shiv is not there? Whether or not, I invoked him or not, Shiv =
or any God for that matter is just by our side. My son, went out, found a r=
ound shaped stone and did mRtyunjaya mantra japa along with abhishekam. As =
far he is concerned, he believed me and there are no questions in his mind.=
 When such believe is bestored in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME
 PURE momenta=
rily and what ever you offer in full trust that god is accepting it, is acc=
epted by God. There is no doubt in it.<br>
<br>
As per the impact it create=
, what impact you want? If you wanted an impact, they you attempted busines=
s with God. When you do not want any thing in return, then you are already =
getting the impact. Otherwise, how, living in this material world, you did =
not expect any thing for what you do?<br>
<br>
The result, you will get is =
to improve your attitude. That WILL happen if you offered sincerely.<br>
<b=
r>
The mythology is full of stories that suggest, in complete surrender or =
otherwise, if the call to God is sincere, God will always answer the same. =
It is another thing if we realized that God has already answered us!<br>
<b=
r>
The very fact, that we are finding time to read/write message like this =
shows that we are trying to correct our attitude and seek god. This itself =
is the result of what ever little sadhana we are doing.<br>
