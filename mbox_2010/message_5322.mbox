> 1. Is it ok to do puja of Kuladaivata idols which have lost features due =
to decades of pooja? not broken etc. but features like eyes, nose etc. are =
no longer discernible.
Vijay: Idols serve two main objectives.
1. Help the =
sadhaka concentrate/focus. Since the sadhaka feels he/she is sitting in fro=
nt of idol of so and so devi/devata there is better focus. Is we get a call=
 and some says, it is from prime minister, wont the attention change?
2. De=
pending on the level of sadhana, the idol, seat, mala etc. Accumulate some =
energy which could help some in your next generations.
God has no form as s=
uch. So, a deformation does not matter to the God. It is all in our minds, =
there is no issue unless you imagine one. Remove the element of doubt and g=
uilt and go ahead using the idols. Remember the way, Ramakrishanji used a b=
roken idol of  Krishna at Dakshineswar!
> 2. Is it ok if one form of the go=
d is mistaken for another unknowingly... specifically Narsimha and Pralhad =
with Narsimha and Laxmi devi? Esp. if Tulja Bhavani is said to be Kuladevi?=

vijay: firstly, when you do some thing unknowingly, you don't get any papa=
m. However, it is different when you know that you are doing some thing unk=
owingly.
I personally use the same idol to invoke multiple devatas and I DO=
 NOT FEEL GUILT. My advice is to find from elder what the idols are and the=
n trust them and get going.
> 3. Addition of gods in puja over generations =
- as each one will have a istha or priya deva/ devi?
Vijay: God is like mot=
her and far better mother than any mother we see. God does not need us to p=
ray him. We are praying him out of our own (spiritual or material) needs. Y=
ou pray to the form of the God you associate yourself with. You donot have =
to pray to all forms of idols just because they are added to your puja room=
 through generations. Towards the end of puja, you can say, sarva devatabho=
m namaha.
