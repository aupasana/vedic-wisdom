Namaste Rajmohansrinivas ji,
 
All three points you mentioned are in=
correct, and have no scientific basis. 
Kindly remain a vegetarian, but do =
not believe in fake 'science'. 

 
Namaste Sararaju ji,
 
Since you seemed =
to be speaking from a position of 'science' and not 
spirituality per se, a=
 few points in your email about food are quite incorrect. 
 
Human body is =
naturally suitable for vegitable foods.  Nobody cannot eat 
 non-veg item w=
ithout cooking and adding some spicy flavours. 

 
This is wrong. Human bod=
y is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like 
people do not eat =
raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. 
Cooking is a=
 later addition to human society. 

 
If you were to clear your mind of all=
 preconcieved ideas and look at REAL 
research in the most unbiased way pos=
sible, and accessed scientific papers in 
clinical nutrition and dietetics,=
 as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find 
ample evidence that humans as=
 a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an 
omnivorous diet:-
 
a) =
Human ancestral diets changed substantially approximately four to five 
mil=
lion years ago with major climatic changes creating open grassland 
environ=
ments. 

 
b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simple=
r 
gastrointestinal tract  requiring foods based around meat protein and fa=
t. For 
example since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to =
five million 
years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requ=
irement for 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - wi=
thout a 
corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possib=
le only with a 
diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman =
terms, our brain 
would not have reached the size and mass as it is today, =
had it not been for 
diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. 

 
c)=
 The gut morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally 
equidi=
stant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because 
human=
s are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and 
ru=
men, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant 
c=
ellulose into usable energy, which is why, a major part of the leafy vegeta=
ble 
based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stom=
ach lining 
of humans do not contain  the kind of strong acids which is pre=
sent in a typical 
carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Natur=
e through  the natural 
process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. =
It may further interest you 
to know that the teeth structure of humans is =
actually identical to, guess what, 
rats who also are omnivores.
 
d) It ma=
y shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that research into 
clinical=
 nutrition very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human 
bod=
y for w.r.t different foods is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish,=
 
and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negat=
ive 
calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories in abs=
orving it 
than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to di=
gest. You can 
look up actual BV (biological value) charts for more details=
.
 
All this is science. Real science. If you are interested, please do stu=
dy actual 
scientific papers with an objective mind, but do not pass judgem=
ents based on 
lack of study or motivated hearsay. 

 
*              *    =
            *
 
>From the point of view of sadhana, as per my personal exper=
ience, it is best to 
eat as light a food as possible. 

 
Spicy foods are =
more disturbing than nonvegeterian foods, therefore the best is 
totally bl=
and food. Eating exactly the same food daily for months on end is also 
ver=
y helpful to disengaging the mind from food. 

 
Feel free to stick to your=
 preferred eating habits, but kindly do not use

Re: [vedic-wisdom] IS NON VEG FOOD BAD FOR MEN?

  
Dear Rajmohanji,
 
Saat=
wic foods naturally creating good moral habits and maintain our body 
metab=
olisim very well. Most of the vegitable foods are saatwic. 

 
Human body i=
s naturally suitable for vegitable foods.  Nobody cannot eat 
 non-veg item=
 without cooking and adding some spicy flavours. 

 
For example I can take=
  an apple simply wash and then eat it. But iimagine 
can I  take non-veg f=
ood like these? naturally non-veg is not a taste one it 
gives taste only b=
ecause of cooking and adding flavour is it. 

 
whether pava or punya it do=
esn't matter. But is it really good for health? think 
over that. 

 
Most =
of the ingridents,vitamins and minerals are more with vegitabes than 
non-v=
eg. 

 Its only illusion to create non-veg will give more strength than veg=
.
 
Reg.,
sararaju
