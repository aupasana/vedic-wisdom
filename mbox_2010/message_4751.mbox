Dear Members,

I would appreciate any guidance on the recitation of Devi Ma=
hatmyam.

In addition to reciting on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdashi can De=
vi Mahatmyam be recited in parts to be completed within a week? And if yes,=
 what is the procedure in terms of Shaapoddhara, Utkeelana mantras, Argala =
Stotram and Kilakam?

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Narayana
