 I was born the sixth daughter of Sri Periyakulam Krishna Iyer and
Kanakamm=
al on the fourth day of Panguni month, Saleevagna Sahabdha, 1823
(17-3-1902=
). My parents and elders called me Meenakshi. I was happy with my
parents.
=

In the meantime, my father took sannyasa and became one of the leading
dev=
otees of Sri Ramana Bhagavan. (The father's name was Dandapani Swami).
Late=
r, my father went to Palani with Bhagavan's permission, constructed an
ashr=
am in South Giri Street, and lived there for some time. While he was
there =
he came to our house in Rayapuram. During his visit, he gave a copy of
Aksh=
aramanamalai (The Marital Garland of Letters) to my husband. My husband
wen=
t through them and after four days informed me that he was going to
Thiruk =
kazhi Kunram. However, instead, he went straight to Tiruvannamalai.

When h=
e saw Bhagavan, he felt that his whole body was burning. He wept and
cried =
out complaining of a burning sensation without knowing what it was.
The att=
endants around Bhagavan thought that he was mad. One attendant, Sri
Ramakri=
shna Swami rubbed lemon juice on his head and poured pots of water
over him=
. He stayed there for several days doing tapas and having Bhagavan's
darsha=
n. Then he returned to Madras and his job, but he had little interest
in hi=
s work.

Then he began to go to Tiruvannamalai on all Saturdays and Sundays=
 for one
year. After my mother-in-Iaw's first annual ceremony, and without =
informing
me, he resigned his job and went to Ramanathapuram. My neighbours=

telegrammed to my brother about my problem and he came to see me. Both of =
us
went to the school and met the headmistress who was an English lady She =
said
that he had resigned his job and left. I began to weep and she console=
d me
by saying that God would help me.

Then I went to Ramanathapuram with =
my brother and Muruganar came to visit us
the night we arrived. I held his =
feet and wept. I requested him to point out
my faults if any that made him =
leave me alone. He gave me no reply. Then I
went to Raghava Iyengar, a grea=
t Tamil scholar in the town and told him
about my troubles. Raghava talked =
to my husband but his words had no effect.

Meenakshi's father, Dandapani S=
wami was a permanent inmate of the Sri
Ramanasramam. Her father presented h=
er husband, Sri Muruganar a copy of the
Aksharamanamalai sometime after her=
 marriage.

A few days later, Sri Muruganar left home permanently for the a=
shram without
telling anyone. "From that day he was totally absorbed in Bha=
gavan", she
says."Searching for him I reached Sri Ramanasramam. I found him=
 and yet did
not find him for he was wholly Bhagavan's now."

Muruganar sta=
yed near the temple in town with Eswaraswamigal and Gopal Rao.
They used to=
 go begging for their food at noon. Muruganar used to sit alone
in Subraman=
iya Temple in the evening. One evening, acting on Santhammal's
advice, I ca=
ught hold of his feet and asked, "What mistake have I done? Why
did you lea=
ve? What will be my future? " In response he opened neither his
mouth nor h=
is eyes.

Soon after this incident; someone brought a piece of verse to the=
 hall and
put it before Bhagavan. Bhagavan wanted Muruganar to read it and =
said:
"Muruganar has been absent for the last two days. What is the reason?=
 " In
response to this I went to Bhagavan and told him what I did at the te=
mple on
Santhammal's advice. Bhagavan got angry with me and said, "Why did =
you act
like that on that woman's advice. You see, while he was here, you c=
ould see
your husband. But now he has disappeared, what will you do? Hereaf=
ter, don't
take other's advice and don't give trouble to Muruganar."

One d=
ay, all the devotees were sitting in the hall. I was in tears again.
Bhagav=
an asked me. "Why are you crying again? Did some body tease you?" I
said, "=
No one talked against me but I thought of my miserable life and the
tears j=
ust came." Bhagavan said, "Why don't you take my advice? What is
there in t=
he family life. See, your father has ten children, but they are
not helping=
 him. What is the use? I am always here with you. Nothing will
happen, don'=
t worry." Thus Bhagavan consoled me.He said, "Go only to the
house who call=
s you affectionately, Meenakshi '. The Ashram will take care
of you."

Bhag=
avan then told Muruganar that he has not left him in the streets, but
Murug=
anar has left Meenakshi in the streets. Muruganar got up laughing, but
Bhag=
avan asked him to give a reply before getting up, but he went away
without =
saying anything.

Then Bhagavan said, "I tried in so, many ways. It is of n=
o use. God alone
will look after you. "

Bhagavan was very kind to me.

His=
 grace must be with me forever .....
