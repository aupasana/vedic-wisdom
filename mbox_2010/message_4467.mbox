 (Published in The Mountain Path, July 1965)

I have been a visionary from =
childhood. When I was only five years old I
already had visions of Sri Kris=
hna. At first I thought every one could see
them. I once said to my mother:=
 =E2=80=9CLook! He's standing there!=E2=80=9D but she
explained to me that =
only I saw him.

When I grew up I joined the army. However my desire for Go=
d-experience grew
so strong that after some years I resigned and decided to=
 devote my life to
sadhana. I wanted to become a sannyasin but could not be=
cause I had a wife
and children to look after.

One day my wife was just se=
rving my midday meal when a sadhu came and stood
in the doorway. I invited =
him in and told her to serve him food too and then
asked him whether he cou=
ld direct me to a Swami who could show me God. He
told me that I could find=
 what I was looking for from Ramana Maharshi of
Tiruvannamalai.

The next d=
ay I saw an advertisement in the paper for an ex-army man to run a
canteen =
in Madras. I applied and was at once given the post and my fare
paid.

When=
 I got to Madras I said that I must first pay a visit to Tiruvannamalai
bef=
ore taking up my duties.

As soon as I had an opportunity to see Bhagavan a=
lone I asked him my usual
question. I added: =E2=80=9CIt's a bargain. I am =
willing to pay any price, even my
life,but your part of the bargain is to e=
nable me to see God.=E2=80=9D

Then he said: =E2=80=9CI can enable you rath=
er to be God than to see God.=E2=80=9D

A few days later I went for a walk =
in the rough country at the foot of the
north slope of Arunachala and fell =
into a state of ecstasy during which I
again had a vision of Sri Krishna. W=
hen I got back I told Bhagavan. He asked
me: =E2=80=9Ccan you see Krishna n=
ow?=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CNo; only when I have a vision.=E2=80=9D

So h=
e said: =E2=80=9CWhat is the use of a God who comes and goes? If he is a re=
al
God he should be with you always.=E2=80=9D

That shocked me. Again I alm=
ost lost faith in him, but some of the devotees
explained to me. Before I l=
eft for Madras I asked Bhagavan for a mantra but
he did not give me one. I =
asked him for permission to take sannyas, but he
refused.

I lost interest =
in all the ritual and incantations and breathing exercises
that I had been =
doing up to then. For instance, I used to get up at three
o'clock in the mo=
rning to attend to my statue of Sri Krishna. All such
things ceased to inte=
rest me. I was very worried about this. I thought it
meant I had become an =
atheist.

At the first opportunity I went to Tiruvannamalai. I told Bhagava=
n about the
change that had come over me and how I had lost interest in all=
 the ritual
that I had been practising regularly for so many years past.

B=
hagavan looked steadily at me for some time and then said something to me
i=
n Tamil which I was told, on enquiry, meant =E2=80=9CYou, that is me, that =
is
Bhagavan.=E2=80=9D

These words sank into my heart and I experienced the=
 most wonderful feeling
of bliss I had ever known.

It was from this time t=
hat I began to understand Bhagavan and his teaching.
