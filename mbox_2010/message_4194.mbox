 12th September, 1947

A devotee who came here some time back and had been =
listening to the various
discussions in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence, approa=
ched Bhagavan this afternoon and
respectfully asked, =E2=80=9CSwami, it is =
said that Ishwara who is the reflection of
the soul and appears as the thin=
king mind, has become jiva, the personal
soul, which is the reflection of t=
he thinking faculty. What is the meaning
of this?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan answer=
ed,

=E2=80=9CThe reflected consciousness of the Self (Atman) is called Ish=
wara, and
Ishwara reflected through the thinking faculty is called the jiva=
. That is
all.=E2=80=9D

The devotee: =E2=80=9CThat is all right, Swami, bu=
t what then is chidabhasa?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CChidabhasa is the f=
eeling of the Self which appears as the
shining of the mind. The one become=
s three, the three becomes five and the
five becomes many; that is, the pur=
e Self (satva), which appears to be one,
becomes through contact, three (sa=
tva, rajas and tamas) and with those
three, the five elements come into exi=
stence, and with those five, the whole
Universe.

It is this which creates =
the illusion that the body is the Self. In terms of
the sky (akasa), it is =
explained as being divided into three categories, as
reflected in the soul:=
 the boundless world of pure consciousness, the
boundless world of mental c=
onsciousness and the boundless world of matter
(chidakasa, chittakasa and b=
hutakasa). When Mind (chitta), is divided into
its three aspects, namely mi=
nd, intuition and =E2=80=98Maker of the I=E2=80=99 (manas,
buddhi and ahank=
ara), it is called the inner instrument, or =E2=80=98antahkarana=E2=80=99.
=

Karanam means upakaranam. Legs, hands and other organs of the body are
cal=
led =E2=80=98bahyakarana=E2=80=99, or outer instruments, while the senses (=
indriyas)
which work inside the body are antahkaranas or inner instruments.=
 That
feeling of the Self, or shining mind, which works with these inner
in=
struments, is said to be the personal soul, or jiva. When the mental
consci=
ousness, which is a reflection of the tangible aspect of pure
consciousness=
, sees the world of matter, it is called mental world (mano
akasa), but whe=
n it sees the tangible aspect of pure consciousness, it is
called total con=
sciousness (chinmaya). That is why it is said, =E2=80=98The mind is
the cau=
se of both bondage and liberation for man (mana eva manushyanam
karanam ban=
dha mokshayoh)=E2=80=99. That mind creates many illusions.=E2=80=9D

The qu=
estioner: =E2=80=9CHow will that illusion disappear?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =
=E2=80=9CIf the secret truth mentioned above is ascertained by
Self-enquiry=
, the multiplicity resolves itself into five, the five into
three, and the =
three into one. Suppose you have a headache and you get rid
of it by taking=
 some medicine. You then remain what you were originally. The
headache is l=
ike the illusion that the body is the Self; it disappears when
the medicine=
 called Self-enquiry is administered.=E2=80=9D

The questioner: =E2=80=9CIs=
 it possible for all people to hold on to that path of
Self-enquiry?=E2=80=
=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CIt is true that it is only possible for mature mind=
s, not for
immature ones. For the latter, repetition of a prayer or holy na=
me under
one=E2=80=99s breath (japa), worship of images, breath-control (pr=
anayama),
visualising a pillar of light (Jyotishtoma) and similar yogic and=
 spiritual
and religious practices have been prescribed. By those practices=
, people
become mature and will then realize the Self through the path of
S=
elf-enquiry. To remove the illusion of immature minds in regard to this
wor=
ld, they have to be told that they are different from the body. It is
enoug=
h if you say, you are everything, all-pervading. The Ancients say that
thos=
e with immature minds should be told that they must know the
transcendent S=
eer through enquiry into the five elements and reject them by
the process o=
f repeating, =E2=80=98Not this, not this (Neti, neti)=E2=80=99. After sayin=
g
this, they point out that just as gold ornaments are not different from
g=
old, so the elements are your own Self. Hence it must be said that this
wor=
ld is real.

=E2=80=9CPeople note the differences between the various types=
 of ornaments, but
does the goldsmith recognise the difference? He only loo=
ks into the fineness
of the gold. In the same way, for the Realized Soul, t=
he Jnani, everything
appears to be his own Self. Sankara=E2=80=99s method w=
as also the same. Without
understanding this, some people call him a nihili=
st (mithyavadi), that is,
one who argues that the world is unreal. It is al=
l meaningless talk. Just as
when you see a stone carved into the form of a =
dog and you realise that it
is only a stone, there is no dog for you; so al=
so, if you see it only as a
dog without realizing that it is a stone, there=
 is no stone for you. If you
are existent, everything is existent; if you a=
re non-existent, there is
nothing existent in this world. If it is said tha=
t there is no dog, but
there is a stone, it does not mean that the dog ran =
away on your seeing the
stone.

There is a story about this. A man wanted t=
o see the King=E2=80=99s palace, and so
started out. Now, there were two do=
gs carved out of stone, one on either
side of the palace gateway. The man s=
tanding at a distance took them for
real dogs and was afraid of going near =
them. A saint passing along that way
noticed this and took the man along wi=
th him, saying, =E2=80=98Sir, there is no need
to be afraid.=E2=80=99 When =
the man got near enough to see clearly, he saw that
there were no dogs, and=
 what he had thought to be dogs, were just stone
carvings.

=E2=80=9CIn the=
 same way, if you see the world, the Self will not be visible; if you
see t=
he Self, the world will not be visible. A good Teacher (Guru) is like
that =
saint. A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of the fact that he
is =
not the body.

But there is one thing more. Unless one looks upon death as =
a thing that is
very near and might happen at any moment, one will not be a=
ware of the Self.
This means that the ego must die, must vanish, along with=
 the inherent
vasanas. If the ego vanishes thus, the Self will shine as the=
 luminous
Self. Such
people will be on a high spiritual plane, free from bi=
rths and deaths.=E2=80=9D With
that Bhagavan stopped his discourse.
