Preface

=E2=80=9CThe ego or separate soul is a concept(idea). God, the wor=
ld, the mind
desires,action, sorrow and all other things are all concepts=
=E2=80=9D.

Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, a famous Sage of modern India, at=
tributed
unique value to this lucid exposition of Supreme Truth. He often r=
eferred to
it in his talks with devotees and seekers, and he is reported to=
 have said
that is one repeatedly read Chapter 26 of the Ribhu Gita one cou=
ld pass
spontaneously into samadhi, or the natural state of Self-realizatio=
n.

The Ribhu Gita, literally =E2=80=9CRibhu=E2=80=99s Song=E2=80=9D, is Pa=
rt Six of the Shiva Rahasya,a
legendary mystical text of India. The whole o=
f the Ribhu Gita is said to
represent the teaching given to the Sage Ribhu =
by God himself in the form of
Lord Shiva, the formless aspect of the Divine=
 activity, in whom all beings
and things are always already absorbed. The S=
age in turn gave the teaching
to his reluctant disciple Nidagha.


The Hear=
t of the Ribhu Gita

1. I shall now expound to you the method of inhering i=
n the All-inclusive
and undifferentiated Reality. This teaching is secret a=
nd difficult to
understand even with the help of the various Scriptures. Ev=
en celestial
beings and practitioners of spiritual discipline who hold it d=
ear acquire it
only with great difficulty. Follow what I say and, inhering =
in Reality,be
happy.

2. My son! Realized sages say that absolute inherence=
 in Reality means
becoming one with the immutable, tranquil, non-dual Absol=
ute Supreme Being
which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and the Self of al=
l, and making the
wandering mind one with it like the proverbial milk and w=
ater, absolutely
free from all concepts.

3. When one scrutinizes this vari=
ety of manifestation one realizes that it
does not really exist and that ev=
erything is the undifferentiated Absolute
Supreme Being which is not differ=
ent from the Self and oneself. Let this
knowledge become firm with you by c=
onstant practice. Then,discarding
everything, become one with the Supreme A=
bsolute Reality and, remaining as
that, be happy.

4. Abide as That which d=
oes not, when scrutinized, show any duality in the
form of these various ob=
jects or the least trace of cause and effect, That
in which, when the mind =
is absorbed in It, there is not fear of duality at
all =E2=80=93 and be alw=
ays happy, unshakable and free the fear arising from
duality.

5. Abide as =
That in which there are neither thoughts nor fancies, neither
peace nor sel=
f-control, neither the mind nor the intellect, neither
confusion nor certai=
nly, neither being nor non-being, and no perception of
duality =E2=80=93 an=
d be always happy, unshakable and absolutely free from the fear
arising fro=
m duality.

6. Abide as That in which there is neither any defect nor good
=
quality,neither pleasure nor pain, neither thought nor silence, neither
mis=
ery nor austerities practiced for getting rid of misery, no

 always
happy, free from all traces of thought.

7. Abide as That in which =
there is no work, physical, mental, verbal or of
any other kind, neither si=
n nor virtue, neither attachment nor its
consequences =E2=80=93 and be alwa=
ys happy, free from all traces of thought.

8. Abide as That in which there=
 are neither thoughts nor a thinker, neither
the arising nor the preservati=
on nor the dissolution of the world,nothing
whatsoever at any time =E2=80=
=93 and be always happy, free from all traces of
thought.

9. Abide as That=
 in which there is neither the Self-limiting Power of
Illusion nor its effe=
cts, neither knowledge nor ignorance, neither separate
soul nor Lord of Cre=
ation, neither being nor non-being,neither world nor God
=E2=80=93 and be a=
lways happy, free from all traces of thought.

10. Abide as That in which t=
here are no gods and their worship, none of the
three Divine aspects of Cre=
ator, Preserver and Destroyer or meditation on
them no Supreme Formless God=
 nor meditation on Him =E2=80=93 and be always happy,
without the least tra=
ce of thought.

11. Abide as That in which there is neither maturing bondag=
e to the way of
good works nor searching devotion to the Divine nor self-kn=
owing wisdom, no
fruit of action to be enjoyed, no supreme state separate f=

traces of thought.

cted, nothing other than one Self =E2=80=93 and be always happy,
free from =
the least trace of thought.

17. Abide as That in which there is no debate,=
 no success or failure, no
word or its meaning, no speech, no difference be=
tween the soul and the
Supreme Being, none of the manifold causes and conse=
quences =E2=80=93 and be always

prepared, and those who are not
prepared at all), none of the three kinds a=
fflictions (those of the body,
those caused by the elements, and those caus=
ed by subtle beings and powers),
none of the five functional layers of bein=
g
(gross physical, vital, emotional-psychic, mental, and that of formless
b=
liss), no one to identify himself with them =E2=80=93 and be always happy,w=
ithout

22. Abide as That in which there is no =
sentient object, no power to hide
Reality, no difference of any kind, no po=
wer of projecting unreal objects,
no power of any other kind, no false noti=
on about the world =E2=80=93 and be always
happy, without the least trace o=
f thought.

23. Abide as That in which there are no sense organs or anyone =
to use
the,That in which transcendent bliss is experienced, That which is
a=
bsolutely immediate, That by realizing and attaining which one becomes
immo=
rtal, That by becoming which one does not return to this cycle of births
an=
d deaths =E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the least trace of thought.=


24. Abide as That, on realizing and experiencing the bliss of which, all
=
joys appear to be the joys of That, That which, when clearly known to be
on=
eself, shows there is nothing apart from oneself, and, knowing which,all
ki=
nds of separate souls become liberated =E2=80=93 and be always happy,withou=
t the

oneself, there is nothing else
to be known, everything becomes already know=
n and every purpose accomplished
=E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the=
 least trace of thought.

26. Abide as That which is attained easily when o=
ne is convinced that one is
not different from the Supreme Absolute, That w=
hich results, when that
conviction becomes firm, in the experience of the S=
upreme Bliss of the Real,
That which produces a sense of incomparable and c=
omplete satisfaction when
the mind is absorbed in It =E2=80=93 and be alway=
s happy,without the least trace of
thought.

27. Abide as That which leads =
to the complete cessation of misery when the
mind is absorbed in It, and th=
e extinction of all ideas of =E2=80=9CI,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D and=

=E2=80=9Canother,=E2=80=9D and the disappearance of al differences =E2=80=
=93 and be always happy,
without the least trace of thought.

28. Abide as =
That in which, when the mind is absorbed in It, one remains
without a secon=
d, nothing other than oneself is seen to exist and
incomparable bliss is ex=
perienced =E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the least
trace of thought=
.

29. Abide as That which is undifferentiated Existence, undifferentiated
=
Consciousness, undifferentiated Bliss, absolutely non-dual, the
undifferent=
iated Absolute Reality =E2=80=93 and with the firm conviction that you
are =
That, be always happy.

30. Abide as That which is =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D as w=
ell as =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D as well as everyone else, is
the basis of all,=
 is one without anything else whatsoever, is extremely
pure, the undifferen=
tiated Whole =E2=80=93 and with the firmconviction that you are
That, be al=
ways happy.

31. Abide as That in which there are no concepts or anything e=
lse
whatsoever, the ego ceases to exist, all desires disappear, the mind be=
comes
extinct and all confusions come to an end =E2=80=93 and with the firm=
 conviction
that you are That, be always happy.

32. Abide as That in which=
 there is no awareness of the body, or the various
functions of manifest ex=
istence, no perception of objects, That in which the
mind is dead, the soul=
 become one with the Reality,thoughts dissolved and
even one=E2=80=99s conv=
ictions no longer hold =E2=80=93 and with the firm conviction that
you are =
That, be always happy.

33. Abide as That in which there is no longer any m=
editative spiritual
practice or ignorance or knowledge or activities of any=
 kind, that which is
the Supreme Reality =E2=80=93 and with the firm convic=
tion that you are That, be
always happy.

34. Abide as That in which, when =
one is completely merged with It, one
experiences pure bliss, never experie=
nces misery, sees nothing, does not
take birth again, never thinks oneself =
to be a separate individual,becomes
the Supreme Being and with the convicti=
on that you are That,be always happy.

35. Abide as That which is truly the=
 Supreme Absolute Reality, the Supreme
Formless God, the absolutely pure Be=
ing, the Supreme State, Absolute
Consciousness, the Supreme Truth =E2=80=93=
 and with the conviction that you are
That, be always happy.

36. Abide as =
That which is the absolutely pure Supreme Being, absolute
Bliss, the suprem=
ely subtle Being, the Self-Effulgent, non-dual and
undifferentiated One =E2=
=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always
happy.

37. Abi=
de as That which is absolute Truth, supreme Tranquility, eternal
Being, abs=
olutely attributeless, the Self, the absolutely undifferentiated
Supreme Be=
ing =E2=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.

=
38. Abide as That which is everything from the experiential point of view
a=
nd nothing from the absolute point of view, Existence =E2=80=93Consciousnes=
s-Bliss,
always tranquil, with nothing separate from It, the self-existent =
Being =E2=80=93and
with the conviction that you are That be always happy.

=
39. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to you the state of being one=

with the Supreme Being. By constantly thinking that you are the
undifferen=
tiated Supreme Being you can attain that state and enjoy constant
bliss. Th=
ere after, having become the Supreme Absolute Reality, you will
never exper=
ience the misery that comes from
identification with birth and death.

40. =
=E2=80=9CEverything is the Supreme Being, which is
Existence-Consciousness-=
Bliss, and I am That=E2=80=9D By constantly cultivating this
pure thought, =
get rid of impure thoughts. Then, my son, discarding even that
thought and =
always inhering in the State of Fullness, you will become the
non-dual and =
undifferentiated Supreme Being and attain liberation.

41. Pure and impure =
thoughts are a feature of the mind. There are no
wandering thoughts in the =
Supreme Being. Therefore, abide as That and, free
from the pure and impure =
thoughts of the mind, remain still like a stone or
a log of wood. You will =
then be always happy.

42. By constantly thinking of the undifferentiated S=
upreme Being and
forgetting thereby all thoughts, including the thought of =
the Supreme Being,
you will become the all-comprehensive Supreme Being. Eve=
n a great sinner who
hears and understands this teaching will get rid of al=
l his sins and become
the undifferentiated Supreme Being.

43. The endless =
textbooks of spiritual instruction have already prescribed
meditation for a=
ttaining purity of mind. In order that those who have become
pure in mind m=
ay easily attain liberation and, realizing that they are
absolute and bound=
less Bliss, remain still like a stone in the
undifferentiated and all-compr=
ehensive Supreme Formless God, the nature of
this immaculate state has been=
 expounded by me.

44. Therefore, attaining purity of mind by constantly th=
inking that
everything that is known is the Supreme Being and that Supreme =
Being is
oneself, and thereafter abiding in the state of complete identity =
with the
Absolute Reality, liberation can be attained here and now. I have =
spoken the
truth. In this manner, Sage Ribhu expounded the true and full st=
ate of being
to Nidagha.

45. When one is convinced that one is always That=
 which is
Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and abides as That in a state of co=
mplete
identity,one casts off the unreal bondage of identification with bir=
th and
death and attains liberation. This is the significance of the highly=

blissful mood and dance of our Supreme and undifferentiated God.

<br>39. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to =
