Please cut down on this belligerance. If you kee=
p polluting the list with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the li=
st. We welcome all views, but one can disagree with great scholars and mast=
ers without belittling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attit=
ude.

Aadi Shankara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you stud=
y his works, you will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in=
 his commentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, schola=
rship in Vedic scriptures, breadth of
 commentaries of Vedic literature and=
 the linguistic richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among a=
ll scholars of Kali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about th=
e importance of devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most p=
rolific scholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.

* * *

Sanskrit=
 is a very useful language. So much great literature that shows various pat=
hs to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras=
 directly resonate with the energy centers in one's subtle consciousness. S=
o, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in S=
anskrit, it is a great idea.

At the same time, Shankara's advice of chanti=
ng the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue on=
e in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complet=
e* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in t=
he end.
 Learning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplinin=
g the mind with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - al=
l these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending=
 on one's rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activit=
ies, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing =
rituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so th=
at people do not forget it and get bogged down.

If one wanting to climb a =
mountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, =
one may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stu=
ck at the base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that for=
ever may forget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compa=
ssionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.

* * *

I am re=
minded of a small episode from the life of Swami
 Vivekananda.

Swami Vivek=
ananda said at a San Francisco class: "I am the disciple of a man who could=
 not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often h=
ave I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!"

Stud=
ent said, "But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best."

Swami Vivekan=
anda said, "That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am."

Vi=
vekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimin=
ation) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (disc=
rimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limita=
tions of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).

* * *

> Tha=
t Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,=

Maturity of a teacher is not measured by the
 following=
. And great teachers do not care about being "celebrated".

In any case, it=
 is not true that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percen=
tage of Vedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily b=
y Adi Shankara's commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosopher=
s for many many generations.

Apart from his scholarly works, the mutts est=
ablished by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant pe=
rcentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.

Any teachings in writt=
en/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great=
 great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only th=
e teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to in=
fluence the thinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Sh=
ankara's words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retaine=
d their meaning and power for more than
 a couple of millennia. The longevi=
ty of his works is amazing.

* * *

It is ok to have strong opinions. As pe=
ople's understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try =
not to offend others with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting sai=
nts, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of thei=
r teachings, is not good karma. I request members to be considerate, tolera=
nt and respectful to others.

Best regards,
Narasimha
