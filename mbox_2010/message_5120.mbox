Namaste,

Thanks for the feedback. I have just now finished typing a long =
post on another thread. However I will address both your questions in anoth=
er post hopefully within a week or so at the earliest that I can. I will al=
so elaborate a little more on the role of intiation in mantramarga. Except =
for mantra sadhana, initiation is not a mandatory requirement in any other =
form of sadhana. It is a different matter though that the idea has been app=
ropriated by practitioners studying even predominantly secular disciplines =
such as music, dance, astrology etc, causing a lot of unwanted and unhealth=
y confusion. No doubt, spiritualising these secular subjects makes them mor=
e wonderful and inspiring. It is the false pretense of certain unscrupulous=
 self-proclaimed gurus of material vidyas that I am cautioning against. It =
is mantra sadhana alone as enjoined by the Tantras that requires initiation=
. Nowhere else is it a requirement. I will deal with the rest in my next po=
st.

Regards,
Satya Prakash
