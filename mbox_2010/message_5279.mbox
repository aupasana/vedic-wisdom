Namaste,

In the earlier message it is said:
> So, lets attempt to divinze =
Physical form, in accordance with >highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mah=
aavatar babaji has done, >because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada.

Narasimha=
 Garu has mentioned:
> Aurobindo's ideals have been misunderstood by many l=
earned people >to mean that he was striving for physical immortality.

I ha=
ve hardly read writings by Aurobindo and I am not properly aware of his hig=
hest ideal which is called as Supra-consciousness but when I saw that Mahaa=
vatar Babaji was stated as an example for that Ideal i started thinking abo=
ut this.

While into a particular Sadhana, a certain chain of thoughts appe=
ared one after another in my consciousness. I try to Penn down as below:

1=
) In "Autobiography of A Yogi", if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that=
 once Mahaavatar Babaji wished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but =
he was advised not to do so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that =
Its a *DIVINE WISH* which has come out from the sister and so he would stay=
 till the end of this yuga.

2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized th=
at the Final Boss is a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi M=
andala and he controls the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete crea=
tion

3) Ramakrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishn=
a took Arjuna in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at som=
e place where Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on t=
he tree. Krishna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was a=
stonished to see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then to=
ld Arjuna that this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.

=
The above 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I =
was trying to synthesize and derive the essence of all these thoughts. Only=
 one common thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The so=
urce of all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri K=
rishna, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vi=
shnu, Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves ar=
e from that source. The whole creation including all universes known and un=
known along with their Gods are from that single source.   

I do not know =
if my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Su=
pra-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your=
 divinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Br=
ahman provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as lon=
g as one desires or probably as per Brahman's desire while at the same time=
 retaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasim=
ha's view and probably that seems to be the highest state which we one can =
look up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which wa=
s achieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. 

Best Regards,

=
Utpal

 Ravana had done that 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but the sha=
kti of his sadhana was such that he got a new head every time to continue t=
he sadhana. On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death o=

n a mundane level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only afte=

 remember the series of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irre=
