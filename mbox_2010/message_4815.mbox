Respected Sir,

I want to ask that can I do Shri Krishna Homam at night.

A=
ctually, I am a doctor and practice in a vilalge of North India. Some times=
 I have to attend emergencies in early morning. 

I used to perform Homam d=
uring winters regularly in early morning. but after summers started we usua=
lly get high incidence of Emergencies in early morning due to harvesting se=
ason, then paddy sowing season and now a days it is time to pour insecticid=
es and pesticides in fields.

Due to all these reasons I had to quit my rou=
tine of doing homam in early morning. And sometimes it also cause disturban=
ce in my Japam schedule. 

I seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. =
And as Shri Krishna Homam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in even=
ing with a fear of doing a wrong deed. 
 In winters I will be able to do th=
e homam in early morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. 

=
But Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book =
"Vedic Wisdom" Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch =
to Ganapati homam to be performed at night?

Personally, I want to stick to=
 Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doing Maha Ganapa=
ti Homam will also have same importance for me.

Hope to find a suitable an=
swer

Kind Regards
Atul
