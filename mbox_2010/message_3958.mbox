> So indirectly there is more ego involved. I can negotiate and overcome sa=
nsaric needs on my own. As in the end it is the "I" and "Me" needs to disso=
lve too.

Yesterday, I had a similar thought and some reflection on the sam=
e.
I had a telecon at 5:30 pm and I thought I will take the same from home.=
 I started at office at 4:57 pm. My house is 13 km away from office. My bos=
s asked me if I am confident I would reach home in time. I said "Yes" and s=
tarted (I went on two whealer yesterday, and hence confident I could make i=
t in time).

Normally when I drive, I will be mentally chanting some mantra=
s. Yesterday was no different. But, at some point, I was getting struck in =
the traffic and unthinking, I was telling, Oh, my God, ensure I reach in ti=
me. Afterall before starting my boss challenged me if I could reach". The v=
ery next movement, I thought, "Why am I seeking Gods help in such a small t=
hing. What happens if I don't reach in time. It would be a matter of few mi=
nutes of delay, and more over, I can start participating since, I had setup=
 a dialout to my mobile.
More over, this is some thing I can manage. I am w=
ith two whealer and can sneak in between the other vehicles. I don't need G=
ods help in such small thing. I can do it by myself."

Immediately, another=
 thought came to me. Can I really manage it by myself?".Abosolutely NO.

Wh=
ile, I was correct in thinking, I should not ask God's help in petty things=
, I was incorrect in assuming "This I can do on my own".

What we do, we do=
 by grace of God. What we do not do, we do not do by the grace of God. What=
 we get, we get by grace of God.

This is a movementary realisation, and I =
am sure, I am back to my normal thinking. I percieve I, "Vijaya Kumara Laks=
hmi Narayana Rao Pingali" is typing this message. unfortunately, I do not f=
eel I am writing this email by God's grace, even though that is the case.

=
Sorry, if this email is out of context.

Best regards,
Vijay
