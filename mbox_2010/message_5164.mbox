An excerpt from the new book:

"Living Dharma: The Teachings of Sri Dharma =
Pravartaka Acharya"

http://dharmacentral.com/dharmastore/Living_Dharma.php=



"The true guru only comes to those who are blessed by God, and who are r=
eady to receive guidance with humility.  Understand the rare gift it is to =
come into contact with such a pure guru.  Listen quietly and sincerely to t=
he untainted words of such a genuine guru and allow yourself to learn and a=
bsorb his teachings to you. Make yourself worthy of such a gift.  The great=
est offense (guru-aparadha) that we can commit against the guru is to arrog=
antly treat the guru as an ordinary person. The guru is not our buddy. The =
guru is not our colleague. The guru is not our therapist. The guru is not o=
ur employee.  The true guru is the self-realized sage who will guide us awa=
y from our self-imposed illusion and toward the spiritual emancipation for =
which our innermost heart yearns. The true guru is our personal savior." - =
Pg.73
