This unusual article by Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh was originally publish=
ed in Bhavan's Journal in May of 1959

It would be easy to dismiss the ques=
tion by saying: "Yes, after a prolonged period of intense austerities and m=
editation, while I was living in Swargashram, and when I had the darshan of=
 a number of maharshis and their blessings, the Lord appeared before me in =
the form of Sri Krishna."

But that would not be the whole truth, nor a suf=
ficient answer to a question relating to God, who is infinite, unlimited an=
d beyond the reach of the speech and mind.

Cosmic Consciousness is not an =
accident or chance. It is the summit, accessible by a thorny path that has =
steps, slippery steps. I have ascended them step by step, the hard way; but=
 at every step I have experienced God coming into my life and lifting me ea=
sily to the next step.

My father was fond of ceremonial worship (puja) in =
which he was very regular. To my child-mind, the image he worshipped was Go=
d; and I delighted in helping father in the worship, by bringing him flower=
s and other articles of worship. The deep inner satisfaction that he and I =
derived from such worship implanted in my heart the deep conviction that Go=
d is in such images devoutly worshipped by His devotees. Thus did God come =
into my life first and placed my foot on the first rung of the ladder.

Gro=
wing up

As an adult, I was fond of gymnastics and vigorous exercises. I le=
arnt fencing from a teacher who belonged to a low caste; he was a harijan. =
I could go to him only for a few days before I was made to understand that =
it was unbecoming of a caste Brahman to play the student to an untouchable.=
 I thought deeply over the matter. One moment I felt that the God whom we a=
ll worshipped in the image in my father's puja-room had jumped over to the =
heart of this untouchable. He was my guru, all right! So I immediately went=
 to him with flowers, sweets and cloth, and garlanded him, placed flowers a=
t his feet and prostrated myself before him. Thus did God come into my life=
 to remove the veil of caste-distinctions.

How very valuable this step was=
 I could realize very soon after this: for I was to enter the medical profe=
ssion and serve all, and the persistence of caste-distinction would have ma=
de that service a mockery. With this mist cleared by the light of God, it w=
as easy and natural for me to serve everyone. I took very keen delight in e=
very kind of service connected with healing and alleviation of human misery=
. If there was a good prescription for malaria, I felt that the whole world=
 should know it the next moment. Any knowledge about the prevention of dise=
ases, promotion of health and healing of diseases, I was eager to acquire a=
nd share with all.

Then, God came into my life in the form of the sick in =
Malaya. It is difficult for me now to single out any instance; and perhaps =
it is unnecessary. Time and space are concepts of the mind and have no mean=
ing in God. I can look back now upon the whole period of my stay in Malaya =
as a single event in which God came to me in the form of the sick and the s=
uffering. People are sick physically and mentally. To some, life is lingeri=
ng death; and to some others, death is more welcome than life. Some lead a =
miserable life, unable to face death; some invite death and commit suicide,=
 unable to face life. The aspiration grew within me that if God had not mad=
e this world merely as a hell where wicked people would be thrown, to suffe=
r, and if there is (as I intuitively felt there should be) something other =
than this misery and this helpless existence, it should be known and experi=
enced.

Conscious search for God

It was at this crucial point in my life t=
hat God came to me as a religious mendicant who gave me the first lesson in=
 Vedanta. The positive aspects of life here, and real end and aim of human =
life, were made apparent. This drew me from Malaya to the Himalaya. God cam=
e to me in the form of all-consuming aspiration to realize Him as the Self =
of all.

Meditation and service went on apace; and with them came various s=
piritual experiences. The body, mind and intellect, as the limiting adjunct=
s, vanished; and the whole universe shone as His Light. God then came in th=
e form of this Light in which everything assumed a divine shape; and pain a=
nd suffering, that seem to haunt everybody, appeared to be a mirage, the il=
lusion that ignorance creates, on account of low sensual appetites that lur=
k in man.

One more milestone had to be passed in order to know "Sarvam Kha=
lvidam Brahma." Early in 1950 (on the 8th Jan.) God came to me in the form =
of a half-demented assailant, who disturbed the night satsanga at the ashra=
m. His attempt failed. I bowed to him, worshipped him and sent him home. Ev=
il exists to glorify the good! Evil is a superficial appearance; beneath it=
s veil, the one Self shines in all.

A noteworthy fact ought to be mentione=
d here. In this evolution nothing gained previously is entirely discarded a=
t any later stage. One coalesced into the next; and the Yoga of Synthesis w=
as the fruit. Murti-puja, selfless service of the sick, meditation, the cul=
tivation of cosmic love that transcended the barriers of caste, creed and r=
eligion, with the ultimate aim of attaining Cosmic Consciousness, was revea=
led. This knowledge had immediately to be shared. All this had become an in=
tegral part of my being.

The mission had been gathering strength and sprea=
ding. It was in 1950 that I undertook the All-India Tour. Then God came to =
me in His virat-svarupa, multitudes of devotees, eager to listen to the ten=
ets of divine life. At every centre I felt that God spoke through me, and H=
e Himself in His virat-form spread out before me as the multitude, listened=
 to me. He sang with me; He prayed with me; He spoke and He listened. Sarva=
m Khalvidam Brahma.
