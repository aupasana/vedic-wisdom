 Sri Bhagavan says : =E2=80=98Without the seer, the seen, be they worlds or=
 gods,
cannot exist. All those objects of sight depend upon the seer. The p=
urpose
of all objects of sight is only to point to the seer. The purpose of=
 all
creation is verily to get at the creator.=E2=80=99

Sri Bhagavan clear=
ly concluded his explanation in favour of simultaneous
creation by saying: =
=E2=80=98Without the seer, the seen, be they worlds or gods,
cannot exist. =
All those objects of sight depend upon the seer.=E2=80=99

The debate revol=
ves around two Sanskrit terms, srishti-drishti vada and
drishti-srishti vad=
a. Srishti-drishti vada means the theory of gradual
creation, that is, the =
theory that God created the world and the soul.

According to the theory of=
 parinama vada, Brahman does not appear as the
world and the soul, as a rop=
e appears to be a snake, but undergoes a change
and becomes them in the sam=
e way that clay becomes a pot. This theory
maintains that Brahman has actua=
lly (and not merely apparently) undergone
transformation and change. It als=
o maintains that the effects, namely, the
world and the soul, are as real a=
s their cause, Brahman.

Drishti-srishti vada means the theory of simultane=
ous creation, and is also
known as the theory of false appearance. Accordin=
g to this theory, Brahman
is the sole reality that never undergoes any chan=
ge, and the world, the soul
and God are false appearances that rise into ex=
istence simultaneously with
the seer. This theory maintains that all object=
s depend for their apparent
existence upon the seer. Whereas in gradual cre=
ation, objects are seen
because they have been created, in simultaneous cre=
ation, objects are
created because they are seen.

The question of which cr=
eation theory is taught in Ulladu Narpadu has been
answered by Bhagavan him=
self in verse 83 of the Garland of Guru=E2=80=99s Sayings.

Through the ven=
ba verse that begins, =E2=80=98Because we perceive the world...,=E2=80=99
G=
uru Ramana =E2=80=93 who teaches the one true beneficial attainment [jnana]=
 that is
needed by the people of the world =E2=80=93 declared, out of his l=
ove for us, the
doctrine of illusory appearance to be the truth that bestow=
s the ultimate
benefit, avoiding the consideration of other doctrines.

In =
this verse Bhagavan states that since he wrote Ulladu Narpadu, it is
unders=
tood that he teaches only the doctrine of false appearance, or
simultaneous=
 creation, and that he has set aside all other theories. It
should also be =
clear from reading the text of Ulladu Narpadu that Sri
Bhagavan is teaching=
 that the seer and the seen rise together.

In verse seven it states, =E2=
=80=98Although the world and the mind rise and set
together, it is by the m=
ind alone that the world shines=E2=80=99 and in verse
twenty-six it states,=
 =E2=80=98If the ego comes into existence, all else will come
into existenc=
e. If the ego does not exist, all else will not exist.=E2=80=99

Although B=
hagavan taught the theory of simultaneous creation, this theory
should not =
be elevated to the status of an absolute truth. Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
actu=
al experience is ajata, which is a denial of all creation theories,
simulta=
neous or otherwise, since it is the experience that neither the
world, the =
soul nor God has ever come into existence. Ajata is the final
experience, n=
ot a theory that can be taught, for there is no room in this
experience for=
 such differences as a teacher and a person to be taught.

Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s teachings assume that we are aware that the world rises and sets
with =
the rising and setting of the seer. The first words of Ulladu Narpadu
are =
=E2=80=98Because we see the world=E2=80=99, and this assumption that we see=
 the world
becomes the basis for this teaching on creation. If he was inten=
ding to
attempt to teach ajata, he would not have admitted the existence of=
 the
world at all, and if he had intended to teach gradual creation he woul=
d have
said, =E2=80=98Because the world is created=E2=80=99.

Although Sri =
Bhagavan sometimes used to speak from the standpoint of gradual
creation wh=
ile replying to questioners, in his main works (for example, in
Who am I?, =
in verses 6, 7, 14, 23 and 26 of Ulladu Narpadu, and in verses 6
and 7 of A=
runachala Ashtakam), he clearly teaches only the theory of
simultaneous cre=
ation. As he has explained in Self Enquiry in the answer to
question 10, th=
e theory of gradual creation is taught only for immature
aspirants, while t=
he theory of simultaneous creation is taught to mature
aspirants. The same =
idea is expressed by him in Day by Day (15th March 1946)
and in Talks no. 6=
51 where he concludes: =E2=80=98But the true seeker can be content
with yug=
apat srishti, instantaneous creation.=E2=80=99

The Ulladu Narpadu selectio=
n has been translated by Robert Butler, while the
two Arunachala Ashtakam v=
erses have been taken from Sri Arunachala Stuti
Panchakam, Sadhu Om and Mic=
hael James=E2=80=99 translation of and commentary on
Bhagavan's Arunachala =
poems:

6

The world is of the form of the five senses. It is nothing other=
. Those five
senses are perceived through the five organs of sense. Since t=
he mind alone
perceives the world through the medium of the senses, can the=
re be a world
apart from the mind? Speak!

7

Although the world and the mi=
nd arise and subside together, it is through
the mind that the world shines=
 forth. That which is the perfection that
shines without appearing or disap=
pearing, as the place where both the world
and the mind appear and disappea=
r, is the Real.

14

If the first person [I] exists, the second and third p=
ersons [you, he, she,
it and they] will also be in existence. But if, upon =
one=E2=80=99s investigation
into the reality of its nature, the first perso=
n is destroyed, the second
and third persons will also cease to be, and one=
's own nature, shining
alone, will be verily the state of the Self.

23

Th=
is body does not say =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. And no one says =E2=80=98When I a=
m asleep I do not
exist=E2=80=99. After the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 arises, all=
 else arises. Investigate with a keen mind
whence this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =
arises.

26

If the ego arises, all else will arise. If the ego is not, not=
hing else will
exist. The ego, truly, is all. Know that simply to enquire w=
hat it is, is to
renounce everything.

Arunachala Ashtakam 6

You, the Hear=
t, the light of consciousness, the one reality, alone exist! A
wonderful sa=
kti exists in You as not other [than You]. From [it a] series of
subtle sha=
dowy thoughts [rise and] by means of [the reflected light of]
consciousness=
 in the whirl of prarabdha are [simultaneously] seen [as]
shadowy world pic=
tures, both inside [on] the mirror of the thought-light and
outside through=
 the [five] senses such as the eyes, just like a cinema
picture which exist=
s [by being projected] through a lens. O Hill of Grace,
whether they [the w=
orld pictures] stop [appearing], or whether they continue
[to appear], they=
 do not exist apart from You.

7

If the thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 does n=
ot exist, no other thing will exist. Until that
[moment when the =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99-thought ceases], if other thoughts rise [one should
enquire] =E2=
=80=98To whom do they rise?=E2=80=99 To me. [Then, by scrutinising] what is=
 the
rising place of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, merge [within]. Diving within [in=
 this manner], if one
reaches the Heart-throne [one will become] verily the=
 Sovereign under the
shade of one umbrella. [There] the dream known as =E2=
=80=98inside and outside=E2=80=99, the
two karmas, death and birth, pleasur=
e and pain, and darkness and light, will
not exist, and the limitless ocean=
 of the light of grace, called Aruna Hill,
which dances motionlessly in the=
 court of the Heart, alone [will exist].
