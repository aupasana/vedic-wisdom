Experiencing Samadhi        

"Experiencing a certain type of Samadhi, does=
 not mean you are released from Existence. . It is a significant step in on=
e's spiritual evolution, but still not the ultimate." - Sadhguru

There are=
 various types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadhis have be=
en classified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been broadly cate=
gorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or qualities =
and samadhis without attributes or qualities. 

We see with Isha Yoga, peop=
le go into different types of samadhis. Here it is common to witness both s=
avikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain state of equanimity whe=
re the intellect goes beyond its normal function of discrimination. This, i=
n turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi states, one becomes =
loose inside the body or there is a space between what is you and your body=
. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significance in terms of Real=
ization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does not mean you are rele=
ased from Existence. It is just a new level of experience. 

It is like whe=
n you were a child, you had one level of experience, once you moved into yo=
ur adulthood, you have another level of experience. The same things that yo=
u have experienced at a particular point in your life, after a few years, y=
ou experience them in a totally different way. So, you have moved from one =
level of experience to another level of experience. 

Samadhis are just lik=
e this. You are moving from one level of experience to another level of exp=
erience in a much more significant and deeper sense. Still, it is just anot=
her level of experience.

Somebody may go into a certain level of samadhi a=
nd stay there for years because it is enjoyable. There is no space or time.=
 There are no bodily problems. He has broken the physical and psychological=
 barriers to some extent. But this is only temporary. The moment he comes o=
ut, again he gets hungry, he has to sleep, and again everything comes back.=
 

Samadhi definitely has its benefits. There are many things it has to off=
er for an individual, but this doesn't really take you closer to Realizatio=
n, as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who is slightly drunk, ha=
s a different level of experience, but he has to come down at some point. A=
ll samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high without any external ch=
emicals. Now, by going into these states, it opens up a new dimension for y=
ou, but it doesn't leave any great transformation behind. It doesn't leave =
you permanently transformed. 

You have not moved into another reality. In =
the same reality, your level of experiences has deepened. You have experien=
ced the same things in a little deeper sense. You have not become free from=
 the mind. 

Now, somebody meditates for 12 years and comes out. Even after=
 12 years, he may not be a realized being, but, maybe he is a little closer=
. When you go into another reality and stay there for long hours or long ye=
ars, the grip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you have come to an ex=
periential understanding that, this is not it. Not just an intellectual und=
erstanding, you have seen experientially that this is not it. That is the w=
hole purpose of long meditations. But most realized beings never went into =
samadhi states. 

Gautama never sat for 12 years in one place. Many of his =
disciples, many Buddhist monks went into very long meditations. They never =
came out for years, but Gautama himself never went, because he saw it is no=
t necessary. 

He practiced and experienced all the eight kinds of samadhis=
 before his enlightenment and he discarded them. He said, "This is not it".=
 This is not going to take you any closer to realization. It is just moving=
 into a higher level of experience and probably you will get more caught up=
, because it is more beautiful than the current reality. 

If the goal is s=
et, if you've made realization the top priority in your life, then every th=
ing else which doesn't take you one step closer is meaningless. Let's say y=
ou are climbing the Mount Everest, you will not take one step sideways, bec=
ause every ounce of energy is needed. Now, if you have to transcend your ow=
n consciousness, you need every ounce of what you have and it's not enough.=
 So, any action that we perform, we don't want it to be a sidewinder.

We h=
ave created powerful consecrated spaces where experiencing samadhi states c=
omes very naturally. There are samadhis that are very pleasant, blissful, a=
nd ecstatic and there are samadhis that are beyond this. Those who go into =
samadhi states beyond pleasant or unpleasant, or nirvikalpa, we always keep=
 them in protected states as their contact with the body has become very mi=
nimal. The smallest disturbance, like a sound or a pinprick would dislodge =
them from their body. These states are maintained for certain periods to es=
tablish the distinction between you and the body. It is a significant step =
in one's spiritual evolution, but still not the Ultimate.
