Dear friends,

Namaskar!

Few friends of mine told me over the week that no=
n vegetarian food increases infertility in men and if the future generation=
 too continue to eat non veg food, many men would be sterile in the near fu=
ture. I have not studied biology or chemistry. So from layman's point of vi=
ew, i have understood from what others are telling 

1) meat especially clo=
gs the arteries and sexual reproduction in men is dependent on movement of =
blood. So not only heart that is affected in non veg eaters but also sexual=
 reproduction system. this is surprising since non veg foods are supposed t=
o make men more rajasic and active. 

2) for the last 10 years at least the=
 chemicals are being used increasingly to make the animals more heavier and=
 tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, prawns, chickens, goats, buffa=
lo are all being fed with food that would make them grow faster and to make=
 their flesh tastier.

3) people all over the world are ignoring such facts=
 to their own peril.

I am a born vegetarian and i do not know the facts ab=
out non veg foods.

Can someone explain the facts?

Thanks to everyone,
Raj=
mohan
