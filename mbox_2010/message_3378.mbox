 THERE was a wood-cutler who was highly spiritual. One day he was dreaming a
happy dream;but being suddenly awakened by someone, he exclaimed with
annoyance: "Why did you awaken me? I was a king and the father of seven
children.My children were all receiving education in various sciences. I was
seated on the throne and ruling
over my country. Why did you destroy so happy and delightful a state?" The
man replied: "Oh! It was only a dream. What does it matter?"

The wood-cutter said: "Get away, you fool! You do not understand that my
being a king was, as real as my wood-cutting. If it be true that I am a
wood-cutter,then it is equally true that I was a king."

According to Vedanta the waking state is no more real than the dream state.
