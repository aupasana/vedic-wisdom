namaste,

I am finding that study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit Grammar is keepi=
ng me alert and time well spent rather than religious opiates and highs. In=
 fact, I am a little upset with the Adi Shankaracarya - snd his Bhajagovind=
am - If he manifested now before me - and gave his "mUDha mate" stuff - I'l=
l tell him "young man" go preach elsewhere to your own age group. What you =
don't know is the vyAkarNa is "vedAnga" - And kids should be "seen and not =
heard"

regards
