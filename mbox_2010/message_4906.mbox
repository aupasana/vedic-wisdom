Namaste,
 
Yes, you can. There are many ways to god. But fire is very useful and fast. Even lighting a fire, imagining god in the fire and just meditating in front of the fire with a mantra is good enough.
 
Many people in this situation try the super-short procedure (see the appendices at the end of the manual). It is much simpler and has very few mantras and much simpler ones. A lot of people find it easy to start with super-short procedure and slowly expand it. You may want to take a look.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
