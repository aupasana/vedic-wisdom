Dhananjay Ji

I possess nowhere near the level of knowledge many of the lea=
rned members here possess but just felt like sharing a little on this topic=
.It would be like the babble of a little child before a learned assembly an=
d I am sure Narasimha ji will respond with a much clearer explanation.

It =
is the view of the Naths and Siddha Saints that ultimately even external Ho=
ma must lead to Internal homa done in the body which is the best.This can t=
ake many forms such as offering Havishanna into the Jatharagni ( Fire in th=
e form of digestion) or Mental homa.

Narasimha ji explained this beautiful=
ly in the homa manual with stating that the power of homa is mostly in its =
visualization , the external homa is for purification of the nadis which le=
ads to excellent visualization. Excellent visualization leads to one being =
a better Mantra Drashta!!!!

The Nath yogis say for example " One is not ab=
le to travel to Kashi Vishwavanth and wishes to offer Mental Pradakshina to=
 Lord Vishwanath . He should visualize the Temple its surroundings in all i=
ts glory with all its intricate details and the important point is it shoul=
d take the same amount of time it would take in the real world "

If one ha=
s to do a mental homa the visualization similarly would have to be equally =
detailed with each step happenning mentally and it taking similar amount of=
 time.

I think theoretically the effect of Mental homa would be manifold e=
xcept that due to impurities in the nadis of one not used to sadhana it is =
much better to do external homa for many years and sharpen that visualizati=
on .

Vemparla Ram Kishore
