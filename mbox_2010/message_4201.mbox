NAMASKAR

Thanks Vijay,

There is no question of destroying her(wife) but t=
o destroy her mental illness...I am seeking mental peace, peace of my famil=
y but not the material benefit...

Another thing, I am suspecting that some=
 black tantric/magic may be applied to harm my family, marital peace. How c=
ould I omit those harmful effects? Is the swattik gonapati homam are suffic=
ient to counter those black magic? Though I know the word "counter" is not =
appropriate, all of we are children of our supreme god, so he/she will take=
 care of his/her children as decided by him/her...we can only to  beg to li=
ve with our desired way in our version...

gurujis please reply...
Biswajit=


NB: I am performing the ganapati homam with not a single pray of material=
 benefits as guided by Narasimha...If needed to pray for well beings of min=
e, without harming others, please suggest...
