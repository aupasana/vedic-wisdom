Is there any specific reasoning for demons, rakshasas, and asuras to
appea=
r as pairs/brothers in most stories?  Example, Madhu and Kaithab,
Chand and=
 Mund, and Shumbh and Nishumbh in Chandi Path, the various
incarnations of =
Jai and Vijay as demons to outlive their curses in
Vishupuraana etc.

Do th=
e pairs reflect different aspect of the tamas guna?  For example
Chand can =
be an evil heart while Mund can be an evil mind implying that
evil works bo=
th at the heart and the head?

Regards

Veenu
