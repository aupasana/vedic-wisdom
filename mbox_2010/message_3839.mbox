Namaste Biswajit,
 
Good luck with homam. Others answered your questions and I will leave them. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on aghora seems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand when we are communicating verbally, because one's own mental conditioning has a role in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-text. It is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.

Brahmacharya is very important in any spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in loss of ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one's creative essence. Doing sadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leaking through a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it will soon become empty!
 
Just as a filled water pot that is leaking may still satisfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similarly a person doing sadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do his dharma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do sadhana even as one's brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be if the filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a sadhaka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak that energy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serve dharma better.
 
If there are 12 people who maintain physical and mental brahmacharya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the world can be changed.
 
*        *        *
 
If an aghora sits naked with partner and chants mantra, please remember that the goal isn't having sex. This practice is by means a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*. Even if the mind is overwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the goal is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy as something to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahmacharya can be maintained despite such provocation.
 
In fact, the true meaning of brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to refrain from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be able to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain physical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain from mental thoughts.
 
An aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those thoughts in his mind (what Manish called as "sampradaaha"). Mind considers some things as pure and some things as impure. The "impure" objects and circumstances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other disturbance to the mind and waver it from god. But an aghora puts them right in the middle of a "pure" activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to deal with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impure! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure about it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind and waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what is impure about it?
 
That is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yogis may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opposite sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his mind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinerate the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be aroused by, not by staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to focus the mind on god.
 
Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more perfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahmacharya.
 
If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it may be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the other attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.
 
*        *        *
 
The coarse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.
 
The finer meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts even in the mind.
 
The finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in Brahman always. Brahmacharya literally means "engaging in Brahman or Self". One experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc only when one's mind perceives and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful lady, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me etc) and NOT when one's mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacharya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celibacy and control over anger.
 
Rome is not built in a day.
 
Bottomline: It is very important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. Start off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes on. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.

BTW, regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be burning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming your offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.
 
Keep it as cheap as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood sticks collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

When the talking of "AGHORA" going on, is it really needed to perform "Bramhachariya" for daily ganapati homam? if someone can control his/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/masturbating/consume non-veg food is really needed? (In my practical experience, consume very low-diet little food at last night are excellent for performing Ganapati Homama in the morning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hours before the homama procedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful for me!)
