PRANAM GURUJAN

Recently I got noticed about "Dimethyltry=
ptamine " drug as well as the topics of near-death-experien ce, though I pe=
rsonally believe the life after death through some incidents of telepathy. =
Some of my family members (gurujans) absolutely dedicated to sadhana, and h=
ear some stories from them, but I don't have any personal experience.. .

T=
hose Gurujis, who have some experience atleast, please guide for something =
spiritual experience, I know having this experience is not the goal, but so=
methimes mind seeks atleast one...

I can remember two experience of mine, =
but not entirely sure about that...

1. there is a dream like vision during=
 meditation when performing daily-ganapati- homam, but it could be the secr=
ation of "Dimethyltryptamine " too...

2. normally I give money frequently =
to street beggars, but one day when I was busy at drinking from a street si=
de food stall, a young(30 around! but i am not sure, its hard to guess) wom=
an ask for something to give, but just look and find she is young enough to=
 earn, so I refused to give. After that I suddenly remember the stories of =
Rajarshi, P.V.R Ji during their tours with Manish, and then try to find her=
 again, but she just vanished within merely 30 seconds...I haven't see her =
before or after that incident...but I am sure too with this incident...

Gu=
rujis, please guide, help.

Pranam again,
Biswajit
