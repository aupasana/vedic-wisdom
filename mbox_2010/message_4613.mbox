Namaste Sri Narasimha, 

Thank you so much for your feedback. 

I also have=
 the following questions/comments on Ganapathi Homam. 

1. Not being able t=
o perform this wonderful homam everyday, I am not able to get the mantras b=
yheart and always have to keep referencing the manual as I do homam, which =
is kind of inconvenient. I thought of solution to get around this. I want t=
o take up a mandala deeksha of doing the homam everyday for 41 days (hopefu=
lly get it byheart by the end of it), culminating in Vinayaka Chaturthi tha=
t falls on September 11th, Saturday, this year. Is my calculation right? I =
have Jagannatha Hora software to determine what date is Bhadrapada Shukla C=
haturthi in Michigan, USA. Is my approach right? 

2. The purpose of doing =
this homam is for myself to have more clarity on spiritual matters (and not=
hing else). From time to time I keep getting into several internal debates =
in my mind as to what is right / wrong even when I am interpreting great bo=
oks like Srimadbhagavadgita. In the recent past I am trying to involve myse=
lf in an intense study of this great scripture and keep getting all kinds o=
f Dharma Sandehas (just like Arjuna did) and I think the only way one will =
have the kind of understanding that Arjuna had at the end of it, is only af=
ter having a full darshana of the lord (in whichever life it happens). So, =
in my opinion, only Sadhana can lead to some real answers for the questions=
 we keep getting from time to time as we read these confusing scriptures. A=
m I thinking in the right direction?

Regards, 

Nagraj

Yes, this is a reasonable substitute for Satya Narayana vratam. If you want=
, you could add aahutis for loka palakas also (OM gaNapataye swaahaa, OM br=

are already doing them. This will only increase with time. I hope Vishnu sa=
hasra naama homam also catches on. Many people know how to chant Vishnu sah=

nting time! Of course, if one wants to make it longer, one can repeat a few=
 times.

 and offering Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot =

 to navagrahas, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the 'Pancha =
Loka Palaka Pooja' and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vi=
shnu homam, all the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam is=
 a good substitute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if on=
e is falling short of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?
