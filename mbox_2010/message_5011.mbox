Any mantra =
gives results when one succeeds in focusing mind on it. In addition, if a t=
hought or desire is present in the mind at the time of such focus, i.e. min=
d is focuses on a mantra and a desire and there is nothing else in the mind=
, then it is possible that the mantra works to fulfil the desire.
 
The pur=
pose of sankalpa is to focus the mind on a thought. Before you start a ritu=
al, you tell yourself what you want. However, it is possible that one who s=
aid a sankalpa explicitly forgets about that sankalpa when the mind starts =
get a perfect focus on the mantra. Or one may not even get such focus. On t=
he other hand, one who meditates on a mantra without a formal sankalpa may =
get a sankalpa in the mind just when one's mind is about to get perfect foc=
us.
 
Bottomline is that saying sankalpa explicitly is just a formality. If=
 a desire is to be fulfilled, one needs to have it at the back of the mind =
during sadhana and focus enough on the mantra to generate enough kaarmik pu=
sh to fulfil it.
 
*        *        *
 
I will narrate an incident, which =
may throw some light on some related areas.
 
There was a sadhaka who was a=
ttached to Gayatri mantra, but never did sadhana with Gayatri mantra with a=
ny explicit sankalpas. Oneday, a Super bowl match was going on (final Ameri=
can football match of the season to decide the world champion). The local t=
eam of his own city were the favorites and they had won Superbowl a couple =
of times in previous years. They went into Superbowl with a perfect record =
that season and were expected to win. They were considered an all-time grea=
t team. The opponents were a small-time team that came into finals defying =
all expectations. People thought they were lucky even to be in the Superbow=
l. All the friends and relatives of this sadhaka were obviously rooting for=
 the local team. They were all watching the match together at a friend's ho=
use. Not being a football fan, this sadhaka stayed home alone. Though he kn=
ew nothing about football, its teams and its players, he casually picked up=
 a name from news and said to a couple of relatives on the previous day tha=
t this person (quarterback, i.e. captain, of the other small team) would do=
 well. Of course, he routinely goes wrong in this kind of hunches and he wa=
s casual about it.
 
When the match was going on, the other small team went=
 ahead in the last quarter in a low-scoring match. His relatives called him=
 and congratulated him saying your team is winning. He said good. With abou=
t 2:45 min left in the game, the local team (favorites) scored a touchdown =
and went ahead. His wife called him then and said that one of the relatives=
 was taunting the opponents' quarterback and said some insults about him. T=
his sadhaka suddenly became angry at a particular insult. He thought, "I sa=
id to them that I liked so and so quarterback and that he will do well. Why=
 should they then insult him so much?" Though it is quite irrational for so=
meone who does not follow the game and just picked up a name and casually p=
raised the name in front of some relatives, he became quite attached to the=
 idea that that quarterback should do well and prove his worth. He was quit=
e deluded and felt like *he* was being insulted and taunted and he needed t=
o do something.
 
He turned on the TV, watched the game for a few seconds, =
just sat down in a meditating posture with eyes closed and back straight an=
d started meditating with Gayatri mantra. Though it would normally take him=
 a long time to achieve focus on the mantra, he was able to achieve focus v=
ery quickly that particular time. He lost awareness of his body and his min=
d was fully absorbed in the mantra. His mind was reverberating with the man=
tra and the desire that so and so team and its quarterback should do well a=
nd win was still present in the mind as a background thought. Except for th=
at thought and the sound of the mantra, there was pretty much no other thou=
ght in the mind.
 
Suddenly, a thought arose in his mind (from where?): "en=
ough now - the job is done". That thought disturbed the focus and his shakt=
i came down. He was then aware of his body and was aware of his physical su=
rroundings. He opened his eyes and looked at the TV. Some 40-45 seconds wer=
e left in the clock. There was a touchdown within a few seconds and the oth=
er small team went ahead. The game was over.
 
In matters like this, cause =
and effect analysis is very difficult and not worth it. This sadhaka may or=
 may not have *caused* anything. But, what he experienced when his shakti r=
ose and the mind was focused is quite interesting and different from what h=
e would normally experience in such a situation. A communion between onesel=
f, a mantra and a sankalpa was achieved and it was a strange experience. Th=
e way the awareness arose that "the job is done" and the way touchdown happ=
ened a few seconds later was interesting.
 
However, that sadhaka was never=
 able to replicate that experience again. He consciously tried it with othe=
r sankalpas later, but he either did not achieve mental focus (and the resu=
ltant rise of shakti) OR he totally forgot about the sankalpa by the time m=
ental focus was achieved and shakti could rise!
 
He realized one simple fa=
ct slowly. In the normal state of being, one has several sanklapas. But one=
 is unable to fulfil them due to the dispersion of mental energy in many di=
rections. In an elevated state of being where the mental energy is focused =
and sankalpas can be fulfilled, one can only think of sankalpas that Nature=
 wills one to have and forgets all other sankalpas one may have had before.=

 
Bottomline: Forget about sankalpas and fulfilling them. Just surrender t=
o god and do sadhana. Not to accomplish this or that, but to allow Nature t=
o use one to accomplish what *Nature* wants done! There is nothing higher t=
han submitting oneself to Nature and being an instrument that allows Nature=
 to work Her will. Even if one tries to fulfil one's own will, one cannot g=
o against Nature. Synchronizing one's will with Nature's will is anyway nee=
ded for spiritual progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
