w days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one p=
erson told me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat beca=
use Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ra=
makrishna there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if sho=
uld quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave "Kamini=
" and "Kanchana", then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quo=
ted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she=
 advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just fo=
cus mind on God.

example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other =
such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all rea=
lized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are=
 knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego =
is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* wh=
at they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of di=
scussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco =
or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be s=
urely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as =
I said, they know complete background behind their each action and
>  moreo=
ver their self identification is missing from the action and hence it is li=
ke Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without bin=
ding them in any cause-effect chain.
> Ramakrishna used to frequently say t=
o all his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blaz=
ing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everyt=
hing. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without get=
ting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremel=
y important.
> If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surel=
y have some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comp=
rehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `gu=
ilt' from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted=
 by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of me=
at eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the sam=
e time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' w=
hose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unsee=
n blessings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that =
there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential =
act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By =
the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was=
 still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after =
some
