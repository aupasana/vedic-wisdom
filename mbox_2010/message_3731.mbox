Dear Biswajit,
=C2=A0
If you keep doing Mahaganapati homas regularly for a =
few months I am sure things will become better. By grace of Mahaganapati, n=
othing is impossible. Just make sure not to use any tamasik substance in th=
e fire.
=C2=A0
Do not worry about whether your homa was successful or not. =
That is not for you to judge. Keep working on devotion to Mahaganapati. Eve=
ry homa you do is like you are depositing some money into a bank account. O=
nce a certain amount of money gets deposited you will start enjoying the be=
nefits. Have faith and keep doing sadhana. 
=C2=A0
Just keep doing homas fo=
r a few months regularly and effects will=C2=A0come. 
=C2=A0
-Regards

NAMASKAR

Dear Gurujis,

I have started MAHAGANAPATI HOMAM, thou=
gh started with super-short procedure, now I am including more rituals and =
sanskrit verse from the short procedure eventually.. .

Now I am asking som=
e bare minimum questions...

1. What is the sign that my Ganapati Homam are=
 successful or not?

2. Is it possible to include more verse for prosperity=
 and peace? (as my family life in trouble) if yes, please suggest.

best re=
gards,
Biswajit
