Hola Dick,

The Universe seemingly self-organizes naturally forming dissipa=
tive structures which dynamically shift from formless to form and back agai=
n continually. Think vibration, resonance, information, and aesthetics in b=
oth the social and cultural arenas.

 tremendous gains in presentation. Now I'm looking for the group that gets

the whole idea, and has no hierarchy keeping them from talking about it.

love anything you've got after=

Thanks, mark=C2=A0 ] 

=C2=A0 

Good morning =
Mark,=C2=A0 

Mine is a strange story, and quite lengthy. One day I had
a p=
hone call from the guy who had won the Nobel Prize for uniting two of the
f=
our fundamental forces of the physical universe (the electro weak force). H=
is
name was Abdus Salam. He was the founder and director of the Internation=
al
Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste. He wanted to know if he could=
 come
to England and meet up for a day. So we did at Oxford. It was he, and=
 a few
other physicists and cosmologists who first asked me to write prose =
books. I
said no thank you very much. I am not even a writer.=C2=A0 But the=
y kept on and on so eventually I did. And all hell broke
lose, I knew it wo=
uld :- )=C2=A0 

I am not a physicist. I am a
mystic. (their word not mine)=
. From the age of three (now seventy two) I had
been having spontaneous mys=
tical and transcendent experiences. I therefore
started studying myself, co=
nsciousness, depth psychology, and other people and
society. One of my majo=
r interest has always been politics (also music and
chess). What I found wa=
s/is amazing, and there is a lot of it. It leaves Carl
Jung in Kindergarten=
. But just one of the things which I found is that
consciousness works the =
same way as does physics, and specifically found to be
so in particle annih=
ilation, symmetry breaking and symmetry establishment.
Folks seem to forget=
 that WE are a part of all this set up. We are not
something on the outside=
 looking in. WE ARE IT. Along with this the paradigm
seems to teach them th=
at we are `given' life. We are NOT given life, WE ARE
LIFE.=C2=A0=C2=A0 

A=
s to what can be proved of any
of this by way of scientific investigation a=
nd experiments I don't know, we
will have to wait and see. I am sceptical, =
but whilst always saying go for it,
and see what can be discovered that way=
. It would be foolish not to. But I do
steer clear of quasi religionists in=
 scientific garb. One day some guy wrote to
me and said he had put me on hi=
s scientific god prize list (check it out for
yourself -=C2=A0 http://www.g=
odprize .org/ ) without asking
my permission =E2=80=93 most of the others a=
re dead so they cannot argue back. I would
not have minded had it not been =
trying to substantiate jesus bloody christ et
al, and the Roman socio-polit=
ical set up of two thousand years ago. When I
asked to be taken of it they =
suddenly became very angry, rude and aggressive. I
steer clear of priestcra=
ft and their myrmidons of puppets that give them power.
Along with this I a=
m aggressively active against International Corporate Monopoly
Capitalism. =
My idea of how politics ought to be is so way out of the radar of
existing =
ideas that I would place it somewhere about two thousand years in the
futur=
e.=C2=A0 When I was three I felt sure
that I had been born either on the wr=
ong world or the right world at the wrong
time. I still feel like that seve=
nty years later :- )=C2=A0 

So, I am not the most popular
critter that eve=
r walked the face of the globe. Probably one of the most
unpopular.=C2=A0 A=
nd like Plato said
(although I do not agree with what he said in most thing=
s) it is as though they
are living in some kind of dark cave and taking sha=
dows on the wall as the
reality.=C2=A0 So, there you go :- )))) That
is a b=
rief synopsis.=C2=A0 

Why don't you get your people
together and start a c=
hat group and thrash out an agreeable language for
starters. Everybody on t=
his planet speaks a different language. That is no
damned good. In the mean=
time the world will not come right until people get
themselves right first.=
 Man's stupidities will not be eliminated until such
time that Man comes in=
to a better understanding of his mysterious
consciousness, and from whence =
it comes. The Mind and Consciousness of Man is
ever tied to the cross of Ti=
me and Eternity.=C2=A0
This is not an hypothesis or a speculation =E2=80=93=
 IT IS SO and it is there to
be found deep within us in the very ground of =
our cognitive being, where Time
cannot encroach upon its encompass. But you=
 try telling them these things and
you will be laughed off the planet, as y=
et. Homo Ensophicus is coming. But not
yet. They do not want Homo Ensophicu=
s here, for there is no profit in that.
Tell your countrymen these things, =
for they are all dead over here.=C2=A0
