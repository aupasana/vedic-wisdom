Ramana when living in Subrahmanya temple after he shifted from Patala
Linga=
m.After spending some weeks at this shrine Ramana moved to the
adjoining fl=
ower garden.

Finally, Ramana moved to the hall where the vehicles for the =
temple
processions were kept (vahana mantapam).

After some time Ramana lef=
t the vahana mantapam and sat under the Illupai
tree which was inside the o=
uter wall of the southern temple tower. The path
used for the temple proces=
sions passed nearby.

Here Ramana was fully exposed to the weather. Sometim=
es a cold wind blew and
his body would be covered with dew. To protect hims=
elf against the cold he
would cross his arms about the upper part of his na=
ked body. Later he
reflected that no woollen blanket could compare to the a=
rms laid across the
chest and that this was the first upper garment that he=
 used.

At the following Kartikai festival Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s first disci=
ple, Uddandi
Nayinar, arrived and became a permanent companion.He took care=
 of his bodily
needs and prevented him from being disturbed or bothered. He=
 settled down at
a short distance from him,observed the crowds of visitors =
for hours at a
time and drove away the urchins who found it amusing to caus=
e trouble for
the young ascetic. He also cooked simple meals, which he shar=
ed with him.

It was because of Uddandi Nayinar that Annamalai Tambiran fir=
st noticed
Ramana.

One day, as he was walking past the Illupai tree he saw=
 the young Swami
sitting there and was deeply impressed, from that day on h=
e accompanied
Uddandi Nayinar.

Finally they both suggested to Sri Ramana t=
hat he should move to Gurumurtam.
There he could meditate undisturbed as th=
e place was secluded and in
addition offered better protection from the col=
d. Ramana agreed and in
February 1897,not quite six months after his arriva=
l at Tiruvannamalai, he
left the temple area and was brought to Gurumurtam =
by Tambiran and Uddandi.

At times Tambiran, due to his devout but excessiv=
e veneration,became a
nuisance to Sri Ramana. One day he made preparations =
to render homage to his
new guru like to one of the idols of the goddesses =
in the temple
(abhishekam). He obtained flowers, oil,sandal paste, milk and=
 other
ingredients and actually wanted to pour this over the head of his =
=E2=80=9Cliving
god=E2=80=9D. To prevent this, Ramana took a piece of charc=
oal and the next day,
before Tambiran arrived, wrote on the wall in Tamil, =
=E2=80=9CThis [food] alone is
the service [needed] for this [body].=E2=80=
=9D

So Tambiran was forced to abandon his plan. Through this incident peop=
le
learned that the silent Swami was educated and able to read and write.

=
Amongst the admirers who had started to visit Ramana regularly,was a
highly=
-placed official called Venkataramana Iyer. When he realized that the
Swami=
 was able to write, he felt he must find out his name and where he came
fro=
m. But Ramana, despite repeated questioning, remained silent. Iyer
finally =
explained that he would not leave until his questions were answered,
even i=
f that meant that he would have to go hungry and get into trouble
because o=
f his lengthy absence from his office. This moved the young Swami
and he wr=
ote down the words, =E2=80=9CVenkataraman, Tiruchuli=E2=80=9D. The place,
h=
owever, was unknown to the official. So Ramana reached for the
Periyapurana=
m, which was lying at his side, and pointed out Tiruchuli as the
name of a =
village, whose temple was honoured in the famous hymn by
Sundaramurti (one =
of the 63 Tamil saints). Thus,not only the official but
Tambiram and all th=
ose present discovered his name and his origins. From now
on Ramana was no =
longer nameless and unknown.

Ramana was absorbed in deep samadhi most of t=
he time unaware of his body,
which he neglected, completely disregarding hi=
s outward appearance. He was
filthy, his hair had grown very long and had b=
ecome a dishevelled and matted
mass and his fingernails had grown so long a=
nd crooked, that he was unable
to use his hands for any useful purpose. Nei=
ther Tambiran nor Uddandi did
anything about this and he himself felt no ne=
ed to change his bodily
condition. Only later, when Palaniswami took care o=
f him, did the daily bath
become a routine.

Once, however, he was forced t=
o bathe and on another occasion to have a
shave, =E2=80=9CEven so, a lady, =
by name Minakshi, who used now and then to bring
food to give me, one day b=
rought a large pot and began to boil water. I
thought it was for some use f=
or herself,but, taking from a basket some oil,
soap-nut, etc., she said,=E2=
=80=98Swami, please come=E2=80=99. I did not move. But would she
keep quiet=
! She pulled me by the arm, made me sit, smeared the oil all over
my body a=
nd bathed me. The hair on the head which had got matted for want of
care, w=
as now spread out and hung down like the mane of a lion. =E2=80=A6 Shaving
=
was also like that. The shave I had on the day I came here has been
recorde=
d; the second was after a year and a half. The hair had got matted
and wove=
n like a basket. Small stones and dust had settled down in it and
the head =
used to feel heavy. I had also long nails, and a frightful
appearance. So p=
eople pressed me to have a shave, and I yielded. When my
head was shaven cl=
ean, I began to wonder whether I had a head or not, it
felt so light. I sho=
ok my head this way and that to assure myself that it
was there. That showe=
d the amount of burden I had been carrying on my head.=E2=80=9D

The place =
where Ramana sat was infested with ants, but he took no notice of
them as t=
hey crawled over his body and bit him incessantly.After a while his
devotee=
s sat him on a stool against the wall. To keep the ants away they
placed th=
e legs of the stool in jugs of water, but to no avail, as the ants
merely r=
an up the wall and bit his back. To this day the imprint of his back
can be=
 seen where he sat leaning against the wall.

During the first two months s=
pent in Gurumurtam, Tambiram used to give him
some of the food which had be=
en offered at the Gurumurtam shrine. But then
Tambiran went away, after fir=
st asking Uddandi to look after the Swami. He
promised to be back in a
week=
 but, in fact, only returned a year later. Some weeks after he left,
Uddand=
i also had to return to his own math. So suddenly no one was there to
care =
for Ramana. But, as a result of his increasing fame, food was always
brough=
t to him. After the departures of both Tambiran and Uddandi the only
proble=
m was that there was no-one there to keep the crowds away. This
problem was=
 finally solved when Palaniswami joined him.

Palaniswami was a Malayali fr=
om Kerala and at least 20 years older than Sri
Ramana. He paid homage to th=
e idol of Goddess Ganesha in a temple in the
town. His only food was food w=
hich had been offered to Ganesha, which
consisted of a single meal a day, t=
o which he added no spices, not even
salt. Someone noticed his devotion to =
the Goddess and said, =E2=80=9CWhat is the use
of spending your lifetime wi=
th this stone Swami? There is a young Swami in
flesh and blood at Gurumurta=
m. He is steeped in austerities (tapas) like the
youthful Dhruva mentioned =
in the puranas. If you go and serve him, and
adhere to him, your life would=
 serve its purpose.=E2=80=9D Others also drew his
attention to the fact tha=
t the Swami was without an attendant at the time
and that it would be a ble=
ssing to serve such a great soul. Spurred on in
this way Palaniswami went t=
o Gurumurtam.

Some time in May 1898, after a little over one year spent at=

Gurumurtam,Ramana and Palaniswami moved to the adjoining mango grove. Here=

they spent several peaceful months undisturbed by the numerous visitors, a=
s
Venkataraman Naicker, the owner of the garden, let no-one enter who had n=
ot
been asked in. There they lived in two narrow sheds under a mango tree. =
Ramana
remembers,=E2=80=9CUnder a mango tree they erected something overhea=
d to prevent
rain from falling on me. There was, however, not enough space =
under it even
to stretch my legs fully while sleeping. So I used to sit alm=
ost all the
time like a bird in its nest. Opposite my shelter Palaniswami a=
lso had a
small shed. In the huge garden, only two of us used to stay.

Pal=
aniswami, who had access to a library in town, brought back a number of
boo=
ks in Tamil on Vedanta, such as Kaivalya Navaneeta,Yoga Vasistha and
Shanka=
ras Vivekachudamani.But, as his knowledge of Tamil was not very good,
he us=
ed to struggle through the scriptures word by word and often had
difficulti=
es in understanding.Ramana read each of the books, immediately
grasped the =
meaning,remembered everything and imparted the essence of it to
Palaniswami=
. In this way Ramana gradually learned about all the important
Vedanta scri=
ptures and discovered that his personal experience corresponded
with them. =
The experience he had had on the upper floor of his uncle=E2=80=99s house
i=
n Madurai was exactly the same as the experiences he found described in the=

scriptures.
