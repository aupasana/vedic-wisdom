	Non-duality

 Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference
[b=
heda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.
[Therefore]=
 it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of
non-duality, hav=
ing attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through negation
[of the =
non-Self].

Sadhu Om: The nature of jiva is to think that fear will be remo=
ved only when
there is some other person with him. But this idea is foolish=
. How can there
be cause for fear in the state of Self, where no other thin=
g exists?

Only in a state where there exists something other than oneself =
is it
possible for one either to have desire for that thing or to have fear=
 of it.
Therefore, true fearlessness can be attained only in the non-dual s=
tate of
Self, where no other thing exists.

To illustrate how fearlessness =
can be attained only when one attains the
state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used =
to narrate the following story:

After Lord Vishnu had killed Hiranya, Hira=
nya=E2=80=99s son Prahlada was happily
ruling the kingdom.

But after some =
time, a fear arose in Prahlada. =E2=80=9CBecause Lord Vishnu is kind
to me,=
 I am living safely. But if one day He becomes angry with me, He will
kill =
me just as He killed my father,=E2=80=9D thought Prahlada.

Being a great d=
evotee of Lord Vishnu, Prahlada had no one else to turn to,
so he
prayed to=
 Him. The Lord immediately appeared before Prahlada,who then
explained his =
fear and prayed for the state of fearlessness.

=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said=
 Lord Vishnu, =E2=80=9CYou are correct. By seeing me like this in name
and =
form, you cannot be free from fear.

You must see me within yourself. Only =
when you thus realize me to be not
different from yourself, will you attain=
 the state of fearlessness=E2=80=9D. Then
the Lord taught him the path of S=
elf-enquiry. When Prahlada followed the
Lord=E2=80=99s instructions and rea=
lized Self, he attained the state of
fearlessness.

This story thus illustr=
ates that even God cannot serve as permanent refuge
from fear so long as on=
e retains the sense of difference [bheda-buddhi].
Only by attaining the non=
-dual Self can one become truly and permanently
free from fear.
