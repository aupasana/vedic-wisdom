Namaste,

> Feel free to=A0ask questions about the practical details of sad=
hana.

Very well then.  My first and major concern is regarding the fire it=
self.  I live in a small, one-room apartment.  I have a door I could open, =
but the window I have is fairly overrun with vegetation.

I have a small po=
rch I could conceivably use, but it is open to the public, even though it i=
s opposite the main roadway.  None of my neighbors is, to my knowledge at l=
east, Hindu.  

Does the homam create a fair amount of smoke and/or odor?  =
(I would of course disconnect my fire alarm, it goes off when I am cooking =
sometimes!)  Would it be best done indoors or out of doors, given my situat=
ion?  I am thinking of buying some sort of stone or ceramic slab to put the=
 kundam onto just to be safe in I do it indoors (rather than just the woode=
n plank suggested in the instructions).

Also, would I need to memorize the=
 Sanskrit invocations and the procedure, or would using a printed copy of t=
he instructions be acceptable?  I obviously would want to do the former eve=
ntually, but is the latter ok when just starting out?

Just a few questions=
 to start with.  As I said previously, it may be a while before I am ready =
to perform the homam, but just thinking ahead and making preparations!
