The Samkhya philosophy says that the entire universe is composed of the thr=
ee gunas - sattva, rajas and tamas.The five tattvas are also the evolutes o=
f these gunas. 

The three gunas are said to make up not only the physical =
world but also the non-physical world like the mind, chitta etc A chapter i=
n the gita enumerates the dominance of different kinds of gunas and their e=
ffects.

However we know that matter is made out of molecules, atoms, elect=
rons etc. 

How do we reconcile the two theories?

Is it possible that the =
Samkhya philosophy is stating the composition of the universe as seen from =
the mind? After all everything, in order to be perceived, has to be "seen" =
by the mind. And as far as the image of the object created in the mind is c=
oncerned, there can be no question of atoms and molecules there. So matter =
being composed of the three gunas is actually not the physical matter but t=
he constitution of the image of matter created in the mind.

Is something l=
ike this the case?

with regards
