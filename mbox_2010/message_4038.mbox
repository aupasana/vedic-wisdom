Talk 209.

Mr. B. C. Das, the Physics Lecturer, asked about free-will and d=
estiny.

M.: Whose will is it? =E2=80=98It is mine=E2=80=99, you may say. Y=
ou are beyond will and
fate. Abide as that and you transcend them both. Tha=
t is the meaning of
conquering destiny by will. Fate can be conquered.Fate =
is the result of past
actions. By association with the wise the bad tendenc=
ies are conquered.
One=E2=80=99s experiences are then viewed to their prope=
r perspective.

I exist now. I am the enjoyer. I enjoy fruits of action. I =
was in the past
and shall be in the future. Who is this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=
? Finding this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 to be pure
Consciousness beyond action a=
nd enjoyment, freedom and happiness are gained.
There is then no effort, fo=
r the Self is perfect and there remains nothing
more to gain.

So long as t=
here is individuality, one is the enjoyer and doer. But if it is
lost, the =
divine Will prevails and guides the course of events.

The individual is pe=
rceptible to others who cannot perceive divine force.
Restrictions and disc=
ipline are for other individuals and not for the
liberated.

Free-will is i=
mplied in the scriptural injunctions to be good. It implies
overcoming fate=
. It is done by wisdom. The fire of wisdom consumes all
actions. Wisdom is =
acquired by association with the wise, or rather, its
mental atmosphere.

S=
ource: Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book

More Over in In verse 19 of Ulladu =
Narpadu

Ramana says that the dispute whether fate (vidhi) or free will (ma=
ti)
prevails is of interest only to those who do not know the (mulam) =E2=
=80=94 the
root, base, foundation, origin or source =E2=80=94 of both fate =
and free will
(namely the mind, which misuses its free will and experiences=
 whatever fate
results therefrom), and that those who have known the truth =
of this mind
have thereby separated themselves from fate and free will and =
will not
hereafter become entangled with them again. In other words,fate an=
d free
will appear to exist only so long as our mind appears to exist, but =
when we
scrutinise this mind and thereby know the truth that it does not re=
ally
exist, fate and free will will also cease to exist.
