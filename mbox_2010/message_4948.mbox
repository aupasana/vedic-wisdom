JAI
MAA,



Thank
you for a UNITED FRONT from all Sanatan Dharmi all ove=
r the world; we were able
to receive an apology from the manufactures of
th=
e shoes plus the removal of the sale of the so called OFFENSIVE
shoes.

 

=
My request for every one
who is directly or indirectly; born Hindu, practic=
ing Hindu,
every one who is any form or fashion associated with Yoga, Medit=
ation, Pranayan
etc - to take few minutes time from their busy daily life a=
nd take
the first step to educate those who are not aware of the values of =
Sanata
Dharma.

 

1 - Do a research (on internet) to find local businesses=
. If possible - advise them of the core
value of Sanatan Dharma (i.e why ha=
ving pictures of our deity on a shoe or
toilet cover is offensive to us).

=
 

2- I am requesting all
my fellow brothers and sisters (Sanata Dharmi)  w=
ho are in contact with
politician; anywhere in the world, If possible - adv=
ise them of the core
value of Sanatan Dharma (i.e why having pictures of ou=
r deity on a shoe or
toilet cover is offensive is offensive to us).

 

3 -=
 A letter or plain
gentle suggestion will suffice. 

 

I am a great fan of=

Respected Dalai Lama - He represents and lives the life of our four VEDA. =
Today
the plight of Tibetans is in the mind of all conscious people all
ove=
r the world. We all can follow his footsteps in this respect and advise our=

tradesmen and lawmakers.

 

This kind of action
needs to be stopped at th=
e grassroot level.
Gururbrahmaa gururvishnuh gururdevo Maheswarah |

saakshaat parabrahma tasmai shrigurave namah || 



Om,
