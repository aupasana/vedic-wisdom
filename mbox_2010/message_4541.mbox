Namaste,
=C2=A0
If knowing a deity or having God-communion or self-knowledg=
e (aatma gyan) has not produced a sense of internal=C2=A0detachment to thin=
gs material, money etc,=C2=A0then there is still a lot of ground to cover s=
piritually. Detachment is never neglect of Dharma. But performing ones dhar=
ma with zero attachments. =C2=A0That is what Krishna has taught us to do.=
=C2=A0If that state has been achieved, it is excellent. If not, keep trying=
.
