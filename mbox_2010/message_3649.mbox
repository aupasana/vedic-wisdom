Namaste Rajarshi,
Thanks for responding to my query. I have some follow up quesitons.
1) If I do Chandi homam with only specific chapters do I need to modify the sankalpam in any way. If Yes please let me know what is the correct method.
2) Do I have to say just a normal swaha or swahah (with intonation) after each verse. 
3) I dont have any idol for Chandi but I do have a photo of my kuladevi (Said to be a Durga manifestation). Can I use this photo instead of the Idol in the homam. Whats the correct translation of the word "Photo" in Sanskrit and how do I use it while doing avahanam and udhvasanam.

It would be really great and useful to many beginner sadhakas like me if there is a chandi homam video similar to the one that Narasimhaji has uploaded for ganapathi homam. Maybe not for the entire Chandi recitation but the introductory parts along with nyasa would be really helpful. Request you and Narasimhaji to kindly consider this request.

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
