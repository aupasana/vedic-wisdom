Dear Manish
=C2=A0
The good part of Kali Yuga is as Vimalananda says, sadha=
na probably work faster and God realization maybe possible in shorter span =
of time than in previous ages.

I lea=
rnt a very good thing today from Narasimha's message. What will be our cond=
ition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.

***
You have passionately r=
aised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thin=
g i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes g=
ives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a =
Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers=
, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and doe=
s not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmac=
harya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.
I whole hea=
rtedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in hi=
s 'Satyana Prayogo' about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matt=
ers. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in soc=
iety. He really was a Saadhu.

There is a big difference between fall of a =
Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn't=
 fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us, t=
hen a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of the w=
hole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to fa=
iths of general public.

I am not specific on Satyananda here because i do =
not know if it is really true.

If the footage is right, then i fancy here =
that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan D=
harma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corruption is fi=
nally controlled and reduced to very minimum.

> Further, in this age of Ka=
li the karmas and rnas have become so >twisted and 

You have spoken the tr=
uth. The world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 years ba=
ck. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul like=
 Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desir=
es.

Finally, i would say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger =
claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma =
Gandhi's bold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is =
*One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )

It reminds me of S=
ant Tukaaram's famous line
"Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule"

te KK,<BR>> <BR>> No matter how genuine the video may look, let us gi=
ve the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa
 Nithyananda and not jump to conclus=
ions as someone said.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> *Even if* his=
 expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from=
 Mahamaya's web. He is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a =
charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaini=
ng high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his wea=
knesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent kn=
owledge and rare wisdom. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time co=
mes for a test?<BR>> <BR>> No matter how much one has read, no matter=
 how much one has understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no m=
atter how many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experienc=
es one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most of t=
he time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Tak=
e your mind off god for a second
 and you CAN fall. When we are not in a st=
ate where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then wh=
y should we judge others?<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> The most =
important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a=
 dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who mak=
e good progress in the coming years and people around them may start notici=
ng their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by=
 name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of=
 a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one=
 allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one t=
hing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.<BR>> <BR>>=
; * * *<BR>> <BR>> Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses a=
nd fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we=
 instead discuss his
 teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not =
suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spi=
ritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Perhaps an increase of dharma is not pos=
sible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in key places.=
 We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her ways are defi=
nitely inscrutable.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>>=
