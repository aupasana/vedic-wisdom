Namaste Narasimha Garu,

following is direct extract from the MahaGanapati =
Homam Manual:
"
>From the middle of the western edge of the homam kundam, dr=
aw two parallel red lines with kumkum (vermilion) powder towards your seat.=
 They should go east-west and connect homa kundam to your seat. Melt the gh=
ee and place the bowl containing it on those lines.
"

Due to technical res=
trictions, i am not able to effectively observe the above aspect given in t=
he Manual. My Havan Kunda is on Bricks or on a metalic Stand due to which i=
t does not make feasible to connect The Havan Kund and Asana. How important=
 this aspect is w.r.t. connection of external fire with Internal fire? i am=
 hardly observing this rule. Any thoughts/suggetions on this?


Best Regard=
s,

Utpal
