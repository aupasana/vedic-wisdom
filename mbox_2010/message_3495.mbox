Dear shri narasimhaji and shri Rajarishis nandiji,
After going thro the exp=
eriences of Shri Manish at Kasi, I am wonderstruck.
I also like to add to t=
he query raised by SHri Acharayalu.
Only in Hindu religion(most of the cast=
es) they cremate the body whereas
in other religions they are buried after =
doing the last religious rites. Does
their soul wander? Can a similair sadh=
ana is possible on a body which is 
buried and not creamted?
I also llike t=
o add from one of the mails in another group wherein the writer
has said th=
at the entire Kasi is filled up with shiva linga ie wherever u dig
the grou=
nd after some depth u find Shiva lingam and that is the reason
the whole of=
 Kasi is energised and also in spite of caracass floating in
Ganges at Kasi=
 yet the water is never polluted because of presence
of shiva lingam.
=C2=
=A0
regards,
k.gopu

Dear Rajarshi,

=C2=A0 Namaste. What an inspiring recita=
tion of the experiences. After reading the third day's experience about the=
 "MOKUL", I wonder, is there religion among SPIRITS also.....I mean there a=
re spirits of all religions floating around....I was, in my limited knowled=
ge, thinking that the religion is only to the body...Please shed some light=
 on this...

=C2=A0 Narasimhaji, can you please enlighten on this...

=C2=
=A0 Thanks a lot for sharing these experiences. .

Acharyulu
