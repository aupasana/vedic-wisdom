Dear Rajarshi Ji,

=C2=A0 Thanks indeed for the reply. O.K. I understand th=
at the Yakshas / Mokuls/ Angels are all different beings altogether as you =
have said.... that leads me to more confusion about oneness of God. Then, w=
ho is the highest God?

=C2=A0 Also, I have another query about the presenc=
e of the "Mighty Bull". Did Manish Ji tell anything about not choosing that=
 place and chosen other end of the shamshan. My query is when Manikarnika w=
as entirely protected by Shiva as it was revealed by Manish Ji , what was i=
t causing this situation wherein you felt uncomfortable and Manish Ji lead =
you to the other end of the Shamshan. 

=C2=A0 Thank you very much in advan=
ce for answering the query which lead me to more profound confusion. Thanks=
 again,

Acharyulu

      Namaste Acharyulu,
=C2=A0
I can only take a guess at repl=
ying to this. What I say may or maynot be correct.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Generally,=
 what is called a Yaksha/Yakshini, an Angel in Christianity and a Mokul in =
Islam, are beings of similar potential.=C2=A0 In different religions, we wi=
ll find that the descriptions of different planes like heaven and hell are =
provided differently, and it is not just people who reach=C2=A0there after =
death, but there are beings in different realms who are born in these plane=
s and exist their in totality. If they were all equal, why are descriptions=
 provided of these places different in different cultures? Maybe because, i=
n the world of duality there is much more than what meets the five human se=
nses. 
=C2=A0
The mind that we have, may not end when the body ends, simila=
r at the different realms there could well be a similar operating software =
(like our human mind) through which things are percieved and things appear =
as diverse or more than what we experience in this realm. The world of dual=
ity is indeed complex. Often what happens in this plane has a precursor in =
the astral worlds, good or bad, it is said. Aurobindo mentions this in his =
writings clearly. So it is possible that there are ethereal beings in diffe=
rent realms who self identify with different astral aspects of our world.=
=C2=A0Bottomline, the world of duality is immensely complex.=C2=A0=C2=A0

=C2=A0
I am not sure if it answers your query apty, but I just gave it a ho=
nest shot.

Dear =
Rajarshi,

=C2=A0 Namaste. What an inspiring recitation of the experiences.=
 After reading the third day's experience about the "MOKUL", I wonder, is t=

=C2=A0 Nara=
