Thanks for your thoughts. Indulge me here, I couldn't help but=
 think what I would've done if I were FL in your example below: I would be =
inclined for option #2 you listed out under regular circumstance; however g=
iven on what basis the money was given, i.e. for  pious cause, I would feel=
 that it belongs to Mother and would be comfortable with resorting to all t=
actics (Vasuli, like you so aptly describe) to make sure it does reach the =
right destination/cause.
In cases like these (or in cases where you see gro=
ss injustice being meted out), does not one's dharma override any karma iss=
ues?

 If one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is associated with naked me=
n/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex in a di=
fferent way. This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras.

a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a pr=
actical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by s=
etting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for=
 all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel att=
raction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an unders=
tanding brings.=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, thou=
gh it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The bas=
ic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries t=
o accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making failu=
re very unpleasant.

interesting to read in the context of aghora.

 Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I st=

 much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wro=

 can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, i=

tra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari,=
 a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes dail=
y ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that ta=
kes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? I=
s Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain wha=
t is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn wha=
t the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vid=
ya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of =
Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.
