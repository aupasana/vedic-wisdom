ning para. Sorry for the confusion.

      Dear Sri NarasimhA, 



Last year, when it was =
the beginning of uttarAyaNam, our local temple priest organized an upAkarma=
 ritual for us south Indian brahmins over here in Michigan. Now, he has lef=
t our city - so I turn to you for help. I know just the mantras for changin=
g the sacred thread and I chant the savitru gayatri mantra for a thousand t=
imes. Last year, our priest made the brahmachAris do a homam with the same =
mantra a thousand times but said the householders should only do a japam, a=
lthough at other times I do offer gayatri mantra in almost every homam that=
 I do. Now, I need guidance from you in some aspects, if you could help me.=
 



1. I have two sons, whose upanayanam is done. I want them make them do=
 a homam with thousand times Gayatri mantra while I want to chant the mantr=
a with them. Can I also join in the homam? 



2. Can you guide us how to r=
ecite the mahasankalpa, kAnDa rishi tarpaNas etc. (essentially the whole up=
Akarma procedure, if possible)



Also, I was told that upakarma is done be=
cause vedas are not supposed to be studied in uttarAyana (as this time is e=
armarked for studying shad-angas and other sastras/itihasas), but vedic sch=
ools do study anyway because they must finish the syllabus in time and henc=
e as a prAyaschitta they do perform this upAkarma. But now a days, with no =
one studying vedas, (at least in our family) is it still relevant to do thi=
s? In any case, I think it is a good idea at least to change the sacred thr=
ead and chant the Gayatri mantra to the best of our ability on that day. Co=
uld you please advise us as to how to carry out that project? 



Also, I h=
ave one trivial question, what is "dwitIya parArthE" ? as it comes in dwitI=
ya parArthE, swEtha varAha kalpE, vaivaswata manvantarE .... and so on. I k=
now the rest of them, but confused about this phrase!
