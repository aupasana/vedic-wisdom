 35. =E2=80=98Like ether, I am always pervading all, in and out, unswerving=
, ever
equal in all, pure, untainted, clear and unshaken.

36. =E2=80=98Tha=
t which remains eternal, pure, ever-free, all alone, unbroken bliss,
non-du=
al, Being-Consciousness-Bliss, transcendent Brahman (the same) am I=E2=80=
=99.

37. Long, constant practice of =E2=80=98I am Brahman only=E2=80=99 de=
stroys all vasanas
(latent tendencies), born of ignorance as an efficacious=
 remedy (rasayana)
eradicates a disease.

38. Be dispassionate, keep the se=
nses under control and let the mind not
wander; sit in a solitary place and=
 meditate on the Self as infinite and one
alone.

39. Keep the mind pure; w=
ith keen intellect, resolve all that is objective
into the Self and always =
meditate on the Self as clear and single like
ether.

40. Having discarded =
all names and forms, you are now the knower of the
Supreme Being and will r=
emain as perfect Consciousness-Bliss.

41. Being the same as Consciousness-=
Bliss, there is no longer any
differentiation such as the knower and the kn=
own; and the Self shines forth
as Itself.

42. If in this manner by process=
 of constant meditation,the two pieces of
wood, namely the Self and the ego=
 are rubbed together, the flames from the
fire of knowledge burn away the w=
hole range of ignorance.

43. On knowledge destroying ignorance in this way=
, like the light of dawn
scattering the darkness of night, the Self will ri=
se like the sun in all its
glory.

44. True, the Self is always here and no=
w; yet it is not apparent, owing to
ignorance. On ignorance being destroyed=
 the Self seems as if it were gained,
like the necklace on one=E2=80=99s ow=
n neck.

45. Just as in darkness a post is mistaken for a man, so is Brahma=
n in
ignorance mistaken for a jiva. If, however, the true nature of a jiva =
is
seen, delusion vanishes.

46. Knowledge arising on the experience of rea=
lity immediately destroys the
ignorant perception of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 an=
d =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, which resemble the delusion of
direction in darkn=
ess.

47. A jnani who is a perfectly Self-realized yogi, sees by the eye of=
 wisdom
all objective phenomena to be in and of the Self and thus the Self =
to be the
sole being.

How does he then act in the world?

48. Just as clay=
 is the only material from which different utensils are
formed (such as pot=
s, jars, etc.), so he sees that the Self, too, is the
whole universe and th=
ere is nothing but the Self.

49. In order to be liberated while yet alive,=
 the sage should completely
eschew the adjuncts (upadhis), and thus gain th=
e real nature of
Being-Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into=
 a wasp.

50. Having crossed the ocean of illusion and having killed the de=
mons of
likes and dislikes, the yogi, now united to shanti (peace), finds d=
elight in
the Self and so remains in his own glory.

51. The jivanmukta, fr=
eed from all desire for transient,external pleasures,
delights in his own S=
elf and remains clear and steady a like lamp in a pot.

52. Like the akasa =
(ether) which remains untainted by the objects contained
therein, the muni =
(sage) remains untainted by the adjuncts (upadhis)
covering him. Being the
=
all-knower he remains like one that knows not, and moves about like the air=

uncontaminated by the objects it touches.

53. On the dissolution of the a=
djuncts (the body, senses,etc.), the sage now
freed from particularities me=
rges in the all-permeating Being (Vishnu), like
water in water, ether in et=
her or fire in fire.

54. There is no gain over and above this gain, no ple=
asure over and above
this bliss, no knowledge over and above this knowledge=
, know this to be
Brahman.

55. That on seeing which nothing remains to see=
, on becoming which there is
no more return to samsara, on knowing which no=
thing remains to know, know
that to be Brahman.

56. What fills everything,=
 above, below and around, itself
Being-Consciousness-Bliss, non-dual, infin=
ite, eternal, one only, know that
to be Brahman.

57. What remains as immut=
able, unbroken Bliss, and as one only, that which
even the scriptures indir=
ectly denote by the process of elimination as =E2=80=98not
this, not this=
=E2=80=99, know the same to be Brahman.

58. Dependent on a fraction of the=
 inexhaustible Bliss of the Atman, all the
gods such as Brahma enjoy bliss =
according to their grades.

59. Like the butter in milk, the objective univ=
erse is contained in it; all
the activities are based on it alone. Therefor=
e Brahman is all-pervading.

60. What is neither subtle nor gross, short no=
r long,produced nor spent,
what is devoid of form, attribute, caste and nam=
e, know it to be Brahman.

61. By whose light the sun and other luminaries =
shine forth, but which is
not itself illumined by them and in whose light a=
ll this is seen, know it to
be Brahman.

62. Like fire in a piece of red-ho=
t iron, Brahman permeates the whole world
in and out and all through, makes=
 it shine and itself also shines by itself.

63. Brahman is distinct from t=
he universe, yet there remains nothing apart
from Brahman. Should any other=
 than Brahman appear, it is only an illusion
like water in a mirage.

64. W=
hatever is seen or heard, it cannot be different from Brahman. True
knowled=
ge finds Brahman to be Being-Consciousness-Bliss and one without a
second.
=

65. Only the eye of wisdom can see the omnipresent
Being-Consciousness-Bli=
ss, but not the eye of ignorance for a blind eye
cannot see the sun.

66. L=
ike gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities
burnt =
away by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by sravana,
manan=
a and nidhidhyasana (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he
shin=
es forth by himself.

67. Because the sun of knowledge, the chaser of darkn=
ess has risen, the
Atman shines in the expanse of the Heart as the omnipres=
ent sustainer of all
and illumines all.

68. He who bathes in the clear, wa=
rm, ever-refreshing waters of the Atman,
which being available everywhere, =
here and now, need not be sought for in
special centres and seasons; such a=
 one remains actionless. He is the knower
of all; he pervades all and is ev=
er immortal.
