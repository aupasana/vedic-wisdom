Young man from Colombo asked Bhagavan,=E2=80=9CHow are the three states of
=
consciousness inferior in degree of reality to the fourth? What is the
actu=
al relation between these three states and the fourth?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =
There is only one state, that of consciousness or awareness or
existence. T=
he three states of waking, dream and sleep cannot be real. They
simply come=
 and go. The real will always exist. The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or existence t=
hat
alone persists in all the three states is real. The other three are not=
 real
and so it is not possible to say they have such and such a degree of
=
reality.

We may roughly put it like this.Existence or consciousness is the=
 only
reality. Consciousness plus waking, we call waking.Consciousness plus=
 sleep,
we call sleep. Consciousness plus dream, we call dream.

Consciousn=
ess is the screen on which all the pictures come and go. The
screen is real=
, the pictures are mere shadows on it.Because by long habit we
have been re=
garding these three states as real, we call the state of mere
awareness or =
consciousness as the fourth. There is however no fourth
state,but only one =
state.

In this connection Bhagavan quoted one verse composed By Thayumanav=
ar and
said this
so-called fourth state is described as waking sleep or sle=
ep in waking =E2=80=94
meaning asleep to the world and awake in the Self.
