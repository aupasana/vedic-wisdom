Namaste

If I can add to the email reply.  The sweating or hot sensation t=
hat you
were feeling could be related to the japam or completely unrelated =
it is
difficult to classify it based on limited occurance.  Unless it gets
=
really bothersome or creates some medical anxiety for you it is best to
ign=
ore.

Sadhakas doing japam regularly and with lot of focus and devotion can=

experience some cleansing or energy sensations and this could be
experienc=
ed through feelings of being hot or running a temperature or
even having va=
rious sensations (hot or cold) in your feet or head region
such as forehead=
 and eyes.  This is more so in the case where the japam
is that of an ugra =
devata.  As an example, there are mantras prescribed
for Narasimha or even =
Hanumanji for warding off fever and a person doing
such mantras, example wi=
th "Kshraum" beeja of Narasimha, if done
properly, may produce sweat and he=
nce fever may be reduced.

Since you experienced your sensations only a few=
 times I would not worry
too much.  As Narasimha says regularly the objecti=
ve is to not get
distracted by what is happening to you and around you, rat=
her it is to
lessen the self identification of ego with your physical body =
and to
move towards identification with a specific diety or state of
consci=
ousness.

Best regards

Sumeet
