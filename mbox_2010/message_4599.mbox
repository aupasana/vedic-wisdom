 She carries herself with a special dignity, born from the peace of deep
de=
votion. This is what we feel when Ramani Ammal walks past us at Sri
Ramanas=
ramam. The spiritual aspirations which consumed her since her
childhood hav=
e blossomed into a graceful flower of virtue and self poise. In
this interv=
iew, videotaped in December of 1989, she briefly told us her life
story.

Q=
uestioner: Please tell us about how you first came to Ramanasramam.

Ramani=
 Ammal: My chosen deity in childhood was Lord Krishna. From my youth I
had =
very pleasant dreams and would sometimes see Lord Krishna or other
familiar=
 deities in these dreams. But at the age of sixteen or seventeen I
once saw=
 a strange sage-like person coming down a hill and was captivated by
his gr=
andeur. I later came to realize that this sage was Sri Bhagavan.

After hav=
ing that vision of Bhagavan in my dream, a certain fear that had
gripped me=
 for some time all of a sudden disappeared. My relatives and
others noticed=
 this and commented how I was now moving about freely. This
was Bhagavan's =
first influence on me.

Also, at the age of sixteen I was reading the Jnana=
 Vasishta. While reading
it I experienced that I was enveloped in jyoti, a =
bright white light. I
thought that if this is what happens just by reading =
it, how much more
wonderful would it be if we practised dhyana and the othe=
r spiritual
injunctions taught in the book. I used to be thrilled simply by=
 reading
those ancient Tamil scriptures. But it wasn't until I was twenty b=
efore I
got hold of a book on Bhagavan.

Kumaraswami Raja, the Chief Minist=
er of Madras, who was a cousin of mine,
brought me Bharati's biography of B=
hagavan, Ramana Vijayam, in 1946. Mrs.
Kumaraswami Raja was very fond of me=
, and though other relatives prohibited
me from reading spiritual books, sh=
e used to stealthily supply me with them.
The day she sent this book over w=
ith a boy, I was sitting in the house with
a friend, a headmistress, who th=
ough Christian, was sincerely interested in
our religion.

The boy who brou=
ght the book said, "Mami said to hand this book to you." I
got up and went =
up to the gate to receive it. The moment I touched the book
I lost body con=
sciousness. My whole body became stiff. I somehow managed to
return and sit=
 next to my friend. Noticing my plight, she commented that I
shouldn't read=
 such books that make me forget myself. Everyone was
complaining about this=
 same thing, for in those days most of the time I
would be sitting quietly,=
 alert to my spiritual aspirations. All thought
that I was simply idle with=
 no work to do.

With difficulty I opened Ramana Vijayam to the first page =
and was met by the
photo of the young Ramana. I became speechless. My frien=
d, who was somewhat
alarmed at my condition, had to leave and I somehow saw=
 her off. With great
reverence I took the book and started reading it. As I=
 read, my eyes kept
closing involuntarily, and I was drawn within, which I =
later came to know
was meditation. Bhagavan taught me meditation in this wa=
y.

After reading this book, I felt I should leave home and go meet Ramana
=
Maharshi. It is my family custom that women never even leave the house, not=

to mention leaving the town. That vairagya, or desperate determination to
=
leave my house for spiritual fulfilment, was implanted in me by this book;
=
and I am sure it was by the direct influence of Sri Bhagavan himself.

Beca=
use of my intense desire to go and see Bhagavan, my younger brother was
mov=
ed to help me. He is a very pious person, with a soft nature. With his
help=
 I secretly left home and reached Tiruvannamalai and the holy feet of
Sri B=
hagavan. But after reaching there, I was overcome with a sense of guilt
for=
 running away from home. This feeling of guilt, and a sense of bringing
ill=
 fame to the respected Rajagopalan family, was uppermost in my mind when
I =
first came into Bhagavan's presence. I felt depressed because of this.

Whe=
n I arrived I went to the office to inquire where Bhagavan was. I was
told =
that Bhagavan was near the well. When I came near the well, I saw a
thatche=
d shed next to it and all I could see in it was a flaming fire. I
thought t=
o myself, "I asked for directions to go to Bhagavan and they have
sent me t=
o a sacrificial place where there is a fire." It was only after a
few minut=
es that I saw Bhagavan's comely form emerge from those flames. Even
when I =
had the Jyoti Darshana I was blaming myself, thinking that I had this
delus=
ion of seeing a fire instead of Bhagavan because I was foolish enough
to co=
me out into the hot sun. It was only afterwards I realized Bhagavan had
bes=
towed upon me this great boon of Jyoti Darshana. Next I heard Bhagavan
sayi=
ng to me, "You have now come home. Why don't you sit down?"

Coming from a =
family where women never go out, and having never gone out
myself, I did no=
t know how to behave in company. When Bhagavan said "You
have now come home=
. You can sit down," I sat down right in front of him and
not in the place =
reserved for women. For three days I kept sitting in front
of him and all t=
he while the feeling of guilt for running away from home was
haunting me. I=
 kept sitting in front of Bhagavan, not knowing how to act or
ask questions=
, or anything else.

On the third day I heard Bhagavan telling someone: "I =
also ran away from my
home, and at the railroad station I was so frightened=
 that anyone could have
identified me as a runaway, caught hold of me and s=
ent me home. I ran away
like a thief." When Bhagavan narrated this, it comp=
letely wiped out all my
guilt feelings from that moment onwards. This was a=
n act of pure grace
directed towards me. It is very strange that by those f=
ew words Bhagavan
entirely removed any residual fear in me. Bhagavan later =
said that sometimes
you have to do a wrong thing to achieve the ultimate ri=
ght thing. He even
commented that there is nothing wrong in a woman running=
 away at the tender
age of twenty to come here.

I should narrate how my fi=
rst Giri Pradakshina took place. I was not
accustomed to walking at all, bu=
t whenever people came to tell Bhagavan that
they were going on a Giri Prad=
akshina, I longed to go too. One day
Venkataramayya and others were going r=
ound the hill, and in this group there
were two devotees who were over eigh=
ty years old. I did not say anything to
Bhagavan, but was all the time pray=
ing that I should be included in that
party. Immediately Bhagavan said to V=
enkataramayya "Take this girl - the one
seated there - with you." Bhagavan =
didn't stop there, for he even said, "She
will walk very slowly. Will that =
be all right?" Then Bhagavan turned towards
me and said, "These are our own=
 people. Are you prepared to go with them?"
Looking at me, he simply said, =
"Go!"

The Pradakshina took almost six hours. At Adi Annamalai I could move=
 no
more. I requested the group to proceed without me, and told them I will=

reach the Ashram later. But they said, "How could we leave you when Bhagav=
an
entrusted you to us? Even if it takes you another day to complete the
Pr=
adakshina, we will stay with you. Only with you can we re-enter the
Ashram.=
"

I was again feeling very guilty when we finally arrived. I was thinking =
that
others take three to four hours to complete the Pradakshina and I have=
 taken
six hours, wasting not only my time, but theirs too. I felt that the=
y were
all older than me, and a younger person, like me, had caused them so=
 much
inconvenience. When I entered the Ashram my heart was heavy with this=

feeling. With great difficulty we entered into the presence of Bhagavan an=
d
as soon as I sat down, Bhagavan started narrating how the Pradakshina sho=
uld
be done by walking as slow as a royal queen in her ninth month of pregn=
ancy.
"So there is nothing wrong in what she did," he concluded. After this=
, many
times I used to go around the hill all alone.

I used to fast a lot =
in those days - almost fifteen days out of a month. It
was helping in my sa=
dhana. One day, with the permission of Chinnaswami, I
stayed in the Ashram =
till 7:30 p.m., which is the supper time. Bhagavan
turned to me and said, "=
Aren't you coming for supper?" Then he said,
"Sattvic food should be eaten.=
 There is no meaning in mere fasting." Since
then I stopped fasting. Even i=
f I wanted to fast, for some reason or other
it would be broken. That is a =
real wonder to me.

I was not aware of this Brahmin-non-Brahmin separation =
in the Dining Hall.
One day I entered and saw the screen dividing the seati=
ng area. Some people
were already seated. I was in a fix as to where I shou=
ld sit. Bhagavan saw
my plight and asked me to sit right next to him. He sa=
id to an attendant,
"She doesn't know anything, so put her leaf here." Then=
 he said to me,
"Don't worry about these Brahmins." That is how Bhagavan in=
 his kindness
used to take care of me, for I was all alone and ignorant of =
the customs and
ways of the world. Since Bhagavan was showering all this pe=
rsonal attention
on me, Chinnaswami also took a personal interest in my wel=
fare. As Muruganar
was away, Chinnaswami offered me his residence to stay i=
n, and also offered
to send someone to guard me. I told him that I was not =
afraid and would lock
the house from inside and needed no one to guard me. =
Bhagavan overheard this
and said, "She is a young girl, and does not know t=
he consequences. Let her
sleep indoors, behind closed doors, but you send a=
 servant to sleep outside
on the verandah." I did not know anything when I =
came here. Even cooking I
learned here and, of course, Bhagavan taught me m=
any things from within.

Interviewer: Since you used to sit in front of Bha=
gavan quite often, could
you please give a detailed description of what is =
called 'Bhagavan's Glance
of Grace?'

Ramani Ammal: Bhagavan's look was rea=
l magic. You could not do anything but
just look into his eyes, which would=
 transform you into Samadhi. Everyone in
the hall used to feel Bhagavan was=
 looking at them alone. This was the true
experience of each one of us. In =
his inimitable way he was giving the glance
of grace to each and everyone s=
eated in the hall. Bhagavan's look used to
take us deep into Samadhi. Just =
by looking into his eyes, we came to know
what meditation is. This was, and=
 is, the common experience of all devotees.
You ask anyone and you will get=
 the same reply.

Once he gave me such a look and for a very long time I wa=
s absorbed in
Samadhi. Bhagavan was reading the newspaper, letters were bei=
ng brought in,
normal activity was going on, but I was oblivious of the hap=
penings outside
of me. In fact, I was unaware of my body.

I once remember =
a Harijan lady who for the past twenty-five years was
gathering honey to se=
nd to Sri Bhagavan. On every occasion she was unable to
bring the honey her=
self and had to send it with someone. After waiting for
twenty-five years, =
she finally found the opportunity to come. The poor lady
was in tattered cl=
othes, standing before Bhagavan. Her eyesight was poor and
I still vividly =
recall the unusual way she looked at Sri Bhagavan, calling
out "Oh Darling,=
 where are you? I want to see you." Bhagavan in all his
graciousness said, =
"Granny, look this way. I am here." Looking at the honey
she had brought wi=
th her, he said to me, "They are Brahmins, they won't eat
this. We will sha=
re it, and eat it."

It is often said, Bhagavan did not give direct Upadesa=
, but what else is all
this? Although Bhagavan repeatedly pointed out human=
 frailty, people were
not prepared to rectify themselves.

As if talking to=
 himself, he looked at this poor old woman in ragged clothes
and said, "Poo=
r lady, she must be hungry. And where will she go for clothes?
Who will off=
er her food and clothes?" Upon hearing this, Ondu Reddiyar got
up and said,=
 "We will give her food and also see that some clothes are
purchased." Then=
 Reddiyar took the woman to the Dining Hall and fed her
sumptuously. He als=
o sent someone to town to buy her a sari. As the old
woman had no money, sh=
e had walked a great distance to come here. Bhagavan
knowing this, said in =
an impersonal way, "Would anyone be interested in
getting her a bus ticket?=
" Reddiyar again came forward and said, "We will
provide her with a bus tic=
ket and see her off." When this lady returned from
the Dining Hall she was =
touching the ground, and then touching her eyes.
That is a way of prostrati=
on and thanksgiving. It is noteworthy that
whenever the poor or untouchable=
s came, Bhagavan took a very personal
interest in them, which was a moving =
sight to see.

Sri Bhagavan had absolutely no connection with either body o=
r mind. People
used to be confused by seeing him read letters and newspaper=
s. His inner
state never changed since he was sixteen. This was demonstrate=
d repeatedly,
but only those who had the eyes to see, could see and realize=
 it. Sri
Bhagavan was also a real taskmaster. He used to quietly move aroun=
d to
various places within the Ashram without notice. So every place had to=
 be
kept clean and neat because Bhagavan was very particular about cleanlin=
ess.
He was also particular about punctuality. This kept every member of th=
e
Ashram alert and on their toes, ready at all times to do what was necessa=
ry.
Look how this Ashram has grown. Unless Bhagavan was very careful in his=

silent supervision, could it have grown to this extent?

Questioner: Where=
 were you at the time of Sri Bhagavan's Mahanirvana?

Ramani Ammal: I was a=
t Rajapalayam. That night I saw a blue light
beautifully rising up into the=
 sky. I knew Bhagavan had left the body. I
felt that I did not want to live=
 after that and started a fast. By fasting I
wanted to drop the body. After=
 five or six days of not touching food I had
several visions. In one of the=
m I was taken inside the Arunachala Hill and
saw there rishis performing ya=
gnas and yoga. I also saw Sri Bhagavan seated
there. Some munis or rishis o=
ffered some prasad to Bhagavan. Then Sri
Bhagavan himself gave it to me, an=
d I was made to eat. I remembered that I
was fasting, but couldn't refuse B=
hagavan's prasad. How can I say that it
was a dream? I consider it was Bhag=
avan's grace alone. He also said to me,
"You say and repeat 'I have gone aw=
ay, I have gone away'. Where have I gone?
I am right here. You are not look=
ing inward. If you look within, I am
there." For many days afterwards the s=
mell of that prasad lingered. The
aroma even spread all through the house. =
My brother and sisters kept talking
about it. When I was fasting, my brothe=
r and sister were also fasting with
me. The morning following that vision w=
e started taking food again.

In the dream I also remember Bhagavan was sea=
ted near a tank and rishis and
munis were serving him. He looked splendid, =
gracious, magnanimous, and
magnificent. It was a beautiful sight. I saw the=
re Kamadhenu, the celestial
cow, the celestial tree, and many other wonderf=
ul things. It was a divine
sight indeed. From that day onwards I had no tho=
ught at all that Bhagavan
had left us. He is all pervading, and I experienc=
ed him particularly in my
heart. I no longer felt sorrow. He is even here n=
ow.

When I came again to Tiruvannamalai I was filled with bliss. You can f=
eel
Bhagavan's presence every minute. Right this very minute I feel his Div=
ine
Presence. I have no unhappiness. I am happy all the time. Sri Bhagavan'=
s
Presence is so overpowering. See how we all are gathered here. What have =
we
done to deserve this?

Interviewer: To my knowledge I haven't done anyth=
ing good and I also wonder,
along with you, how Bhagavan has gathered us he=
re.

Ramani Ammal: I can't say that I have ever done anything bad. From my
=
childhood I didn't know what is good and what is bad either. But doing good=

or bad has nothing to do with our coming to Bhagavan's Presence. It is onl=
y
by his grace that we are filled with his glorious Presence.

ur warm appreciation to J. Jayaraman who was the Tamil
interviewer, James H=
artel who videotaped it, Sri V. Ganesan who translated

nglish, and to Geeta Bhatt who kindly typed it.]

with you." Bhagavan didn't stop there, for he even said, "She=
 will walk very slowly. Will that be all right?" Then Bhagavan turned =
towards me and said, "These are our own people. Are you prepared to go=
 with them?" Looking at me, he simply said, "Go!"<br>

<br>T=
he Pradakshina took almost six hours. At Adi Annamalai I could move no more=
. I requested the group to proceed without me, and told them I will reach t=
he Ashram later. But they said, "How could we leave you when Bhagavan =
entrusted you to us? Even if it takes you another day to complete the Prada=
kshina, we will stay with you. Only with you can we re-enter the Ashram.&qu=
ot;<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">I was again feeling very gui=
lty when we finally arrived. I was thinking that others take three to four =
hours to complete the Pradakshina and I have taken six hours, wasting not o=
nly my time, but theirs too. I felt that they were all older than me, and a=
 younger person, like me, had caused them so much inconvenience. When I ent=
ered the Ashram my heart was heavy with this feeling. With great difficulty=
 we entered into the presence of Bhagavan and as soon as I sat down, Bhagav=
an started narrating how the Pradakshina should be done by walking as slow =
as a royal queen in her ninth month of pregnancy. "So there is nothing=
 wrong in what she did," he concluded. After this, many times I used t=
o go around the hill all alone.</span><br>

<br>I used to fast a lot in tho=
se days - almost fifteen days out of a month. It was helping in my sadhana.=
 One day, with the permission of Chinnaswami, I stayed in the Ashram till 7=
:30 p.m., which is the supper time.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">B=
hagavan turned to me and said, "Aren't you coming for supper?"=
; Then he said, "Sattvic food should be eaten. There is no meaning in =
mere fasting." Since then I stopped fasting.</span>=C2=A0Even if I wan=
ted to fast, for some reason or other it would be broken. That is a real wo=
nder to me.<br>

<br>I was not aware of this Brahmin-non-Brahmin separation=
 in the Dining Hall. One day I entered and saw the screen dividing the seat=
ing area. Some people were already seated. I was in a fix as to where I sho=
uld sit. Bhagavan saw my plight and asked me to sit right next to him. He s=
aid to an attendant, "She doesn't know anything, so put her leaf h=
ere." Then he said to me, "Don't worry about these Brahmins.&=
quot; That is how Bhagavan in his kindness used to take care of me, for I w=
as all alone and ignorant of the customs and ways of the world. Since Bhaga=
van was showering all this personal attention on me, Chinnaswami also took =
a personal interest in my welfare. As Muruganar was away, Chinnaswami offer=
ed me his residence to stay in, and also offered to send someone to guard m=
e. I told him that I was not afraid and would lock the house from inside an=
d needed no one to guard me. Bhagavan overheard this and said, "She is=
 a young girl, and does not know the consequences. Let her sleep indoors, b=
ehind closed doors, but you send a servant to sleep outside on the verandah=
." I did not know anything when I came here. Even cooking I learned he=
re and, of course, Bhagavan taught me many things from within.<br>

<br>Int=
erviewer: Since you used to sit in front of Bhagavan quite often, could you=
 please give a detailed description of what is called 'Bhagavan's G=
lance of Grace?'<br><br>Ramani Ammal: Bhagavan's look was real magi=
c. You could not do anything but just look into his eyes, which would trans=
form you into Samadhi. Everyone in the hall used to feel Bhagavan was looki=
ng at them alone. This was the true experience of each one of us. In his in=
imitable way he was giving the glance of grace to each and everyone seated =
in the hall. Bhagavan's look used to take us deep into Samadhi. Just by=
 looking into his eyes, we came to know what meditation is. This was, and i=
s, the common experience of all devotees. You ask anyone and you will get t=
he same reply.<br>

<br>Once he gave me such a look and for a very long tim=
e I was absorbed in Samadhi. Bhagavan was reading the newspaper, letters we=
re being brought in, normal activity was going on, but I was oblivious of t=
he happenings outside of me. In fact, I was unaware of my body.<br>

<br>I =
once remember a Harijan lady who for the past twenty-five years was gatheri=
ng honey to send to Sri Bhagavan. On every occasion she was unable to bring=
 the honey herself and had to send it with someone. After waiting for twent=
y-five years, she finally found the opportunity to come. The poor lady was =
in tattered clothes, standing before Bhagavan. Her eyesight was poor and I =
still vividly recall the unusual way she looked at Sri Bhagavan, calling ou=
t "Oh Darling, where are you? I want to see you." Bhagavan in all=
 his graciousness said, "Granny, look this way. I am here." Looki=
ng at the honey she had brought with her, he said to me, "They are Bra=
hmins, they won't eat this. We will share it, and eat it."<br>

<b=
r>It is often said, Bhagavan did not give direct Upadesa, but what else is =
all this? Although Bhagavan repeatedly pointed out human frailty, people we=
re not prepared to rectify themselves.<br><br>As if talking to himself, he =
looked at this poor old woman in ragged clothes and said, "Poor lady, =
she must be hungry. And where will she go for clothes? Who will offer her f=
ood and clothes?" Upon hearing this, Ondu Reddiyar got up and said, &q=
uot;We will give her food and also see that some clothes are purchased.&quo=
t; Then Reddiyar took the woman to the Dining Hall and fed her sumptuously.=
 He also sent someone to town to buy her a sari. As the old woman had no mo=
ney, she had walked a great distance to come here. Bhagavan knowing this, s=
aid in an impersonal way, "Would anyone be interested in getting her a=
 bus ticket?" Reddiyar again came forward and said, "We will prov=
ide her with a bus ticket and see her off." When this lady returned fr=
om the Dining Hall she was touching the ground, and then touching her eyes.=
 That is a way of prostration and thanksgiving. It is noteworthy that whene=
ver the poor or untouchables came, Bhagavan took a very personal interest i=
n them, which was a moving sight to see.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weigh=
t:bold">Sri Bhagavan had absolutely no connection with either body or mind.=
 People used to be confused by seeing him read letters and newspapers. His =
inner state never changed since he was sixteen. This was demonstrated repea=
tedly, but only those who had the eyes to see, could see and realize it.</s=
pan>=C2=A0Sri Bhagavan was also a real taskmaster. He used to quietly move =
around to various places within the Ashram without notice. So every place h=
ad to be kept clean and neat because=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=
Bhagavan was very particular about cleanliness. He was also particular abou=
t punctuality.</span>=C2=A0This kept every member of the Ashram alert and o=
n their toes, ready at all times to do what was necessary. Look how this As=
hram has grown. Unless Bhagavan was very careful in his silent supervision,=
 could it have grown to this extent?<br>

<br>Questioner: Where were you at=
 the time of Sri Bhagavan's Mahanirvana?<br><br>Ramani Ammal: I was at =
Rajapalayam. That night I saw a blue light beautifully rising up into the s=
ky. I knew Bhagavan had left the body. I felt that I did not want to live a=
fter that and started a fast. By fasting I wanted to drop the body. After f=
ive or six days of not touching food I had several visions. In one of them =
I was taken inside the Arunachala Hill and saw there rishis performing yagn=
as and yoga. I also saw Sri Bhagavan seated there. Some munis or rishis off=
ered some prasad to Bhagavan. Then Sri Bhagavan himself gave it to me, and =
I was made to eat. I remembered that I was fasting, but couldn't refuse=
 Bhagavan's prasad. How can I say that it was a dream? I consider it wa=
s Bhagavan's grace alone. He also said to me, "You say and repeat =
'I have gone away, I have gone away'. Where have I gone? I am right=
 here. You are not looking inward. If you look within, I am there." Fo=
r many days afterwards the smell of that prasad lingered. The aroma even sp=
read all through the house. My brother and sisters kept talking about it. W=
hen I was fasting, my brother and sister were also fasting with me. The mor=
ning following that vision we started taking food again.<br>

<br>In the dr=
eam I also remember Bhagavan was seated near a tank and rishis and munis we=
re serving him. He looked splendid, gracious, magnanimous, and magnificent.=
 It was a beautiful sight. I saw there Kamadhenu, the celestial cow, the ce=
lestial tree, and many other wonderful things. It was a divine sight indeed=
. From that day onwards I had no thought at all that Bhagavan had left us. =
He is all pervading, and I experienced him particularly in my heart. I no l=
onger felt sorrow. He is even here now.<br>

<br>When I came again to Tiruv=
annamalai I was filled with bliss. You can feel Bhagavan's presence eve=
ry minute. Right this very minute I feel his Divine Presence. I have no unh=
appiness. I am happy all the time. Sri Bhagavan's Presence is so overpo=
wering. See how we all are gathered here. What have we done to deserve this=
?<br>

<br>Interviewer: To my knowledge I haven't done anything good an=
d I also wonder, along with you, how Bhagavan has gathered us here.<br><br>=
Ramani Ammal: I can't say that I have ever done anything bad. From my c=
hildhood I didn't know what is good and what is bad either. But doing g=
ood or bad has nothing to do with our coming to Bhagavan's Presence. It=
 is only by his grace that we are filled with his glorious Presence.<br>
