 Visitor: What is the difference between meditation and distraction?

Mahar=
shi: No difference. When there are thoughts, it is distraction: when
there =
are no thoughts, it is meditation. However, meditation is only
practice (as=
 distinguished from the real state of Peace.)

She: How to practice meditat=
ion?

Maharshi: Keep off thoughts.

She: How to reconcile work with meditat=
ion?

Maharshi: Who is the worker? Let him who works ask the question. You =
are
always the Self. You are not the mind. It is the mind which raises thes=
e
questions. Work proceeds, always in the presence of the Self only. Work i=
s
no hindrance to realisation.

It is the mistaken identity of the worker t=
hat troubles one. Get rid of the
false identity.
