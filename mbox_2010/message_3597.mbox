Subject: Question on technical aspects of homa

Namaste Narasimha ji,

I have been performing homa regularly for the past f=
ew months after performing them on and off since the last 3 years. Sometime=
s the technical aspects (for lack of a better word) have been ignored or no=
t been complied with fully but my main focus has been to do it in the spiri=
t of the document i.e. complete surrender to the deity and with unselfish i=
ntent to the best of my ability. That is not to say I have always been succ=
essful but your writings provide me with encouragement and inspiration and =
I have made a concerted effort to get better continually.

However, as I ha=
ve gotten more comfortable and fluent with the process, I would like to get=
 the technical aspects right as well. My sincere belief is that while spiri=
t of performance of the ritual is paramount I should try to get the technic=
al aspects right to the extent that I can control. I do 2 homas a week and =
I reuse the darbhas that are used to "cordon" off the havan kund including =
the one to draw the 6 lines on the kund. I remove them for cleaning the are=
a before sitting for the next homa.

My questions are 
(a)is it acceptable =
to reuse the darbha grass for the next homa 
(b)it may be acceptable but wh=
at is the correct approach? and 
(c)how to best dispose off darbhas that ha=
ve been used.

Regards,
Alok.
