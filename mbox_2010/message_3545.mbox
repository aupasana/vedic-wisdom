CHAPTER VI

Of inordinate affections

Whensoever a man desireth aught above=
 measure, immediately he
becometh restless.  The proud and the avaricious m=
an are never
at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the
multit=
ude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self,
is soon tempted,=
 and is overcome in small and trifling matters.
It is hard for him who is w=
eak in spirit, and still in part
carnal and inclined to the pleasures of se=
nse, to withdraw
himself altogether from earthly desires.  And therefore, w=
hen he
withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily
angered =
too if any oppose his will.

2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his =
inclination,
immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his
cons=
cience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in
no way attaine=
d the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of
heart is to be found in =
resisting passion, not in yielding to it.
And therefore there is no peace i=
n the heart of a man who is
carnal, nor in him who is given up to the thing=
s that are without
him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and livi=
ng the
life of the Spirit.


CHAPTER VII

Of fleeing from vain hope and pri=
de

Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in
any cre=
ated Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others
for the love of Jes=
us Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this
life.  Rest not upon thyself, bu=
t build thy hope in God.  Do what
lieth in thy power, and God will help thy=
 good intent. Trust not
in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that =
lives, but
rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and
g=
iveth grace to the humble.

2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast=
 them, nor in thy
friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all t=
hings,
and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself.  Be
not=
 lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with
only a sligh=
t sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain
of thy skilfulness or=
 ability, lest thou displease God, from
whom cometh every good gift which w=
e have.

3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou
appea=
r worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  Be
not proud of t=
hy good works, for God's judgments are of another
sort than the judgments o=
f man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes
displeasing to Him.  If thou hast =
any good, believe that others
have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy hu=
mility. It is no
harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but i=
t is
great harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Peace is ever
with t=
he humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is
envy and continual wr=
ath.


CHAPTER VIII

Of the danger of too much familiarity

Open not thine =
heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise
and feareth God. Be seldo=
m with the young and with strangers.  Be
not a flatterer of the rich; nor w=
illingly seek the society of
the great.  Let thy company be the humble and =
the simple, the
devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning =
things
which edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good
w=
omen alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His
Angels only, an=
d flee from the notice of men.

2. We must love all men, but not make close=
 companions of all.
It sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us =
is highly
regarded through good report of him, whose actual person is
never=
theless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes
think to please ot=
hers by our intimacy, and forthwith displease
them the more by the faultine=
ss of character which they perceive
in us.


CHAPTER IX

Of obedience and s=
ubjection

It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under
aut=
hority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it to
live in subj=
ection than in a place of authority.  Many are in
obedience from necessity =
rather than from love; these take it
amiss, and repine for small cause.  No=
r will they gain freedom of
spirit, unless with all their heart they submit=
 themselves for
the love of God.  Though thou run hither and thither, thou =
wilt
not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him
who =
is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them
have deceived ma=
ny.

2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent,
and is =
the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if
Christ is amongst us=
, then it is necessary that we sometimes
yield up our own opinion for the s=
ake of peace.  Who is so wise
as to have perfect knowledge of all things?  =
Therefore trust not
too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hea=
r the
opinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for
the=
 love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another,
thou shalt t=
he more profit thereby.

3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to heark=
en and to
receive counsel than to give it.  It may also come to pass that
e=
ach opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when
reason or =
occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or
wilfulness.


CHAPTER X

Of th=
e danger of superfluity of words

Avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of =
men; for talk concerning
worldly things, though it be innocently undertaken=
, is a
hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity.
Many=
 a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone
amongst men.  But=
 why do we talk and gossip so continually,
seeing that we so rarely resume =
our silence without some hurt
done to our conscience?  We like talking so m=
uch because we hope
by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and b=
ecause we
seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts.  And
=
we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or
desire, o=
r else of those which we most dislike.

2. But alas! it is often to no purp=
ose and in vain.  For this
outward consolation is no small hindrance to the=
 inner comfort
which cometh from God.  Therefore must we watch and pray tha=
t
time pass not idly away.  If it be right and desirable for thee
to speak,=
 speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and
neglect of our rea=
l profit tend much to make us heedless of
watching over our lips.  Neverthe=
less, devout conversation on
spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiri=
tual progress, most
of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find thei=
r ground
of fellowship in God.
