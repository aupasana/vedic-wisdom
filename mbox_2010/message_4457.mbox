 IN 1932, I had the good fortune to attend a conference of cooperative
orga=
nizations, which was held at Tiruvannamalai.It enabled me to see the
holy A=
runachala Hill and also pay a visit to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.
When I=
 saw him he was in his hall, reclining on a couch. The hall was clean
and c=
ool and the sofa was fully covered with colored shawls and a tiger's
skin, =
but Bhagavan himself had only a loincloth on his body and nothing
more. In =
the subdued light of the hall, his body shone like burnished gold
and his e=
yes were luminous, full of flashes of some very intense inner life.
The mor=
e I looked at him, the more his face seemed to be radiating a
mysterious li=
ght, the source of which was somewhere deep within. I found
myself unable t=
o guess his mental state. I could not make out whether he was
aware of the =
world or not, whether he saw me or not, whether he was in some
yogic trance=
 or in contemplation of something quite beyond my vision and
knowledge.

Th=
e hall was full of silence, serenity and peace. About twenty people sat on
=
the ground, apparently in deep meditation. When the bell rang for the midda=
y
meal, he invited us all with a nod of his head and we followed him to the=

dinning hall. In the dinning hall, orthodox Brahmins were sitting apart,
b=
ehind a bamboo screen, while Bhagavan was sitting with non-Brahmins and
som=
e of the Brahmins who did not follow caste restrictions.

After food I was =
asked to clean the spot where I had eaten and take away the
banana leaf tha=
t was used as a plate. Anywhere else I would have taken it as
a sign of dis=
respect. But I told myself that it may have been a necessary
lesson and so =
I swallowed my pride.

The next morning I went again to the Ashram and sat =
near the door facing
Bhagavan. Some government officer, accompanied by a re=
tinue of peons,
entered the hall and at once started telling Bhagavan how c=
orrupt the
government servants were, how they abused and misused their posi=
tions, how
they quarreled and fought among themselves making the administra=
tion
inefficient and unreliable, how he had been entrusted with the task of=

cleaning up the government machinery and how he was busy fighting against
=
all the evils of the world. He complained that in his loyalty to his
superi=
ors, who had given him their confidence, and in his anxiety to make a
succe=
ss of himself, he had lost his peace of mind and had come to ask
Bhagavan t=
o make him calm and contented. It was clear that he thought
himself to be a=
 very important person whose request must be promptly met.
After he had fin=
ished talking he looked expectantly at Bhagavan, as if
saying: "Now it is y=
our turn to show what you can do."

Bhagavan did not even look at him. The =
hours were passing, but Bhagavan was
completely silent. The officer lost pa=
tience, got up and said: "You are
silent, Bhagavan. Does it mean that you w=
ant me to be silent too?" "Yes,
yes." Said Bhagavan, and that was all.

I o=
nce asked him "Bhagavan, my mind does not obey me. It wanders as it likes
a=
nd lands me into trouble. Be merciful to me and tell me clearly how to
brin=
g it under control." Even before I completed the question Bhagavan
turned t=
o me and looked at me affectionately. He spoke to me most kindly and
his wo=
rds sparkled with meaning: "All religious and spiritual practices have
no o=
ther purpose than getting the mind under control. The three paths of
knowle=
dge, devotion and duty aim at this and this alone. By immersing
yourself in=
 your work you forget your mind is separate from your work and
the problem =
of controlling the mind ceases. In devotion, your mind is merged
in the God=
 you love and ceases to exist as separate from Him. He guides your
mind ste=
p by step and no control is needed. In knowledge, you find that
there is no=
 such thing as mind, no control, controller, or controlled. The
path of dev=
otion is the easiest of all. Meditate on God or on some mental or
material =
image of Him. This will slow down your mind and it will get
controlled of i=
ts own accord."

Somehow I felt satisfied and there was deep peace in me wh=
en I looked at him
for the last time.
