And also like Rajiv Says in the Article.

1.The two interviews he did with =
Nithyananda where Nithyananda gave the proofs for the land documents and an=
swered the other allegations got posted both on the official website and yo=
utube also.

2.It seems Nithyanada did a third interview where he honestly =
admitted he was doing tantric practises with consent with a select group of=
 disciples .However the current ashram management strongly shot down the id=
ea of publishing that Interview.

Anywaz ..... :) It is kali yuga and like =
somebody posted in a old post. You can never know who is a sinner and who i=
s an saint....

Now if there are still people who wish to abuse him and ter=
m him by differnt names  etc...Please do so ...after all it is a free count=
ry.

They say even one who has taught an single alphabet is a teacher and a=
lways must be respected. For me learnt some valuable truths from his lectur=
es on Shiva Sutras and will continue to respect him.
