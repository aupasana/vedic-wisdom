 You see, the one eliminates all the not I cannot eliminate the =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99. To say
=E2=80=98I am not this=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98I am that=E2=
=80=99 there must be the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.This =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is on=
ly the
ego or the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought. After the rising up of this =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought, all other
thoughts arise. The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99-thought is therefore the root-thought. If the root
is pulled out, all o=
thers are at the same time uprooted. Therefore seek the
root-=E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99,question yourself =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99, find out its source. =
Then all these
will vanish and the pure Self will remain over. (Talks, 197)=
.

Only the annihilation of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is Liberation. But it can b=
e gained only by
keeping the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 always=
 in view. So the need for the investigation of the
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thou=
ght.
(Talks, 139).

There is only one =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 all along; but wh=
at rises up from time to time is the
mistaken =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought; =
whereas the intuitive =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 always remains Self-shining,
i.e.=
, even before it becomes manifest. (Talks, 139).

The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-t=
hought is only limited =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. The real =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is=
 unlimited,universal,
beyond time and space. They are absent in sleep, and =
before seeing the
objective world, there is a state of awareness which is y=
our pure Self. That
must be known (Talks, 311).

Soul, mind and ego are wor=
ds. There are no real entities of the kind.
Consciousness is the only truth=
. (Talks, 245).

Just on waking from sleep and before becoming aware of the=
 world there is
that pure =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=E2=80=94=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. =
Hold it without sleeping or without allowing thoughts to
possess you. If th=
at is held firm it does not matter even though the world
is seen. The seer =
remains unaffected by the phenomena. (Talks, 196).

How is the ego to be de=
stroyed? Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to
be destroyed. Who ask=
s this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree
to kill itself? This=
 question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to
kill it. If you seek =
the ego you will find it does not exist. That is the
way to destroy it.
(Ta=
lks, 615).

Your duty is to be; and not to be this or that. =E2=80=98I AM T=
HAT I AM=E2=80=99 sums up the
whole truth. The method is, summed up in =E2=
=80=98BE STILL=E2=80=99. What does stillness
mean? It means =E2=80=98destro=
y yourself =E2=80=99. Because any form or shape is the cause
of trouble.Giv=
e up the notion =E2=80=98I am so and so=E2=80=99. (Talks, 363).

The ego is=
 like one=E2=80=99s shadow thrown on the ground. If one attempts to bury
it=
, it will be foolish. The Self is only one. If limited, it is the ego; if
u=
nlimited it is the Infinite and is the Reality. (Talks, 146).

=E2=80=98I a=
m that I am=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99 is God... not thinking, =E2=80=
=98I am God=E2=80=99.Realise =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99
and do not think =E2=80=
=98I am=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Know I am God=E2=80=99... it is said, and not =
=E2=80=98Think I am
God=E2=80=99. (Talks, 354).

The mind is by nature rest=
less. Begin liberating it from its restlessness;
give it peace; make it fre=
e from distractedness; train it to look inward;
make this a habit. This is =
done by ignoring the external world and removing
the obstacles to peace of =
mind. (Talks, 26).

Is it the mind that wants to kill itself? The mind cann=
ot kill itself. So
your business is to find the real nature of the mind.The=
n you will know that
there is no mind. When the Self is sought, the mind is=
 nowhere. Abiding in
the Self, one need not
worry about the mind. (Talks, 1=
46).

Mere book-learning is not of any great use. After realisation all
int=
ellectual loads are useless burdens and are thrown overboard as jetsam.
Jet=
tisoning the ego is necessary and natural. (Talks, 28).

It is in the mind =
that birth and death, pleasure and pain,in short, the
world and ego, exist.=
 If the mind is destroyed all else are destroyed too. Note
that it should b=
e annihilated, not just made latent. For the mind is dormant
in sleep. It d=
oes not know anything. Still, on waking up you are as you were
before.There=
 is no end of grief. But if the mind be destroyed the grief will
have no ba=
ckground and will disappear along with the mind. (Talks, 195).

The mind is=
 only a bundle of thoughts. The thoughts arise because there is
the thinker=
. The thinker is the ego. The ego, if sought, will vanish
automatically. Th=
e ego and the mind are the same. The ego is the
root-thought from which all=
 other thoughts arise. (Talks, 195).

To imagine Muladhara at the bottom, t=
he Heart at the centre or the head at
the top or over all these is all wron=
g. In one word, to think is not your
real nature. (Talks, 184).

Is not =E2=
=80=98I am=E2=80=99 also a thought?... The egoless =E2=80=98I AM=E2=80=99 i=
s not a thought. It is
Realisation. The meaning or significance of =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 is God. The experience of =E2=80=98I
am=E2=80=99 is to =E2=80=
=98BE STILL=E2=80=99. (Talks, 226).

Inward seeking is the path to be gaine=
d by man=E2=80=99s intellect.The intellect
itself realises after continuous=
 practice that it is enabled by some Higher
Power to function. It cannot it=
self reach this Power. So it ceases to
function after a certain stage.Then =
the Supreme Power is still left there
all alone. That is Realisation; that =
is finality; that is the goal. (Talks,
502).

It is thus plain that the pur=
pose of the intellect is to realise its own
dependence upon the Higher Powe=
r and its inability to reach the same. So it
must annihilate itself before =
the goal is reached. (Talks, 502).

Why is intellect developed? It has a pu=
rpose. The purpose is that it should
show the way to realise the Self. It m=
ust be put to that use. (Talks, 644).

The mind becomes peaceful for a shor=
t while and again emerges forth. What is
to be done?... The peace often gai=
ned must be remembered at other times.
That peace is your natural and perma=
nent state. By continuous practice it
will become natural. That is called t=
he =E2=80=98current=E2=80=99. That is your true
nature.(Talks, 303).

Peopl=
e think that freedom (moksha) is somewhere yonder and should be sought
out.=
 They are wrong. Freedom is only knowing the Self within yourself.
Concentr=
ate and you will get it. (Talks, 31).
