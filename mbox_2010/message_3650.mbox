Namaste,

A few quick points:

(1) There is no absolute right and wrong. Dh=
arma often requires judging and balancing different criteria and the judgme=
nt may vary from place to place, time to time and person to person.

Uncook=
ed (raw) rice grains last a long time without getting spoiled, but cooked r=
ice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortunately, people cannot eat raw grains. S=
o someone cooks for them. Do not expect cooked grains to last a long time, =
even if a great cook cooked them.

Similarly, generic and raw spiritual tea=
chings given in scriptures and taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is=
 real. World is maayaa. Do good to others. Sacrifice your happiness for oth=
ers) are relevant always, while very specific guidelines given by great yog=
is in specific circumstances (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on =
god. It is ok to do homam with mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone come=
s to you and asks for money, give whatever you have) may have been given ke=
eping the circumstances in mind and may be irrelevant in other circumstance=
s.

If I reject spoiled food cooked by my wife who is out of town and inste=
ad eat food made by my sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. S=
he would not have expected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after =
it expires.

Unfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines to pe=
ople based on the circumstances (desa-kaala-paatra), as people are not smar=
t enough to know the right thing if given only generic guidelines and want =
specific guidance. So they run the risk of someone using the guideline mean=
t for a specific circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances while att=
ributing it to them.

(2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies=
 with the body parts strongly is always a much stronger karma than eating t=
he stuff from plants that have much subtler self-identification with the le=
aves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate f=
ish in the past, it is bad karma.

All of us do many bad karmas and many go=
od karmas and hope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so=
 many good karmas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadhana. =
It may have offset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the time=
 they were not yet fully realized (after full realization, there are no kar=
mas).

(3) In the old days - even a century back - people did much more sad=
hana than now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live i=
n the middle of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our mi=
nds are bombarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in =
the evening, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime=
 time may have sexual innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail abo=
ut sexuality. There are images of half-naked people and struggle for money =
everywhere. There are too many temptations for the mind and too many opport=
unities to fall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world o=
f today is more challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.
=

How good shoes one wears may not matter if one is walking on a normal road=
 in summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy p=
avement during winter, lest one should fall!

When there is so much corrupt=
ing influence around us that we cannot control and that is challenging us, =
we can atleast control our own actions and habits and minimize the bad karm=
as we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.

(4) When Lord Vishnu came=
 to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having=
 only one wife). When he came back as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize th=
at anymore and had many wives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama,=
 he killed demons. When he came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.

Wh=
en yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come =
also, their message is tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Different times r=
equire different leelas, different missions, different messages and differe=
nt styles.

Unfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord Rama cam=
e back as Lord Krishna and even fought with him!

(5) While it is illogical=
 to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of these pe=
ople, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want=
 to eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that is =
bad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected bein=
gs and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Opportuni=
stic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and complete faith accompanie=
d by complete surrender is very powerful. People with such faith WILL find =
their way.

(6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through C=
alcutta. But, if someone insists on going through Calcutta, what can you do=
? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one's conditioning. If we see a =
short path, we can only suggest it to others but nor force them to take it.=


Best regards,
Narasimha

      Dear KK,
=C2=A0
Nice question. I was a=
lso thinking that.
=C2=A0
Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fis=
h is the staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm=
 in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali boo=
k on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where =
a man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakris=
hna said first leave "Kamini" and "Kanchana", then think of food. =C2=A0Als=
o a similar examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where=
 - a certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fi=
sh eating and rather just focus mind on God.
=C2=A0
When I tried to reason =
with them that if these people were to come back again on planet earth they=
 may not recommend non veg eating - considering the state of the world toda=
y - I=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there i=
s something wrong in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 
=
=C2=A0
Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual case=
s, to which I was told, "no", because based on a whole plethora of such exa=
mples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and =
serve fish. This statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad =
in many Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, =
the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and M=
a Sarada better than us ordrinary people. 
=C2=A0
I could make no further a=
rguments and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my p=
arents that I have quit non veg food. 
=C2=A0
A lot of Bengalis may not hav=
e been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives,=
 however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by "Thakur"=
 and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".
=C2=A0
-Regards

=C2=A0 

Dear KK,

Corre=
ction in my earlier message =E2=80=93 It should read `Aghora, at the left h=
and of God'

A sincere suggestion from me- No need to address me with `Ji' =
suffix. However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I'll happi=
ly accept it hence forth.

I just came across Vimalananda' s thought on Kar=
ma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only ge=
nerated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.
Although, it may=
 seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times diffic=
ult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely important statement to answ=
er our queries.

Important information about Vimalananda which I came to kn=
ow only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a sing=
le day passed in his life when he didn't do smoking except on the final day=
 of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco' fre=
quently and occasionally
 ate meat. I gave this information, because as you=
 pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of ex=
act thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thi=
ng. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what h=
e says and not try to do what he does.

Now whatever I wrote above seems su=
fficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts furth=
er (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can =
be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vim=
alananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we te=
nd to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level =
of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things in t=
he universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to univ=
ersal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnya=
anis'.
 Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate m=
eat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew wh=
at they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and=
 every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background be=
hind their each action and moreover their self identification is missing fr=
om the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accompli=
sh a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakr=
ishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very differ=
ent from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which c=
an consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. H=
e can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a k=
ind of food intake is extremely important.
If Vivekananda ate meat during h=
is stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is not
 possib=
le for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that le=
vel. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst westerne=
rs so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to=
 eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. I=
t is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rin=
anubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he =
would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by consuming =
its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but ju=
st a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Gur=
u and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning =
in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go=
 to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for the f=
irst time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water
 and when he =
requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thoug=
ht told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will g=
ive him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa =
Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by=
 Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew' before 4=
0 years.

Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.

So mor=
al of my whole writings is that it's unwise as well as self deluding to tak=
e excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbab=
a, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such ma=
sters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/=
unjust actions.

<div> </div>
<div>Nice question. I was also thinking that.</div>
<di=
v> </div>
<div>Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is t=
he staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in ea=
ting fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on t=
he life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man =
came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna sa=
id first leave "Kamini" and "Kanchana", then think of food.  Also a si=
milar examples was quoted to me from the life of Ma Sarada where - a c=
ertain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eat=
ing and rather just focus mind on God.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I =
tried to reason with them that if these people were to come back again on p=
lanet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - considering the state o=
f the world today - I  was catergorically told they are all Trikalagya=
s, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they would have told right=
 then.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then I tried to say that the exa=
mples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told, "no", because b=
ased on a whole plethora of such examples even today the monks of the Ramak=
rishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fact. I=
 have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions across&nbs=
p;West Bengal. So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know =
about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary peopl=
e. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I could make no further arguments and of c=
ourse had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents that I hav=
e quit non veg food. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A lot of Bengalis may no=
t have been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their l=
ives, however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by "Th=
akur" and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".</div>

<div>Dear KK,<br><br>Correc=

`Ji' suffix. However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I'll =
happily accept it hence forth.<br><br>I just came across Vimalananda' s tho=
ught on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma=
 is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.<br>Al=
though, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multipl=
e times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely important sta=
tement to answer our queries.<br><br>Important information about Vimalanand=
a which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and =
there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn't do smoking exc=
ept on the final day of his departure from physical body. He used to as wel=
l `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally
 ate meat. I gave this informa=
tion, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesti=
ng coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also n=
ote an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his a=
udience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.<br><br>Now whate=
ver I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let m=
e put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized=
 person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases o=
f Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledg=
ed spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who=
 achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of ever=
ything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly an=
d completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doi=
ng. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'.
 Relevant to our topic of discussion, I wo=
uld say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed anim=
als, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specif=
ic purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they k=
now complete background behind their each action and moreover their self id=
entification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operate=
s through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any =
cause-effect chain.<br>Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his discip=
les that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fi=
re burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food res=
triction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually=
 troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.<br>=
If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have some sub=
tle purpose which is not
 possible for majority of us to comprehend unless =
explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the =
sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as on=
e of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and =
such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he=
 is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he a=
te. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on=
 the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were no =
apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not=
 know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viveka=
nanda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Indi=
a and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years act=
ually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to st=
ay away from water
 and when he requested swami to accept him as his discip=
le, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his=
 guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man late=
r became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actual=
ly given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what s=
wami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.<br><br>Swami Vivekananda was all k=
nowing and most of us are NOT.<br><br>So moral of my whole writings is that=
 it's unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional=
 habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Mahara=
j, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completel=
y self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.<br><br>Best Reg=
