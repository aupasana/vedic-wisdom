Namaste,
 
(1) That is a good approach for memorizing mantras. Regular prac=
tice does wonders. Yes, Ganesha Chaturthi this year is indeed on September =
11.
 
(2) Yes, sadhana is the only thing that brings real clarity. Even if =
one reads books and commentaries and listens to lectures and discourses, on=
e may or may not understand and digest much. Even if a river has a lot of w=
ater, you cannot drink all of it.
 
Clarity comes if one is able to underst=
and and digest knowledge. One's ability to understand and digest sublime kn=
owledge increases with internal purity. Internal purity comes with sadhana.=

 
Once Bharadwaja wanted to improve his understanding of Veda and other sc=
riptures and kept reading more and more books. Indra came to him and told h=
im, "this is not the way to understand things. Stop reading and do more sad=
hana. Then you will understand." Bharadwaja did tapas and he indeed underst=
ood what was there to be understood in those books!
 
Best regards,
Narasim=
ha

rom time to time I keep getting into several internal debates in my mind as=
 to what is right / wrong even when I am interpreting great books like Srim=
adbhagavadgita. In the recent past I am trying to involve myself in an inte=

ehas (just like Arjuna did) and I think the only way one will have the kind=
 of understanding that Arjuna had at the end of it, is only after having a =
full darshana of the lord (in whichever life it happens). So, in my opinion=
, only Sadhana can lead to some real answers for the questions we keep gett=
ing from time to time as we read these confusing scriptures. Am I thinking =
in the right direction?

appy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vishnu Homam at my Friend's pl=
ace recently. One of my friends bought a house recently and wanted me to pe=
rform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But since I did not know how to =
do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not inclined to get details on Sud=
arsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Narasimha here before as a homa=
m for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik homam like VishnuHomam and s=
uggested the same. They agreed and we first did a Ganapathi Homam and then =
proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short break. Indeed it was a great e=
xperience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranamam and offering Ahutis, the =
fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot and half in height with ju=
st three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonderful sight). This is very sim=
ilar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahutis to navagrahas, do the reg=
ular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the 'Pancha Loka Palaka Pooja' and the=
 five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vishnu homam, all the essent=
ials are still covered. I find that this Homam is a good substitute (and ta=
kes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if one is falling short of time=
! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?
