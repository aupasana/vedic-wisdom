Namaskaram Narsimhagaru,

You had mentioned that for some...after =
doing homam karmic cleansing can be months, for some years and for some lif=
etime. So obviously a person who undergoes karmic cleansing for lifetime do=
esn't get much spiritual progress. Does it mean that person also doesn't at=
tain salvation or merge with God in this birth? Will he have to take rebirt=
h to finish the leftover job? 
Many thanks for helping me come so far..
Bes=
t Regards,
Priya
