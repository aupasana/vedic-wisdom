Dear Narasimha and others,
=C2=A0
Just further to our conversation on thi=
s topic last night,
If one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is assoc=
iated with naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the o=
pposite sex in a different way. This comes from millions of janmas and sams=
karas. 
=C2=A0
My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used to say=C2=A0in a slig=
htly different context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.
I ap=
plied it to this as well and it works quite well.=C2=A0
Two things=C2=A0are=
 going to be=C2=A0useful, 
1. Continue your mantra during the act and it wi=
ll act as a continuation of your sadhana.
2. If your partner is willing, us=
e Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes =
on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slow=
ly you find that a naked female(or male as=C2=A0may be the case)=C2=A0body =
is like a landscape picture just like any other picture made by Her of natu=
re(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you =
can certainly=C2=A0feel that the picture=C2=A0is very beautiful=C2=A0but yo=
u need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaiki=
ya.... ...
Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to think of sex =
all the while.
Yes you may still encounter it, but that is another story.

=C2=A0

Namaste,

It is perfectly fine to combine the sadhanas of d=
ifferent aspects of the Mother, including Lalita and Chandi.
=C2=A0
Sri Vid=
ya consists of symbolic practices that eventually enable one to understand =
various layers of Maayaa surrounding true Self. The idea is that one is not=
 bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it.
=C2=A0
Ch=
andipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought=
, which explain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typi=
cally bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will pr=
omote the fighting spirit within one that fights these weaknesses.
=C2=A0
T=
here is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome =
it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of=
 the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of=
 the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the M=
other makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, i=
rrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects =
of a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.

Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but =
Aghora is not everyone's cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.
=
=C2=A0
Ghora means terrible. Aghora means "not terrible". One of the names =
of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything =
as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of =
god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) =
always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.
=C2=A0
When someone d=
ies, north Indians chant "Raama naam satya hai" while carrying the dead bod=
y to the funeral. It means "only the name of Lord Rama is true and everythi=
ng else is an illusion". The idea is to remind oneself that life and death =
are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question i=
s: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone =
dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and=
 we are about to feel proud and happy, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam =
satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only =
the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"? When we f=
eel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can't we tell ours=
elves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other thin=
gs that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is rea=
l. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"?
 When someone attacks an=

"Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord =

=C2=A0
A true Agh=
ora's mind thinks "Raama naam satya hai" always. His mind rejects all *impe=
rmanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifyi=
ng them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with a=
ttraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But =
he takes it to extremes.

=C2=A0
Vedanta says "all is =
Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion". An aghora pursues it practic=
ally. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only perman=
ent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but =
not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please re=
member that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food=
 being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (fe=
ces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust =
serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dwelling on the impermenant =
manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it. A successful Aghora may be=
 eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eat=
ing "feces" with certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. =
He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.
=C2=A0
Of course=
, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when =
eating food, which essentially mean "I am Self and I am consuming Self". Ne=
vertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed =
in one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manife=
stations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinjal curry", "a overl=
y salty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).
=C2=
=A0
Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth an=
d trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is=
 putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very ba=
d dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to =
transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that sa=
ys "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and nicely mad=
e food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is=
 not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of=
 a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the min=
d fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so d=
isgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experienc=
e may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.
=C2=A0
However, difficult =
tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an i=
ncentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.

Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of=
 sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose =
one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of s=
adhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.
=C2=A0
A regul=
ar person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual t=
houghts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all,=
 such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy =
for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does n=
ot return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some=
 minds may have for sex?
=C2=A0
An aghora will take it to an extreme. He wi=
ll try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead =
of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the ot=
her impure), he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure=
 vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on =
his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and r=
esult in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, supp=
ose he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually,=
 mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something=
 impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind bet=
ween nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically=
 or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of med=
itation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head m=
ay not lead to denser and
 denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction =
in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spendi=
ng so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attractio=
n and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Ov=
erall, the person's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.
=
=C2=A0
Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the th=
oughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of thes=
e structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structur=
es.
=C2=A0
However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also pos=
sible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and =
thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of medi=
tation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ re=
ady to start with.

=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghor=

=C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "wh=
at is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to unde=
rstand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high st=
akes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may f=
eel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it base=
d on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C2=
=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attrac=
t some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghor=
a and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how =
one absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant=
.
=C2=A0
BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual=
 paths and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the=

Namaste,

Sanskrit is a=
lmost like a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday sho=
uld hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who d=
o not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great d=
ifficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and =
it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.

Integrating various sa=
dhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it=
 is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on =
them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Para=
mahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig on=
e metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.

One possibility is to d=
o a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantr=
as one is attached to.

I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. Howeve=
r, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic represe=
ntation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to =
unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.

Lalita means gentle one and=
 Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, =
you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you wi=
ll learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid paths.=


Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,

I am very much in awe after I learnt that=
 you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hour=
s to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat wi=
th 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam =
with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes),=
 a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minut=
es) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do sp=
ecial rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all.=
 How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from=
 Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to =
be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all abo=
ut but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also=
 and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar rec=
ently.

<DIV>Dear Narasimha and others,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>Just further to our conversation on this topic last night,</D=
IV>
<DIV>If one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is associated with =
naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex=
 in a different way. This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. </DI=
V>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used to say&nbs=
p;in a slightly different context that he believes in Sampradaha or inciner=
ation.</DIV>
<DIV>I applied it to this as well and it works quite well.&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>Two things are going to be useful, </DIV>
<DIV>1. C=
ontinue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuation of you=
r sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV>2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do =
not be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the thing i=
n your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a n=
aked female(or male as may be the case) body is like a landscape =
picture just like any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara fall=
s, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly f=
eel that the picture is very beautiful but you need not be arouse=
d by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...</DIV>
<DI=
V>Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to think of sex all the w=
hile.</DIV>
<DIV>Yes you may still encounter it, but that is another story.=

<DIV>Take another simple example. Suppose someo=
ne is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakne=
ss for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thought=
s in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's sad=
hana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A regular person will try to enforce cel=
ibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formul=
a for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and=
 distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarant=
ee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that.=
 But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?</DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to f=
ix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping =
sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure)=
, he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure.=
 Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and=
 then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in se=
x. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he pers=
ists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may b=
e reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He=
 may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedn=
ess and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentall=
y may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. An=
y small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead=
 to
 denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana,=
 but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much =
time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thril=
l mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the =
person's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.</DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences =
and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down so=
me of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine thos=
e structures.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>However, is this a fool-proof me=
thod? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in =
the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditat=
ion (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if=
 one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.</DIV>

<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on=
 and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may pus=

<DIV> </DIV>Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "wh=
at is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to unde=
rstand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high st=
akes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may f=
eel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it base=
d on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.&nbs=
p;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract=
 some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora=
 and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how o=
ne absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant.=
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy =
for various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality. It may be inter=
esting to read in the context of aghora.</DIV>

<DIV>Thank you for your reply. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> =
;</DIV>
<DIV>I understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of=
 the Universal Mother. But what I am trying to understand is that=
 how to worship both forms simultaneously. For instance, Sri Muththusw=
amy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic=
 Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sr=
i Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis mention great deta=
ils about all the nine avaranas and different forms of the divine moth=
er as one goes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of thos=
e, in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, Ch=
anDike'. That line tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can w=
orship Chandi Ma, in that form. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your repl=
y was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by laye=
rs of duality! I never thought in those terms. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just t=
o get practise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, w=
hich I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get com=
fortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achiev=
e my target. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Also, =
I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For =
now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more!=

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue=

 and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first a=
ttempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours no=
w. THAT is awe-inspiring.<BR><BR>Integrating various sadhanas is a personal=
 problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to p=
ick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of spl=
itting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is =
better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten place=
s, if one wants to find water.<BR><BR>One possibility is to do a homam and =
then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is atta=
ched to.<BR><BR>I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from =
the
 little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation=
 of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel=
 the layer of duality and realize Self.<BR><BR>Lalita means gentle one and =
Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, y=
ou will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you wil=
l learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid paths.<=
