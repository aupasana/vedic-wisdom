Srila Prabupada's english translation of Bhagvad Gita at least and Iskon's=
 interpretations are highly faulty and misleading.

    =
  
      Namaste,

 

I was referring to Vyasa'a Sanskrit version.

 

One =
can access easy English translations by Srila Prabhupada of various scriptu=
res (including Srimad Bhagavatam) at http://vedabase.net.

 

In Potana's T=
elugu version, chapters may be arranged slightly differently. I do not have=
 the text and cannot comment.

 

Yes, Potana is special among Telugu poets=
. Poets like Potana and musicians like Thyagaraja dedicated themselves to L=
ord Rama, and preferred to live in poverty and write (or sing) on god, rath=
er than writing (or singing) on kings and mundane matters.

 

Best regards=
,

Narasimha
