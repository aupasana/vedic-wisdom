Dear Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Excellent answers on each thread and mother sho=
wed her divine grace through you that I am able to find answers to many que=
stions that my immature mind keeps on asking! 
=C2=A0
Anyway, coming back t=
o the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in the first book of Agh=
ora are as follows: 
=C2=A0
1. On the page 45 it says that Telang swami per=
formed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with his own urine and feces. =
What could be the compelling reason for this bizarre behavior and why shoul=
d=C2=A0the priest who slapped him=C2=A0die, because in my opinion, anyone e=
lse would have done the same in the least!=C2=A0Since you have an excellent=
 way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I hope=C2=A0to find and a=
nswer here. 
=C2=A0
2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda=C2=A0equates chan=
ging the=C2=A0loyalty from diety to diety=C2=A0as akin to prostitution, whi=
ch I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara comp=
ose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in=C2=
=A0the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well.=
=C2=A0So are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and=
 Leelashuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity=C2=A0form only (r=
ama=C2=A0in the=C2=A0case of former and krishna in the case of latter) desp=
ite knowing that the other form is the same supreme being, are only a very =
minority in the list of Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I se=
e myself being equally in the love and awe=C2=A0of every form of god, namel=
y=C2=A0Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on!=

Namaste,

> How to achieve it e=
ffectivey?

If it can be achieved easily, we will not have so many spiritua=
l paths and so many sadhanas. All spiritual paths, scriptures, teachings an=
d spiritual sadhanas are meant for this only.

Vasishtha teaches in Yoga Va=
asishtham that one can read scriptures, contemplate their teachings, spend =
time in the company of spiritual people and engage in one's natural activit=
ies with dispassion, in order to progress fast.

* * *

Let me quote someth=
ing from Ramakrishna. Look at your belongings (spouse, children, job, house=
, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the property of god. Imagine =
that you are a temporary caretaker, just as a servant may be living in a ri=
ch person's house as the caretaker as that person stays away. Think of all =
that is in your hands as the sacred property of your master and take care l=
ike a committed servant. A servant takes the best care of his master's prop=
erty, but does not get attached. Do not be attached anything and yet take t=
he best possible care. If something goes wrong, do not worry too much and t=
ell yourself that the master will take care of it when he gets a chance to =
look at it. Think for a moment how a servant taking care of the properties =
of a master living away thinks and behaves.

If one can attain the spirit a=
nd mental state of the servant in this analogy, one's life will be made.

*=
 * *

Read what Manish wrote below:

<<<<Once you take Time out of the equa=
tion (because a deity has a different time space frame which runs in thousa=
nds of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiting with patience, =
then where will God go? God has to come, He can't escape.>>>>

Take time ou=
t of the equation, i.e. do not put a time limit or say "I have done this sa=
dhana for XYZ years. Why is God not coming?" Wait patiently. After all, if =
you have truly surrendered, why is it a problem then to wait, let us say, 1=
000 years for Her grace? If you say "I want Her to come in 1 year or 10 yea=
rs and not 1000 years", that means you have not fully surrendered.

* * *

> How to measure it?

One can measure it by seeing how one is internally re=
acting to challenging circumstances that would earlier provoke lust, anger,=
 greed, jealosy etc inside one.

However, what will one do by measuring? It=
 is not like one can turn a knob based on the measurement to correct it.

I=
n fact, when surrender is completeone you will stop measuring or even think=
ing about how to measure it.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine gra=
ce through you that I am able to find answers to many questions that my imm=
ature mind keeps on asking! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Anyway, coming ba=
ck to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in the first book of=
 Aghora are as follows: </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1. On the page 45 it =
says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with=
 his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this biza=
rre behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, becau=
se in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! S=
ince you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things,=
 I hope to find and answer here. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>2. In q=
uite a few places, Vimalananda equates changing the loyalty from =
diety to diety as akin to prostitution, which I find as an extreme vie=
w! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so many hymns in praise=
 of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise of Sri Rama, Kr=
ishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many great comp=
osers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they wanted t=
o see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of fo=
rmer and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form=
 is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas=
 that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the l=
ove and awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ga=
nesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! </DIV>
