Dear Narasimha Bhai,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Please do not get upset or se=
rious. Standing in a line for samadhi was a joke, humour, laughter. It was =
not a insult, it was a friendly tickling.

Many of my dreams are prophetic.=
 Although they happen to me yet=A0 it is not a reality made up by my mind.
=
Several years ago Shri Hanumanji appeared to me in dream and said something=
. In the morning while drinking tea I said to my mother that last night Shr=
i Hanumanji appeared but I cannot make out what He said. My mother jumped u=
p and said it was for her. She had been doing certain prayers and had then =
stopped before completing it. I had no idea about it because I was not livi=
ng in London then.

Some months after, again I had dream in which Shri Hanu=
manji appeared and touched my head and my nephews head whom I saw in the ro=
om with myself and my mother and left our house. He did not touch my mother=
s head. In the morning I said to my mother why my nephew who lives in US, w=
as in my dream in our house and why Shri Hanumanji has blessed him and not =
any other member of the family. My mother did not know. Much later we learn=
ed that he was getting ready for a admission to a medical collage in US and=
.he is a doctor in Washington now.
=A0
Again after some months Shri Hanuman=
ji appeared  and told me to recite a Sacred Mantra. I could not, would not =
even imagine such a thing. I am not a yogi or devotee or some  high spiritu=
al being. It was not part of my reality.

You appeared to me in a lucid dre=
am some years ago standing in my room looking at religious pictures at my t=
able. I did not know you nor had asked any jyotish questions in the forum.Y=
ou were not part of my minds reality. When I wrote to you after several mon=
ths as I thought I was leaving London, you said I should study YogVasisth. =
Why did you say that?=A0 I knew immediately I would not be leaving London. =
How come this idea came to you? Or was it Grace of Divine Mother comforting=
 me in my situation through a complete stranger far away.

I no longer beli=
eve that by having desire or expectations for spiritual experiences, blocks=
 them. I used to but not anymore. We are not in Truth if we secretly desire=
 them but outwardly act and speak in a different way.Few years ago I found =
a wishing well. I said, Please Divine Mother do not appear to me in Physica=
l form in London but give me a Darshan in dream. Divine mother and loving F=
ather gave me Darshan again& again & again & again & again. Their energy an=
d memory become so intense I could hardly think clearly. True they came on =
their on own accord, but I did not say I do not desire them.

Who knows one=
 day in future you might be standing in line with Rajarshi in some Temple a=
nd Rajarshi might experience samadhi later on. I do not know what Divine Mo=
ther will do?

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Namas=
te Sir,
=A0
It is your dream and what you saw were *your* dream objects. It=
 is a reality made up by your mind, based on its conditioning. What they we=
re doing in that line is better answered by your mind than by any other per=
son.
=A0
Seriously, however, Savikalpa samadhi, Nirvikalpa samadhi, Sahaja =
samadhi etc are not things you can obtain or buy, by standing in a line. Mo=
reover, spiritual experiences never occur when one is expecting or anticipa=
ting them. Various spiritual experiences occur when most thoughts cease in =
the mind and mind is focused on something specific, such as a deity, a name=
, a mantra, a thought etc. The desire or pre-occupation
 with a samadhi or =
a spiritual experience will often work as a barrier blocking one from good =
focus and concentration.
=A0
Best
 regards,
Narasimha

      Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Few days ago I had a dream. I saw Narasimha and Rajar=
shi standing in a line/queue together. I had no difficulty in recognising N=
arasimha as he had appeared in my room at night several years ago and his p=
icture is on video. I knew immediately in dream that other person is Rajars=
hi although I do not know him.

Hay guys, what you were doing in that line?=
 Were you queueing for nirvekalp or sahaja samadhi or similar hocus pocus o=
r just mundane new years sale?

I saw Rajarshi so clearly that I would
 hav=
e recognised him among several persons in physical world but now the image =
has become very dim in my memory. 

It was good to see=A0 you both.
LaxmiNa=
rayan
