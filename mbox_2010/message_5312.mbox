Namaste,

     Just recently came to know about 'Pavamana Homa' which has a=
round 610 verses from Rigveda, for reduction of effects of past bad karmas =
if any. Supposedly it has hymns for all dieties. Any ideas if this can be d=
one by individuals? If yes which is main diety  ? Bija Mantra etc?'

Thanks=

Shashi
