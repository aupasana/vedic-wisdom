 In his Reminiscences, Kunjaswami narrates:

"In Tiruvannamalai, there was =
a rich man by name Kandaswamy. His conduct was
not particularly good and th=
e local people detested him. He used to come and
see Sri Bhagavan occasiona=
lly. In his last days, he suffered from poverty.
Once he wanted some specia=
l gruel and sent word through someone to the
ashram. He was staying in a di=
lapidated temple opposite the ashram. Sri
Bhagavan arranged for gruel to be=
 sent to him. This was sent on three
successive days. On the fourth day, Ka=
ndaswamy passed away. We informed Sri
Bhagavan of this. We thought Sri Bhag=
avan would not have anything good to
say about this man.

What a surprise! =
Sri Bhagavan said, =E2=80=98Nobody can keep his body and clothes as
clean a=
s Kandaswamy. He was next to Injikollai Dishitar in cleanliness. He
used ne=
ither oil nor soap. He would come to the tank at eight in the morning
and s=
tart washing his dhoti and towel. By the time he finished his bath, it
woul=
d be 12 noon. His hair and beard were spotlessly clean.=E2=80=99 We were re=
ally
ashamed of ourselves. Sri Bhagavan was unique in seeing only the good =
in
others.""

"Seeing only the good in others," at least in those who are d=
oing good work
=E2=80=94 what a good way to begin to be Ramana.
