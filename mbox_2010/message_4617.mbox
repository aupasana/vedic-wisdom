 D: What is the authority for saying that Brahman can be apprehended by the=

mind and at the same time that it cannot be apprehended by the mind?

Bhag=
avan: It cannot be apprehended by the impure mind but can be apprehended
by=
 the pure mind.

D: What is pure mind and what is impure mind?

Bhagavan: W=
hen the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself from
Brahman and, in =
union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)
assumes various for=
ms, it is called the impure mind. When it becomes free
from the reflection =
of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is
called the pure mi=
nd.

Its state of union with the Brahman is its apprehension of Brahman. Th=
e
energy which is accompanied by the reflection of consciousness is called =
the
impure mind and its state of separation from Brahman is its nonapprehen=
sion
of Brahman.
