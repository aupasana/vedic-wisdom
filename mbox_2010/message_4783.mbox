Every hymn of Veda is powerful. However, the ability to harness that power has been nearly taken away from humanity. As I said earlier, people use Veda mantras like any other mantras today. This is just like one using a gun as a stick to beat up an enemy.

Utpal, flamboyance can often make one lose one's balance.

I want to remind people of one basic fact. Books, lectures and writeups are nice to read or listen to. But, at the end, what saves one is one's own sadhana. The goal of lectures and books is to inspire and prepare one to do sadhana. Nothing substitutes that. Let us remember that.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
