Namaste,
 
As I wrote at the beginning of the writeup (http://tinyurl.com/homamwhy), I am merely ONE "representative of the nascent 'Do Homam Yourself' Movement". There is nothing special about me.
 
There are a few youngsters in Mumbai who are doing regular homam and progressing. They actually distributed some pamphlets in a local news paper in their area and taught homam to people who saw the pamphlets and contacted them. If someone is interested in going to them one weekend, seeing them do a homam and learning practically, one can contact them and make an arrangement. Of course, they are not commercial and the instruction is free and comes with no expectations. In Mumbai, please contact rajarshi14@... (rajarshi14 at yahoo dot co dot in) or arunishasengupta@... (arunishasengupta at yahoo dot com).

Having said that, I am pretty sure I will be in Mumbai in near future. There are people there who I need to meet and haven't met yet. I was in Pune in 2008 summer when I came to help Manish with the shooting for "Krishna: History or Myth" documentary.

This "do homam yourself" movement is slowly gaining legs. Nearly 1,000 people are doing a homam on a regular basis now. Still, these are the early days. Though people have to manage with PDF manuals, MP3 audio and youtube video for now, it will become more widespread and easier in future to learn and practice. Many people will benefit from it and world at large will benefit too. But everything takes its sweet time...

Trinidad is the land of Ram Charit Manas and Rama bhakti. About 45% people are of Indian origin, though only 25% are Hindus (others converted over the decades due to British govt's discrimination against Hindus). They are from the lowest rungs of society in India and yet kept their religion and culture alive in a foreign country. They follow Sanatana Dharma quite well and have abolished caste system completely. They cannot read complex mantras correctly, but are simple, humble and devoted. There is an unmistakable air of purity and humility in the religious crowds there. I get the feeling that somehow blessings of Guha (a character from Ramayana) are with this community.
 
British did not allow them to get any religious texts. One man long ago took a copy of Ram Charit Manas with him from India. When customs people questioned, he told them it was a "love story in Hindi". The book was allowed then. Many local people made copies of it by writing down manually and started chanting it. So, the only religious text that was present in Trinidad for a long time was Ram Charit Manas! It shaped the religious consciousness and psyche of generations of Hindus in Trinidad. Now, they have the 7th generation of Indians there and their thinking is reasonably rooted in their dharmik heritage, though they have a distinct cultural identity. I was quite impressed with Trinidadian Hindus.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Dear Bhaskar,
> Good thoughts. Just as the Jhora is helping you in performing your Jyotish functions, the Homam manuals, Mantras and Videos can collectively help you get started with the Homams. In the absence of the Guru in person, we need to accept the knowledge and wisdom that comes our way from the Guru and make the best of it.

According to the organizers, that workshop was the most attended event of the entire conference. My goal was to inspire some people to perform a quick 20 min homam by themselves on a regular basis.
