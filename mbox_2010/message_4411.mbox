Namaste Narasimha,

I only recently noticed that Shani Homam manual is havi=
ng a little different pronunciation in Shani's Parashari Mantra.
It says, "=
ChhaayamarTAAnda" Whereas i always used to recite "MarTAnda". I listened to=
 few audios on the net and they too say Martanda. Are they both right? Plea=
se clarify.

Best Regards,

Utpal
