 Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference
(b=
heda-buddhi) in Self, (even) great devas are disturbed by fear.
(Therefore)=
 it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of
non-duality, hav=
ing attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through negation
(of the =
non-Self). (1078)

That which appears (whatever it may be), let it appear, =
that which disappear
(whatever it may be), let it disappear. What (loss or =
gain) is it to
Self-knowledge? That which remains after everything has ente=
red and ceased
to exist in the oneness (kevalam) of Siva =E2=80=93 who surg=
es as the Whole (purnam)
=E2=80=93 alone is Self, one=E2=80=99s own nature.=
 (1053)

Having eradicated the ego, which was wandering like a ghost is del=
usion, and
having destroyed the duality of the sentient and the insentient,=
 the sould
which is thus drowned and fully soaked in the light of the pure =
and blissful
Sahaja Samadhi, is the Supreme Shiva. (197)

Whatever is seen =
by the ego who, having fallen from the true state of Self
and having been b=
uried in dark ignorance, takes the body as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is not at
a=
ll real and is simply non-existent. (69)

Only the ever-existing Self, othe=
r than which nothing exists and from which
nothing is different is the sole=
 reality. All that is known in that Siva
(that sole reality), who is the Su=
preme which exists and shines as sat-chit,
is only that Supreme and nothing=
 else. (986)

Those who do not keenly attend to and know the existence-cons=
ciousness which
shines ever-unsetting in the heart, fall into Maya through =
the objective
attention caused by the ego, which rises and attacks with den=
se delusion.
(644)

Know that the one real =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 appears to b=
e many =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99s because of the
body-outlook (i.e. because of th=
e wrong outlook that each body is an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99).
But through the =
outlook of Self, the one eternal existence-consciousness,
know them all to =
be one. (843)

Not forgetting consciousness (i.e, not forgetting one=E2=80=
=99s own
Self-consciousness due to pramada or inattentiveness) is the path =
of
devotion (bhakti), the relationship of unfading real love, because the r=
eal
consciousness of Self, which shines as the undivided (non-dual) supreme=

bliss itself, surges as the nature of love (or bhakti). (974)

Since the g=
reatness of the nature of oneness is that the seer alone is the
seen, one=
=E2=80=99s own reality (Self) is the greatest thing (mahat). The silent
rad=
iant first person (which shines) after the ego, the first person who is
the=
 seer, has been completely destroyed, alone is Self, the supreme
consciousn=
ess. (1058)

The pure state of having very great attachment to Self and hav=
ing no
attachment to any other thing is verily one=E2=80=99s state of Silen=
ce. Learning to
remain as =E2=80=98I am that Silence=E2=80=99 and ever abid=
ing as It is, is the true mental
worship (manasika puja). (521)

Those who =
have perfect knowledge say that the state of true knowledge
(mey-jnana-sama=
dhi), in which one remains without =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (the ego), alone is
=
maunatapas. In order to experience (that) silence (mauna), which is devoid
=
of the body thought (the feeling =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99), clingin=
g to the Self in
the heart is the sadhana. (1193)

For the extroverted inte=
llect =E2=80=93 which suffers greatly, knowing through the
senses only the =
objects of form and quality before it =E2=80=93 the means to abide
in Self =
is to begin enquiring inwardly, =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D (185)

Know tha=
t the nature of Brahma-swarupa, which is (one) without another (i.e.
which =
is non-dual), is the ancient glory. Though that ancient swarupa (Self
or Br=
ahman) appears to be like a void (sunya) it is not a void; (it is) the
one =
single existence-consciousness (sat-chit), which is the whole reality
itsel=
f. (1055)

It is not because of the rising of an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in bet=
ween (consciousness and the
insentient body) that one=E2=80=99s peace is co=
mpletely destroyed? (Therefore)
unless the wretched Vritrasura, the vain eg=
o =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is killed, Kaivalyam
(the state of oneness=
) cannot be attained. (856)

Unless the appearance (of this world) known ob=
jectively by the senses, and
the wicked ego, the knower of it, die as food =
to Siva, who shines as the
state of supreme consciousness, the supreme real=
ity cannot be attained.
(854)

The state of the experience of the non-dual =
Silence (eka advaita mouna
anubhuti), which is attained as the experience o=
f the unlimited true
knowledge (mey-jnana), is only the shining (of oneself=
) as the empty space
devoid of the false imagination which is the rising if=
 the wicked ego-mind.
(1184)

Unless one follows the principle, =E2=80=9CTh=
at which is essential to be reformed is
only my own mind=E2=80=9D, one=E2=
=80=99s mind will become more impure by seeing the defects
of others. (788)=


Fear not on seeing this empty world, which appears as a dream in the slee=
p
of Self-forgetfulness. This imaginary and bondage-causing world-picture,
=
(projected on the background) of the dark, dense mind, will not stand in th=
e
light of Supreme Knowledge, Sat-Chit-Ananda. (27)

God and Guru are in tr=
uth not different. Just as the prey which has fallen
into the jaws of a tig=
er has no escape, so those who have come within the
ambit of the Guru=E2=80=
=99s gracious gaze will be saved by the Guru, never to be
forsaken.

Those =
who have attained their aim, Jnana, do not see this world as a
multitude of=
 differences, since the multiple differences of this world are a
sportive p=
lay of Chit-Shakti, the one Whole. (58)

The true devotees who in all ways =
remain subjected (adhina) only to Self
(God), (alone) are tadiyars (those w=
ho belong to the Lord). Know that only
for them (those true devotees), in w=
hom there is unceasing love, will the
Supreme Abode (param-dhama), which tr=
iumphs as transcendent, be a complete
attainment. (1211)

By the sharp edge=
 of the sword of divine Silence cultivated in the heart by
the practice of =
jnana-vichara, one should dig out and cast away the root,
the ego, =E2=80=
=98I am the body=E2=80=99. This is the means to attain the over-brimming
ha=
ppiness of peace. (845)

That which is worthy to have as (one=E2=80=99s) ta=
rget is Self, the knowledge which
is pure bliss. The perfect life is for on=
e to exist directly as that (Self),
abiding in the heart through the unforg=
ettable knowledge (=E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99). (1094)

It is only Self, the on=
e pure knowledge, that, as the unreal knowledge (the
mind), makes all diffe=
rences (vikalpas) appear. (Therefore) for the one who
knows and reaches Sel=
f, which is the harmonious knowledge, all those other
things (the entire wo=
rld-appearance) will be (found to be) of the nature of
the one Self. (985)
=

Be assured that That which ever shines (for all) is certainly the true
Exi=
stence of Self, =E2=80=9CI am=E2=80=9D. When the True God is thus realised =
as one=E2=80=99s own
Self, without doubt or misconception, the Supreme Blis=
s will brim over.
(292)

The triputis and their source, pure consciousness =
can, under no circumstance
appear simultaneously. Like the stone and the do=
g in a statue of a dog
carded out of stone, when one appears the other will=
 not appear. (46)

Since Self is the eternal, non-dual Thing and since ther=
e is no means to
reach It other than Self-attention, know that Self itself =
is the path, Self
itself is the goal, and that they (the path and the goal)=
 are not different.
(579)

Accept the ever-shinning Self-knowledge to be th=
e only reality. Reject all
the triads, deciding them to be an imaginary dre=
am. (578)

The appearance of this world, like the illusory appearance of a =
dream, is
merely mental and its truth can be known correctly only by the su=
preme
consciousness that transcends maya, the maya. (55)

Just as the goal=
=E2=80=99s beard wanders and wags for nothing, people roam about
merrily bu=
t in vain, performing activities for the fulfillment of their
worldly desir=
es, while despising the disciplines that lead to eternal moksha
in the self=
. Ah, what a pitiable spectacle is the condition of these worldly
people. (=
71)

For those who see through perfect Jnana, this bodily life is unreal an=
d
merely mental, and therefore know that there is only misery and no benefi=
t
in jiva=E2=80=99s prolonging their jiva=E2=80=99s lifetime. (235)

Though=
 Guru Ramana, who appeared as God incarnate, expounded various
doctrines, d=
epending on the beliefs of the devotees who resorted to his
feet, what we h=
ave heard him say in private, as his own true experience, is
only ajata (no=
n-creation). (Sri Muruganar, 100)

That trustworthy vichara (Self-enquiry) =
exists neither in book learning nor
I learning from, others but only in one=
=E2=80=99s own sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (aham). (146)

Forgetting the l=
ofty purpose of coming to the sadguru and developing an
obsession for the n=
on-self is a deception brought about by immaturity in
those who are dull-wi=
tted. (152).

Though the good dharmas (righteous ones) are said to be many,=
 just as the
golden ornaments are many, the sole reality of all those dharm=
as is
sacrifice of the self, just as the sole reality of all ornaments is g=
old.
(849)

Everything that one has learned is total falsehood if it does n=
ot become a
means for (mind) consciousness to subside within the self. (143=
)

You should know that the veiling (tirodana) that makes jives forget (the=

events of past lives) is an act of supreme compassion by Iswara towards
th=
em. (116)

If memories (of the past lives) are not absent, Jiva will not at=
tain
malaparipaka (state in which purities are ready for destruction) and t=
he
lives of jives will get shattered and ruined. (117)

The vision of the S=
elf will only be encountered by those who are free of the
delusion of desir=
e, and not by more whose corrupted minds are full of
desires for sense obje=
ct (149)

Pure consciousness demands that everything that has been learned =
as
knowledge has to be completely forgotten as ignorance. (147)

He who see=
s an object as separate from consciousness cannot be a pandit who
has known=
 consciousness. (132)

A mind that runs after pleasure through the five sen=
ses, while squashing her
Lord in the heart, is an unchaste woman. (73)

The=
 vision of the Self will only encountered by those who are free of the
delu=
sion of desire, and not by more whose corrupted minds are full of
desires f=
or sense object. (149)

In the recesses of the lotus-shaped Hearts of all, =
beginning with Vishnu,
there shines as pure intellect (Absolute Consciousne=
ss) the Paramatman, who
is the same as Arunachala Ramana. When the mind mel=
ts with love of Him, and
reaches the inmost recess of the Heart wherein He =
dwells as the beloved, the
subtle eye of pure intellect opens and He reveal=
s Himself as Pure
Consciousness.

Pure consciousness demands that everythin=
g that has been learned as
knowledge has to be completely forgotten as igno=
rance. (147)

Manifestation of ancient vasanas (latent tendencies) is creat=
ion.
Destruction of vasanas is the end of creation. (84)

Know that Self, w=
hich is to be enquired into and attained in the heart as
the state of happi=
ness through the requisite tapas (or Self-attention), is
only the state of =
Silence (mauna), which is experienced by removing the
delusive and worthles=
s knowledge of differences (along with its root, the
ignorance or wrong kno=
wledge =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99). (1183)

The boat may remain in wa=
ter, but if water enters the boat, it will bring
great catastrophe, (Likewi=
se) a man may live in the world which is
surrounded by the seas, but if the=
 world enters the man, his whole life will
be miserable. (822)

<br>Not forgetting consciousness (=
