Historic Hanuman C=
halisa recital at Hyderabad for Grand Ram temple

 



27th November , 2010=
 was a historical day in the history of Bhagyanagar ( Hyderabad ) with over=
 45,000 Hindus coming together to chant the "Hanuman Chalisa" at the NTR St=
adium from 5 pm to 7 pm. This was part of the Hanuman Shakti Jagaran progra=
ms being run across the country. It is historical because the Bhaktas who c=
ame, did not come there to chant the Chalisa to seek some personal material=
 benefit but because they came there to seek Hanuman's divine powers to ens=
ure the smooth completion of a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya. The program was=
 blessed with the presence of Pujya Sree Ramanuja Chinna Jeeyar Swami, over=
 40 sadhus and sants of various maths and sampradayas, Sri Ashokji Singhal =
of VHP and Sri Bhagayyaji.Sri Ashokji Singhal threw light on the overall is=
sue of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir and the current status. 
Pu. Chinna Jeeyar sp=
oke about the need for Hindus to be assertive and not be cowed down when th=
eir religion is under attack. He also spoke about the value system that Sri=
 Rama stood for and wanted each one of us to aspire to walk on his ideals.
=




The Preparation:
During the Kumbh mela, the sadhus and sants announced =
that Hanuman chalisa must be chanted by all Hindus with the sankalp to buil=
d a Grand temple at Ayodhya for Lord Sri Rama. For the last 3 months, the c=
hanting at homes started and the first positive step was the court judgemen=
t that the birth place of Sri Rama is not disputed. However, some more clau=
ses have been added in the judgement which act as obstalces to building a G=
rand temple. Moreover, the Muslim leadership does not seem to have seen the=
 spirit of the judgment and are insisting on not giving up the land. Our co=
nviction is that these obstacles will also go away=85.
For the last one mon=
th, the karyakartas of the Hanuman shakti Jagaran Samiti worked day and nig=
ht contacting lacs of homes in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaba=
d educating them about the Ram temple issue and asking them to chant Hanuma=
n chalisa at their homes. Lacs of Hindus participated in chanting of Hanuma=
n chalisa everyday in their homes and came together as part of the Lakshaga=
la Archana program.
Obstacles by Police:
There were last minute issues by t=
he Hyderabad police who tried to stall the program. Two days before the pro=
gram when the construction of stage was to be done, they said that we canno=
t give permission and the program cannot be held. The pretext =96 =94 Dec 6=
th, is coming near and there could be problems=94. This when the informatio=
n has been given to the police so many days in advance . It is strange that=
 the same police does not stall any programs of Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen =
( MIM ) or any other Muslim program. The Samiti had to then move the court =
and the High court came down heavily on the police, that protecting law and=
 order was the duty of the police and what is wrong in having a program wit=
hin a ground. Thus, the permission for the program was got but with the dir=
ective that we must close the program by 7 pm. It is ironical that the MIM =
organised a program yesterday on the Ayodhya verdict issue from 8 pm onward=
s upto midnight and why the Hanumat Jagaran Samiti was restricted to 7 pm i=
s a matter of concern. Is it because the MIM holds 7 MLA=92s and is the Dy.=
Mayor of Hyderabad. How can there be two rules in the same city for differe=
nt communities ? 
Jai Sri Ram, Jai Bajrang Bali 
Anyway, when the Paramatma=
 is with us, obstacles fall away and thousands of families and youth fired =
with the spirit of =93Vajrang Bali=94 encompassed the NTR stadium. Cutural =
programs included some wonderful songs and a beautifully choreographed danc=
e sequence. The roars of Jai Shri Ram reverberated and set the tone for the=
 sankalp that we will ensure the successful completion of a Grand temple at=
 Ayodhya for Sri Ram. Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji ended his speech with a poignan=
t prayer for Ashokji Singhal. He said Ashokji has given most of his life fo=
r this movement and sought strength for him to see the successful completio=
n of this movement.






The road map :
As per the samiti, Hanumat Shakti =
Jagaran programs will be held at all Taluka Headquarters across the country=
 in the month of December as a reminder to the government that Sri Rama=92s=
 temple still remains at the core of the desires of crores of Hindus across=
 the country.
Jai Sri Ram, Jai Bharat
