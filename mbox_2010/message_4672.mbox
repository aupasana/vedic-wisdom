 RAMA asked: But, Holy sir, how can one restrain this wheel of cosmic
illus=
ion which revolves with such tremendous force?

VASISTHA replied: O Rama, t=
he mind is the hub around which this vicious
cycle revolves, creating delus=
ion in the minds of the deluded. It is by
firmly restraining that hub throu=
gh intense self-effort and keen
intelligence that the whole wheel is brough=
t to a standstill. When the hub's
motion is stopped the wheel does not revo=
lve: when the mind is stilled,
illusion ceases. One who does not know this =
trick and does not practice it,
undergoes endless sorrow; the moment the tr=
uth is seen, behold! the sorrow
comes to an end.

The disease of the percep=
tion of this world-illusion is not cured except
through the mastery of the =
mind. Hence O Rama, abandon all other activities
like pilgrimage, gifts and=
 austerities, and bring the mind under your
control for our ultimate good. =
This world appearance abides in the mind,
even as there is space within the=
 pot; if the pot is broken, the illusory
division of space vanishes and if =
the mind ceases to be, the concept of a
world within the mind also ceases t=
o be. Even as an insect trapped within
the pot attains freedom of movement =
when the pot is broken, you will also
enjoy freedom when the mind ceases to=
 be, along with the world-illusion
contained in it.

Live in the present wi=
th your consciousness externalized momentarily, but
without any effort: whe=
n the mind stops linking itself to the past and to
the future it becomes no=
-mind. If from moment to moment your mind dwells on
what is and drops it ef=
fortlessly at once, the mind becomes no-mind, full of
purity. It is only as=
 long as the mind continues to be agitated that it
experiences diversity of=
 its own projection or expansion, even as rain falls
only as long as there =
are clouds; and it is only as long as the infinite
consciousness limits its=
elf into the finite mind that such agitation and
expansion take place. If c=
onsciousness ceases to be the finite mind, then
know that the very roots of=
 cyclic world-illusion (of birth and death) are
burnt and there is perfecti=
on.
