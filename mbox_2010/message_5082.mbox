Namaste,
 
Happy nava ratris and happy Durgashtami!
 
An erudite friend, who is a Devi upasaka, wrote a commentary on the inner meaning of Chandipath (aka Durga Saptashati or Devi Mahatmyam) and sent it to me sometime back. He gave me permission to share it with anyone who may be interested. His name is Dr Satya Prakash Choudhary.
 
I have been doing a Chandi homam daily for more than 3 years and chant these 700 verses everyday in front of fire. Whatever little insights were given by fire after repeated chanting are closely aligned with the esoteric interpretation given by Dr Choudhary in this writeup. This is the best exposition of the esoteric significance of Chandipath I have seen so far. I am pleased to share it with all of you. You can access the writeup at:

Best regards,
Narasimha
