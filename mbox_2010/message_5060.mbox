      <p>Namaste friends,<br>
 <br>
A member of this=
 group gifted me a book when he met me for a saamoohika Satya Narayana vrat=
am we conducted at Cary, North Carolina last year. I finally got to read a =
little from it. I am impressed with this work.<br>
 <br>
The book is called=
 "Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America"=
; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It =
has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.<br>


 <br>
Perverted sc=
holars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upon India and Hind=
uism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted researches in the n=
ame of academic freedom at the religious studies departments of western uni=
versities, published them and gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in=
 the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with this will not improve =
the situation or solve the problem. Interested religious scholars have to f=
irmly and patiently crtique these works in the same academic style, in orde=
r to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.<br>


 <br>
Several papers in=
 this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western scholars an=
d rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hasty, nonsensica=
l or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.<br>


 <br>
*   =
     *        *<br>
 <br>
I will just give an example of the offensive work=
 that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offen=
sive writings should skip the next three paragraphs.]<br>
 <br>
Jeffrey Kri=
pal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal and did=
 research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there enthusiastically=
 helped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced is utterly nons=
ensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation without sho=
wing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or linguistic in=
accuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he produced onl=
y years later, after his book "Kali's Child" based on the PhD=
 dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award at the America=
l Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book w=
as sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choic=
e for learning about Ramakrishna.<br>


 <br>
In the book, he portrayed Ram=
akrishna as a sexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He d=
id not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from an=
y Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty trans=
lations, willful distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sensa=
tional (and damning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word that me=
ans "lap" as "genitals", in the context of Swami Brahma=
nanda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakr=
ishna's lap. He translated a word that means "touching softly"=
; as "uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys".=
<br>


 <br>
Even in places where there was no material to mis-translate, h=
e simply speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri =
and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught a=
dvaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experi=
ence nirvikalpa samadhi: "What it must have been like for Ramakrishna,=
 a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with =
another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man's=
 nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#=
39;s attention. How could it not?" Please note that he is not referrin=
g to any source and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based on his=
 perverted agenda!<br>


 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
If you see the=
 book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship driven by hein=
ous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people under asuric influence=
s make their livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading falsehoods abou=
t Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.<br>


 <br>
Those who are not i=
nclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this and go on doi=
ng their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to strengthen sana=
tana dharma, this kind of things will automatically weaken. However, some s=
cholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically is really required on t=
he ground. We need to give our encouragement to the pioneers who are doing =
this important scholarly rebuttal.<br>
