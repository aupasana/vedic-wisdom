Dear Members,

At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me =
into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward f=
rom Jyotishwritings on "efficacy of remedies". I humbly agree that jHora is=
 not the right forum for discussing these topics.

I have gone through the =
homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being per=
formed  and have the following observations to make.

1. As per rules laid =
out by  srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various=
 rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (w=
hich is the prakruti of all yajnas).

2. All steps in darsapoornamasa shoul=
d be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form=
, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and w=
hich are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by=
 acharyas.

3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras s=
uch as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omiss=
ions.

4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. becom=
e worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right proce=
dure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "fire=
 ritual" as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits =
Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.

5. The procedur=
e in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large de=
viations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures=
. 

6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a part=
icular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the =
bottom of the prceeding ones.

7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantr=
a parishkekam) with the mantra "deva savita prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be=
 from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru=
 karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner =
(Eshaadi eeshaantam).

8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles us=
ed in the vessel above darbha is missing.

9.Prokshanee samskaram and proks=
hanam for purification of the utensils is missing.

10. Patra samskaram or =
purifying the utensils is missing.

11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam=
 on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with da=
rbha) is missing.

12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missi=
ng.

13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of =
the homa dravya used for havan is missing.

14. Darvee samskaram or purific=
ation of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be us=
ed (sruksruvou).

15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.

16=
. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=
issing.

17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in=
 the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of g=
hee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.

and m=
any more ............

18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the de=
ity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as=
 carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity =
pronounced in satva tyaga,  agni carries the offering to the particular dei=
ty. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)

1=
8. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the ag=
ni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is convert=
ed into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya =
ahutis.

19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantr=
a sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don'=
t involve veda mantras so that you don't have to struggle to get the right =
pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas=
 who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted  to perfrom hom=
am for any devata.


20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda=
 work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an ab=
le guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.

21. I sugges=
t that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may =
not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge unco=
rrupted.
