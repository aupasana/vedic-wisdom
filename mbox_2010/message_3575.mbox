I was watching the youtube videos of this homam being performed short 
version and was wondering if anyone could help me a little, or maybe a 
lot lol. In this homam as I am sure in all homama there are some mudras 
and mantras recited with the mudra as well. I am wondering three things.
1. Where can I find the mudras used and explenations of them?
2. Where can I learn the correct chackra to touch and the mudra used and 
bhiij mantra used for each chakra?
3. What is the significance of the snapping the fingers four times 
around the head?

Any response would be helpful as well as if someone could help me learn 
these mantra and mudra. If you are available on skype let me know my 
skype name is "h4v0k_d0m" add me and message anytime. I enjoy making new 
friends. :-)

Aum Namashivaya
