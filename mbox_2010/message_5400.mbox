Introduction

By Sri Dharma Pra=
vartaka Acharya

The foundation of every individual religion and philosophi=
cal system on earth is the claim that only that one religion or philosophy =
possesses the truth...that it alone has the authority to proclaim what is t=
rue and what is not. The question of what constitutes the proper derivation=
 of religious authority is one of the most important, and one of the most c=
ontentious, issues in the realm of religious and philosophical debate. To g=
reater or lesser extents (though definitely mostly greater), every religiou=
s sect, spiritual tradition, denomination, school of philosophy, and spirit=
ual leader makes the claim of having access to the truth. Indeed, for most =
religious and philosophical systems, whether religious and secular in world=
-view, it is claimed, either overtly or else by obvious implication, that t=
heirs is the only direct and sure means for knowing truth. Whether we speak=
 of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Marxism, Science, Ath=
eism, or any system of thought on earth, every philosophical system claims =
that they, and only they, are in a position of bestowing truth. "Only we ha=
ve access to the real Truth", every religious teacher claims. As a direct r=
esult of such competing truth-claims, coupled with the natural variance of =
such claims that results from multiple individuals claiming to know truth, =
we have witnessed several millennia of religious and philosophical contenti=
on. 

While every philosophy can attempt to claim that theirs is the only p=
ath to truth, however, before we can even approach the question of what dif=
fering religions claim, and thus begin the process of philosophical assessm=
ent of these claims, first we need to answer the fundamental question of ho=
w any religion can even claim to know the truth at all. For those religions=
 that claim to be revealing the nature of the Absolute, how is it even poss=
ible for the Absolute, which is infinite, to be understood by finite humans=
? Before we can claim to know God, first we need to grapple with the proble=
m of the very possibility of knowing God at all. The question of "how can w=
e claim to know anything at all?" is the domain of the field of epistemolog=
y, or the science of human knowledge, cognition and perception. 

The scope=
 of the present work is not to attempt to put an end to all religious conte=
ntion, nor to necessarily insist on a conclusive proof that one system of r=
eligious/philosophical thought is in some way superior to all others. Rathe=
r it is my desire that this book will greatly add to a larger general under=
standing of the basic issues of derivation of religious authority as these =
issues pertain specifically to the realm of epistemology, or the systematic=
 study of the nature of knowing. The focus of this work is centered upon th=
e little studied, and even less understood, school of Vedic epistemology. T=
hough it is undoubtedly one of the most ancient systems in the world dedica=
ted to the study of knowledge derivation, Vedic epistemology is a developme=
nt in the history of philosophy that has been routinely neglected as a fiel=
d of serious study by the majority of both academic observers of the histor=
y and philosophy of religion, as well as by most Hindu leaders, seekers and=
 lay-persons. It is my hope that this work will mark the beginning of a gre=
ater interest in this fascinating subject.

My book focuses directly on iss=
ues of epistemology, as well as determining the philosophical bounds of spi=
ritual knowledge. Specifically, I undertake a comparative analysis of the p=
erceptual processes utilized to derive knowledge of ontologically transmate=
rial realities (God, soul, etc.) in the philosophical systems of Hinduism, =
Buddhism, and the whole of the Western philosophical tradition (with specia=
l emphasis on Plato, Augustine and Anselm). While the ultimate goal of my b=
ook is conducting an examination of Vedic epistemology per se, I am purpose=
fully centering the focus of this book on the theories of the 16th Century =
philosopher, Jiva Gosvami. Jiva Gosvami's epistemological theories represen=
t an interesting approach in the long history of South Asian religion relat=
ive to the question of what, precisely, constitutes authoritative knowledge=
. In many ways, Jiva both personifies radical orthodoxy, while simultaneous=
ly being a very original thinker. 

I decided to focus on the epistemologic=
al ideas of this specific philosopher because his epistemological teachings=
 serve as a highly representative axial milieu around which to understand b=
oth the full scope of Hindu epistemology, as well as many of the specific i=
ssues and implications that arise from this subject. 

Unlike the majority =
of Hindu philosophers, Jiva Gosvami (c.1511-c.1596) feels that the smrti li=
terature is more authoritative than shruti, and thus rests the basis of his=
 epistemology, not on the Vedas, but on the Purana literature. Additionally=
, he takes the rather unusual approach of accepting ten distinct ways of kn=
owing (pramanas) as all being epistemically authoritative. Despite the fact=
 that Jiva Gosvami's philosophical theories represent a somewhat unique app=
roach to the field of Hindu epistemology, very sparse research has thus far=
 been attempted in the Western world on this Indian thinker. 

I have sever=
al aims in this present work. First, since Jiva Gosvami represents a school=
 of thought relatively unknown in the Western world, I will present an outl=
ine of his epistemological theories and place them within the greater conte=
xt of Indian philosophy. This will be accomplished by surveying his theorie=
s as contained in his two most important works: Tattva-sandarbha and his au=
tocommentary on the same, the Sarva-samvadini. Second, I will analyze and c=
ritique his arguments from a philosophical perspective using propositional,=
 comparative, and veridical analyses. Third, I will explore the significanc=
e of Jiva Gosvami's ideas for Vedanta. Lastly, I will speak about the immen=
se implications of these epistemological theories for the future of epistem=
ology and philosophy of religion. 

Again, employing Jiva Gosvami's ideas a=
s a philosophical anchor and as a backdrop for the cultural milieu that rep=
resented the historical height of inter-philosophical epistemological debat=
e, the ultimate goal of this work is actually to present the profound insig=
hts and practical efficacy of the Vedic way of knowing God. 

Though this m=
ay seem at first glance to be a rigidly academic work, it is my hope that a=
cademic scholars will, in actuality, serve as only a secondary audience for=
 this work. My primary audience are those sincere spiritual practitioners, =
yogis and yoginis, dedicated Hindus, and followers of Sanatana Dharma globa=
lly who wish to have a more thorough understanding of precisely what it mea=
ns to know God in the Vedic tradition, and to thus deepen their own experie=
nce of the presence of God in their everyday lives. 

As I hope this work w=
ill make abundantly clear, God is not merely an interesting idea designed t=
o serve as the theoretical kindling of fueled academic debate. Rather, God =
is the grounding ontological principle that makes all conceptual and percep=
tual activities on the part of all human beings even possible. It is, indee=
d, in knowing the Absolute that we have access to knowing absolute knowledg=
e. 

The Vedic path powerfully reveals to us the fact that God is very much=
 real.

Moreover, as this book systematically and thoroughly explains, it i=
s through the Vedic path that God can be intimately known.

date, it reveals the precise mystical mechanisms employed for knowing the D=
ivine; the psychological conditions necessary for such a spiritual endeavor=
; the transformative cognitive experiences that occur within the spiritual =
practitioner upon achieving God-realization; the integral relationship betw=
