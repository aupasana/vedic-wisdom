Namaste,
 
The explanation I gave was after the fact. In fact, I don't think many astrologers would've suggested diamond, that too on the right hand index finger, in this case.
 
Similarly, there are no accounts of any astrologer suggesting Kaali worship to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Trailinga Swami.
 
Astrology is a fantastic subject that was taught by rishis for a purpose. However, it is in a badly corrupted state today. I am not saying it casually but after studying the subject for 30+ years (especially seriously for 17 years). No wonder Swami Vivekananda downplayed astrology and said it was for weak-minded people.
 
It will be awesome if a few spiritual sadhakas who have achieved some level of detachment focus their energies on astrology and work on refining it, without any raajasik considerations such as money, fame, acceptance in the Jyotish community, pride of doing good work etc. However, this list is not the right forum for it. There are many yahoogroups dedicated to astrology (e.g. vedic-astrology).
 
As things stand now, I spend a good amount of time on astrology research, but do not recommend anybody to give it too much credence in guiding their spiritual sadhana. Listening to your guru(s), listening to your elders and people you respect and listening to your conscience is better in the matter of spiritual sadhana, than going by questionable thumbrules of astrology.
 
Hopefully, our generation can leave things in a better shape for the next generation.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
