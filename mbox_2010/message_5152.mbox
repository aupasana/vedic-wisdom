namaste,

glad to join this group - after a number of years of claimimg to =
be hindu I discover that I haven't the faintest ideas about the RuShi names=
 associated with vaidika mantra. Further more the Chandas, devata besides k=
hilakam is also important. I have found Maharshi University of management h=
as PDF files that give these details. I have book markd these for easy refe=
rence - and also using spreadsheets to have quick analysis and understandin=
g.

I am dooing a lot more "work" with hindus study than I ever did. I gues=
s that is the reason for me to have RuShi RuNaM pitRu RuNaM and daiva RuNaM=
 - living in debt to these is living in humility and joy.

regards
