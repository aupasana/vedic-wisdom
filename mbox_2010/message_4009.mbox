*Why Swami Nithyananda Must Resign Now
Wednesday, 17 March 2010 =
18:40 Rajiv Malhotra*

When the sex scandal of Swami Nithyananda suddenly e=
rupted on March 2, 2010,
I was already in Delhi as part of a group to go to=
 Kumbh Mela. I was also
finalizing my new book which deals specifically wit=
h Tamil Nadu religious
politics, and in particular with the role of various=
 nexuses based overseas.
So I decided to jump into the eye of the storm of =
this scandal in order to
investigate whether similar nexuses were at work i=
n this case. Naturally, at
one level I have seen this scandal through the f=
ramework of a civilization
encounter in which Vedic culture is pitted again=
st the Dravidian
divisiveness that is being backed by Christian evangelism.=
 At another level,
I found that the sensationalized media reports were too =
one-sided, and none
of them had a single statement to report from the swami=
 himself.
Furthermore, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from=
 Swami
Nithyananda's inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned o=
ut
differently had they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will
e=
laborate later in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has
be=
en to extrapolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu
organ=
izations, which I predict will face similar scandals as and when their
weak=
nesses become understood by those opposed to them. This article
highlights =
my findings at these multiple levels and issues.

During this 2-week invest=
igative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to
give Swami Nithyananda's =
organization the benefit of doubt and to report
their side of the story. Be=
sides wanting to balance out the one-sided media
depictions, I wanted acces=
s to the ashram's core group for my own research
on the broader subject of =
civilization encounters. I respect the
sensitivities of that organization c=
onsisting of many decent and dedicated
devotees who have sacrificed a great=
 deal and stand to lose a lot.

But I have concluded that the situation is =
now beyond repair for Swami
Nithyananda and that his continued involvement =
can only damage the broader
interests of dharma as well as jeopardize the a=
shramites. Along with two
other sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have=
 personally recommended to
Swami Nithyananda that the best course at this s=
tage would be for him to
resign completely from his organization. He should=
 turn it over to a small
team of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets =
can be used in the best
interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of=
 these mahatmas he must
live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institut=
ional responsibilities.
Because the head of any organization must accept re=
sponsibility that "the
buck stops here," only such a move can salvage the o=
rganization and the
reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this=
 resignation would
hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up =
against him
personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is=
 up to him to
accept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclusion b=
ecomes clearer
once the reader has gone through the rest of this article.
I=
 want to begin by examining some principles about the relationships between=

siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This will
=
provide the framework in which to interpret what has happened. Then I will
=
turn to my initial interest in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism in
s=
outh India from a variety of forces.


Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers)=
 and Morality
A few days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private =
conversation
with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introd=
uced myself as
an independent researcher who is writing a series of books o=
n Indian
civilization in the context of the global challenges and opportuni=
ties. One
of my volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus sinc=
e the 1960s
=96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh =
Yogi,
Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri =
Sri
himself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus, in term=
s of
the shifts in their Western followers over time, their scandals, their=

Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her
po=
sition sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western
modernit=
y on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Swami
Nithyananda w=
ill become clear very soon.

The first provocative question I asked Sri Sri=
 concerned the nature of yogic
powers: What is the relationship between sid=
dhis and morality? If siddhis
are a scientific phenomena dealing with power=
s that can be harnessed by all
humans then one must bear in mind that scien=
ce deals with truths that are
morally neutral. If Einstein was declared to =
have lived an immoral life it
would not invalidate his scientific theories.=
 A person who designs aircrafts
or any other complex technological systems =
may or may not be moral in order
to be effective in his technical work. In =
other words, rtam (the patterns of
the cosmos), which we discover and call =
science, functions independently of
human morality. This is why a scientifi=
c principle can be used either
morally or immorally, because it is independ=
ent of morality. There are moral
persons who lack any siddhis or even ordin=
ary scientific competence.
Conversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana=
) who lack morality. Sri
Sri's pranayama techniques would also produce resu=
lts for an immoral person.


Sri Sri seemed impressed by this question, and=
 agreed with my overall
position on the independence between siddhis and mo=
rality. But he pointed
out that the moral dimension, while not determining =
the siddhis, was also
important because it led to receiving the grace of th=
e divine. I agree with
him.

So there are two separate phenomena involved: =
(i) spiritual technologies
that are objective and that allow anyone to harn=
ess spiritual energies, and
(ii) morality which is important in itself, not=
 for attaining siddhis, but
in order to have a positive relationship with t=
he divine. Either one can be
developed without the other; however, the dhar=
ma tradition encourages us to
cultivate both. The reason that meditation sy=
stems prescribe things like
vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an ina=
ppropriate lifestyle
interferes with the mental tranquility required to adv=
ance. This lifestyle
change can be appreciated regardless of whether one be=
lieves in a personal
God or not. This absence of a personal God is clear in=
 Buddhist meditation.
Different Hindu systems place different levels of emp=
hasis upon a personal
God for the yoga to function. This is why many secula=
r and scientifically
minded persons are also drawn towards meditation techn=
iques. In other words,
something cannot be a science if it depends upon mor=
ality, because science
is objective and stands independent of morality.

Th=
e relevance of this question is as follows: Many persons who have learned
a=
dvanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to know if any moral
breache=
s by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of achieving higher
states =
of consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal against the legendary
Swami =
Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges by a large number
of his=
 Western female disciples, the Western academy rashly condemned not
only on=
e man's morality, but also the whole legitimacy of the Indian
tradition its=
elf. In that series of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah
Caldwell, etc=
.), I took the same position then as I am taking now: that
Muktananda's cap=
abilities in harnessing spiritual energies are separate and
independent fro=
m whether or not he violated any code of morality.

Patanjali warns against=
 getting lured by siddhis which appear along the way
when one practices adv=
anced meditation persistently. One is not supposed to
indulge in them. This=
 warning is found in various Hindu systems that deal
with the body as a veh=
icle for spiritual evolution, because these energies
are very powerful and =
can get out of control. Another point that is worth
noting is that the tech=
niques taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his
original ones; he has made i=
t clear repeatedly that they are from the Shiva
Sutras which have a long hi=
story in our civilization. I feel that he does
have the siddhi of being abl=
e to transmit these techniques very effectively
to others. For instance, I =
have never before in my life been able to sit
still and alert in meditation=
 for the whole night, but he had a few hundred
persons in a large hall achi=
eving this. The point here is similar to saying
that the mathematics and go=
lf I have learned from someone is not invalidated
when the teacher is found=
 to be immoral.

Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separatel=
y and
independently from whether his siddhis are genuine.

Is Tantra a Part=
 of Hinduism?

The second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be comple=
tely dealt with
in the time available for our meeting. I hope to pursue thi=
s some day with
him and with various other acharyas for my own benefit. Its=
 significance in
the present scandal becomes clear soon. I asked whether th=
e Shiva Sutras are
valid, pointing out that among the 112 spiritual enlight=
enment techniques
taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual contact between =
a male yogi and a
female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well as the Tantra tra=
ditions have
included exemplars that practiced these techniques. Recently, =
Osho tried to
revive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra has brought some eleme=
nts of these
into his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar =
of Tantra and
Kashmir Shaivism, is one of the voices who brings out the aut=
henticity of
these approaches in the tradition, despite the common rejectio=
ns by society
at large. The tradition considers itself not suitable for mai=
nstream society
and is meant only for a small subset of people.

Many popul=
ar Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of the Tantra
traditions =96 =
such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were
not separat=
e until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in
Adi Shankar=
a all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of
Vaishnavism who took=
 Ramanuja's ideas further), and even more recently in
the life of Sri Ramak=
rishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra
practitioners, but they do it p=
rivately and not publicly.

I have an unpublished monograph that shows the =
history of this shift in
Indian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was und=
er British rule that
certain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started=
 to condemn (as part
of their "reform" of Hinduism) those aspects of Hindui=
sm that bothered
puritan Christian values. It must be noted that Christiani=
ty has had a very
negative posture towards the human body starting with the=
 Biblical episode
of Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called "witche=
s") got demonized
by the Church in its very official genocide of several mi=
llion practitioners
across Europe. This Church prosecution was called the I=
nquisition and was
widespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and an=
ything concerning
the body as a spiritual resource was considered not only =
immoral but also
demonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. The =
term "occult" was
used to refer to a vast assortment of such practices and =
was heavily
condemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.
This mentalit=
y entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of
India was pas=
sed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen
tribes that p=
racticed such "evil" techniques, and they were officially
persecuted into e=
xtinction. A middle-class "whitened" Hinduism evolved as
the mark of being =
"civilized" on British terms. We could thus be proud of
our identity, now t=
hat it was "cleansed" of "primitive" practices of our
ancestors.

In this h=
istory of removing Tantra out of Hinduism, some people include
Swami Viveka=
nanda among those who undermined Tantra. I disagree with this
charge. He wa=
s saying a separate set of things to his Western audiences than
to Indians.=
 In his Western lecture tours, he presented a Hinduism that
Westerners coul=
d relate to and appreciate, but he did not ask Indians to
shift their pract=
ice. It is unfortunate that after his death, the
Ramakrishna Mission he sta=
rted has diluted itself into a sort of
pseudo-Christianity. Kali and other =
related Tantra deities, symbols and
rituals that were dear to Ramakrishna h=
imself, have become "hidden" for the
"private" use by the monks, but are ma=
rginalized publicly and considered as
an embarrassment. Their lead in this =
direction has spread across modern
Hinduism to such an extent that Vedic Hi=
nduism has become separated from
Tantra, and Tantra is now widely condemned=
 by many Hindu gurus. This is also
a factor that worked against Swami Nithy=
ananda's reputation among orthodox
Hindu leaders, for he uses Tantric techn=
iques that arouse body energies,
such as kundalini.

My own feeling is that=
 Tantra is making a big comeback. First there was
Western popularity of dis=
torted versions of Tantra; but this is now being
followed by more clinical =
experimentation by psychologists and others. The
whole issue of latent huma=
n energies and potentials (both positive and
dangerous) is a hot topic of s=
erious scientific investigation. Hindus should
reclaim this aspect of their=
 own tradition rather than waiting for U-Turned
(appropriated) versions to =
get re-exported back to India, packaged as "Made
in USA" spiritual science.=
 This requires an attitude of experimentation
under the appropriate control=
s to prevent abuses and quackery.

I just returned from Kumbh Mela where I =
walked amidst several tens of
thousands of naga sadhus who were completely =
naked. I did not consider them
as either vulgar or primitive. The old guard=
 of Hindu orthodoxy rejects
Tantra at least in public, and yet lives in con=
tradictions because they do
respect the naga sadhus and also the various sy=
mbols and rituals that have
their foundations in Tantra. The vacuum left by=
 avoiding the subject of
Tantra has created opportunities for the likes of =
Wendy Doniger to formulate
distorted interpretations. I feel that Hindu spi=
ritual practitioners as well
as intellectuals must take back control over T=
antra as an intrinsic part of
our tradition.

Sex and Morality

Against thi=
s backdrop, I will address the issue of Swami Nithyananda's
morality. Just =
to recap:
My first point above has been that the morality issue about Swami=

Nithyananda does not impact the effectiveness of the meditation techniques=

he has taught very successfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the
t=
ens of thousands of practitioners for themselves.
My second point was that =
there is nothing inherent about sex that is
rejected by Hinduism across the=
 board, although certain strains of Hinduism
do reject sex seeing it as har=
mful to spirituality.
Here it must be noted that brahmacharya (involving se=
xual abstinence) is
just one of the spiritual paths of Hinduism. The first =
half of my recent
stay in Haridwar was as a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, o=
ne of the greatest
and largest Hindu movements, that does not advocate bein=
g brahmachari. Its
founder, its present head and its members at large, are =
householders and not
brahmacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral=
 authenticity under
this system, he would have to pronounce himself as a ho=
useholder and not a
sannyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine h=
is morality by some
other criteria.

Another approach for him could have be=
en to announce himself as an
experimenter of Tantra for modern times, there=
by making himself transparent
of any such charges. This would place him in =
the same category as Osho. Many
times in his public discourses and teaching=
s, he has praised Osho as his
greatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He=
 even said that many of his own
teachings were derived from Osho. But he fa=
iled to publicly clarify whether
he was practicing those techniques that in=
volve sex. Privately, he explained
to me in recent days that Shiva Sutras h=
ave two categories of techniques.
Most of the sutras do not involve physica=
l contact with another person and
only use the four senses of sight, sound,=
 taste and smell as pathways to
spiritual experiences. Hence an individual =
practices these techniques
entirely on his/her own. This path is what he ha=
s taught thus far to the
public. The best pursuit of this path is as a brah=
amachari according to him,
and he has initiated many followers into it. But=
 for a small number of
persons, he feels that the 6 sutras involving sexual=
 Tantra need to be
tested and perfected for modern times, before they can b=
e safely taught more
widely. This he considers to be like any R & D done in=
 a lab for developing
a product.
My sense is that he did practice Tantra wi=
th a very small number of persons,
and I believe that he even entered into =
written legal contracts with them to
make sure that both parties were clear=
 about the arrangement. The reason for
this "Non-Disclosure Agreement" was =
to make sure that someone who willingly
approaches him for Tantra does not =
later accuse him of inappropriate
physical contact. On March 9 (about a wee=
k ago), I did a specific video
interview with him dealing with this issue v=
ery specifically. But this video
was blocked by his ashram leaders even tho=
ugh he personally felt that it was
a good idea to show it. I gave up arguin=
g in favor of showing it, because
his ashram management took a firm stand a=
gainst it. I still feel that this
was a blunder they made. Swami Nithyanand=
a is very forthright and clear in
that interview =96 I felt that it was the=
 best interview of all the ones I did
with him, but it was never made publi=
c.
I surmise that Ranjitha, the Tamil actress in the scandalous videotape, =
was
practicing Tantra with him. He taught her the self-control she had to
a=
chieve before any intimacy. I have tried to interview her in order to get
h=
er side of the story, but so far I have not succeeded in getting through to=

her. Based on third party reports from some persons who are in touch with
=
her, and the media reports of her statements, her stance seems to be along
=
the following lines: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasio=
n
shown in the videotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But this
a=
ctivity did not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also
sai=
d that the videos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what
actual=
ly happened, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not show
portio=
ns where he asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos
seem to =
have been turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed
any comp=
laint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex
between ad=
ults, and that too backed by a formal written contract between the
parties.=
 Because she has refused to give any statement against Swami
Nithyananda, s=
he feels threatened by those who set her up and who did this
sting operatio=
n. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety
from this mafia-=
like conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate this
thesis directly f=
rom her.

My concern about his morality is, therefore, not based on sex bet=
ween
consenting adults. Rather, my moral issue is about the lack of transpa=
rency
before the public. He could have openly said that he wants to select =
a few
yoginis to experiment Tantra under mutual consent. At worst this woul=
d have
upset many followers and pushed them away. In response to my concern=
 over
his lack of transparency, he could offer the argument that this was a=

private activity between adults who are under no obligation to disclose it=

to the public. After all, people do not go about broadcasting their sexual=

lives. So long as this was under mutual consent, he might say, it cannot b=
e
an offense. And if it was done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Sut=
ra,
it was also an act within the Hindu tradition despite the controversy
s=
urrounding Tantra today.

Having given this best case argument on his behal=
f, I must say that there
could also be the alternative scenario, namely, th=
at this was mere lust
packaged as Tantric spirituality. David White, one of=
 Wendy's Children, has
written extensively making the claim that all Tantra=
 is "hard core porn"
that gets wrapped up before the public in metaphysical=
 mumbo-jumbo to appear
to be legitimate spirituality, which he calls "soft =
porn" coating. White's
latest book takes this allegation to the extreme, an=
d states that all major
yogic exemplars in Indian history were basically no=
t engaged in any kind of
spirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were=
 developing personal power
for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqua=
lified to comment on whether
Swami Nithyananda's case fits this notion of "=
soft porn," or whether it was
legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate fac=
tual data of what happened to
pass judgment either way.
This concludes what=
 I have to say about his morality issue as shown in the
sex tapes.

My Impr=
essions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal
I was introduced to Swam=
i Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent
Hindu leader based in C=
alifornia. This man was so impressed by the young
swami that he frequently =
called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I
told him that I had a guru=
 already, and that my present interest in
interacting with gurus was mainly=
 as a part of my research for my book on
global gurus. He arranged a privat=
e meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,
which I used mostly to explain the=
 civilization threats facing Hinduism,
citing numerous examples, and questi=
oned him on his position in this regard.
I found him to be very sharp, a gr=
eat listener, and in agreement that we
must engage social issues rather tha=
n pursuing the "world negating" or
"escapist" paths that are typical of man=
y gurus today.
Later on, I attended a weekend course in USA where he taught=
 the Patanjali
Yoga Sutras. I have read several translations of this great =
classical work,
but I had never before seen it taught experientially. Swami=
 Nithyananda gave
the attendees their own personal inner experience of ever=
y one of the eight
limbs of Patanjali's system, right up to and including s=
amadhi. This was
quite an achievement in two days.

Overall, my interaction=
s with him remained centered largely on the
geopolitics of religions. I saw=
 him as a prominent swami who was not running
away from troubling issues, s=
uch as Christian conversions and the
Dravidianization of Tamil identity. Gi=
ven that I have been writing a book
for three years (now in the editing sta=
ge) on this very issue as it exists
in Tamil Nadu, I was especially impress=
ed by his experimental program of a
Hindu temple on wheels traveling from v=
illage to village. In each village
this mobile temple stops and offers chan=
ting, a talk by one of the leaders,
food, medicines, etc. So it combines re=
ligion with social service and thus
competes directly against Christian eva=
ngelism. Rather than building a
temple in every village and needing a puroh=
it in each of the thousands of
villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was=
 to bring to each village this
"temple on wheels." What I discovered by my =
own independent fact-finding was
that wherever this temple on wheels went, =
the missionaries were upset
because it blunted their conversion efforts.
I =
attended his 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various
techni=
ques in it are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of
this ca=
n be done by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly
equally be=
tween Indians and whites from North America.

In several side conversations=
 with him as well in the public forum, I
pursued the point that I already h=
ave a guru since 1994, so I was not
looking for a new guru. Since my guru h=
ad left the body a few years ago, I
wanted to continue learning new techniq=
ues for my practice. I explained to
him that I had previously learned and p=
racticed meditation techniques from
multiple sources for over 30 years, inc=
luding: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri
Sri Ravi Shankar, Yogi Amrit Desai (who =
certified me as a teacher), Deepak
Chopra, Vipassana, and more. Additionall=
y, I had practiced numerous bhakti
traditions, as well as formal Vedanta ed=
ucation from Swami Chinmayananda and
Ramakrishna Mission. I went through a =
serious study of the writings by Sri
Aurobindo, various Madhyamika Buddhist=
 systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana
Maharshi, etc. So I was not seeking a ne=
w guru like most others who took his
courses.

I have to say that he never =
pressured me to adopt him as my new guru, and
even said that one must remai=
n loyal to one's guru. To be classified as a
devotee/disciple of his, there=
 are two criteria, neither of which applies to
me. First, there is an optio=
nal program one can sign up for, to do "paada
puja" at the guru's feet, in =
order to develop a special link with him. The
second is that one can ask to=
 be given an initiation with a new name, in
which case his policy is that t=
he person must legally change his/her name,
and use this new name publicly.=
 I did not do either of these steps. So my
relationship is not as a devotee=
 or disciple, but more arms-length.

It was a two-way street. While he taug=
ht me meditation, I brought to him my
scholarship on the geopolitical posit=
ioning of Hinduism which I feel the
gurus know only superficially. They do =
not adequately know things like:
Western philosophy, neither of the religio=
us nor the secular variety; or
Western history; or Western institutions tha=
t have been set up explicitly to
spread its civilization; or various global=
 campaigns under way to invade
Indian civilization through conversions, edu=
cation, media, political
policymaking and more.

He requested that I should=
 present him my findings on such matters so that
he and his senior acharyas=
 could learn. I told him that most gurus have
little time to listen attenti=
vely to a layperson like me, because the gurus
like to do all the talking. =
He replied that he would sit and listen to me
seriously. I made it clear th=
at I was disinterested in giving a short talk
of a few minutes, because my =
findings required considerable time to be
examined seriously. I told him th=
at I would need two full days of undivided
attention, so that I could prese=
nt 300 Powerpoint slides.

Swami Nithyananda sent me an invitation when I w=
as in Delhi to visit his
ashram and present my research. I was delighted to=
 have such an important
audience. I was very impressed by the fact that he =
sat through two long days
of my talks, about 12 hours per day. He asked his=
 40 top acharyas and
various thought leaders in his ashram to sit and liste=
n to me for both the
days. The interactions were intense, and I explained m=
any points from my
forthcoming books. I felt that he and I had a peer relat=
ionship, each side
being an expert in his domain to teach the other. After =
my two days of talks
were over, he asked me to help him incorporate my core=
 ideas into his
curriculum, so as to make sure that his teachings helped po=
sition the Vedic
civilization properly.

No other guru in the world has inv=
ested so much time with me to try and
learn these global issues so deeply. =
(The only other prominent guru I know
personally who understands these issu=
es about the external challenges is
Swami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most gurus =
tend to either be dismissive by
resorting to spiritual loftiness, or imagin=
e that they already know whatever
there is worth knowing. Thus, my primary =
interest in Swami Nithyananda was
as a vehicle to spread greater awareness =
of the kinds of issues that I was
researching. (For instance, he bought a c=
ouple of hundred copies of the
book, "Invading the Sacred" at the full pric=
e, and made it required reading
for all his ashram residents.)

I must bala=
nce this praise with criticism. In my 2-day talks, I had
explicitly discuss=
ed that many gurus were falling prey to sex scandals,
often with women plan=
ted as part of sting operations, or women in the inner
circle who got too c=
lose and let things get out of control. Despite these
warnings, it seems th=
at nothing concrete was done to prevent or at least
anticipate the crisis t=
hat was to follow.

My Approach to this Investigation

When the scandal bro=
ke out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram
management and found t=
hem confident but confused. Probably they felt that
the matter would soon g=
et forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite
happened, as each day =
brought fresh allegations and sensational media
coverage. After several day=
s had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to
study the situation for my=
self. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra
practice with any women. =
Whatever I knew was based on what his followers
told me, because he was per=
sonally inaccessible for several days even after
I reached Bangalore. I spe=
nt many hours daily with some of his ashram's top
team.

What I wrote earli=
er in this article actually comes later in the chronology
of my investigati=
on. But I presented it up front because most readers are
obsessed with gett=
ing my answer to only one single question: did he or did
he not have sex? N=
othing else seems to matter to them, whereas my
investigation's emphasis ha=
s been about issues broader and more
consequential than any one man's moral=
ity.

Until I concluded my fact-finding 2-week period recently, I was unabl=
e to
discuss the sexual acts shown in the videotapes. I had to respect the
=
policies of his people as part of the trust being placed in me to gain
acce=
ss. They also needed legal clearance on what can and cannot be said by
them=
. Their policy on the sex tapes was that Swami Nithyananda would
directly e=
xplain his acts. The Tamil actress' lawyer was also in contact
with them an=
d her sensitivities had to be respected. The sensitivities of
the 140-stron=
g ashramites had to be protected also. Given this set of
circumstances faci=
ng me, I feel that it was unfair to demand that I should
hound him with the=
 one critical question. People have assumed that it was up
to me to decide =
what would be within the scope of each interview. As I have
mentioned earli=
er, even after certain interviews were recorded by me, the
ashram leadershi=
p used its discretion not to air them.

In response to my critics on how I =
conducted my interviews, I would also
like to explain why I chose to focus =
on the criminal charges being made
against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the s=
ex-tape being off limits as
mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the crimi=
nal charges became my focus
for two reasons. These charges could be ascerta=
ined with objectivity =96 such
as asking for documents on the land ownershi=
p, the medical reports on the
death of one meditation participant 2 years a=
go, and so forth. The evidence
was more clear-cut than the evidence on what=
 exactly happened in the
videotapes between two persons none of whom were w=
illing to talk with me
about it. Secondly, the consequences of criminality =
would be far more severe
than mere moral fallibility. While immoral conduct=
 is a big concern for the
devotees, it is not enough grounds by itself for =
the state to confiscate the
entire property that runs into very large sums =
of money. Also, as a matter
of principle, regardless of whether or not he i=
s guilty of the morality
charge, I felt opposed to spurious criminal charge=
s being piled up by the
irresponsible media just to create sensationalism.
=

The Conspiracy against Swami Nithyananda

Since I had arrived at the scene=
 while writing my book on the conspiracy in
Tamil Nadu religious politics, =
it was natural to start with that as my
emphasis for the investigation. But=
 in this short article I have decided to
focus on the matters surrounding h=
is conduct and his organization's conduct,
because these have assumed a mor=
e urgent nature. The details of the
conspiracy belong in my book as corrobo=
rating evidence for my thesis there.
The types of parties reported to be be=
hind the conspiracy, both foreign and
India based, were remarkably similar =
to the ones I have written about in the
book. So for now I shall merely sum=
marize some of the main points concerning
this conspiracy.

First one must =
understand why Swami Nithyananda became such a target. He was
virtually unk=
nown 7 years ago, but once he appeared in public his popularity
catapulted =
at a dramatic rate. For example, last year, YouTube wrote to him
that he wa=
s the most watched of all Indian spiritual leaders on the Internet
and prop=
osed a closer collaboration for their viewers. This letter also
stated that=
 among all spiritual leaders worldwide (not just Indian) he was
the second =
most popular one, the Vatican being first. His meditation
programs have bec=
ome very popular in USA and in certain Indian states. The
main factors are =
that participants almost invariably report experiencing
higher states of co=
nsciousness, and he has healed a large number of persons
of a variety of di=
seases. His healing powers are what brought together his
core inner group o=
f devotees from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,
IT professionals=
, corporate executives. Many of them have explained their
personal healings=
 from terminal illnesses as the turning point in their
lives. His meditatio=
n programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand
attendees for periods rangi=
ng from a few days to several weeks.

While the funds come mostly from uppe=
r strata participants in India and USA,
a large portion of the expenses hav=
e been allocated to develop grass-roots
social and spiritual programs focus=
ing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native
state. This is where he is seen as =
a threat by Dravidian as well as
Christian forces. For instance, in Decembe=
r 2009, about 600 villages across
Tamil Nadu sent their local "Nithyananda =
leaders" for a celebration and
planning session in his main ashram near Ban=
galore. I happened to be present
for the event. These common folks, mostly =
from the lower strata of Tamil
society, had walked 300 kilometers for this =
journey, which they saw as a
spiritual pilgrimage. The reason for the anger=
 of Christian and Dravidian
forces is that his activities have put a dampen=
er to conversions in many
districts, and several Christians have returned t=
o Hinduism by getting
initiated formally into his organization. The swami h=
imself has spoken
against conversions, and has also stated that the Dravidi=
an movement had
made Tamil people unspiritual in their lives, and that this=
 had caused
social decay. His Tamil language publications and courses have =
become his
most popular ones, far exceeding the numbers in English. Also he=
 is a very
big threat because he is not a Brahmin. Because he cannot be tar=
geted using
the classic attack strategies used on Brahmins, and because the=
 masses in
Tamil Nadu were rising to swell his ranks, the threat he posed t=
o the
existing political power structure had to be stopped one way or anoth=
er.

The attack against Swami Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs, dest=
roying
his image and alleging legal misdeeds. At first a highly sensational=
 sexual
charge was broadcast in order to devastate his credibility and crea=
te an
atmosphere in which any and all kinds of outlandish allegations would=
 be
taken at face value. Once the media and popular sentiments had been tur=
ned
against him, there was one amazing allegation after another in rapid
se=
quence. It was clear that none of this was spontaneous but was being
centra=
lly orchestrated under a systematic plan.

What became evident to me was th=
at there was "cooperation" in informal and
unofficial ways among the media,=
 police and lower level judiciary. In fact,
many third parties were aware o=
f the attack in advance and had warned his
people before it happened with s=
pecific details of the plan. For instance,
one of his top devotees got a ph=
one call from someone based in New York
describing the media and police att=
ack that was to come. His predictions
turned out to be accurate but at that=
 time the ashramites did not take the
threat literally. He said that for th=
e right sum of money he could be
helpful in preventing such an attack. He c=
laimed that the planning for this
attack had started a year ago. He mention=
ed that a budget of Rs 200 crores
was allocated by some overseas groups to =
demolish Hindu gurus especially in
south India, and named two south Indian =
churches as the nodal agencies to
coordinate this strategic plan. (I am pre=
sently pursuing these leads as part
of my book investigation.)
There was an=
other concrete extortion effort about eleven or twelve days
prior to the sc=
andal breaking out. A lawyer contacted them and claimed that
his client had=
 compromising videos, and that the client was seeking money or
else they wo=
uld get released. The same intermediary later sent a letter
containing a va=
riety of unsubstantiated criminal allegations against Swami
Nithyananda, an=
d this letter's distribution list included India's Prime
Minister, Presiden=
t, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various Chief Ministers
and police heads,=
 various national criminal investigation and security
organizations. I have=
 a copy of this letter, and it makes the Nithyananda
organization seem like=
 a terrorist outfit that needs to be attacked for the
sake of public safety=
. This letter along with a DVD of the sex video was
delivered to the Chief =
Minister of Karnataka state two hours before the
videotape was first aired.=
 Clearly, the attack was well planned and executed
across many locations, a=
nd was persistently carried out over several days.
This is not the work of =
some isolated individuals.

There were warnings given to individuals in the=
 ashram that their phones
were being tapped and that they better leave to s=
ave their own lives,
because something horrible was about to happen. One fr=
iendly man based in
Pune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nith=
yananda, told the
ashram a week in advance of the attack that some such cat=
astrophe would
happen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press =
Club. Another
publisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda's bo=
oks in Telugu,
called three times to warn that a graphic video would be rel=
eased and gave a
precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that=
 an American
devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in associ=
ation with one
Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent w=
eb site. He was
being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was once =
very deeply
involved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turned mal=
icious. The
only man who has openly come out as the main accuser was an ash=
ramite who
had a falling out when he got demoted due to his conduct. It was=
 recently
reported that he had a prior criminal record against him but nobo=
dy in the
ashram had checked out his background before admitting him.

Ther=
e were constant threats received to harass the ashramites and scare them
aw=
ay, with claims that "narcotics will be planted to cause arrest warrants."
=
The actions by the police were being leaked to the media ahead of time and
=
even to the opposing side, leading to numerous "tips" received by "friends"=

asking the ashram dwellers to run away before "the attack comes."

But eve=
n after a couple of weeks since the scandal has erupted, the lawyers
for Sw=
ami Nithyananda's ashram have failed to get copies of any concrete
charges =
filed with the police, except a few trivial ones. Each time they
approach f=
or specific details they are told that there is no formal charge,
except re=
latively minor ones. So the intimidation has been carried out
mainly throug=
h media reports, without any legal due process starting where
facts and arg=
uments could get cross-examined. This lack of formal charges
has enabled an=
 atmosphere of intimidation using rumors and threats that
cannot be pinned =
down officially.

It is important to contrast this with the manner in which=
 Indian media
treats scandals facing Islamic or Christian groups. The numer=
ous scandals
occurring overseas often get blocked by Indian media entirely,=
 or are given
mild treatment with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be se=
en as "secular"
and not "communal." By contrast every kind of allegation ag=
ainst any Hindu
group gets clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated =
as a social
scourge equivalent to terror groups.

The media's hounding ment=
ality and mafia tactics deserve to be condemned. In
the Swami Nithyananda c=
ase, they have used carrots and sticks to lure and
threaten, using whatever=
 would get them more sensational footage. Several TV
stations and journalis=
ts camped out in Haridwar and sent me emails
requesting my help in arrangin=
g an interview. When I failed to deliver
(because it was not up to me to de=
liver any such thing), some of them turned
nasty against me. One TV woman p=
romised the swami's people "positive"
coverage if she got an exclusive. But=
 after the interview, she betrayed them
and turned it into more distortion =
and smut. This led Swami Nithyananda's
handlers to give interviews to more =
stations in order to counteract this
distortion. But the more they said bef=
ore TV cameras, the worse the scandal
became. One station was blatant in it=
s threat to the swami's assistant: "If
you don't give us an interview right=
 away, we will show you the power of the
media to destroy you." At one poin=
t a major TV station also wanted to drag
in Ramakrishna Mission with simila=
r allegations, but someone was able to
stop that.

Failures of Swami Nithya=
nanda's Organization

Hindu tradition separates three kinds of Varna (skill=
s), each representing a
form of social capital, and these three were never =
supposed to be
concentrated in a single person, thereby preventing too much=
 concentration
of power. I use the terms Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not=
 as birth based
"caste," but as merit based social capital and areas of com=
petence. The
Brahmin job description focuses on spirituality and research; =
Kshatriya on
governance, politics and leadership; and Vaishyas on commerce =
and financial
capital. Swami Nithyananda had persons with Brahmin qualities=
 performing
duties that demand Kshatriya and Vaishya skills. This was count=
erproductive.
The ashram leaders were selected and trained for skills and r=
oles that are
very different than this situation demands. Too often their b=
hakti and
spiritual practice substituted for professional competence in man=
aging a
rapidly growing global enterprise. The sole emphasis was placed on
=
traditional Brahmin qualities, and none on what would be considered
Kshatri=
ya qualities.
For example, there are a large number of white devotees who d=
o have
Kshatriyata - leadership expertise, courage and commitment. But even=
 after
this attack the ashram organization has blundered in its failure to =
leverage
and deploy them. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and f=
ound them
remarkably willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bot=
hered to
organize them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyanand=
a has a
global following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the cris=
is, his
organization was in utter chaos, reacting to each "hit" by the othe=
r side.
Its leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.=

Decisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was
cognitiv=
ely disoriented and many of its members were psychologically
breaking down.=


The organization was too much of a one-man show with the leaders operatin=
g
like children dependent on the swami for every decision. The swami had
be=
come the iconic object of the ashram's inner circle. Their proximity to
him=
 became their measure of personal power and identity. This is classical
cul=
t-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that are inevitable
nowa=
days. Such a concentration of all varnas into one man not only makes an
ent=
erprise incompetent, but it also can also get to the leader's head and
make=
 him power hungry. Especially when the guru has siddhis, this power can
eas=
ily become co-opted by his ego into a dangerous mixture. The result is
that=
 he surrounds himself with sycophants who tell him what he wants to
hear, a=
nd this feedback loop of self glorification turns into group
delusion.

I n=
oticed this in the form of the inner circle's inability to make common
sens=
e judgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to their leader by
giving =
him too much "good news." The result was that the honest truth did
not come=
 out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realistic planning. I had a
difficu=
lt time to get dependable information, and the stories kept changing
not on=
ly over time but also between one person and another within the group.
I co=
uld not tell if there was a cover up and if new lies were fabricated to
cov=
er prior lies. In such an atmosphere one cannot tell which individuals
migh=
t have a separate stake and vested interest from the group. Lacking
compete=
nt Kshatriyas, the swami had not anticipated that such a crisis was
ever po=
ssible, despite the fact that outsiders (including myself in my 2-day
talks=
 at his ashram) had explained to them the threats facing every
prominent Hi=
ndu mahatma today.
While on the one hand I blame those in positions of resp=
onsibility at the
ashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibi=
lity as he selected
them, defined their roles, evaluated their performance,=
 motivated and
supervised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual =
capabilities had
failed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the =
external reality.
An enlightened master must do better than this, or else h=
e must not try to
control everything so personally.
I acknowledge that bein=
g a global guru is very demanding today, given that
one has to represent a =
very old tradition authentically and yet in a manner
that appeals to modern=
 people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course
on matters that are =
well beyond the traditional education in their own
sampradayas (lineages).
=

Hindu Chaos
Swami Nithyananda's own support base in India has started to d=
istance itself
out of self preservation amidst all the rumors and slander. =
His closest
supporters were not approached soon enough with his side of the=
 story, and
by the time they were approached the damage to his credibility =
was already
irreversible. They did not want to risk being associated with a=
 "fallen
guru." Many Hindu gurus have started to publicly lash out against =
the
"fallen godman"; others became silent or neutral publicly, while offeri=
ng
private sympathy but refusing to stick their necks out.

One factor is t=
hat the swami's approach was too conservative for some and
too liberal for =
others. It is too filled with deities, symbols and rituals
of a very orthod=
ox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus who
propagate a whit=
ened, Westernized "clean" Hinduism that is abstract and
metaphysical but de=
void of imagery associated with "primitive paganism." At
the other end of t=
he spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find his idea
of youthful dancin=
g, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be not "real"
Hinduism. A couple =
of shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashed out against
"false" gurus and=
 claimed that only the shankaracharyas had the authority to
certify who was=
 qualified to be a guru. So Swami Nithyananda fits neither
end of this spec=
trum.

Many of the gurus I met have told me in confidence that they fear th=
at
similar attacks are coming to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no cen=
tral
Hindu mechanism to deal with these episodes along the lines of various=

Church mechanisms that intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent=

feelers to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to=

step in and take over the ashram and its related organizations, thereby
br=
inging new management to clean up matters and bring stability to the
enterp=
rise. I was told that while this was a "good idea in principle," it
was not=
 practical because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.

The Way Fo=
rward
My overriding concern throughout this investigation has been to find =
a way
to do damage control in order to protect the broader interests of dha=
rma.
This requires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs, it see=
ms
that the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the movement a=
nd
going into a strictly private life of meditation and self inquiry. I wor=
ry
for the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individuals but in need =
of
proper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the cause and their
pe=
rsonal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication and maturity to
de=
al with what they face today.

Swami Nithyananda should resign immediately =
and hand over all his
organizations to senior spiritual masters, preferably=
 Shaivites practicing
the Shiva Sutras and related traditions. He told me i=
n an interview hat I
recorded on March 9th that he was willing to leave eve=
rything and become a
wandering sadhu again. I wish that interview had been =
aired.

The new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a new life and chan=
ce to
revive itself. It could either remain a place for spiritual training =
or turn
itself into a Hindu social service organization. Either way it woul=
d be a
better outcome than the likely alternative of the government steppin=
g in to
take over the ashram and turn it over to administrators who are not=

positively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 as has happened in numerous
=
similar cases of government takeovers of Hindu temples and organizations
de=
spite government claims of its actions being "secular".

Besides giving up =
the organization, Swami Nithyananda should return to his
personal sadhana u=
nder the guidance of these spiritual leaders. Let them
evaluate him and his=
 organization, and issue their independent report to the
public. Swami Nith=
yananda should fearlessly and humbly submit himself to
their judgment of wh=
at happened and what the remedies ought to be.

Hinduism has survived for m=
any millennia and faced many kinds of crises,
just like all the other major=
 religions of the world. It has its own
internal resources and mechanisms t=
o deal with such situations. These need
to be put to use and they need to b=
ecome modernized. This is not the last
such scandal Hindu groups are going =
to face in the near future.

<strong>Why Swami Nithyananda Must Resign Now <br>Wedne=
sday, 17 March 2010 18:40 Rajiv Malhotra</strong><br><br>When the sex scand=
al of Swami Nithyananda suddenly erupted on March 2, 2010, I was already in=
 Delhi as part of a group to go to Kumbh Mela. I was also finalizing my new=
 book which deals specifically with Tamil Nadu religious politics, and in p=
articular with the role of various nexuses based overseas. So I decided to =
jump into the eye of the storm of this scandal in order to investigate whet=
her similar nexuses were at work in this case. Naturally, at one level I ha=
ve seen this scandal through the framework of a civilization encounter in w=
hich Vedic culture is pitted against the Dravidian divisiveness that is bei=
ng backed by Christian evangelism. At another level, I found that the sensa=
tionalized media reports were too one-sided, and none of them had a single =
statement to report from the swami himself. Furthermore, there was chaos an=
d mismanagement of the crisis from Swami Nithyananda's inner circle. In=
 hindsight, things might have turned out differently had they managed more =
sensibly and faster =96 which I will elaborate later in this article. Given=
 this, another interest of mine has been to extrapolate important lessons f=
rom this episode for other Hindu organizations, which I predict will face s=
imilar scandals as and when their weaknesses become understood by those opp=
osed to them. This article highlights my findings at these multiple levels =
and issues.<br>

<br>During this 2-week investigative period, I have been l=
oyal to my pledge to give Swami Nithyananda's organization the benefit =
of doubt and to report their side of the story. Besides wanting to balance =
out the one-sided media depictions, I wanted access to the ashram's cor=
e group for my own research on the broader subject of civilization encounte=
rs. I respect the sensitivities of that organization consisting of many dec=
ent and dedicated devotees who have sacrificed a great deal and stand to lo=
se a lot.<br>

<br>But I have concluded that the situation is now beyond re=
pair for Swami Nithyananda and that his continued involvement can only dama=
ge the broader interests of dharma as well as jeopardize the ashramites. Al=
ong with two other sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have personally r=
ecommended to Swami Nithyananda that the best course at this stage would be=
 for him to resign completely from his organization. He should turn it over=
 to a small team of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used i=
n the best interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatm=
as he must live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional respons=
ibilities. Because the head of any organization must accept responsibility =
that "the buck stops here," only such a move can salvage the orga=
nization and the reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this re=
signation would hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up aga=
inst him personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up=
 to him to accept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclusion beco=
mes clearer once the reader has gone through the rest of this article. <br>=


I want to begin by examining some principles about the relationships betw=
een siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This wi=
ll provide the framework in which to interpret what has happened. Then I wi=
ll turn to my initial interest in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism i=
n south India from a variety of forces.<br>

<br><br>Siddhis (Extraordinary=
 Yogic Powers) and Morality<br>A few days ago, I had the honor of having a =
two-hour private conversation with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Ri=
shikesh. I introduced myself as an independent researcher who is writing a =
series of books on Indian civilization in the context of the global challen=
ges and opportunities. One of my volumes will be specifically on the major =
global gurus since the 1960s =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, =
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global g=
urus such as Sri Sri himself. I have been investigating what happened to su=
ch gurus, in terms of the shifts in their Western followers over time, thei=
r scandals, their Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru nego=
tiated his/her position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and=
 Western modernity on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Sw=
ami Nithyananda will become clear very soon.<br>

<br>The first provocative=
 question I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic powers: What is the=
 relationship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis are a scientific phe=
nomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all humans then one mus=
t bear in mind that science deals with truths that are morally neutral. If =
Einstein was declared to have lived an immoral life it would not invalidate=
 his scientific theories. A person who designs aircrafts or any other compl=
ex technological systems may or may not be moral in order to be effective i=
n his technical work. In other words, rtam (the patterns of the cosmos), wh=
ich we discover and call science, functions independently of human morality=
. This is why a scientific principle can be used either morally or immorall=
y, because it is independent of morality. There are moral persons who lack =
any siddhis or even ordinary scientific competence. Conversely, there are g=
reat siddhas (like Ravana) who lack morality. Sri Sri's pranayama techn=
iques would also produce results for an immoral person. <br>

<br>Sri Sri s=
eemed impressed by this question, and agreed with my overall position on th=
e independence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed out that the mo=
ral dimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also important becaus=
e it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with him. <br>

<br>=
So there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual technologies th=
at are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual energies, and (=
ii) morality which is important in itself, not for attaining siddhis, but i=
n order to have a positive relationship with the divine. Either one can be =
developed without the other; however, the dharma tradition encourages us to=
 cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems prescribe things like v=
egetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inappropriate lifestyle interfer=
es with the mental tranquility required to advance. This lifestyle change c=
an be appreciated regardless of whether one believes in a personal God or n=
ot. This absence of a personal God is clear in Buddhist meditation. Differe=
nt Hindu systems place different levels of emphasis upon a personal God for=
 the yoga to function. This is why many secular and scientifically minded p=
ersons are also drawn towards meditation techniques. In other words, someth=
ing cannot be a science if it depends upon morality, because science is obj=
ective and stands independent of morality.<br>

<br>The relevance of this q=
uestion is as follows: Many persons who have learned advanced meditation fr=
om Swami Nithyananda want to know if any moral breaches by him would invali=
date the whole Hindu claim of achieving higher states of consciousness. Whe=
n a far worse sex scandal against the legendary Swami Muktananda emerged in=
 the 1990s, involving charges by a large number of his Western female disci=
ples, the Western academy rashly condemned not only one man's morality,=
 but also the whole legitimacy of the Indian tradition itself. In that seri=
es of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah Caldwell, etc.), I took the sa=
me position then as I am taking now: that Muktananda's capabilities in =
harnessing spiritual energies are separate and independent from whether or =
not he violated any code of morality. <br>

<br>Patanjali warns against get=
ting lured by siddhis which appear along the way when one practices advance=
d meditation persistently. One is not supposed to indulge in them. This war=
ning is found in various Hindu systems that deal with the body as a vehicle=
 for spiritual evolution, because these energies are very powerful and can =
get out of control. Another point that is worth noting is that the techniqu=
es taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his original ones; he has made it cl=
ear repeatedly that they are from the Shiva Sutras which have a long histor=
y in our civilization. I feel that he does have the siddhi of being able to=
 transmit these techniques very effectively to others. For instance, I have=
 never before in my life been able to sit still and alert in meditation for=
 the whole night, but he had a few hundred persons in a large hall achievin=
g this. The point here is similar to saying that the mathematics and golf I=
 have learned from someone is not invalidated when the teacher is found to =
be immoral. <br>

<br>Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued sepa=
rately and independently from whether his siddhis are genuine.<br><br>Is Ta=
ntra a Part of Hinduism?<br><br>The second question that I asked Sri Sri co=
uld not be completely dealt with in the time available for our meeting. I h=
ope to pursue this some day with him and with various other acharyas for my=
 own benefit. Its significance in the present scandal becomes clear soon. I=
 asked whether the Shiva Sutras are valid, pointing out that among the 112 =
spiritual enlightenment techniques taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual=
 contact between a male yogi and a female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well =
as the Tantra traditions have included exemplars that practiced these techn=
iques. Recently, Osho tried to revive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra has b=
rought some elements of these into his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a =
US based scholar of Tantra and Kashmir Shaivism, is one of the voices who b=
rings out the authenticity of these approaches in the tradition, despite th=
e common rejections by society at large. The tradition considers itself not=
 suitable for mainstream society and is meant only for a small subset of pe=
ople.<br>

<br>Many popular Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of t=
he Tantra traditions =96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic tr=
aditions were not separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integratio=
n is found in Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrato=
r of Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja's ideas further), and even more rece=
ntly in the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra pr=
actitioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.<br>

ousness concerning Tantr
