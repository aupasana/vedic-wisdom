=C2=A0 

N=
amaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,

I have just started listen=
ing to your (Narasimhaji's) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to revi=
ew my own chart. 

However in numerous instances in the past, I've heard th=
rough friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse imp=
act on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immatur=
e comment, but I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this befor=
e I proceed on this journey.

I would appreciate getting a honest response =
so I can put this issue to rest once and for all. 

Regards,
Raj

PS: I am =
drawn to astology more from an academic perspective of how it influences ou=
r life and how ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get t=
he little understanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate ou=
r next generation so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / r=
etain respect for astrology and our culture.
