Namaste,

Though this may be=
 true in general, specific examples can be found for Krishna devotees who d=
id not have to forgo material comforta or devotees of the divine Mother who=
 were tested by taking away everything.

It depends on the karmas and condi=
tioning.

But, one thing is certain. Whether it is Krishna or Chandi, they =
may test by pushing the person to an extreme, but they never push beyond th=
e breaking limit.

When the mind identifies with something, that thing may =
be negatively affected by god to let one realize that that thing is transie=
nt and does not matter. As one realizes it a little, it may be more negativ=
ely affected. Finally, one may be pushed to an extreme.

However, god is ki=
nd (even an ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God m=
ay push one short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and =
then god may push further.

To use the analogy from the other mail of today=
, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with 6th grade questi=
ons. Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th grade to the 6th grade=
 will now be tested with 6th grade questions. As one advances from one grad=
e to another, one is tested more and more.

Best regards,
Narasimha
