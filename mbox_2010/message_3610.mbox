Pranams Sarv Varishtha,

In the Maha Ganapati Homam, Manishji burns a matchstick and throws it 
away saying some mantra. What is that? Can someone please explain its 
importance - importance of that action that is.


Chaitanya

P.S. Shri Narsimhaji, thanks a lot for the answer on VeerBhadra, i am 
not able to write an reply fit enough hence the delay.
