Namaste Rajmohansrinivas ji,

All three points you mentioned are incorrect,=
 and have no scientific basis. 
Kindly remain a vegetarian, but do not beli=
eve in fake 'science'. 


Namaste Sararaju ji,

Since you=C2=A0seemed to be=
 speaking from a position of=C2=A0'science' and not 
spirituality per se,=
=C2=A0a few points in your email about food=C2=A0are quite=C2=A0incorrect.=
=C2=A0

Human body is naturally suitable for vegitable foods.=C2=A0=C2=A0No=
body cannot eat 
=C2=A0non-veg item without cooking and adding some spicy f=
lavours. 

=C2=A0
This is wrong. Human body is naturally suited for an omni=
vorous diet. Just like 
people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not=
 eat raw vegetables as well. 
Cooking is a later addition to human society.=
 


If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at RE=
AL 
research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scientific pap=
ers in 
clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you =
would find 
ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums h=
ave relied on an 
omnivorous diet:-

a) Human ancestral diets changed subst=
antially approximately four to five 
million years ago with major climatic =
changes creating open grassland 
environments. 


b) Humans developed a lar=
ger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler 
gastrointestinal tract=C2=A0 requ=
iring=C2=A0foods based around meat protein and fat. For 
example since the =
time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million 
years ago, b=
rain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for 
long-chain po=
lyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a 
corresponding inc=
rease in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a 
diet that =
is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain 
would no=
t have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for 
diet =
comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. 


c) The gut morphology of the =
human body as it stand todays is ideally 
equidistant from that of carnivor=
es as well as herbivores. That is because 
humans are designed to be omnivo=
res. The lack of a well developed caecum and 
rumen, unlike herbivores, mak=
es it difficult for the body to absorve plant 
cellulose into usable energy=
, which is why, a=C2=A0major part of the leafy vegetable 
based diet eventu=
ally ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining 
of humans =
do not contain=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids which is present in a typical=
 
carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C2=A0 t=
he natural 
process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may furth=
er interest you 
to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually ide=
ntical to, guess what, 
rats who also are omnivores.

d) It may shock many =
a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C2=A0research into 
clinical nutriti=
on very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human 
body for=C2=
=A0w.r.t different foods=C2=A0is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fis=
h, 
and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered neg=
ative 
calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories in a=
bsorving it 
than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to =
digest. You can 
look up actual BV (biological value)=C2=A0charts for more =
details.

All this is science. Real science. If you are interested, please =
do study actual 
scientific papers with an objective mind, but do not pass =
judgements based on 
lack of study or motivated=C2=A0hearsay.

>From the point of view of sadhana, as per my personal exper=
ience,=C2=A0it is best to 
eat as light a food as possible. 


Spicy foods =
are more disturbing than nonvegeterian foods, therefore the best is 
totall=
y=C2=A0bland food.=C2=A0Eating exactly the same food daily for months on en=

very helpful to disengaging the mind from food. 


Feel free to =

Dear Rajmohanji,

Saatwic foods naturally creating good moral habits a=

metabolisim very well. Most of the vegitable foods ar=

Human body is naturally suitable for vegitable foods.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0Nobody cannot eat 
=C2=A0non-veg item without cooking and adding some=

For example=C2=A0I can=C2=A0take =C2=A0an apple simply =
wash and then eat it. But iimagine 
can=C2=A0I=C2=A0=C2=A0take non-veg food=
 like these? naturally non-veg is not a taste one it 
gives taste only beca=
use of cooking and adding flavour is=C2=A0it. 


whether pava or punya it d=
oesn't matter. But is it really good for health? think 
over that. 


Most =
of the ingridents,vitamins and minerals are more with vegitabes than 
non-v=
eg. 

=C2=A0Its only illusion to create non-veg will give more strength tha=
n veg.
