namaste,

I am making sure that I will meet the elements that make me and t=
he makers of the elements fully sober when my time comes - and when I go I'=
ll care two hoots for any body. 

It is when I am alive that I call a spade=
 a spade - I am most certain the dead sanyasi will not manifest - It is his=
 writings and anti veda non sense about grammar that bugs me. It is with gr=
ammar and skills in computer usage, I am discoverer complete concordance of=
 Maya language of South America and Cherokee of North America with Sanskrit=

 of Bharath! I am now finding Indus and Harappa images actually depicting =
the rules of Sanskrit grammar. 

I call myself an idiot for not having take=
n interest earlier. When I am here I am somebody ... history is lies about =
the past
