Greetings to One and All on the Vedic Wisdom group, I am authoring my first=

post here so I trust if it is a question covered in  the past, my oversigh=
t
will forgiven and someone can direct me to the necessary thread. My query=

regards the homam tradition, and whether the homa fire itself can be used
=
for mundane purposes after the ritual has been brought to completion. I
und=
erstood from the Aghori boks that there are several taboos concerning ANY
f=
ire(never to blow it out, turns one feet towards it etc), and presume these=

also apply to the homam fire after the ritual is completed, but otherwise,=

are there other prohibitions one must observe concerning the post-homam fi=
re
and it uses, could one for instances, warm their hands by it, use it to
=
light a candle etc. Any input on this would be appreciated.

Greetings to One and All on the Vedic Wisdom group, I am authoring my first=
 post here so I trust if it is a question covered in=A0 the past, my oversi=
ght will forgiven and someone can direct me to the necessary thread. My que=
ry regards the homam tradition, and whether the homa fire itself can be use=
d for mundane purposes after the ritual has been brought to completion. I u=
nderstood from the Aghori boks that there are several taboos concerning ANY=
 fire(never to blow it out, turns one feet towards it etc), and presume the=
se also apply to the homam fire after the ritual is completed, but otherwis=
e, are there other prohibitions one must observe concerning the post-homam =
fire and it uses, could one for instances, warm their hands by it, use it t=
o light a candle etc. Any input on this would be appreciated. <br>

I believe that making offerings after every s=

e something from my own experience to illustrate this. Initially I was hesi=
tant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help put things=
 in a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana single-minded=
ly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those days I us=
ed to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some of my c=
o-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks later. Swad=
hyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay of my sad=
hana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period I start=
ed doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. Things we=
re fine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of many fa=
ctors. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana, I decid=
ed to return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my mother&#=
39;s wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medical s=
tudies too.<br>

> > <br>
> > Around early 95, I started doing =
Devi Mahatmya parayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having =
piercing headaches, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressu=
re would shoot up to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standa=
rd investigations, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken=
 a liking to me, suspected that it *might* have something to do with my sad=
hanas too. Things continued to be the same for some more months, till I got=
 introduced to Swami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. =
During the course of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the ne=
xt day after coming to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana=
. After interacting everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into =
Sri Sri Chandi path.  After a week or so after the initiation all the sympt=
oms subsided. The blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It h=
as been around 15 years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. =
What's more, I had some very powerful internal experiences in quick suc=
cession during the following week itself after initiation. This is my exper=
ience.<br>

you are right about the raja yoga/hatha yoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a re=
gular part of my sadhana during 89-92. In fact I became a qualified Yogacha=
rya during this time. However Devi Mahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana=
 along with yogabhyasa since early 91-92 during which time things were fine=
. It was only in 94 that I resumed Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. O=
f course I was doing my yogabhyasa too at this time. I have already written=
 about the rest.  <br>

> > <br>

 as well. Let me add something more here. No two individuals have the same =
experience in such matters. Some may experience nothing significant after i=
nitiation and may still be progressing. Some may need more guidance due to =
the nature of the specific practices that they have got into. Eitherways Sh=
e will take care.  <br>

ree that there are many good sadhakas doing Sri Sri Chandipath without init=

to feel guilty for worshipping or loving the Goddess.  If you take my own e=

e that I was initiated. I didn't even ask for it. If it is meant to be =
it will be. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. The=
 main thing is that the sadhaka should leave the rest to the compassionate =
