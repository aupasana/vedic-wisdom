If everything happening in this world is PreFixed and happening as per the =
wish of God then what is use of theory of Karma?
Because in that case all K=
armas are also prefixed.
If this is true then this game of birth-karmas-dea=
th must be boring for God sometimes which I don't think so,I had this query=
 in my mind since long time and I wish to get an answer for it.Thanks
