Namaste All,  

   In a Chandi  Path version which i have seen it goes like=
 this
   1. Shapoddhara mantras
   2. Brahmadi Shapa vimochan 
   3. Kavach=
am.. 
   .
  .

However the question is  on the Brahmadi Shapa vimochan whi=
ch has about 20 versions most of which ends with  asking the devi ..'brahma=
 vasistha vishwamitra shapa vimukta bhava'.. however the last verse is diff=
erent.  it seems to suggest that  whoever recites chandi path without under=
standing...will face ill effects..    Why this verse?  Is  reading such a v=
erse wise? is avoiding it wiser?


Thanks & Regards
Shashi
