Namaste Narasimha garu,  I am surprised at your response to the 3rd questio=
n.  wouldn't it be along the same lines as your response to the 4th questio=
n?  Aren't we worshipping that creator through his/her creation which could=
 be a stone or something that we created out of our imagination (which agai=
n is his/her manifestation) like gramadevatas?  Based on your explanation, =
Gramadevatas could very well be the projections of someone's imaginations, =
which are equally true to the person who percieved them as Mahalakshmi or D=
urga to most of us.  Am I totally off on this?

Now, you may note that the above form is the beeja (seed) for the madhyama =

Mahisha literally means the mighty one. Mahishasura personifies our tendenc=

rahas (consciousness grabbers). When eighteen-handed Mahalakshmi is establi=
