Namaste All,
=C2=A0
W=
hile re reading my mails after I sent them to the list, I found many silly =
errors of spelling and grammer. I was writing in a flow and never checked w=
hat I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they say, =
"Bhavnayoko samjho!".
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
During the day time, we roamed a=
round shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any of =
the temples in Kasi. I asked him, "What about the temples? Won't we visit t=
hem?". Manish retorted immediately, "=C2=A0Aren't we=C2=A0going to the most=
 powerful temple in Kasi every night?"! I silently agreed. This is somethin=
g about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or standard places=
 of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temple and stand an=
d stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, "There is somethin=
g here."
=C2=A0
During evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnar=
am Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during the 16th century. The pl=
ace is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. A=
s we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are st=
rong energies in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=C2=A0 p=
ranam=C2=A0at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the =
Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating fo=
r 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=A0 Manish, on being=C2=
=A0questioned, said that many sadhanas have been done here in this place fo=
r long by people with no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are stron=
g here. While looking around the Ashram we found some quotations which were=
 written in small wooden boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed =
to one quotation. Translated to English, it read, "If you have to give your=
 head off to get a sadguru, you
 have=C2=A0got it cheap".
=C2=A0
By 8 PM we=
 sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient t=
ime before going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach w=
hile performing any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in =
the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that =
digests ideas/concepts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which e=
xists in the subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for=
 one to "digest" various experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when =
the Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are =
extremely focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget =
food, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and =
decrease in Jathara Agni.
=C2=A0
As we sat eating our food and talking on d=
ifferent topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here is a =
thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha and=
=C2=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. 
=C2=A0
Manish said, "It is the same s=
et of=C2=A0souls who come back=C2=A0again and again in different bodies and=
 personalities at different times, who=C2=A0are responsible for this land. =
There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, =
Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc." He continued, "They can come as kings, yo=
gis, or any other form which is necessary for them to accomplish their dhar=
ma. And their dharma is connected to this land=C2=A0which we call India=C2=
=A0today.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Ri=
shis sent people when needed.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardonin=
g Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey h=
is Guru?".I silently contemplated her fate.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
"One very senior R=
ishi has decided to=C2=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so sh=
all it happen.=C2=A0Ved=C2=A0Dharma will be re established here along the l=
ength and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individua=
l or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0can stand against the will of a Rishi."=C2=A0 Arunish=
a asked a pertinent question here. "What were the Rishis doing for=C2=A0one=
 thousand years?". Manish laughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend a=
 thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=C2=A0one day=
=C2=A0wake up from meditation=C2=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2=A0a=
nd all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So He decides, it is ti=
me to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=
=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changi=
ng a country is child's play for Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me =
slowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadhana, in some manner =
or the other.
=C2=A0
As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for th=
e Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Man=
ikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I aske=
d him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2=
=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the=
 divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the sta=
te of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his b=
ody and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0worshipping t=
he divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda says, "Let t=
he Mother show you the face of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalanand=
a. Manish said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Maha=
kala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda d=
id Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika. " Then staring at the pitch black =
ganges, Manish chuckled lightly and
 added, "That man was something." This =
was again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before which Mainsh conti=
nued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were t=
o stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowin=
g through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a=
 army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books=C2=A0are like a Bible=C2=A0f=
or sadhakas,=C2=A0arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I asked him if =
it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied tha=
t yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question =
is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. I=
nterestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention =
that a time will come when his "children" would spread homas. Strange, or m=
aybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. 
=C2=A0
We reached the samshan =
by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place where we had sat on=
 the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt a=
lready. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacef=
ully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more. In the middle =
of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upwards=C2=A0and with th=
e next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher. He did this quite=
 a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I countinued with t=
he Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when he required an=
ything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towards us and excla=
imed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahadev". This homa was=
 faster. He did not use any "samputs", but a direct, straight Chandi homa. =
Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around som=
e of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was
 enjoying it. A f=
ew people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a r=
ule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the=
 head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom R=
aja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram B=
aba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because o=
f this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. =
I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many people in the s=
amshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run=
 away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there are people h=
ere even so late in the night.
=C2=A0
Once the final purnahuti was given, w=
e sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, =
the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if=
 my mind would just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of=
 the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 mi=
nutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slight=
est movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and sli=
ghtly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remark=
ed, " I could have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I=
 had a flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge o=
f death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back." Smiling he added=
, "What a sight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can =
be left at will".=C2=A0 I did not know what to say. 
=C2=A0
We stood there =
watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had beco=
me black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. The dom came forward, and wit=
h the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0from the side of the=
 corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and placing it again, st=
rategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0motion of lifting u=
p the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=C2=
=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift =
pieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both dead -=C2=A0from our plates =
to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, "Maza aya?". I smiled back in ackno=
wledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should write about this experienc=
e in the coming days. Let people know.
=C2=A0
By this time I remembered tha=
t when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=C2=A0had run off wi=
th one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Lea=
ve the other chappal here as well." Manish said we had a rna with this sams=
han. We had been here before, in some life.
=C2=A0
As we were returning, Ma=
nish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2=A0of Shiva's trishul passes=
 through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "safe" samshan. Anyone who tri=
es anything negative here will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards t=
his place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturbance inside the sams=
han. That is also why there are people here even at 2 am in the morning. Th=
ere is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions are genuine and good, =
Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.
=C2=A0
While walking along =
the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totally deserted, Manish instructed me not t=
o stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=
=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish=
. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thought and recollected =
that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a =
"Mokul". A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once t=
he ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do not wait along the ba=
nks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water=C2=A0late in the nig=
htt. There are things in the water. Generally they may not do anything, but=
 why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika =
Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to l=
ive in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-i=
ntoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is their city.
=C2=A0
Ne=
xt morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked=
 about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both =
paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one =
must get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2=
=A0enquired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to=
 be done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed =
and replied,=C2=A0"Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!"=
.=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
While talking about Ramayana with Aru=
nisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became slow and heavy=
,=C2=A0"The color of Rama's body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2=A0=
around him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by =
Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable=
. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=C2=A0is so fast that=
 a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed =
a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2=A0ma=
ntra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of =
his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2=
=A0command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy. 
=C2=A0
And Ra=
ma removed even=C2=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human be=
ing when he defeated Ravana which=C2=A0means; he even removed the last vest=
ige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder th=
en, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the nam=
e of Sri Rama?". 
=C2=A0
He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defin=
ed, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.
=C2=A0
Thus en=

Dear Na=
rasimha
=C2=A0
It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life al=
l the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess ga=
me. 
=C2=A0
Great analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=C2=
=A0completed a beautiful=C2=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2=A0one =
divine chess player, and it is totally His game. 
=C2=A0
Before I continue =
with the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I ha=
d not clearly mentioned in my last mail:
=C2=A0

At the end of the third da=
y of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the =
pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write ab=
out this experience in a public forum. Therefore my mails.
=C2=A0

Caveat: =
A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhana, and it is not en=
tirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=C2=A0only someone w=
ho has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, =
or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing t=
he homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, =
by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. =

=C2=A0

Many people have a negative=C2=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and A=
ghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the phil=
osophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV cha=
nnels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted indiv=
iduals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are talking =
about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is on=
e of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is ne=
ither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We=
 must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respect fo=
r other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken this p=
ath. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were=
 all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master=
 Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand objective=C2=A0account =
of how a
 powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am =
just the cronicler.
=C2=A0

There are many people in this age who have a de=
sire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, bu=
t have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2=
=A0people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a fig=
ment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousan=
ds of years ago. But to go about it and=C2=A0actually be able to do this sa=
dhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or r=
ules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=C2=A0an=
d let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and pa=
tience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature=
 will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every indiv=
idual=C2=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2=A0kind.=
=C2=A0 In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimalanad=
a says :


"Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. L=
et them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a =
few will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself w=
ill make arrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they wi=
ll be taught according to their capabilities. The progression will go on; t=
here is nothing to fear".
Therefore have faith, do sadhana.=C2=A0 

=C2=A0
=
Back to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. M=
anish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are avail=
able on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past midnight we were wa=
lking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be se=
en anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we =
found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stop=
ped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started m=
entally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journ=
ey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the=
 other side who chased the dogs away.=C2=A0Without looking at me=C2=A0Manis=
h said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=
 for your breeches".
=C2=A0
As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this i=
s a wonderful place.=C2=A0I did not think too much about it then since my m=
ind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next=
 day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I sud=
denly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish s=
miled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the =
energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that=
 the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not s=
ay anything.=C2=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was f=
rom Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to st=
ay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idio=
t.
=C2=A0
Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled =
with people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manis=
h kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started st=
aring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to the m=
iddle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing=
 the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in=
 thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there has not b=
een a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in Indi=
a. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenl=
y I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not=
 want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my conc=
ern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only th=
e bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did not ask him what. =
So we
 went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish,=
 "Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated=
 one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people standing aro=
und the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire i=
s too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were man=
y curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could =
hear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at.=
 This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people=
 would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of=
 this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries.=
 Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from=
 their families and thus they do not disturb. 
=C2=A0
The homa, as usual wa=
s awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was ve=
ry strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous=
 night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this py=
re. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, an=
d all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs h=
ave a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This homa w=
as extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a cert=
ain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that way=
 but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or m=
ade some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. At o=
ne point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense thin=
gs which I=C2=A0 - being such an=C2=A0ordinary person -=C2=A0obviously had =
no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2=A0I could hear
 chants o=
f "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brough=
t in. 
=C2=A0
Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smok=
e, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at th=
at. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and =
leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As th=
e Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shado=
w pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought it was some relative=
 who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find t=
here was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. T=
his time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying=
 to myself "all iz well"-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana t=
he deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if sli=
ghtly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this can=C2=A0happen n=
ot just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing=
 sadhana.
=C2=A0
While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut rolled =
off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes use to str=
oke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2=A0had b=
een a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural strokin=
g the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2=A0there was any=
 company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily take it=
. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=A0Inte=
restingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconut while=
 buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood why.
=C2=A0
In the=
 middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who was st=
anding nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre h=
as just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. I=
t was already late in the night. The person did not know what to say. Sudde=
nly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad bei=
ng done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was menta=
lly wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relatives came fo=
rward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok=
 and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of t=
he homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse=C2=A0 I =
saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to=
 see!
=C2=A0
There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2=A0at the end t=
o finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to p=
our water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. F=
inally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=A0asked if they could pour som=
e Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will hap=
pen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water=
 but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after=
 some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi=C2=A0samne kha=
di hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reve=
ntially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2=A0Manish's feet, bu=
t Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distrib=
uted some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very =
late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had a=
ddressed earlier) came
 running with tears in his eyes asking for forgivene=
ss for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he h=
as done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it w=
as some other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup=
 of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a c=
ertain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without=
 responding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied in=
terior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the=
 night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India s=
o unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred =
'educated'=C2=A0people are too rational to understand these things. God lov=
es the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam t=
o the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my head to m=
y heart, there was nothing
 below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I =
was simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just =
gave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, "Good".
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
As we were wa=
lking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "There is a foreigner lad=
y who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhan=
as in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her while med=
itating." For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practically dif=
ficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre.=
 Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manis=
h. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above)=
, I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish =
quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night =
in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, but directionless. " At =
that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so =
important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemp=
lating which is of no good,=C2=A0so that you are ready when
 Nature decides=
 to give you a push. 
=C2=A0
After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=
=C2=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed li=
ke any other tourist, specially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck=
=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close t=
o Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked s=
eeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.
=C2=A0
Thus ended=
 my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Ma=
nikarnika Ghats of Kashi.

DIV>Namaste All,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While re reading my mails aft=
er I sent them to the list, I found many silly errors of spelling and gramm=
er. I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon s=
uch errors and read through them. As they say, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>During the day t=
ime, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never=
 visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, "What about the temples? =
Won't we visit them?". Manish retorted immediately, " Aren't we g=
oing to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?"! I silently agreed. =
This is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or=
 standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside tem=
ple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, "T=
here is something here."</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>During evening we wen=
t to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kas=
i during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before ent=
ering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish=
 became silent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we medi=
tated for sometime, Manish did  pranam at the samadhi of Baba Bha=
gwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered =
Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnik=
a Samshan.  Manish, on being questioned, said that many sadhanas =
have been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desire=
s. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram=
 we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish=
 called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English=
, it read, "If you have to give your head
 off to get a sadguru, you have&n=
bsp;got it cheap".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>By 8 PM we sat for dinner. =
We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going =
to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing a=
ny sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed=
. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/con=
cepts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subt=
le body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to "digest" =
various experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni =
is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused=
 on something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not f=
eel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jatha=
ra Agni.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we sat eating our food and talking=
 on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here =
is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunish=
a and me) had before coming to Kasi. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Man=
ish said, "It is the same set of souls who come back again and ag=
ain in different bodies and personalities at different times, who are =
responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Pr=
ithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc." He continued, =
"They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for th=
em to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land&n=
bsp;which we call India today.This land is connected to the Rishis. Th=
is is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed. Prithviraj mad=
e one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who =
made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently contemplated her fate. =
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>"One very senior Rishi has decided to ch=
ange this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen. Ved&nbs=
p;Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing,=
 however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or group, can s=
tand against the will of a Rishi."  Arunisha asked a pertinent questio=
n here. "What were the Rishis doing for one thousand years?". Manish l=
aughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply in s=
amadhi, meditating. Then suddenly one day wake up from meditation=
 and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone and all sorts of non-spiritual=
 things going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create =
the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about what a Rishi can do. One=
 Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child's play f=
or Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so imp=
ortant to keep
 doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manik=
arnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnik=
a, for now. We walked long the deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him i=
f it is ok doing a homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said yes =
why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine=
 feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of h=
ighest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and=
 mind such that it can hold shakti for which worshipping the divi=
ne Mother is the best way. That is why Vimalananda says, "Let the Moth=
er show you the face of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Mani=
sh said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala ex=
ists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Maha=
kala sadhana here in Manikarnika. " Then staring at the pitch black ganges,=

 Manish chuckled lightly and added, "That man was something." This was aga=
in an old conversation we had started before which Mainsh continued, "=
All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand=
 infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowing throu=
gh them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a army o=
f sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books are like a Bible for sadh=
akas, arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was =
possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes i=
t was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question is whet=
her one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interest=
ingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a =
time will come when his "children" would spread homas. Strange, or maybe no=
t so. Who knows how deep things run. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We reach=
ed the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place wher=
e we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body h=
ad been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came=
 and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more.=
 In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his palm upwards&n=
bsp;and with the next ahuti immediately the fire would leap higher. He=
 did this quite a few times, when the flames were getting weaker. I co=
untinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when=
 he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towar=
ds us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahadev"=
. This homa was faster. He did not use any "samputs", but a direct, straigh=
t Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pus=
hing around some of the coconut pieces to make them
 burn properly. I was e=
njoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Ka=
si there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of th=
e Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old t=
imes, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporar=
y of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe =
it is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for t=
hese sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many =
people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, ev=
eryone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why the=
re are people here even so late in the night.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa=
 got over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, =
was superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and ex=
pand across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I =
had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditati=
ng for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still =
like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That =
made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, " I could have just left my body a=
nd gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, o=
r anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow a=
nd brought me back." Smiling he added, "What a sight it would have been for=
 the people to see, how the body can be left at will".  I did not know=
 what to say. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We stood there watching another=
 pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with de=
ep red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo sti=
ck inserted it (the bamboo stick) from the side of the corpse, lifting=
 up the burning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in =
the middle of the pyre. The smooth motion of lifting up the half burnt=
 torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick, into the thin, =
dark, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - m=
eat or vegetables, both dead - from our plates to our mouths. Man=
ish asked me smiling, "Maza aya?". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then h=
e commented that I should write about this experience in the coming da=
ys. Let people know.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>By this time I remembered=
 that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog had run of=
f with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai!=
 Leave the other chappal here as well." Manish said we had a rna with this =
samshan. We had been here before, in some life.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks) =
;of Shiva's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "saf=
e" samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The=
 trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary d=
isturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even =
at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intenti=
ons are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.</=
DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While walking along the ghats which were&n=
bsp;totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red =
lungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it with one hand and k=
ept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if =
I had got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint=
 smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of=
 similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you =
are out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not =
move too close to the water late in the nightt. There are things in th=
e water. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The pro=
tection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriy=
a Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this G=
anges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas woul=
d roam around
 naked. It is their city.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Next m=
orning, as we sat recollecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked abo=
ut Vedas. Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both path=
s of Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must=
 get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I en=
quired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be d=
one before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish laughed and r=
eplied, "Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!".&nbs=
p;I was dumbstruck. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While talking about =
Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice beca=
me slow and heavy, "The color of Rama's body is deep blue with a golde=
n tinge all around him. Like a sun blazing. That was the kavacha =
given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It=
 was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands&nbs=
p;is so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours =
he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras. Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga.=
 It was a mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga ha=
d become part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at=
 the slightest command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enem=
y. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>And Rama removed even his Gayatri Kav=
acha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which&nb=
sp;means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and f=
ought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India go=
es crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?". </DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV>He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he w=
as there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It may sou=

hese people are pieces in another kind of chess game. </EM></DIV>

<DIV>Great analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he&n=
bsp;completed a beautiful Ganapati homa last August. There is one=
 divine chess player, and it is totally His game. </DIV>

<DIV>Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention a few po=
ints which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikar=
nika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish sud=
denly said, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a pu=
blic forum. Therefore my mails.</LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI><STRON=
G>Caveat</STRONG>: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor sadhan=
a, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said&=
nbsp;only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can t=
ry this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Man=
ish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis) I was only doing the Chand=
i Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try=
 out this sadhana. </LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>Many people have a=
 negative bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due t=
o lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of thes=
e sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films e=
tc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly inc=
orrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts s=
tart with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the r=
each the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a=
 path. Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen pat=
h but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many gre=
at saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is con=
sidered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga =
Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are inten=
ded to give a first hand
 objective account of how a powerful sadhana =
in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.</LI></U=
L>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>There are many people in this age who have a =
desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, =
but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such&n=
bsp;people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a fi=
gment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousa=
nds of years ago. But to go about it and actually be able to do this s=
adhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or =
rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now a=
nd let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and p=
atience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Natur=
e will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every indi=
vidual because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so kind=
.  In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimalana=
da says :</LI></UL>

<DIV>Back to the=
 narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said =
it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on thi=
s night which can destroy Ashuras. Past midnight we were walking towar=
ds Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere=
 on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pac=
k of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wonder=
ing if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally cha=
nting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. =
Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side=
 who chased the dogs away. Without looking at me Manish said, "So=
metimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your b=
reeches".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish =
said this is a wonderful place. I did not think too much about it then=
 since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to com=
e. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shoo=
ting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became cal=
m. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapash=
ya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since =
I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however =
I did not say anything. Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someon=
e who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami=
 used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a con=
firmed idiot.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Back to midnight. We reached Man=
ikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait=
. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we=
 came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfully made wa=
y for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at =
the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/=
10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a s=
ingle minute when there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it i=
s one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which M=
anish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand =
right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked danger=
ous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other si=
de of the samshan. It not only the bull,  but there is something else =
as well. I did not ask him
 what. So we went to another side. The dom there=
 came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log kaun se chita me baith=
na chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead =
and asked the people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit.=
 He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'l=
l sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space fo=
r us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to dis=
turb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Manik=
arnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not here. Manish=
 later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done=
 in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsleve=
s seen these things or heard from their families and thus they do not distu=
rb. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =
was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =
was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=
inutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=
 because there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose =
this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler se=
nse perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. =
Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intent=
ly for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. Bu=
t, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, t=
he dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost fe=
lt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I  - b=
eing such an ordinary person - obviously had no clue about. In th=
e middle of the Chandi
 path I could hear chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai=
" and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. </DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of sm=
oke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at =
that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire an=
d leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As =
the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human sha=
dow pass over the pages of the book. I thought it was some relati=
ve who was standing behind me. I looked back and was a shocked to find=
 there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again.=
 This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and sayi=
ng to myself "all iz well"-:).  Manish later said, as one does sadhana=
 the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if s=
lightly. It is not an imagination but reality and this can happen=
 not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doi=
ng
 sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While offering coconuts into the =
fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick w=
hich the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I=
 wondered if I had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I stran=
gely felt natural stroking the pyre the way the domes do. I even wonde=
red if there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job=
, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom =
at Manikarkina! Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bough=
t one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I unde=
rstood why.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In the middle of the homa, suddenl=
y Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him&n=
bsp;that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that t=
hey (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the ni=
ght. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him,=
 do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only pr=
aying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is =
going on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum l=
og ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down =
and continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish aske=
d me to observe the skin on the corpse  I saw the skin on the face had=
 caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water at the end to fins=
h the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour wa=
ter on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally=
 at the end they came to Manish and asked if they could pour some Gang=
es water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to=
 the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but n=
othing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some =
more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi samne khadi hai=
. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reventiall=
y bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch Manish's feet, but Mani=
sh would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed s=
ome flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very late i=
n the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had
 addres=
sed earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for=
 having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has don=
e no wrong, everything is all right.  Later Manish said, if it was som=
e other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of te=
a. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain=
 saint (a famous saint) who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respo=
nding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=
 Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night=
. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so uniq=
ue, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educa=
ted' people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the=
 simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the =
fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my
 head to my hea=
rt, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach , as if I was si=
mply floating on thin air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=
 curt one word reply, "Good".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish su=
ddenly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who=
 has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know h=
ow to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to come and per=
form these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a=
 Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to=
 meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to =
the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreig=
ner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is=
 the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. "Sh=
e has desire, but directionless. " At that time there was nothing more we c=
ould do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana =
on your own, instead of merely contemplatin
