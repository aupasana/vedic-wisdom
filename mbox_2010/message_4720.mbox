 Talk 208.

It is enough that one surrenders oneself. Surrender is to give =
oneself up to
the original cause of one=E2=80=99s being. Do not delude your=
self by imagining such
source to be some God outside you. One=E2=80=99s sou=
rce is within yourself. Give
yourself up to it. That means that you should =
seek the source and merge in
it. Because you imagine yourself to be out of =
it, you raise the question
=E2=80=9CWhere is the source?=E2=80=9D

Some con=
tend that the sugar cannot taste its own sweetness and that a taster
must t=
aste and enjoy it. Similarly, an individual cannot be the Supreme and
enjoy=
 the Bliss of that state; therefore the individuality must be
maintained on=
 the one hand and God-head on the other so that enjoyment may
result! Is Go=
d insentient(Devoid of feeling and consciousness) like sugar? How
can one s=
urrender oneself and yet retain one=E2=80=99s individuality for supreme
enj=
oyment?Furthermore they say also that the soul, reaching the divine
region =
and remaining there, serves the Supreme Being. Can the sound of the
word =
=E2=80=9Cservice=E2=80=9D deceive the Lord? Does He not know? Is He waiting=
 for these
people=E2=80=99s service? Would not He - the Pure Consciousness =
- ask in turn: =E2=80=9CWho
are you apart from Me that presume to serve Me?=
=E2=80=9D

Still more, they assume that the individual soul becomes pure by=
 being
divested of the ego and fit for being the body of the Lord. Thus the=
 Lord is
the Spirit and the purified souls constitute His body and limbs! C=
an there
be a soul for the souls? How many souls are there? The answer must=
 be,
=E2=80=9CThere are many individual souls and One Supreme Soul.=E2=80=
=9D What is soul in that
case? It cannot be the body, etc. What remains ove=
r after all these are
eliminated must be said to be the soul.Thus even afte=
r realising the soul as
that which cannot be discarded,the Supreme Soul mus=
t be known to exist. In
that case, how was the soul realised to be the ulti=
mate reality after
discarding all that was alien to it? Should this be righ=
t, the soul which
was described as that inalienable reality is not the true=
 soul.

All such confusion is due to the word =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 (atma)=
. The same word atma is
used to signify the body,the senses, the mind, the =
vital principle, the
individual soul and the Supreme Being. This wide appli=
cation of the word has
given rise to the idea that the individual soul (jiv=
atma), goes to
constitute the body of the Supreme (Paramatma). =E2=80=9CI, =
O Arjuna! am the Self,
seated in the heart of all beings; ...=E2=80=9D (Bha=
gavad Gita, X-20). The stanza
shows that the Lord is the Atma (Self) of all=
 beings. Does it say, =E2=80=9Cthe Self
of the selves=E2=80=9D?If, on the o=
ther hand, you merge in the Self there will be no
individuality left. You w=
ill become the Source itself. In that case what is
surrender? Who is to sur=
render what and to whom? This constitutes devotion,
wisdom, and investigati=
on.

Among the Vaishnavites too, Saint Nammalvar says, =E2=80=9CI was in a =
maze,sticking
to =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99; I wandered=
 without knowing my Self. On realising my Self
I understand that I myself a=
m You and that =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 (i.e., my possessions) is
only You.=
=E2=80=9D

Thus - you see - Devotion is nothing more than knowing oneself. =
The school
of Qualified Monism also admits it. Still, adhering to their tra=
ditional
doctrine, they persist in affirming that the individuals are part =
of the
Supreme - his limbs as it were. Their traditional doctrine says also=
 that
the individual soul should be made pure and then surrendered to the S=
upreme;
then the ego is lost and one goes to the
regions of Vishnu after on=
e=E2=80=99s death; then finally there is the enjoyment of
the Supreme (or t=
he Infinite)!

To say that one is apart from the Primal Source is itself a =
pretension; to
add that one divested of the ego becomes pure and yet retain=
s individuality
only to enjoy or serve the Supreme, is a deceitful stratage=
m. What duplicity
is this - first to appropriate what is really His, and th=
en pretend to
experience or serve Him! Is not all this already known to Him=
?
