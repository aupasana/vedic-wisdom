Namaste,
           The comparision with digging holes is with doing differ=
ent upasana to different Gods/Goddesses or trying different mantras or diff=
erent paths one after the other. It is to show the importance of perseveren=
ce. It does not mean that we should not worship different Gods or Goddesses=
. One always has a 'Mula Mantra' or 'mula Devatha' for upasana. This is the=
 primary diety in whom ones identity is sought to be dissolved. One can do =
other sadhanas in addition for maintenance of life or help in sadhana- for =
example- Devi upasana is accompanied with some form of Siva or Bhairava upa=
sana as taught by Guru. This helps because it will help in getting siddhi a=
s well as in protection. One may also do mrtyunjaya or mahamrtyunjaya or pr=
ay to Lakshmi if health or poverty are causing hindrance in ones sadhana.Th=
ese Gods and Goddesses may or may not be anga Devatha or Parivara devatha t=
o the mula Devatha. This is the traditional view.

Sticking to the Mula man=
tra/Devatha is critical for success. One can read books about mantra sastra=
 to understand why.

Animal sacrifice: Animal sacrifice is permitted( in ge=
neral). If one is a vegetarian, one can do naivedya of what one eats. If on=
e is in the habit of eating meat- what is wrong in sacrificing the same to =
the Devatha ? If one feels it is wrong, it must be wrong for oneself also t=
o eat. If it is right, then it must be right in sacrificing to the Devatha =
also( depending on the nature, likes and dislikes of the Devatha of course)=
. If you look at the Rahasyatrayam anga of the Chandi for example, sacrific=
ing and offering blood is permitted to all except 'dvija'. That said, I for=
 example cannot do this because my Guru parampara does not do this and I am=
 a dvija( by most definitions)- so there is a double injunction against thi=
s.



Just my 2 paise worth from the priceless teachings of Gurus and great=
 souls. I am willing to indulge in discussions which will help, but will ig=
nore any discussion the moment I feel my ego is getting into it.

Regards,
=
