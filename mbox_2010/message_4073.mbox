 Talk 286.

D.: How is realisation made possible?

M.: There is the absolut=
e Self from which a spark proceeds as from fire. The
spark is called the eg=
o. In the case of an ignorant man it identifies itself
with an object simul=
taneously with its rise.It cannot remain independent of
such association wi=
th objects.

This association is ajnana or ignorance, whose destruction is =
the objective
of our efforts.If its objectifying tendency is killed it rema=
ins pure, and
also merges into the source.The wrong identification with the=
 body is
dehatmabuddhi (=E2=80=98I-am-the-body=E2=80=99 idea).This must go =
before good results
follow.

D.: How to eradicate it?

M.: We exist in sush=
upti(deep sleep) without being associated with the body
and
mind. But in th=
e other two states we are associated with them. If one with
the body, how c=
an we exist without the body in sushupti?

We can separate ourselves from t=
hat which is external to us and not from
that which is one with us. Hence t=
he ego is not one with the body. This must
be realised in the waking state.=


The ego in its purity is experienced in intervals between two states or t=
wo
thoughts. Ego is like that caterpillar which leaves its hold only after
=
catching another. Its true nature can be found when it is out of contact
wi=
th objects or thoughts. Realise this interval with the conviction gained
by=
 the study of avasthatraya (the three states of consciousness).

D.: How do=
 we go to sleep and how do we wake up?

M.: Just at nightfall the hen cluck=
s and the chicks go and hide themselves
under her wings. The hen then goes =
to roost in the nest with the chicks in
her protection. At dawn the chicks =
come out and so does the hen. The
mother-hen stands for the ego which colle=
cts all the thoughts and goes to
sleep. At sunrise the rays emerge forth an=
d are collected again at sunset.
Similarly, when the ego displays itself, i=
t does so with all its
paraphernalia. When it sinks, everything disappears =
with it.
