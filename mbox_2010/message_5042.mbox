Namaste,
   While searching for how to make pavitraM on internet i stumble=
d upon
this blog
(http://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2008/03/origins-of=
-tarpanam.html
<http://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2008/03/origins-of-t=
arpanam.html\
> ), which has some interesting matters pertaining to pitRRi =
tarpaNaM,
one of the items that i got attracted to is the 10.15 RRik of RRi=
gvedaM.
Below is the english translation of the RRik(translation is that of=

Griffith, not that bad :-).

   Sanskrit version of the RRik and the recit=
ation of the same by vedic
pundits is posted here:

   Extracted the recitation from

RRik 10.15.....

1. MAY they ascend, the lowest, h=
ighest, midmost, the Fathers who
deserve a share of Soma-
May they who have=
 attained the life of spirits, gentle and righteous,
aid us when we call th=
em.

2 Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who passed of ol=
d
and those who followed,
Those who have rested in the earthly region, and =
those who dwell among
the Mighty Races.

3 1 have attained the gracious-min=
ded Fathers, I have gained son and
progeny from Visnu.
They who enjoy press=
ed juices with oblation seated on sacred grass, come
oftenest hither.

4 Fa=
thers who sit on sacred grass, come, help us: these offerings have
we made =
for you; accept them.
So come to us with most auspicious favour, and give u=
s health and
strength without a trouble.

5 May they, the Fathers, worthy o=
f the Soma, invited to their favourite
oblations.
Laid on the sacred grass,=
 come nigh and listen: may they be gracious
unto us and bless us.

6 Bowing=
 your bended knees and seated southward, accept this sacrifice
of ours with=
 favour.
Punish us not for any sin, O Fathers, which we through human frail=
ty
have committed.

7 Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings, give rich=
es to the man who
brings oblations.
Grant to your sons a portion of that tr=
easure, and, present, give them
energy, ye Fathers.

8 Our ancient Fathers =
who deserve the Soma, who came, most noble, to our
Soma banquet,-
With thes=
e let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing eat our
offerings at his =
pleasure.

9 Come to us, Agni, with the gracioug Fathers who dwell in glowi=
ng
light, the very Kavyas,
Who thirsted mid the Gods, who hasten hither, ob=
lation winners, theme of
singers' praises.

10 Come, Agni, come with countl=
ess ancient Fathers, dwellers in light,
primeval, God-adorers,
Eaters and d=
rinkers of oblations, truthful, who travel with the Deities
and Indra.

11 =
Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: ye kindly
leaders, ta=
ke ye each your proper place.
Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: =
grant riches with a
multitude of hero sons.

12 Thou, Agni Jatavedas, when =
entreated, didst bear the offerings which
thou madest fragrant,
And give th=
em to the Fathers who did cat them with Svadha. Eat, thou
God, the gifts we=
 bring thee.

13 Thou, Jatavedas, knowest well the number of Fathers who ar=
e here and
who are absent,
Of Fathers whom we know and whom we know not: ac=
cept the sacrifice
wellprepared with portions.


14 They who, consumed by f=
ire or not cremated, joy in their offering in
the midst of heaven,-
Grant t=
hem, O Sovran Lord, the world of spirits and their own body, as
thy pleasur=
e wills it.



Thanks and Regards,

sarma.
