There were occasions on which Sri Bhagavan took special notice of him, for
=
instance, when a cinema picture was about to be shown in the dining hall at=

5 p.m., Bhagavan declined to go there till Sri Narayana Iyer, who was
expe=
cted at 7 p.m. arrived, consequently a large number of people who had
gathe=
red in the hall had to wait for a long time. There were other instances
als=
o. Though deeply involved in the affairs of the ashram and having
different=
 views, he continues to visit the ashram regularly and is well
known to one=
 and all.

One morning at about 5 a.m. I prostrated before Bhagavan and too=
k leave of
him. There had been some function like jayanti or mahapuja the p=
revious day
and all were tired and asleep.

Sri Bhagavan said =E2=80=98Wait=
=E2=80=99 and went into the kitchen. I followed. He searched
and found noth=
ing to give me. He then put his hand inside a pot and found
some almonds. H=
e immediately lit the fire, put a pan on it, fried the
almonds in ghee and =
gave them to me. Though I protested, he gave me a big
packet of them and as=
ked me to eat them on my way and to give some to the
children at home! Is t=
his not divine love?

I once asked him: =E2=80=98Bhagavan, it is said that =
all roads lead to Rome. All
religions lead to the same goal. How, can it be=
 said that the quest =E2=80=9CWho am
I?=E2=80=9D is the only way and the di=
rect way?=E2=80=99

He replied: =E2=80=98Yes, all roads lead to Rome. But, =
on reaching Rome, you have to
go to the citadel(A stronghold into which peo=
ple could go for shelter during
a battle) =E2=80=93 the sanctum(A sacred pl=
ace of pilgrimage). What I say is just
that.=E2=80=99

The reactions of Sri=
 Bhagavan to physical pain were always a mystery to me.
I asked him if it w=
as true that he once had (as I was told by a friend)
boiling rice gruel (ka=
nji) spilt over his posterior and that Sri Bhagavan
knew about it only some=
 time after.

He narrated the incident thus: =E2=80=98I was straining the k=
anji from a vessel in
which rice was boiled. I was sitting on the floor. Th=
e boiling kanji was to
be collected in a smaller vessel on the floor, but I=
 was talking to some one
and without my noticing the kanji fell on the floo=
r, not in the vessel. As
the floor sloped towards me, it got under my poste=
rior. I knew about it only
afterwards when it got cool!

=E2=80=98Of course=
 I got blistered and Zam Buck was later applied. No doubt there
was pain af=
ter it was noticed, but who cares?=E2=80=99

The bliss of Self-realisation =
perhaps drowns any other experience!

One hot Sunday afternoon an old devot=
ee placed before Sri Bhagavan some
palmyra fruits [nongu].

Bhagavan severe=
ly remarked: =E2=80=98Why do you do this daily? You are a sannyasin.
You mu=
st beg of others the wherewithal to procure these. You must say that
they a=
re for me. You know that I cannot eat them without others present
sharing t=
hem and so you have to get some quantity, and this you do using my
name, as=
 though I desire it! Can=E2=80=99t you keep quiet and mind your business?
Y=
ou prostrate before me and think that you have won me over. Every
prostrati=
on is like a blow on my head. All sorts of things are done outside
these fo=
ur walls with impunity, as though these walls hide and protect them.
Who li=
kes these prostrations?=E2=80=99

And on and on he went in a tirade against=
 all and sundry who posed like
pious men but were hiding a lot of impurity.=
 It was not one individual that
was attacked. The atmosphere in the hall wa=
s tense, and one by one, the
devotees sneaked out. But such moods were only=
 momentary, and he could
switch on to his wonted geniality the next instant=
.
