The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once eve=
ry 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable material or spiritu=
al benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most people have, persisten=
t sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event cannot fix things.
=

 

As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual) everyday or atleas=
t every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one's favor over the time and s=
tart fixing material problems and enabling one's spiritual evolution.

 

I=
f one has access and is able to engage a priest everyday or every weekend, =
what you said is a fine strategy.

Absolutely. We should have nothing aga=
inst them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly =
noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no abilit=
y to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like man=
y priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying =
of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disap=
pointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do someth=
ing about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.

 

*        *    =
    *

 

Jyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a different bal=
l game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be done well by on=
e without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone and giving a bo=
ost to one's material and spiritual pursuits (using one's own spiritual ene=
rgy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and one without =
a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days, people hard=
ly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and how can they=
 take care of others?

No offense taken. Whose caliber i=

 <br>
The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or a=
ny ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable =
material or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most peo=
ple have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event =
cannot fix things.<br>
 <br>
As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any r=
itual) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one's =
favor over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one's s=
piritual evolution.<br>
 <br>
If one has access and is able to engage a pri=
est everyday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.<br>

 <br>
Absolutely. We should have nothing ag=
ainst them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly=
 noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no abili=
ty to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like ma=
ny priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying=
 of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disa=
ppointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do somet=
hing about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.<br>
 <br>
*      =
  *        *<br>
 <br>
Jyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a =
different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be do=
ne well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone an=
d giving a boost to one's material and spiritual pursuits (using one's own =
spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and=
 one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days=
, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and=
 how can they take care of others?<br>
