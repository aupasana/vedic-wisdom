Thanks for the reply.=C2=A0
I should be getting the sesame seeds and the no=
n-iron/steel pot today, so will start using them from tomorrow.=C2=A0For to=
day, I had to do it with the steel glass and the akshats.
Just one more que=
ry
As per the manual, before offering is made to Pitris, the Sesame seeds s=
hould be added to the pot. Now, the pot already has akshats lying at the bo=
ttom, is it fine to add sesame seeds as well to the same pit, or separate p=
ot is to be used?
Also, if the water has reduced in the pot after offerings=
 to Devas and Rishis, is it OK to add more water to the pot (if same as ask=
ed in previous question) before start offering to Pitris?

      Namaste,

 

Yes, tilodakam means "water with sesame se=
eds". If you are unable to use sesame seeds and use akshatas as a substitut=
e for sesame seeds, it is ok to stick to the same mantra and imagine the ak=
shatas to be sesame seeds. That may be better than changing the text to "ak=
shatodakam".

 

Sesame seeds, atleast the white ones, are available in mos=
t places, including the west.

 

You can collect the water in a vessel or =
bowl and offer it at the base of a plant or tree at the end of the ritual. =
That is better than leaving it on the floor.

 

*        *        *

 

Th=
is fortnight is a fantastic time to do pitri tarpanas. One can do pitri tar=
pana on everyday during this fortnight and forget all other criteria.

 

A=
 lot of people these days may benefit from pitri tarpana. The super-short p=
rocedure can be finished in 5 minutes and makes a lot of difference over th=
e time. These are some chakras (energy centers) in the palm. When water flo=
ws over tham in a particular direction and thoughts of freedom from certain=
 subtle influences on one's mind are in one's mind at the same time, it is =
conducive to internal changes which free one from those influences. Like wi=
th all rituals, you are engaging in external actions that promote certain k=
inds of internal transformation over time. Rituals work over time, when cou=
pled with conducive thinking.

 

In the old days, brahmanas (i.e. people i=
nterested in knowledge, spiritual progress and liberation) used to do a sho=
rt homam and pitri tarpana everyday. If that is not possible, atleast doing=
 tarpana during this fortnight is a great idea.

 

*        *        *

 
=

Someone asked about diet rules etc. For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as s=
aattwik food as one can is always a good idea. While doing sadhanas like pi=
tri tarpana or homam, it is good if one can stop eating meat or atleast cut=
 down on it. Eat as simple and saattwik food as possible.

 

Best regards,=
