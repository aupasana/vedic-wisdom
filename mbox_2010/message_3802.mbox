Namaste!

I always thought that it is the intensity that is the cutting edg=
e in Sadhana. Somebody said that u have to put everything on line if u trul=
y want to "get there"....(to the inner garbha of the temple?). If one is in=
tense enough the long and winding way / que actually gets shortened once da=
rkness, dinginess, smell of urine, dirt dont actually matter...the ghora be=
come aghora...duality become one...illusion dissappears...

But to have tha=
t kind of intensity is rare. Even Draupadi held on to her vastra till the v=
ery end...

Our faith may not be complete and total...we cannot surrender c=
ompletely....and therefore we traverse the long and winding road... stand i=
n a que...rather than take the short route.

Yes, when there is no me there=
 will be only You. Maybe there is no Me and no You...but only leela and laa=
li...and Lal.

Kabir said:

"Laali mere Lal ki, jit dekhun tit laal
Laali d=
ekhan main gayi, main bhi ho gayi laal (Lal?)"

For all of us who stand in =
a long que or take a shortcut, the desire is there to see the Laali...meet =
our Lal...become laal.

When we actually become laal depends upon the inten=
sity of our desire...our final and total surrender...to Lal.

Just a few th=
oughts / conjectures inspired by your mails...
