 AFTER SPENDING about twelve years in personal attendance on Bhagavan, I
be=
gan to feel an urge to devote myself entirely to sadhana, spending my time
=
all alone. However, I could not easily reconcile myself to the idea of
givi=
ng up my personal service to Bhagavan. I had been debating the matter
for s=
ome days when the answer came in a strange way. As I entered the hall
one d=
ay I heard Bhagavan explaining to others who were there that real
service t=
o him did not mean attending to his physical needs but following
the essenc=
e of his teaching: that is concentrating on realizing the
Self. Needless
to=
 say, that automatically cleared my doubts.

I therefore gave up my Ashram =
duties, but I then found it hard to decide how
in fact I should spend the e=
ntire day in search of Realization. I referred
the matter to Bhagavan and h=
e advised me to make Self-enquiry my final aim,
but to practice Self-enquir=
y, meditation, japa and recitation of scripture
turn by turn, changing over=
 from one to another as and when I found the one
I was doing irksome or dif=
ficult. In course of time, he said, the sadhana
would become stabilised in =
Self-enquiry or pure Consciousness or
Realization.

>From my personal experi=
ence, as well as from that of others within my
knowledge, I can say that be=
fore recommending any path to an aspirant
Bhagavan would first find out fro=
m him what aspect, or form, or path he was
naturally drawn to and then reco=
mmend him to follow it. He would sometimes
endorse the traditional stages o=
f sadhana, advancing from worship (puja) to
incantation (japa), then to med=
itation (dhyana), and finally to Self-enquiry
(vichara). However, he also u=
sed to say that continuous and rigorous
practice of any one of these method=
s was adequate in itself to lead to
Realization.

Thus, for instance, when =
one adopts the method of worship, say of the
Shakti, one should, by constan=
t practice and concentration, be able to see
the Shakti everywhere and alwa=
ys and in everything and thus give up
identification with the ego. Similarl=
y with japa. By constant and continuous
repetition of a mantra one gets mer=
ged in it and loses all sense of separate
individuality. In dhyana again, i=
n constant meditation, with bhavana or deep
feeling, one attains the state =
of Bhavanatheeta, which is only another name
for pure Consciousness. Thus, =
any method, if taken earnestly and practiced
unremittingly, will result in =
elimination of the "I" and lead to the goal of
Realization.

Once some awkw=
ard problems concerning Ashram management cropped up. Without
being directl=
y concerned, I was worried about them, as I felt that failure
to solve them=
 satisfactorily would impair the good name of the Ashram. One
day two or th=
ree devotees went to Bhagavan and put the problems before him.
I happened t=
o enter the hall while they were talking about them, and he
immediately tur=
ned to me and asked me why I had come in at this time and why
I was interes=
ting myself in such matters. I did not grasp the meaning of his
question, s=
o Bhagavan explained that a person should occupy himself only
with that pur=
pose with which he had originally come to the Ashram and asked
me what my o=
riginal purpose had been. I replied: "To receive Bhagavan's
Grace." So he s=
aid: "Then occupy yourself with that only."

He further continued by asking=
 me whether I had any interest in matters
concerning the Ashram management =
when I first came here. On my replying that
I had not, he added: "Then conc=
entrate on the original purpose of your
coming here."
