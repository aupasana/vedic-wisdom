Namaste,
 
> Do you also agree to this ?
 
No, I do not. Two fundamental points:
 
(1) Truth is too complicated and throwing light on all aspects of Truth simultaneously requires volumes to be written or spoken. To simplify things, a great yogi may emphasize one aspect and downplay others. If a yogi's job is to make someone climb a mountain using one path, does he need to survey all the sides of the entire mountain and make factual statements on every nook and corner? Even if he makes misleading statements about paths on the other side of the mountain, it does not matter as long he he succeeded in motivating several people to climb the mountain in one path and several of them reached the pinnacle.
 
(2) Even a great yogi who masters the knowledge of non-dual Self, may be deluded with respect to the knowledge of dual Self, i.e. the vast field of duality (which springs from Self). The Divine Mother gives whatever knowledge is needed for one to fulfil one's job and can keep one in some level of misunderstanding about some aspects of the field of duality.

Swami Vivekananda came at a time of superstition and ritualism by the mainstream, when young and intelligent men were being influenced by modern atheistic and monotheistic philosophies. It was a time when astrology was corrupted badly and did not stand a chance of revival. It was a time when people superstitiously believed in fate, astrology, muhurtas etc.
 
His agenda was to put brakes on superstition and ritualism, promote a deeper understanding of the knowledge of rishis, attract intelligent young men towards the adwaitic teachings of rishis, create belief that one is a master of one's destiny, exhort a dormant giant to arise and awake and tell the world about that dormant giant. Some of his specific messages may be tuned for his desa-kaala-paatra.

First of all, neither I nor Rajarshi (nor even Manish) are assuming the role of a "guru". Some people who appreciate our views on various issues may end up looking at us as gurus, but we ourselves do not call ourselves gurus. I, for one, look at myself as a traffic sign board that shows directions to Delhi. I may or may not know much about Delhi, but I have been installed by my guru and the Mother to show the direction to Delhi to people interested in travelling to Delhi. It is good if some people actually reach Delhi using this sign board, but it does not really matter to me.
 
Secondly, the compulsion you mention is unwise. Why pass judgment over something one does not know?
 
A good guru is not one who has a strong opinion on everything, or who knows everything, or who answers all questions. A good guru is one who somehow or the other ensures that the disciple gets the correct understanding - not just an intellectual understanding but an understanding that is ingrained in one's consciousness and affects one's attitude, thoughts and actions deeply.
 
*        *        *
 
What is your motivation in asking for an opinion on Vivekananda's quote on astrology? Are you trying to cast aspersions and dismiss Vivekananda's critique on ritualistic interpretations of Veda, that was mentioned by Rajarshi?
 
Vivekananda was an active teacher. He may have made many statements when he was at different levels of realization. But his comment on Veda and a need for interpreting Veda correctly came on the last day of his life too. He forced his students to get a commentary, read one verse, and gave his independent interpretation tying it to some yogic/tantric concepts. He remarked that Veda needed to be interpreted correctly. By that time, he had the fullest realization of his true nature and also knew that he was about to give that body up. His statement on Veda on the last day of his life was almost like an acknowledgement of a task that could not be finished in that life and was left for others.
 
Interestingly, work of Aurobindo Ghose's life was like a fulfilment of that wish of Vivekananda. It is interesting that Aurobindo claimed to have been visited by Vivekananda (who left body several years earlier) and taught some philosophy while he was in prison.
 
In any case, those who think that Veda teaches explicit details about external rituals need to think whether knowledge of external actions in the material world can ever be "absolute" and untouched by desa-kaala-paatra. Veda is *absolute* knowledge that has nothing *relative* (i.e. based on desa-kaala-paatra).
 
Aurobindo's "Secret of the Veda" is the most definitive work of the last few millennia on Veda.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalized, recorded, and made into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers lived and had this book in their possession. It seems possible that this is how astrology came into existence. Excessive attention to the minutiae of astrology is one of the superstitious which has hurt the HINDUS very much.

Because in India you will find old altars, made according to a certain geometrical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in when certain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the Hindus gave them astronomy.

He had written a huge, lengthy article on why and how mantras are nothing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancient people, and they are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A person with such a shallow understanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be expected to recognize the spiritual essence and depth of "Agni". Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of rituals/history/ or even dharma, but probably a testimony of the various spiritual realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical verses.

During his last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the interpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his opinion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas really are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses and in future, and that someone has to come up with a more holistic and deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence that Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up with a new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.

> There are different homam proceudures followed by different paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none of them is incorrect. The final judge of the success of any sustained sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. If the sadhana is making the sadhaka more detached, etc etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed. It is not the number of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the internal transformations that you experience which are crucial. There are people who follow a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals and yet never experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas, which when done regularly helps to
