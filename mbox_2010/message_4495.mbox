Namaste Sindhu ji,


In your message which was describing an interesting ar=
guments with noble intentions, till the point you wrote following:

[
The a=
pprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,
 "I cannot possibly finish t=
his preface without expressing my deep gratitude for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Ra=
th, who has been a constant source of enlightenment, 
encouragement and ins=
piration. I am eternally grateful to him"
 
and now you say
 
"In my well-c=
onsidered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets and some generic guidel=
ines (which may be imperfect, like with ......
]

With the above, you creat=
ed enough doubt about your intentions because you went on Personal attack o=
n Narasimha straight away without any provocations. His Astrological differ=
ences and opinions are something totally-off the subject which concerns Hom=
am issues. 

I can easily answer the above point which indicates the shift =
of Narasimha's opinion on one of his jyotish Gurus teachnigs. but Narasimha=
 may not approve of it so it is best left to him.

Best Regards,

Utpal

pects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the hi=
ghest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to=
 reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on =
the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can b=
e made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on de=
sa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current position!
