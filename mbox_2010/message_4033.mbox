 16th December, 1938

Talk 596.

A visitor asked: Sri Bhagavan said last ni=
ght that God is guiding us.

Then why should we make an effort to do anythi=
ng?

M.: Who asks you to do so? If there was that faith in the guidance of =
God
this question would not have arisen.

D.: The fact is that God guides u=
s. Then what is the use of these
instructions to people?

M.: They are for =
those who seek instructions. If you are firm in your belief
in the guidance=
 of God, stick to it, and do not concern yourself with what
happens around =
you.

Furthermore, there may be happiness or misery. Be equally indifferent=
 to
both and abide in the faith of God. That will be so only when one=E2=80=
=99s faith is
strong that God looks after all of us.

Mr. Chopra asked: =E2=
=80=9CHow shall I secure that firm faith?=E2=80=9D

M.: Exactly. It is for =
such as these who want instructions. There are
persons who seek freedom fro=
m misery. They are told that God guides all and
so there need not be any co=
ncern about what happens.If they are of the best
type they at once believe =
it and firmly abide by faith in God.

But there are others who are not so e=
asily convinced of the truth of the
bare statement. They ask: =E2=80=9CWho =
is God? What is His nature? Where is He? How
can He be realised?=E2=80=9D a=
nd so on.

In order to satisfy them intellectual discussion is found
necess=
ary.Statements are made, their pros and cons are argued,and the truth
is th=
us made clear to the intellect.

When the matter is understood intellectual=
ly the earnest seeker begins to
apply it practically. He argues at every mo=
ment, =E2=80=9CFor whom are these
thoughts? Who am I?=E2=80=9D and so forth=
, until he is well-established in the
conviction that a Higher Power guides=
 us.That is firmness of faith. Then all
his doubts are cleared and he needs=
 no further instructions.
