Dear=C2=A0 Rajarshi - Namaste









It is my belief that you
have prob=
ably incorrectly understood some of Narasimha's points. He is not
saying th=
at a grossly mispronounced mantra will give you specific results, BUT,
if t=
he fear of the 64 things that bind a mantra stops an individual from even
t=
rying to do japa, THAT is an even more serious problem. Therefore, his advi=
se
was to start doing sadhana in whatever way possible without getting bogg=
ed down
by technicalities too much.

=C2=A0

Thanks for your kind
review. B=
ut I think you didn=E2=80=99t read me as a whole. When I first read
Narsinh=
a=E2=80=99s=C2=A0 post I just took a printout
,again read it as a whole in =
my pastime and then started some thinking as what
he wrote was not compleme=
ntary to scripture references on such imp subtle topic.
This whole dissecti=
on consists of mainly two points; whether yajamana gets
desired results thr=
ough priest=E2=80=99s shakti or by devata shakti and focus of mind
w.r.t. r=
ituals,=C2=A0 arrangement of
mantrawords, power of words, etc. including ge=
neric mantra subtopic. From my
side this is due to mixing of religion and s=
pirituality. Religion as a whole is
for all four purusharthas i.e. dharma, =
artha, kama
and moksha while spirituality is for moksha only. In other word=
s you may think
this as pathway to desire fulfillment and pathway to god. D=
esire fulfillment
has nothing to do with moksha and for moksha vasanakshaya=
, desire eliination is
needed. In this perspective you can understand me be=
tter.

I didn=E2=80=99t focus on
pronunciation, accent etc. and rituals, ka=
rmakanda details. If we want to refer
shastra have all themes for and again=
st; to substantiate the principle which
was lacking in Narsimha=E2=80=99s p=
ost. Mere experiences or logic of one man will not
prove the facts. Sages c=
ritically write that universal =E0=A4=86=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=
=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=97=E0=A5=

=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=
=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 is
must to =
claim any siddhanta.. My ex. of ram and ramya was for understanding the
hum=
an nature of devatas and how varnamala is imp for creation, etc. =C2=A0We c=
all veda hymns as richa and one meaning of
rucha is stuti; praise. All four=
 Vedas pronounce kshha [=E0=A4=B7] as kshha [=E0=A4=B7] but shuklayajurveda=

tradition pronounce kshha [=E0=A4=B7] as kha [ =E0=A4=96], ya
[=E0=A4=AF] =
as ja [=E0=A4=9C] ; =C2=A0they pronounce =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=
=81=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=83 as =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=96=E0=
=A4=83, which=C2=A0 from all other traditional =C2=A0vedic view is wrong bu=
t nearly half vedic
population follows shuklayajurveda. As per your underst=
anding if I have stressed
on pronounciation etc. this seems to be an incorr=
ect rucha; but I call this
correct though I follow rugveda. To understand t=
his fully we should know
subjects like siddha tradition, varadamantra, bles=
sings of devata etc. Yes, we
must not bog down by too much technicalities b=
ut still we must follow some
rituals [I think you must be following some ho=
ma manuals=C2=A0 of Narsimha] and in my whole post I never
stressed for thi=
s. I could have supported sindhu saraswati in your =E2=80=98 homa
procedure=
=E2=80=99 discussions but even in old golden days rituals for same devatas,=

same mantras differ a lot as per desh, kala, paristhithi and sidhha tradit=
ions.
=C2=A0Yes, I fully understand and whole
heartedly appreciate Narsimha=
=E2=80=99s guidelines for doing sadhana on own but that
does not mean to pr=
opagate wrong ideas or to interpret scriptures in this way.
And why I am sa=
ying this is clear from my comments regarding generic mantra and
focus of m=
ind.

So desire
is from yajamana, mind is of priest and blessings are from =
pleased devata. Even
in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recomm=
ended various rituals of
various devatas for removing bad effects of bad da=
shas or bad planetary
placements. I wonder if mantra and rituals do not cou=
nt why Narsimhaji is
having so many homa manuals.

Mantra and rituals surel=
y
count, BUT, they by themselves are incapable of producing results UNTILL =
the
individual performing the ritual has requisite Shaktih. I have seen lea=
rned
priests performing elaborate and technically complex (costly too!) rit=
uals
which did not produce any result. Iwonder how many priests in todays t=
ime can
say with 100 percent certainty that if he does X ritual, he can gau=
rantee a Y
result for a yajamana? I have met people who can do this too, th=
ey were not
priests, but sadhakas. Most ordinary priests today have zero ca=
pability of
producing results. The ritual is a tool to be used, through whi=
ch Shakti accumulated
by the priest is directed to gain a certain specifc r=
esult. Without the Shakti
elaborate rituals are of no use. They will just n=
ot produce tangible results.
And results are the parameter of judgement. Sh=
aktih is the result of
accumulated sadhana. Like Narasimha said, a ritual i=
s like a gun and the
Shaktih is like a bullet. Having the gun is good, but =
without the bullet it
won't work. These days priests do not do enough sadha=
na and therefore, they
cannot gaurantee any results most of the times. In t=
he light of the above, it
is better if people perform their own rituals or =
own sadhana and sincerely ask
the Deity to give the results instead of wait=
ing for a priest to do it, who
anyway cannot gaurantee results these days. =
Religion is a practical art.

At least you accept
mantra, rituals are neces=
sary. If we say priest must have shakti how can we
count his nature of shak=
ti in terms of quality, quantity, depth and need? Should
we consider shakti=
 to beget baby, remove diseases, give immense wealth is same?,
how to diffe=
rentiate priest with and without shakthi, =C2=A0most imp who will different=
iate this, what are
the parameters to define this, what are the tools to un=
derstand all these
subtle points, etc will be the complex issues before yaj=
amana/us when he/we
think of doing any remedy. Do we have any universal sys=
tem for this? If you
think over these issues you will come to know the trut=
h. If a priest perform a
puja every third day he must have at least tons of=
 shakti to give results. Only
person who is in unmani/trans avashta can hav=
e such a huge shakti [even great
sages don=E2=80=99t have such shakti as pe=
r vishvamitra, trishanku story] and such
person will not use his power to w=
ash sins of so many people unless asked by
his superiors to do this. Such g=
reat shakthi is not accumulated in one birth
and no wise man will waste his=
 shakti obtained from penances of so many births
to wash sins of people for=
 money. We read lot of stories of saints, sages
refusing to change, interve=
ne in prarbdhha of people. Shri Ramkrishna
Paramhansa didn=E2=80=99t rescue=
 mathurbabu, akshay from death trap though he was
having immense shakti. If=
 you give some serious thinking on this topic I hope
you will understand fu=
tility of shakti concept. I have already stated that
priests are mere techn=
ician or mediator for all rituals, so question of
guaranty from them is of =
no use. Will you ask a car mechanic/ driver to give
guaranty in terms of pe=
rformance, yield etc? Who recommend remedy; an
astrologer or a sadhaka who =
guides the yajamana, so they should give guaranty
for this as they know the=
 depth of sins w.r.t. correct remedy. =C2=A0Can you give proclaim that pred=
ictions of all
astrologers always comes true? Can you give guaranty that if=
 there is X yoga
there will be Y results?=C2=A0 Today maximum
astrologers a=
re unable to give correct predictions so do you call for learning
astrology=
 on your own to fix remedies? Now a days many astrologers are giving fake
r=
emedies, wrong predictions so will you say that don=E2=80=99t visit astrolo=
gers but
learn astrology to have remedies for your bad yogas in horoscope?=
=C2=A0 The main duty of priests is to have
substantially good knowledge / p=
ractice of rituals,mantras etc. with accuracy
and not sadhana as a mortal h=
uman being can not bless yajamana. That
responsibility rest with devatas; a=
 divine powerhouse. 

=C2=A0

To consider
spiritual aspect of it, persons l=
ike saint or yogis who do have dharanA like a

solid rock
who always rest i=
n Trans or dhyanavashtA need not require mantra or tantra,

rituals for
cre=
ating energy. A mere wish of them can do work. Normal people like me;

requ=
ire all
earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of patanjali like yama, niyama, aA=
sana,

praNAyAm,
pratyahAr and dharanA. And these all steps are embedded in=
 vedic or tantrik

pooja
traditions as mantra, tantra, nyas, etc. So for wi=
sh to be get full filled by
devata

many many
things count.

Yes many thing=
s count,
but if the count is so high that it stops one from even attempting=
, it is
hardly of any use then. A saint or a yogi does not become a yogi in=
 a single
day, but by rigorous and continuous sadhana day in and day out, a=
cross
lifetimes. Follow whatever rules one is comfortable with, and just pl=
unge into sadhana.
The results will manifests on their own. And Nature is e=
ver kind. It guides the
ones who have are ready to make the effort with a s=
incere heart. BUT effort,
even if flawed, is the key. There are people who =
are theoritically
knowledgeable about so many rules/technicalitie s etc of =
mantra sadhana, such
that they themselves never tried anything, and yet the=
re are others who hardly
know any rules but just plunge into sadhana and in=
 due coarse of time start
experiencing the beauty of the Deity! So therefor=
e, all said and done, the key
is practical, day or day sadhana. Unless one =
is making efforts, all theoritical
discussions don't really effect much. Ya=
ma/Niyama/ aAsana etc will come through
effort and practise. Waiting for it=
 to dawn one fine day won't happen. Which
again means, start sadhana in wha=
tever way one can if one is really serious
about experiencing divinity or f=
or that matter getting a specific saatwik
result. This is the practical fac=
t of the matter. Which, IMHO, is what
Narasimha was saying.

I think you di=
dn=E2=80=99t refer
Narsimha=E2=80=99s quotes before my comments where he cl=
early wrote as The power is not in a
combination of syllables (mantra) or a=
 sequence of physical actions (ritual).
The power is in the MIND that FOCUS=
ES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or
a sequence of physical actions=
 (ritual). A man of average intelligence like me
thought this as wrong beca=
use sage whom we call mantradrashta =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=
=A4=B0=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9F=E0=A4=BE not o=
nly see the deity but all science and power
behind nature of alphabet, ther=
e sequence, arrangements, like and dislikes of
deity etc. of mantra when th=
e DIVINE REVEAL HIMSELF THROUGH HIS WISH to that
saint and that is why Veda=
s [this includes all tantric, puran, veda mantras]
are called shruti, apour=
usheya =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=8C=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=87=E0=
=A4=AF; knowledge with out efforts. When that sage comes
to normal human mi=
nd state he writes rituals etc for that mantra which we call
as smruti and =
this smruti part is always flexible according to desh, kala,
paristhiti. Bu=
t shruti part is immortal, divine and hence not subject to any
change. We a=
re discussing astrology and remedy post so remedy mantra must be
w.r.t to s=
in, curses, bad karma and according to this we must have appropriate
mantra=
, tantra etc. so naturally count will be high. Yes, follow smriti rules
[as=
 sanctioned by guru only] with whom we are comfortable but we must follow
s=
hruti rules as it is divine, blessed words. =C2=A0So I request you to read =
para of both and then
you will understand my comments.

w.r.t. rituals,<span style=3D"">  </span>arrangement of
mantraword=
s, power of words, etc. including generic mantra subtopic. From my
side thi=
s is due to mixing of religion and spirituality. Religion as a whole is
for=
 all four purusharthas i.e. dharma, artha, <st1:place w:st=3D"on">kama</st1=

and moksha while spirituality is for moksha only. In other words yo=
u may think
this as pathway to desire fulfillment and pathway to god. Desir=

has nothing to do with moksha and for moksha vasanakshaya, de=
sire eliination is
needed. In this perspective you can understand me better=
