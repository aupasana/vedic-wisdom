Namaste,

Instantly one thought came. A famous temple always has a queue of=
 thousands of people and it normally takes minimum of 4 to 5 hours to get i=
n and have the Darshana of the lord AND on the other hand, there is a secre=
t way to get into Garbha Gruha and reach The lord very fast in few minutes =
but the way is through A extremely Stinking and filthy Toilet and possibili=
ties to faint and become unconscious.

These is Conventional ways and Aghor=
a.

Best Regards,

Utpal
