Talk 507

D.: Object existence is independent of the sub=
ject.

M.: Do the objects exist in the absence of the subject?

M.: Do you =
say that they exist, or do they come and announce their existence
to you?

=
D.: I know that they exist.

M.: So it is your knowledge of them only. Thei=
r existence is not absolute.

D.: Even if I did not know they will continue=
 to exist.

M.: Do you claim their existence in the absence of your knowled=
ge of
them?(Laughter).

 In Shankaracharya's Drik Drisya Vivekam it is said

The world we see, bein=
g seen by the eye, is drisya (object);the eye which
sees it is drik (subjec=
t). But the eye, being perceived by the mind is
drisya (object) and the min=
d which sees it is drik (subject). The mind, with
its thoughts perceived by=
 the Self, is drisya (object) and the Self is drik
(subject).The Self canno=
t be drisya (object), not being perceived by
anything else. The forms perce=
ived are various, blue and yellow, gross and
subtle, tall and short, and so=
 on; but the eye that sees them remains one
and the same. Similarly, the va=
rying qualities of the eye, such as
blindness, dullness and keenness and of=
 the ears and other organs, are
perceived by the mind singly. So, too, the =
various characteristics of the
mind, such as desire, determination, doubt, =
faith, want of faith,
courage,want of courage, fear, shyness, discriminatio=
n, good and bad,are all
perceived by the Self singly. This Self neither ris=
es nor sets, neither
increases nor decays. It shines of its own luminosity.=
 It illumines
everything else without the need for aid from other sources.
