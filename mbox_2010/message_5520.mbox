> Dont blame the system - it is the you.

Good general advice.

> =
I hve the entire word by word tolkappIyam in analyzable format ... to see t=
he real truths in the Aryan - Dravidian divide This should have been done b=
y scholars or myself years ago -

You might want to look into the works of =
the International Institute
of Tamil Studies, based in Chennai. They have d=
one a bunch of research
comparing and contrasting the Tolkappiyam & Paniniy=
am grammar. I do
not know anything about this, but it is certainly an inter=
esting area
of study.

> Dedicated to the Adi sha~gkara ... with is comment=
 on vyAkarNa
> his "ai giri..." cannot be understand if you don't know what=
 "ai" is

Firstly, on this tangent -- to be best of my knowledge, the
mahis=
hAsura-mardini stotram is not a composition of Adi shankara. I do
not see i=
t in the Vani Vilas edition of his woks. It is possible that
the composer w=
as someone named Ramakrishna Kavi.

Secondly, on point. In my opinion, Adi =
shankara made no comment
towards you, or towards any vaiyAkaraNa regarding =
vyAkaraNa. A little
bit of logic shows a lot of myth surrounding his moha-m=
udgara-stotra
(later rebranded as bhaja-govinda). The rumour-mill account, =
which is
taken as the absolute truth says that Adi shankara saw an old man
=
trying to start learning grammar by memorizing the dhAtu-pAtha, and
out of =
pity, he instructed him by spontaneously composing 12 verses.
The remaining=
 verses are said to be later additions.

(a) It is difficult to justify the=
 composition of the 2nd verse
(muuDha jahiihi) and especially difficult to =
justify the composition
of the 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an upadesha to an=
 old man. If we
assume that aspects of the traditional account are true, it=
 is much
more likely that he recited these verses to his own sannyAsii stud=
ents
to cultivate vairAgya in them. Assuming that you are a non-sannyAsii,
=
there's no reason to get riled up about advice that is not primarily
direct=
ed at you.

(b) Adi shankara is said to have composed the first 12 stanzas,=

following which, many of his students composed single verses that have
bee=
n now been compiled together. It is pretty unlikely that Adi
shankara would=
 have had his disciples (young and old) gang up on an
old man. It also seem=
s unlikely that his students would have added
onto a work that was composed=
 for someone else's benefit. In a
satsanga of rishis, everyone waits for th=
e main rishi to speak. On the
other hand, assume that this advice was compo=
sed and imparted to his
own students. It is more likely that his students m=
ight add onto this
kind of work. Again, there is no reason for you to get r=
iled up about
advice that is not primarily directed at you.

(c) In the bes=
t case, the first verse (bhaja govindam) merely provides
the context. At wo=
rst, it is a later addition. The moha-mudgara
consists of verses 1-12. Let =
us take the first verse as a
mangala-shloka, rather than excluding it altog=
ether. This stotram is a
work of contemplation. Though Adi shankara is a ma=
ster bhakta, this
work is not a good example of bhakti. The older name of t=
he stotram
(moha mudgara =3D hammering delusion), is much more reflective o=
f the
work that the popular name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi
sh=
ankara is clear about people needing different solutions at
different point=
s in their spiritual life. First, they need karma +
upAsana, and only later=
 should they pursue viveka. Thus, the advice in
his stotra is intended prim=
arily for a different crowd. It is unlikely
that he would have given this a=
dvice to some random stranger. There is
no reason for you to get riled up a=
bout advice that is not primarily
directed at you.

(d) Now, let us assume =
that the rumour-mill account is true. As you
have noted, Adi shankara's com=
positions are composed in sanskrit.
Further, it is clear that he is extreme=
ly well-versed in grammar. So,
any conclusion that he is anti-grammar seems=
 strange, and is wrong.
There is no reason to get riled up over this.

(e) =
His sampradAya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAkaraNa
is a regu=
lar topic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at
sringeri. It is the=
 same institution that is publishing, and
re-publishing various grammatical=
 works. His own disciples, who adorn
this peeTha, are great scholars of vyA=
karaNa. Adi shankara, and his
sampradAya are clearly not anti-grammar. In f=
act, they are clearly
pro-grammar. So, there is nothing to get riled up abo=
ut.

Now, let us take the "bhaja govindam" verse at face value. I still
don=
't see the problem --

That there is no point in studying the dhAtu-pATha o=
n the death-bed.
This makes sense. "dvAdasha-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam"=
. Grammar is
learned in 12 years. What point is there in starting the study=
 on the
death-bed? This doesn't mean that vyAkaraNam shouldn't be studied a=
t
all. All it means is that desha-kAla-pAtra should be taken into
account. =
And, if you want to take things literally, Adi shankara said
nothing about =
grammar in general. In this verse, all he talked about
was the dhAtu-pATha =
in particular.

People who truly study the dhAtu pATha these days are rare,=
 and I
would expect a disproportionate number of them to consider Adi
shank=
ara as their guru.
