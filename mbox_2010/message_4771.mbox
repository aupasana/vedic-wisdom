Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Free Book on M=
iscellaneous Spiritual Topics

  
Namaste learned friends,

I have been wri=
ting a lot of mails on various topics related to spirituality and 
sadhana =
on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup for a few years now. These writings are 
free-wh=
eeling in nature and not well-organized.

On 2010 Guru Pournima, my Jyotish=
 students in Boston gifted me a book they 
created out of some of those wri=
tings. They organized the writings topically in 
the form of a book.

A lot=
 of topics that may be of interest to spiritual seekers are addressed in 
o=
ne place, in a *somewhat* organized form. A lot of questions from members w=
ere 
answered in simple language and several subtle issues were addressed.
=

The book in PDF format is only 1.5 MB in size and is FREE to download. If =
you 
are interested, please go to:

If you want the full link, use the following:

http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/articles/vedic_wisdom_1.pdf

If you find th=
e book useful, please feel free to benefit from it and pass the 
word aroun=
d. Otherwise, as I always say, kindly ignore.

Best regards,
Narasimha
