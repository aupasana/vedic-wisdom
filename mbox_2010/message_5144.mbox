Namaste,
 
The word yajna (or even the word homa) means an act of offering a sacrifice. The fire ritual in which physical materials are offered to deities in fire is dravya yajna (material sacrifice).
 
The real yajna is one where various actions that are performed based on one's dharma are sacrificed in the internal fire of wisdom (i.e. the knowledge that God acts through us). Of course, if one says "god is doing this through me" as a mere formality, but secretly entertains thoughts like "I am doing this", "I did it" etc, then one is not really *sacrificing* the action. It is akin to pretending to throw some material into fire in a fire ritual, but not really throwing it or throwing it outside of the fire. It does not burn and does not reach god. Only materials thrown inside the fire and burnt fully will be considered to have been sacrificed to gods. Similarly, only if the sense of doership and ownership over an action is completely surrendered to god can we say that one has sacrificed that action in the internal fire of wisdom.
 
Lord is essentially saying below that actions performed without surrendering the doership to Lord completely become bondages and actions performed and completely sacrificed to Lord in the internal fire, i.e. completely surrendered to Lord, do not bind one. Whether you do a good act and a bad act, it binds you as long as you think that you are doing it.
 
*        *        *
 
Depending on your dharma, what you do may vary. You may be teaching spiritual knowledge. You may be doing rituals for establishing sanatana dharma. You may be doing rituals for the victory of a ruler. You may be fighting an election to be a president. You may be fighting a physical war with enemies. You may be doing business and making money to build a temple. You may be begging on the streets and living with dogs. You may be doing anything. But, the key is to give up the doership to the Lord and erase the notion that "I am doing" completely from the mind. THAT yajna will keep you free from bondage.
 
*        *        *
 
In order to kindle the internal fire and make it burn well, we use an external fire as a symbol in the beginning. As we spend time with external fire, the internal fire is kindled by resonance. That is why an external fire ritual is recommended to sadhakas.

Regarding swa-dharma, two points:
 
First point: One's varna may or may not be shown by the family of birth. One's varna is to be determined by one's aptitude and the direction in which one's conditioning pulls one.
 
Second point: A brahmana's job is not just to do rituals. A brahmana's job is to pursue knowledge and self-realization and become a beacon of knowledge for the society. One can do that by engaging in rituals for dharma in the society or teach people or just do tapascharya or so many other things.
 
*        *        *
 
Though Krishna's directive to Arjuna has been interpreted in the context of varnashrama or, loosely speaking, caste system, it is not so simple. Krishna asked Arjuna to follow "swa-dharma", i.e. one's own dharma, and avoid paradharma, i.e. other people's dharma. It is not that there are four kinds of dharma in the world. Each person has one's own dharma, that is decided based on who one has been in previous lives, what karmik debts one has, what desires and conditioning one has, and what abilities one has. Each person has a unique dharma.
 
But it is not easy to find what exactly one's dharma is! Arjuna was lucky and had a guru like Krishna, who told him his dharma was to kill those armies of relatives, gurus, elders etc. Shankaracharya was lucky to have a guru like Govinda Bhagavatpada, who told him he had to write commentaries on Vedic literature and debate. Vivekananda was lucky to have a guru like Ramakrishna who begged him not go to Himalayas and asked to spread the knowledge of Sanatana Dharma in India and abroad.
 
*        *        *
 
How do we find what *our* dharma is? It is not easy! If you have a trusted guru, follow him/her. Otherwise, follow the internal guru, i.e. the instincts from your conscience. Unfortunately, one sees one's dharma clearly only if one is pure. And, one becomes pure only if one fulfills most of one's dharma. This is a catch-22 situation.
 
The simplest algorithm is to listen to your trusted guru (an external person or internal conscience), discharge the dharma as said by guru and try to increase surrender and detachment in actions. As detachment increases and some dharma gets fulfilled, purity increases and clarity on what one's dharma is increases. As that happens, one can become more detached. And so on. If one keeps doing this patiently and keeps doing sadhana and contemplation, one will eventually break through into right track.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Does this mean that we should all leave what we are doing and go back to our native places and keep doing our kula vritti as defined by our vihita karmas as defined by our scriptures? I am very confused and need PVRjis help to understand this better.
