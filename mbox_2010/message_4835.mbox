Respected Sir,

I am highly thankful for your guidance.
 I restarted my rou=
tine of homam from this Shri Krishna janmashtami.

Sir, Since we sometimes =
discussed about Shri Narayan kavacham in this group. Because of curiosity I=
 read Shri Narayan kavacham today. I was amazed to read that In the verses =
we request Narayana's incarnations to protect us from enemies. And these en=
emies include both our external enemies and our internal enemies like anger=
, ignorance, laziness, lust etc.

Sir I am curious that can this kavacham b=
e used by a sadhaka seeking spiritual upliftment for overcoming his interna=
l enemies?


Can it be used to accelerate one's travel on spiritual path? 
=

Kind Regards
Atul
