Namaste Hari,
 
> (1) Whether, on the day of one's birthday, is it ok to do=
 the pitr tarpana
> without any restrictions?
 
Hari, in general, restricti=
ons and technical guidelines are meant for maximizing the *chance* of a lib=
erating experience and not meant for stopping one from a sadhana that one i=
s well-motivated to do! Moreover, the liberating experience may come after =
a lot of sadhana.
  
Go ahead and do it. Happy birthday!
 
> (2) Whether th=
e puja lamp can be lit at the start of the day (as is the
> usual practice)=
 and pitr tarpana done after lighting lamp (of course, in a
> different pla=
ce other than the puja mandir)?
 
Yes, pitri tarpana can be done after ligh=
ting the lamp or doing a homam.

Namaste Rajesh,
 
>=
 1. Is it ok to do tarpan ( pouring water for tarpan and all) besides havan=
kund? or at the same place of havankund?
 
Yes.
 
> 2. While doing tarpan v=
idhi, is it ok if in the middle of tarpan vidhi, =C3=82 i put ghee to havan=
kund for maintaining fire so that=C3=82 sopari ( which is used=C3=82 for pu=
rnahuti)=C3=82 can be burned totally?
 
Wait till the homam is completely f=
inished and everything burns. Then start the other ritual.
 
> 3. I am norm=
ally doing vishnu homam and tarpan vidhi both in my bedroom. In pitru tarpa=
n manual it is written that during shraddha paksha ( this fortnight) there =
is no harm in doing tarpan vidhi in house also..is this ok?
 
It is ok. How=
ever, it is better to do pitri tarpana in another place. People's minds are=
 quite vulnerable when they are asleep, to various influences. When you do =
a pitri tarpana or otherwise contemplate on the ancestors who are blocked f=
rom higher realms of being, you may be leaving some thoughts related to the=
m and their weaknesses in that place. That is normally harmless, but a very=
 sensitive person sleeping there may be somewhat disturbed by it.
 
> 4.=C3=
=82 Lacking knowledge of sanskrit,=C3=82 chanting of shlokas from manual an=
d giving tarpan is becoming most of the time mechanical. I feel no devotion=
 there.=C3=82 Is it ok,=C3=82 if=C3=82 i pray in my mind=C3=82 =C3=82 in my=
 mother tongue=C3=82 to all devas, pitrus and rishis to accept my pitru tar=
pan and requesting them to not to be obstacles in my spiritual progress and=
 material progress?
 
Yes, it is ok. You did not know the procedure earlier=
, but now you know it. You do not know the meanings now, but you will know =
it later, when the time comes. Knowledge and ability to act on it come in s=
tages. Grab whatever comes to you..
 
> 5. My gotra is Kaudinya gotra? it c=
an not be seen=C3=82 in pitru manual? can u help me which rishi=C3=82 my go=
tra belong to?
 
The name of your gotra rishi then is Koundinya. :-)
 
The =
rishi tarpana section in the Pitri tarpana manual only includes the Saptars=
his. You can add your gotra rishis if you want. At the end of of "rishi tar=
pana", you can add "OM kauNDinyaH tR^ipyataaM".
 
*        *        *
 
Nam=
aste Sriram,
 
> Just one more query
> As per the manual, before offering i=
s made to Pitris, the Sesame seeds should be added to the pot. Now, the pot=
 already has akshats lying at the bottom, is it fine to add sesame seeds as=
 well to the same pit, or separate pot is to be used?
 
You can use the sam=
e pot/vessel/kalasham.
 
> Also, if the water has reduced in the pot after =
offerings to Devas and Rishis, is it OK to add more water to the pot (if sa=
me as asked in previous question) before start offering to Pitris?
 
Yes, y=
ou can add more water.
 
*        *        *
 
Namaste Bhupendra ji,
 
> At=
 the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in conclusion:

Good point. I will try to=
 record the MP3 audio.
