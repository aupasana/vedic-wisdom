take sankalpam that the benefits of the homam only reach the girl
if you be=
come kind and bless her in the homam then you may suffer by attracting her =
karmas
a yogi must have a heart made of stone

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] homam quest=
ion

   
I recently found out that a small 5 year old girl(friend of my dau=
ghters) has been very sick and is hospitalised. She might become bedridden =
for a long time or die. Her mother has been crying a lot ever since.The lea=
st I can do is perform homam for her. While mentally I will request god to =
help her but formally what changes need to be done in the homam manual so t=
hat my prayers get directed  towards her.Kindly suggest.

Thanks and regard=
s,
Prm
