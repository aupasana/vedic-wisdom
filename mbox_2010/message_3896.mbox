Dear All,
=C2=A0
Interesting chain of mails. Let me add s=
ome more comments.Sri Karunanidhi was also the person who asked, "Which eng=
ineering college did Rama pass out from?". That is horrible. I wonder if an=
yone in India has the guts to publicly come out and ask a similar kind of q=
uestion about religious figures of the Abrahamic religions. I find it also =
weird that people start a witch-hunt against Nityananda Swami for his sex s=
candal, but nothing of that sort happened when Sri Karunanidhi could public=
ly question the authenticity of the Ramayana and Rama as a God. 
=C2=A0
I p=
ersonally had no clue who Nityananda Swami was till yesterday when the news=
 broke. He maybe genuine, he may not be. But how are we to judge that? Just=
 because he is caught having a sexual relation with someone, he suddenly be=
comes untouchable? In that case what about another very famous 'saint' /'gu=
ru' in India, who is merely a product of calculated advertisements and inte=
lligent PR machinery, which makes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month =
his quotes on every damn subject on the planet (and very shallow quotes if =
you ask me), or news related to him appears in the largest selling english =
daily in India?=C2=A0That is another level of cheating, in my opinion. Why =
don't I see people trying to witch-hunt such 'sadhus'? Because Hindus are a=
 confused lot. 
=C2=A0
As Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for real Dh=
arma to come back. In which case=C2=A0I sincrely=C2=A0pray to Ma Chamunda t=
hat she throws down some more of these money-making, platitude-mouthing, 's=
adhus'/'gurus' from their lofty public pedestals. In this age we don't need=
 'bhagwans' and 'sadhus', we need sadhana. Let us do our own=C2=A0sadhana a=
nd inspire others to do sadhana and let us sincerely pray to Her to clean u=

dear sri ram kishore,
I would like to ad=
d a few corrections in regards to our Chief minister
karunanidhi. He doesnt=
 have communist ideology, he is a third rate
immoral character having 3 wiv=
es( first wife is no more) and he had
lot of concubines. Dayanidhi maran is=
 karunanidhi' s nephew and not
his brother. If u recollect when Sun TV and =
its family newspaper was
attacked during 2008by karunanidhi' s sun Alagiri(=
now union chemical
minister) three of the employees of the newspaper died i=
n that violent
attacks. All this happened because the newspaper reported th=
at
people will prefer Stalin(karunanidhi' s IInd son) rather than Alagiri.
=
This dayanidhi maran went on TV saying that perpetrators of this 
violence =
will be dealt with strongly as per law. Over a period of time
patch work wa=
s done between the two families and now the same
dayanidhi maran has withdr=
awn the cases filed against Alagiri and
quietly forgotten the loss of three=
 innocent employees lives.
Such people cannot talk abt morality. Karunanidh=
i has ammassed wealth
thro corrupt deals and he is one of the richest famil=
y which u may not
see in communist party. He hates brahmins and he is an an=
ti hindu.
=C2=A0
Coming to the sting operation the whole thing can be a far=
ce or doctored.
It is high time Sri Nityananda comes out and tells the trut=
h behind this
episode. As a human he can always denounce Brahmacharyam and =
get
into Grihasta life, but if such a desire is strong in his mind then he =
shud
announce and tell his followers that he is denouncing Brahmacharyam, b=
ut
yet he would be continuing his spiritual discourses and activity.
I only=
 wish this sting operation is a false and it shud be a lesson to all
these =
media people who seem to sway the minds of the people by
repeated broadcast=
 of such perverted material.
=C2=A0
regards,
k.gopu

Utpal ji and Rajarshi ji

Vimalananda sa=
ys in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva

"This is one of the many reasons I hate=
 communism .Communists are taught to forget their parents ,culture to denou=
nce them .If you destroy your parents and culture which is your root how do=
 you ever expect to prosper "

1.I agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are pol=
itically affliated entities with parties hell bent on atheism which wait fo=
r a chance to use any occassion to denigrate sanatana dharma. I do not wish=
 to deviate the discussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which bro=
ught out the clip is owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supr=
emo DMK which is a carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today's speech=
 he used the cover of this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.

The =
same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco w=
as ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased w=
as writing articles every day with so called details of misgivings at the a=
shram....Sense a pattern ...That is the media war of modern India controlle=
d by vested interests who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.A=
lso stakeholders in this drama are the missionary orgs.

2.In Nithyananda' =
s defense he never said he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn a=
way from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep i=
t physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not become a addic=
tion. 

He could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in a s=
exual ritual. 

Two of his gurus were an old woman and a female tantrik whi=
ch he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciousness and feminity.

=
3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very good way of explaining high=
er level truths.

What he did or did not do is only his karma alone .This d=
oes not take away anything from his lectures or messages.

and like Utpal j=
i rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse t=
o judge others...we better be prepared when the divine mother tests us.By j=
uding we will incurr a share of the karma others committed and also will be=
 judged quite harshly when our turn comes.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore

<DIV>dear sri ram kishor=
e,</DIV>
<DIV>I would like to add a few corrections in regards to our Chief=
 minister</DIV>
<DIV>karunanidhi. He doesnt have communist ideology, he is =
a third rate</DIV>
<DIV>immoral character having 3 wives( first wife is no =
more) and he had</DIV>
<DIV>lot of concubines. Dayanidhi maran is karunanid=
hi' s nephew and not</DIV>
<DIV>his brother. If u recollect when Sun TV and=
 its family newspaper was</DIV>
<DIV>attacked during 2008by karunanidhi' s =
sun Alagiri(now union chemical</DIV>
<DIV>minister) three of the employees =
of the newspaper died in that violent</DIV>
<DIV>attacks. All this happened=
 because the newspaper reported that</DIV>
<DIV>people will prefer Stalin(k=
arunanidhi' s IInd son) rather than Alagiri.</DIV>
<DIV>This dayanidhi mara=
n went on TV saying that perpetrators of this </DIV>
<DIV>violence will be =
dealt with strongly as per law. Over a period of time</DIV>
<DIV>patch work=
 was done between the two families and now the same</DIV>
<DIV>dayanidhi ma=
ran has withdrawn the cases filed against Alagiri and</DIV>
<DIV>quietly fo=
rgotten the loss of three innocent employees lives.</DIV>
<DIV>Such people =
cannot talk abt morality. Karunanidhi has ammassed wealth</DIV>
<DIV>thro c=
orrupt deals and he is one of the richest family which u may not</DIV>
<DIV=
>see in communist party. He hates brahmins and he is an anti hindu.</DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Coming to the sting operation the whole thing can be =
a farce or doctored.</DIV>
<DIV>It is high time Sri Nityananda comes out an=
d tells the truth behind this</DIV>
<DIV>episode. As a human he can always =
denounce Brahmacharyam and get</DIV>
<DIV>into Grihasta life, but if such a=
 desire is strong in his mind then he shud</DIV>
<DIV>announce and tell his=
 followers that he is denouncing Brahmacharyam, but</DIV>
<DIV>yet he would=
 be continuing his spiritual discourses and activity.</DIV>
<DIV>I only wis=
h this sting operation is a false and it shud be a lesson to all</DIV>
<DIV=
>these media people who seem to sway the minds of the people by</DIV>
<DIV>=
repeated broadcast of such perverted material.</DIV>
