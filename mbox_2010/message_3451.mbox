Narasimha Ji

I have just finished reading the third book " the law of karm=
a " by Aghori Vimalananda . It is no doubt as you said written by a great b=
eing . Vimalananda in his book mentions three karmas which cannot be easily=
 gotten rid of and are very terrible by nature and might take an immense am=
ount of lifetimes to even clear.

The two I remember are Killing of one's g=
uru and rape . 

Now the doubt that has arisen in my mind is this

1.How do=
 we know whether a thing that is happening now is an reaction to an past ac=
tion or a fresh action being set forth in this lifetime...

The learned gur=
ujan's on the board might question ..Is there really a use by knowing that =
since either way the action is taking place and cannot be stopped.

The rea=
son I ask this is  ...the mother goddess is described as

" Ati Soumyati Ro=
udrayai Nathastasyai namo namah "

She is the most pleasing among beautiful=
 things and the most ferocious among terrible things ...There is no relativ=
e scale of good or bad for nature ( Ramarkrishna's parable of Devi Kali bri=
nging up a child and killing it ) ....I fully understand good or bad exists=
 only in the human mind.

But if a certain act right now is not happening a=
s a reaction to a past act... What on earth can possibly cause a person to =
do such a severe act.  

:( And how should one console a person who has und=
ergone such a punishment....

One more reason for me asking this is ...A lo=
t of great gurus have always said " Whatever happening in the world right n=
ow is Mangala and the very form of Shiva himself "

How can I reconcile suc=
h acts of violence happening in this kali yuga as Mangala especially some o=
f the henious acts ....which brings back my original question...Are these h=
appening more in number in kali yuga as a reaction of the souls who needed =
this punishment being born in greater numbers now...or are these a fresh se=
t of acts.


I do not know whether my questions would make sense. If you co=
uld answer them would help me in clearing some confusion.
