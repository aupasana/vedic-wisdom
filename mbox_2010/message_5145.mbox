Namaste friends,

Essentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matters=
 in this discussion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one c=
an do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion o=
n translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some=
 unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:

1.	There are various sacred chants=
 embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacr=
ed chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. S=
ome stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras.  The Samhita p=
ortion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.
 
2.	Undoubtedly mantras=
 and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is n=
ot even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.

3.	W=
hilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition make=
s a distinction between them.
     
4.	As per the traditional view one does=
n't need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the =
same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, man=
tras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantr=
as from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need =
initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. What=
ever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integ=
ral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiatio=
n, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.
 
5.	Vishnusahasranama=
, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall u=
nder stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditi=
onally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger=
 status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without ini=
tiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the navarna =
or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.
           
6.=
	I know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as=
 well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of =
Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHO=
DASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadh=
ana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be initiated =
to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.
 
7.	Recapping my e=
arlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independent statu=
s by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yog=
asastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As =
a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. T=
hus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if =
one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the D=
evi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recomme=
nded in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navakshari  am=
ounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommen=
ded to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly under =
guidance.
 
8.	Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam i=
n the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mah=
avidya, it has an inherent problem in our times.  The problem with attempti=
ng to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation)=
 is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra=
 or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksh=
aras.
 
9.	I you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget=
 translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Nei=
ther have I attempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras =
do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is=
 recommended to know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sa=
dhana while chanting it. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak'=
, not a translation! 

10.	For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi p=
ath without initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has=
 to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path i=
tself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no=
 initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious no=
t to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is bet=
ter to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That =
attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will hap=
pen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassi=
onate Goddess.              

Hope the above pointers help in clearing any =
confusion.  

Regards,
Satya Prakash
