Dear KK,
 
Great questio=
n!
 
Also, I personally do not agree that a saint cannot interfere in the p=
olitical situation of a country. Dharma depends on the desh-kaal-patra. Swa=
mi Ramdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspired Shivaji Maharaj to fight against =
the Moghuls. Had it not been so, today Kashi would have remained Muhammadab=
ad and Mathura and Prayag would have become Mecca and Medina.
 
However at =
the same time I am sure there were probably other self-realized saints in I=
ndia who never bothered themselves with the political situation of the land=
. 
 
So everyone to his/her path. If you feel a strong urge for something, =
probably your swa-dharma crosses through those points.
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi=
