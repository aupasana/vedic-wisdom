Welcome to this forum. I would like to make a few brief po=
ints regarding some of your ideas as mentioned below.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I sugges=
t reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get a insight into=
 the importance of these steps.

Pardon me for being rude, but Frits =
Staals understanding of the vedic=C2=A0ritual is naive at best and criminal=
ly incorrect at worst. He had written a huge, lengthy article on why and ho=
w mantras are nothing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancie=
nt people, and they are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A perso=
n with such a shallow understanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dh=
arma, cannot be expected to=C2=A0recognize=C2=A0the spiritual essence=C2=A0=
and depth of "Agni". Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of ritual=
s/history/or even dharma, but probably a testimony of the various spiritual=
 realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical =
verses. A

Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During his last=
 days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the interpret=
ation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his opinion,=
 not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas really a=
re. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses and in futu=
re, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a more holistic and deeper in=
terpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence that Sri A=
urobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed him on c=
ertain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up with a=

sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=A0etc etc,the sadhana =
is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0It is not the number of =

rienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations. What =
use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whateve=
r helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this l=
ight, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas=
, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to
 transform an individual. Many ha=
ve experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0future. And all this ha=
s been possible only because the Divine Mother wants it so.

Dear Members,

=
At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum=
. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwrit=
ings on "efficacy of remedies". I humbly agree that jHora is not the right =
forum for discussing these topics.

I have gone through the homam manual pr=
ovided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have=
 the following observations to make.

1. As per rules laid out by srouta an=
d gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yaj=
na (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakr=
uti of all yajnas).

2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the=
 homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to b=
e there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not esse=
ntial. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.

3. Th=
ere are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba =
sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.

4. The ord=
inary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divin=
e usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only i=
t becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "fire ritual" as named=
. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get a in=
sight into the importance of these steps.

5. The procedure in the manual i=
s not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omis=
sions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. 

6. In parista=
rana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in =
which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prc=
eeding ones.

7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) wi=
th the mantra "deva savita prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner t=
o NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in=
 a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaant=
am).

8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel =
above darbha is missing.

9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purific=
ation of the utensils is missing.

10. Patra samskaram or purifying the ute=
nsils is missing.

11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, var=
una poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.=


12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.

13. Ajya sam=
skaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya u=
sed for havan is missing.

14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles u=
sed in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).
=

15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.

16. Idhma pradanam =
or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.

17. It i=
s seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multip=
le ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given i=
n each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.

and many more ........=
....

18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoke=
d into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the =
other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in sat=
va tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deit=
y is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)

18. In the tantrik =
procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as =
the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity =
(agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.

19. Very =
good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Ma=
ntra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don't involve veda man=
tras so that you don't have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and =
svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam=
 on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.
=

20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can b=
e learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice=
 with devotion, precision and perfection.

21. I suggest that we preserve e=
ach branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield goo=
d results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.
