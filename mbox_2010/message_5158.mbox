Namaste Narasimha garu,

Both of=
 us share a similar approach here. As I already wrote in an earlier post, "=
there will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid tradi=
tional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme based on one'=
s personal affiliations, family and cultural influences".   Neither of us i=
s at the liberal/casual extreme nor the very rigid traditional extreme. Bot=
h of us seem to be somewhere in the middle though at different points.

Excellent point. Here I will share s=
omething from my own experience to illustrate this. Initially I was hesitan=
t to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help put things in=
 a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana single-mindedly =
as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those days I used =
to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some of my co-s=
adhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks later. Swadhya=
ya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay of my sadhan=
a at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period I started =
doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. Things were =
fine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of many facto=
rs. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana, I decided =
to return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my mother's wi=
sh. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medical studies =
too.

Around early 95, I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana with *more* v=
igour. Within a month I started having piercing headaches, my body would be=
 quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would shoot up to around 150/110 =
on and off. After conducting the standard investigations, Dr. Rao from the =
Dept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking to me, suspected that it *=
might* have something to do with my sadhanas too. Things continued to be th=
e same for some more months, till I got introduced to Swami Sachchidananda =
in what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the course of conversation Sw=
amiji asked me to meet him alone the next day after coming to know about my=
 practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After interacting everyday for a w=
eek Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Chandi path.  After a week o=
r so after the initiation all the symptoms subsided. The blood pressure, jw=
ara and headaches, all normalized. It has been around 15 years since then a=
nd none of the symptoms have recurred. What's more, I had some very powerfu=
l internal experiences in quick succession during the following week itself=
 after initiation. This is my experience.
                                 =


>>>(6) If one is not looking for any specific results and doing a >>>mant=
ra just for spiritual progress with a >>>sense of surrender, one is safe.>>=
>>


Right from the start whatever sadhanas I did, were all done largely as=
 a spiritual pursuit only with no specific results in mind at least conscio=
usly. However the general desire to make progress would have naturally been=
 there.


>>> (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga=

Though I was not consciously thinking of raising Kundal=
ni or anything like that and was just focusing on sadhana, you are right ab=
out the raja yoga/hatha yoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a regular part of my=
 sadhana during 89-92. In fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this =
time. However Devi Mahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yoga=
bhyasa since early 91-92 during which time things were fine. It was only in=
 94 that I resumed Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. Of course I was d=
oing my yogabhyasa too at this time. I have already written about the rest.=
  

My stance regarding the role of initiation stems from my own experience=
 as well as the instructions coming down through the guru parampara. Howeve=
r I can appreciate your stance as well. Let me add something more here. No =
two individuals have the same experience in such matters. Some may experien=
ce nothing significant after initiation and may still be progressing. Some =
may need more guidance due to the nature of the specific practices that the=
y have got into. Eitherways She will take care.  



>>>>> Given this state=
ment, the difference of opinion between us are very subtle.>>>>


It is bet=
ter for all of us to focus more on the underlying unity of our thought and =
not on the difference. Moreover overstretching such discussions can deter s=
ome sadhakas which is not something that anyone of us would wish for.

I agree that there are many good sadhakas doi=
ng Sri Sri Chandipath without initiation. There is no need for anyone to fe=
el guilty. It is only good samskaras and vasanas that attract a sadhaka to =
Sri Sri Chandi. One does not need to feel guilty for worshipping or loving =
the Goddess.  If you take my own example, initially I did the sadhana witho=
ut initiation. It is only Her Grace that I was initiated. I didn't even ask=
 for it. If it is meant to be it will be. Things will happen on their own a=
ccord in the natural flow. The main thing is that the sadhaka should leave =
the rest to the compassionate Goddess and trust that She will take care of =
everything.                   

On this note I suggest that we should wrap =
up the topic of initiation. From my side I wish to say nothing more. 

I mi=
ght be off the list till another fortnight or so as I am travelling.

All Glories to the Goddess!!!

Satya Prakash

 Even if one were initiated, it would be quite difficult to not leave thing=

a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras co=

tion. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not t=
he same as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally re=
ferred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the ac=
tual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct s=

ch as Kali or Sri.

 Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY a=

of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is not recommended=
 especially when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as=
 an integral part of the chanting.

 to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatm=

initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.
