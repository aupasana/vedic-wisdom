Namaste Narasimha,

[

ooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva, then one is aware of
duality and

l Self at the same time.

]

First time hearing this concept! a fresh idea =
to explain very high state
of few souls who are aware of Duality and absolu=
te at the same time.

Shiva comming back with Shakti to Muladahara!

Best R=
egards,

Utpal

PS: You didnt answer my query about parallel lines.

in it for a long time and happens to co=

then one may become like Shiva and work wi=
th Shakti with zero attachment
and perfect mastery. One is aware of the ent=

spaces and times - and yet unattached to anythin=

perceives the underlying non-dual Self even as sense=

places in the subtle body (=
there are thousands of nadis and chakras!),
one is aware of various realiti=

when Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.
>
> When Kundalin=
i reaches sahasrara, one's self-awareness is with Shiva.
Shakti loses herse=
lf to Shiva and there is no objectification that is
the hallmark of Shakti.=
 If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower
chakra, one's self-awarenes=
s is again deluded by duality. However, if
shakti comes back from sahasrara=
 to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva,
then one is aware of duality and non=
-dual Self at the same time. One
lives as a liberated sage, using the body =
as an instrument to fulfil the
will of Nature (since there is no longer any=
 individual will).

i,<BR>> <BR>> There are different types of samadhi. Samadhi literally=
 means concentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is v=
ibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi, most =
of these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high degree of =
focus.<BR>> <BR>> The focus can be on a physical object perceived thr=
ough senses (e.g. an idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle ob=
ject perceived by the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of=
 a mantra). The focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of pe=
rceiving the object or on the perceiver (all the three exist within one's c=
onsciousness as three different things). One's self-awareness can identify =
with one object and focus its attention on another object ("I am Rajarshi w=
ith so and so qualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so and so qualities=
"). Or, one's self-awareness can identify with that object ("I am Bhairava =
with so and so qualities"). Please note that all these samadhis are within =
the field of duality. There is still a sense of "this is I" and "this is th=
e rest", i.e. there is differentiation.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>=
> The next state is what most people refer to as samadhi. This is a stat=
e where mind is absorbed in non-dual Self, i.e. without any differentiation=
. When there are no notions of "this is I" and "this is the rest", there ar=
e no thoughts, no opposites and there is only Sat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of=
 just being).<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Now, let me come to w=
hat Vimalananda says!<BR>> <BR>> The non-dual Self is Shiva (or Purus=
ha or Narayana). The field of duality is Shakti (or Prakriti or Narayani). =
Though one may normally think that Shiva and Shakti are different, are they=
 really different?!<BR>> <BR>> Because of our notion that Shiva and S=
hakti are different, we can either be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time b=
ut not with both at the same time. A yogi who has objectification and the s=
ense of "this is I" and "this is the rest" is in the domain of Shakti. When=
 one overcomes objectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the =
domain of Shiva. When one leaves that state and one's egosense ("this is I"=
 and "this is the rest") returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and =
re-enter the field of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality again! =
That is what Vimalananda is saying.<BR>> <BR>> If one can be with Shi=
va *and* Shakti at the *same time*, then one is then not enamored or delude=
d by any aspect of Shakti. When a small aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes on=
e ("this is I", "that is beautiful", "that is ugly", "I like that" etc), on=
e is unable to perceive the entire field of Shakti. This is just like a per=
son tied to a rock in the ocean not being able to swim the entire ocean. Wh=
en one is not bound by any object in the field of Shakti and not attracted =
or repelled by anything, then one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all s=
pace-time combinations. This is possible only if one has perfect mastery ov=
er Shakti. That comes only when one has zero attachment to anything in the =
field of Shakti. That comes only when one is with Shiva enough and eventual=
ly becomes like Shiva. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays in it for =
a long time and happens to come back to the field of duality, then one may =
become like Shiva and work with Shakti with zero attachment and perfect mas=
tery. One is aware of the entire field of duality - all spaces and times - =
and yet unattached to anything. That is because one perceives the underlyin=
g non-dual Self even as senses perceive various objects of duality.<BR>>=
 <BR>> For most people, this is out of bounds. One either experiences no=
n-dual samadhi for a short duration and cannot sustain it longer and comes =
back to be deluded by duality again, or one stays in non-dual samadhi for a=
 long time and does not come back (like a salt doll that goes to survey the=
 depth of ocean melting in the ocean, to borrow words from Ramakrishna Para=
mahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Sai Baba, who spent en=
ough time in non-dual samadhi and yet came back to live in the world, are s=
o rare in this age.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Let me put this=
 in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in moolaadhaara, our self-awa=
reness identifies with the physical body and is aware of the physical world=
 around us. As Kundalini goes to various places in the subtle body (there a=
re thousands of nadis and chakras!), one is aware of various realities that=
 are out there in this universe. For example, one world (realm of awareness=
) may be reverberating with the sound of a particular beejaakshara and fill=
ed with a particular light and every being in that world may be a small par=
ticle in that light reverberating with that sound. Like that, there are man=
y worlds out there (within us) and one can enter a samadhi through any of t=
hem, when Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.<BR>> <BR>> When Ku=
ndalini reaches sahasrara, one's self-awareness is with Shiva. Shakti loses=
 herself to Shiva and there is no objectification that is the hallmark of S=
hakti. If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower chakra, one's self-aw=
areness is again deluded by duality. However, if shakti comes back from sah=
asrara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva, then one is aware of duality a=
nd non-dual Self at the same time. One lives as a liberated sage, using the=
 body as an instrument to fulfil the will of Nature (since there is no long=
er any individual will).<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<B=
