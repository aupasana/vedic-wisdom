Ok. Folks, I have been reading too many things about food. 

First science =
is only knowing so much and it is not even completely aware of the body. he=
nce based on science if you are trying to say right or wrong about this sub=
ject, it is not correct. I have been reading too many artical and research =
on this topics goes according to who ever is paying for the research hence =
it has political motive.

As far as Shastra is concern, and as far as I hav=
e understood this concept, restriction on food is like guard around bush. w=
hen bush grown to tree, it does not need guard around it. when your senses =
does not want to eat,smell,drink,look,hear etc sensual pleasure stuff then =
any food is good. Otherwise "Satvik" food is going to help controling your =
senses better then tamsik food. food is source of your nature. nature chang=
es with food intact. this is the Bhagavad Puran not me.
