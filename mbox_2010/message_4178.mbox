 One day, two destitute-looking brahmins entered the Hall. It was known tha=
t
they earned their livelihood by the wretched and socially demeaning
occup=
ation of bearing the dead to the cremation grounds.Both were extremely
hung=
ry after having discharged their duties.

Custom demands that anyone enteri=
ng a house recently visited by death,
should take a bath immediately upon l=
eaving. This stricture applies
particularly if one steps into the cremation=
 ground, and more particularly
if one is involved in removing and physicall=
y transporting the departed to
this place.

A heated argument had ensued be=
tween the two men about the propriety of
coming to the Asramam to have a me=
al without having bathed. While one of
them keenly felt the unseemliness of=
 transgressing this hallowed custom, the
other dismissed it at impracticabl=
e in ivew of their acute hunger. Assured
of a meal in the Asramam, which wa=
s on their way home, they thought they
might appease their appetite. They c=
ame to the Hall and sat down.

One of them excitedly and abruptly said to B=
hagavan:

"Swami! I have been insisting on the customary bath before we sit=
 for our
meal. Is that not but just and proper?"

Bhagavan responded in a v=
ery soft tone: "No one can say you are unjust."

The other one in a greatly=
 agitated voice, burst forth:

"The pangs of hunger are so intense that our=
 entrails are being devoured. Is
it wrong to eat when hunger is so gnawing?=
"

Bhagavan Ramana quietly replied: "Who says it is wrong? Not at all."

Sh=
ocked, looking at one another, they asked in one voice: "Who then is
wrong?=
"

Bhagavan answered:

"Don't think you alone are pall-bearers. All of us a=
re carrying these
lifeles corpse. This body is a veritable corpse. Everybod=
y carries it
saying, 'I', 'I'. Whoever has the 'I-am-the-body' feeling, is =
but a
pall-bearer. As long as one has not gone beyond this, one remains as =
impure
and polluted as a poll-bearer. The pollution of bearing this dead bo=
dy
cannot be washed away by dip in any tank. Bathing in the waters of Atman=

alone can remove this pollution."

The Brahmins though initially feeling v=
indicated, were now startled and
stared at each other. In an instant, the e=
ntire complexion of the issue
stood transformed. Everyone without exception=
 was equally polluted. All
people shared their fate!
