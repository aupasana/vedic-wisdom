Ahh, so that is where you found me :- )  I was just a day visitor and
will=
 be pulling out of there later today. Don't think that you will
find the fo=
lks that you are looking for there. How many do you think
that you will fin=
d anywhere? I have found fourteen living ones in
seventy years. But of cour=
se one does not have access to six billion of
them, so who knows. But I kno=
w well enough that some are out there. That
is the great advantage of writi=
ng about it and putting it on-line free
=96 you don't have to look for them=
 any more, they find you.



I advertised your video's on a couple of group=
s, but really I am
done with groups work now, did it for twelve years on ab=
out 400 of them;
and enough is enough. I might get back to the novel which =
I started in
1977 :- )



As for me, well I do not know where I really belo=
ng in time and space;
not here and that is for sure :- ) But I am not compl=
aining and I had a
lot of fun even though it was like travelling back into =
the dark ages :-
) I did at least land in a most beautiful place.  I love i=
t, every blade
of grass and trickle of stream water.  I had the gut feeling=
 that I had
known it before when I first saw it.  Ahh, the things we get st=
uck with
eh.  Anyway, I wish you all the success with your experiment. I ho=
pe
somebody can wake them up in large numbers =96 it ain't easy :- )
but it=
 sure is needed here.  But keep me informed, it sounds
fascinating.

Dick.
