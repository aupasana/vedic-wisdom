 Kandaswami was the devotee who single handedly raised an Asramam for Sri
B=
hagavan on the south-eastern slopes of Arunachala. In gratitude for
Kandasw=
ami=E2=80=99s labours Sri Bhagavan named the Asramam after him as
Skandasra=
mam. Sri Bhagavan stayed here from 1916 to 1922 before moving
permanently t=
o the present Ramanasramam at the foot hills of Arunachala.

At Virupaksha =
cave besides Pazhaniswami, others like Perumalswami and
Kandaswami began to=
 attach themselves permanently to the Sri Bhagavan and to
live with Him. =
=E2=80=98Share and share alike=E2=80=99 was always Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s m=
otto; and
food had to be found for all of them. Since they could not feel s=
ure of
feeding all the visitors,Pazhaniswami and other dependants would sta=
rt from
the Hill and go to the town to beg food. They used to go about begg=
ing in
the streets for food and bring it up the Hill and everyone used to s=
hare it.
Sometimes there used to be just rice,sometimes a mixture of everyt=
hing from
sweetmeats to savouries, but the Swami used to make it so tasty t=
hat
whatever they got, they used to be extremely satisfied with. Perumalswa=
mi
and Kandaswami used to blow in concert on the conch.When leaving thus th=
ey
would blow a long blast on their conches. This was an announcement to th=
e
townspeople that Swami=E2=80=99s party had left the cave on their begging=
 mission.
They would give another blast when they reached the foot of the H=
ill, a
third call would be sounded at the entrance to the street. All the r=
esidents
of the street would be ready with their offerings and the party wo=
uld march
along the street singing Siva namavalis and collecting the offeri=
ngs. This
would suffice to feed the Swami, his attendants, visitors and all=
 the
monkeys, both day and night.

Kandaswami was anxious to build a separa=
te Asramam for Bhagavan. The number
of visitors had also begun to increase.=
 There was no water facility near the
cave at that time. There was not enou=
gh room to cook or for people to stay.
Some of the visitors were ladies and=
 Virupaksha was too small to accommodate
all of them, hence Kandaswami=E2=
=80=99s decision to build a new Asramam.In fact, as
Bhagavan had mentioned =
in his deposition to the commission, the work on
Skandasramam began as earl=
y as 1902.Kandaswami inspected various places on
the Hill and in the forest=
s to select a site.

To the west of Virupaksha Cave, there is a black rock.=
 Once when Bhagavan
went towards the rock,he saw some water oozing from und=
er the rock.Bhagavan
showed the moist area to Jadaswami and said there migh=
t be a spring there.
Jadaswami had the place dug, and out came pure, sweet =
water. Whenever
Bhagavan went there, he used to collect the pure water in h=
is Kamandala for
use later. Kandaswami finally suggested this site for the =
new Asramam and
with Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s approval he began work on the n=
ew Asramam single
handedly.

Kandaswami began converting what was a thick f=
orest of prickly pear on the
Mountain slope. He removed the stones around t=
he spring and cut down the
thorny shrubs and leveled the ground.The result =
of his labour & great
self-sacrifice,unaided by any at the time, is the Ska=
ndasramam we see now.
Regarding this Sri Bhagavan has said,

=E2=80=9CYou c=
annot imagine the state the site was in originally. Kandaswami worked
with =
almost superhuman effort, achieved by his own hands what even four
people t=
ogether could not have done. He removed all the prickly pear,
reduced stone=
 and boulder to level ground created a garden and raised the
Asramam. We go=
t four coconut trees for planting. To plant them properly
Kandaswami dug hu=
ge square pits about ten feet deep. That would give you an
idea of the amou=
nt of labour he put into the work he took on hand. He was a
strong, well-bu=
ilt man.=E2=80=9D He put up a structure and planted mango, jackfruit,
cocon=
ut trees and some plants in front of it. Since that Asramam was
constructed=
 in a spirit of service to Ramana, in a quiet manner and without
any self a=
dvertisement, it came to be called Skandasramam in memory of his
name.

Lat=
er, with the help of Perumalswami, he completed the present brick
building =
and requested Sri Bhagavan to come and stay there. Sri Bhagavan
stayed at S=
kandasramam from 1916 to 1922.Kandaswami spent some time with Sri
Bhagavan =
and later returned to his birth place. Kandaswami never returned to
Tiruvan=
namalai. There was no further news of him.

Once, in later years after movi=
ng down to live in Ramanasramam, Bhagavan
showed devotees a group photo in =
which Kandaswami,
Perumalswami,Pazhaniswami, Sivaprakasam Pillai, Narayana =
Reddi,Iswara Swami,
etc., are sitting with Sri Bhagavan.The photo was taken=
 on a rock behind
Virupaksha Cave. He then added, =E2=80=9CKandaswami looks=
 like a weak and lean man
in this photo. That is because he went away from =
us for more than a month
and was doing tapas at Ezhu Sunai (Seven Springs) =
and was purposely
underfeeding himself. Before that,he was a muscular, well=
-built man.

Kandaswami=E2=80=99s humble offering to Sri Bhagavan,Skandasra=
mam is still looked
after by Ramanasramam and is a place of pilgrimage for =
the devotees of Sri
Bhagavan.
