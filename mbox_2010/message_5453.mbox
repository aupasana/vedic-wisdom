Scene:- 
Cheer harana(pulling of vastra)of Draupadi in the court of Dhitara=
shtra.

ryodhan and Soota putra for Karna during her svayamvar.

"Court of dead people"after everything was over and Bhim took an oath to dr=
ink  blood of Dushasana seeing Draupadi crying on the floor.
Kripacharya,Bh=
ishma,Draun etc were present why none of them stopped Maharaj Yudhishthir w=
hen he put her into gamble?All of them felt shy afterwards but as per Dharm=
a somebudy should have atleast stopped Yudhishthir before he did this stupi=
d mistake.I know that it was like a famous line in Hindi"Meine aapka Namak =
Khaya hai Duryodhan"like but atleast people listed above could have stopped=
 this sad episode when they were given such a high place in the court of Dh=
itarashtra/Mahabharata.

Q: What is hell?
A: Paravashta aka being in anoth=
