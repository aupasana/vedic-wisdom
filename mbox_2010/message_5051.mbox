Dear friends,

I came across few friends who chant Vishnu & Lalita Sahasran=
amas during early morning. Large number of people also believe that only Su=
prabhatams should be chanted in the morning and all Sahasranamas have to be=
 done in the evenings. Which one is correct? 

Learned members, I request y=
ou to enlighten me on this.

Love to all,
Rajmohan
