To Whom It May Concern;

Recently, I become aware that Your company, Conve=
rse is selling sports shoes
with colorful images of Hindu deities which sho=
uld be regarded as sacred and
treated as such on the outside of them.



Th=
ese pictures you may call as =91Hindu deities=92. However, for us they are =
forms
and most sacred representations of the Ultimate Truth, The absolute i=
deals
through which we call parabrHMam as =91God=92. They are the object of=
 worship by millions
of people whom you may call =91Hindus=92.  We look upo=
n these deities as the
Ultimate TRUTH, the Absolute one, in your words the =
=93God=94 Himself.



Thus, we view this latest episode of selling shoes wi=
th these pictures as a
blatant denigration of oldest living Spirituality fr=
om which all the religions originated.
Therefore, I like to point out to yo=
u that your actions are very insulting to all
=93Hindus=94 and =93Hinduism=
=94. It is extremely hurting the pace loving people, the
so-called Hindus a=
ll over the world.



It is puzzling to us how a reputed company like Conve=
rse can be so
irresponsible and childish to put such pictures on the shoes.=
 If you are very
much interested in doing so, i.e., putting pictures why do=
 not you put a
picture of Christ or Mohammad on the shoes and see what happ=
ens? I am sure you
will not put a picture of the Cross or Jesus Christ or V=
irgin Mary or Mohammed
on any of your product, especially on shoes.



Your=
 intention may not have been to hurt us, but that is what you did. You hurt=

sentiments of a large part of the citizens of this world who are very peac=
e
loving. Your company=92s actions victimized the adherents of the oldest
S=
pirituality of the world. It might have been an oversight and perhaps a cas=
e
of an overenthusiastic marketing department. 



Therefore, on behalf of =
the Billion-plus people of the world, I request you to
do the following: 

=
(1) immediately stop the sale of these shoes all over the world.

(2) Destr=
oy the manufactured shoes 

(3) Stop future production of shoes of this nat=
ure.

(4)Train your employees in cultural sensitivity training program and =
let them
understand the importance of respecting sentiments of other cultur=
es. 

(5) Issue and Publish a statement of apology. Last but not least,

(6=
) Teach the basics of the oldest living Spirituality to
at least the top ma=
nagement of your company. I am willing to come and teach
them that.

 

I a=
m confident that Converse management will address this
matter with utmost u=
rgency.  I look forward to further word from you. 

  
Sincerely,


Rajyala=
xmi
