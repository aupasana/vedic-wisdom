In addition to that

How do we ensure that the start we have taken in this =
birth(doing homam,japam 
etc) is utilized in next birth ( if we have to tak=
e next birth) and continue 
with the same activities

tion about spiritual progress...

  
Namaskaram Narsimhagaru,

You had ment=
ioned that for some...after doing homam karmic cleansing can be 
months, fo=
r some years and for some lifetime. So obviously a person who 
undergoes ka=
rmic cleansing for lifetime doesn't get much spiritual progress. 
Does it m=
ean that person also doesn't attain salvation or merge with God in this 
bi=
rth? Will he have to take rebirth to finish the leftover job? 

Many thanks=
 for helping me come so far..
Best Regards,
Priya
