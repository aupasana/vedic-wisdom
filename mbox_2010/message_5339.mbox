Dear Rajarshi,


"Don't believe what I am saying. Academic science does not=
 ask  anyone to 
believe anything. It only says read the evidence with a cl=
ear  mind."

Thanks for your e-mail on this thread, it spurred me to read (=
again) about BV of 
food sources. Nothing I have read so far backs up what =
you state:
 "  fish is the easiest to digest for huamans, and red meat and =
roots like  
carrots are the most difficult...."

Here is a nice write up o=
n BV

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_value

More specifically, BV =
talks about protein assimilation exclusively and there are 
quite a few fla=
ws even estimating that. Here is a nice journal article (it is 
referenced =
in the wikipedia article mentioned above

^ Hoffman, Jay R.; Falvo, Michael=
 J. (2004). "Protein =E2=80=93 Which is Best". Journal 
of Sports Science a=
nd Medicine 3 (3): 118=E2=80=9330. 
http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf=
.pdf.

Here are the key points from the article

=E2=80=A2 Higher protein n=
eeds are seen in athletic
populations.
=E2=80=A2 Animal proteins is an impo=
rtant source of
protein, however potential health concerns do
exist from a =
diet of protein consumed from
primarily animal sources.
=E2=80=A2 With a pr=
oper combination of sources,
vegetable proteins may provide similar benefit=
s
as protein from animal sources.
=E2=80=A2 Casein protein supplementation =
may provide
the greatest benefit for increases in protein
synthesis for a p=
rolonged duration.

For the vast majority of the population living a fairly=
 active lifestyle and 
access to sufficient vegetarian food, adequate prote=
in intake is not an issue at 
all. 


regards,
Chandraprakash

Namaste=
 Girish ji,
 
Some slight clarification from my side.
 
Now this "x-y" meat=
 consumed should be compared to what is actually absorbed by 
the human bod=
y. I think it is generally known that animal protein is absorbed at 
a lowe=
r rate than plant protein.
 
Yes, that is exactly what is called the Biolog=
ical Value in Clinical Nutrition, 
which means, the amount of assimilative =
capacity of the human body for x or y 
food. Therefore all journals of clin=
ical nutrition and ditetics carry a BV 
chart, showing what is the ease wit=
h which body assimilates different food.
 
 
It is a myth that vegeterian f=
ood is easily assimilable by the human body. 
 
On the contrary, fish is th=
e easiest to digest for huamans, and red meat 
and roots like carrots are t=
he most difficult, considered to be negative 
calorie. Rest, all other vege=
tables and chicken comes inbetween fish and red 
meat. If you so desire, I =
can paste a BV chart too. Science is very clear about 
this.
 
Don't believ=
e what I am saying. Academic science does not ask anyone to believe 
anythi=
ng. It only says read the evidence with a clear mind.
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi

With deepest respect I beg to differ from Dr. Bhatla abo=
ut the "cheapness" of 
protein derived from Animals. 


We have to take int=
o consideration that animals consume "x" quantity of veg food 
and convert =
it to "x-y" meat (y will be due to metabolism - 100% conversion or 
more th=
an 100% conversion is impossible).

Now this "x-y" meat consumed should be =
compared to what is actually absorbed by 
the human body. I think it is gen=
erally known that animal protein is absorbed at 
a lower rate than plant pr=
otein.

Without taking into consideration the entire food chain (and taking=
 an end to 
end view) there will be fallacies.

Again with sincere respect.=
