Namaste Rajmohansrinivas ji,

All three points you mentioned are incor=
rect, and have no scientific basis. 
Kindly remain a vegetarian, but do not=
 believe in fake 'science'. 


Namaste Sararaju ji,

Since you=C2=A0seemed =

=C2=A0
This is wrong. Human body is naturally suited for an om=
nivorous diet. Just like 
people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do n=
ot eat raw vegetables as well. 
Cooking is a later addition to human societ=
y. 


If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at =
REAL 
research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scientific p=
apers in 
clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, yo=
u would find 
ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums=
 have relied on an 
omnivorous diet:-

a) Human ancestral diets changed sub=
stantially approximately four to five 
million years ago with major climati=
c changes creating open grassland 
environments. 


b) Humans developed a l=
arger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler 
gastrointestinal tract=C2=A0 re=
quiring=C2=A0foods based around meat protein and fat. For 
example since th=
e time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million 
years ago,=
 brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for 
long-chain =
polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a 
corresponding i=
ncrease in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a 
diet tha=
t is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain 
would =
not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for 
die=
t comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. 


c) The gut morphology of th=
e human body as it stand todays is ideally 
equidistant from that of carniv=
ores as well as herbivores. That is because 
humans are designed to be omni=
vores. The lack of a well developed caecum and 
rumen, unlike herbivores, m=
akes it difficult for the body to absorve plant 
cellulose into usable ener=
gy, which is why, a=C2=A0major part of the leafy vegetable 
based diet even=
tually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining 
of human=
s do not contain=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids which is present in a typic=
al 
carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C2=A0=
 the natural 
process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may fur=
ther interest you 
to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually i=
dentical to, guess what, 
rats who also are omnivores.

d) It may shock man=
y a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C2=A0research into 
clinical nutri=
tion very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human 
body for=
=C2=A0w.r.t different foods=C2=A0is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for =
fish, 
and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered =
negative 
calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories i=
n absorving it 
than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet =
to digest. You can 
look up actual BV (biological value)=C2=A0charts for mo=
re details.

All this is science. Real science. If you are interested, plea=
se do study actual 
scientific papers with an objective mind, but do not pa=
ss judgements based on 
lack of study or motivated=C2=A0hearsay.

Dear Rajmohanji,

Saatwic foods naturally creating good moral habit=

Human body is naturally suitable for vegitable foods.=C2=

For example=C2=A0I can=C2=A0take =C2=A0an apple simp=

ecause of cooking and adding flavour is=C2=A0it. 


whether pava or punya i=

Mo=

=C2=A0Its only illusion to create non-veg will give more strength =
