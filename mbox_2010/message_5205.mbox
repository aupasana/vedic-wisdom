namaste,

There is something radically wrong and unnatural that the wheel a=
nd circular objects are the indications of very advanced (evolved beings).
=

It is absolute trash that people, educated people and mammals fed on mothe=
r's milk or for that matter even from a bottle can consider this at all. Th=
e greater sign of evolution is invention of the square.

Many have seen and=
 seen a lot in the artefacts of Harappa. There are bulls, heifers, oxen, ho=
rns, fish, crabs, ligatured animals - What is significantly missing is the =
cow!! And for that matter female signs are very very few. WHY?

Is this a c=
ase of male dominance and gender discrimination. Yes it is. Why, I think th=
at is and was the pattern in vaidik study - meaning sanskrit study. I think=
 the seals are convoction degree certificates and the finds are from ancien=
t university sites. In which was taught science, pure and applied science a=
nd technology.

Given the security and hardship reasons of those days it sh=
ould be understandable of the relative rarity of the females in vaidika cer=
emony and yaj~ja. However it was amply made up in day day to day lives and =
out side the university / ashrams in temples and families.

There is a figu=
re with three horns - those that do not know sanskrit can never guess what =
it is - Agni (fire) is atrributed the name trishru~gga.
