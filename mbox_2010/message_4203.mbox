Dear Bishwajit,
=C2=A0
I feel, just keep doing Mahaganapti homam with black=
 and white til for a few months. These two ingredients help to remove karma=
 phal, slowly but surely. 
=C2=A0
Most things in life are a balance of karm=
ic reactions and free will. Generally, things which are negative or unpleas=
ent are karmic reactions. Untill the karmas are over, the suffering does no=
t end. There is=C2=A0only one way in which you can clear karmas.=C2=A0That =
is doing sadhana - like you are doing. As you keep doing homas, your karmas=
 slowly burnt out. And using black til and white til are the best things I =
feel. Also, if you can, it is a good idea to burn a whole fruit in purnahut=
i, maybe a small banana. This takes time and quite abit of ghee. You can tr=
y this once a week or once in 14 days or once a month, as per your convenie=
nce.=C2=A0Otherwise keep doing your regular homas. This is the best way to =
finish off karmas. And have patience!
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

NAMASKAR

Thanks Vijay,

There is =
no question of destroying her(wife) but to destroy her mental illness...I a=
m seeking mental peace, peace of my family but not the material benefit...
=

Another thing, I am suspecting that some black tantric/magic may be applie=
d to harm my family, marital peace. How could I omit those harmful effects?=
 Is the swattik gonapati homam are sufficient to counter those black magic?=
 Though I know the word "counter" is not appropriate, all of we are childre=
n of our supreme god, so he/she will take care of his/her children as decid=
ed by him/her...we can only to beg to live with our desired way in our vers=
ion...

gurujis please reply...
Biswajit

NB: I am performing the ganapati =
homam with not a single pray of material benefits as guided by Narasimha...=
 If needed to pray for well beings of mine, without harming others, please =
suggest...
