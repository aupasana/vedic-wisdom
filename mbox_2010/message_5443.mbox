How can we decide to not perform a certain karma when all of us are b=

Most of the time we only realize a wrong act onc=

Namaste,

If one's sense of dharma tells one that on=
e has a responsibility towards a person and the person is following a wrong=
 path, then one may have to do what is in one's hands to change the situati=
on. If talking to the person has a chance of helping, one can try that. Som=
etimes, it may be counter-productive. If so, one can just wait till the per=
son runs through that phase. When (if) the phase is over and the person is =
ready to disentangle, one can help.

One of Rammakrishna Paramahamsa's high=
ly learned disciples, Swami Abhedananda, was interested in Raja yoga and ho=
t pursuit of Kundalini rise through physical activity such as breathing. He=
 heard about a guru with some siddhis and went to him once, though Ramakris=
hna Paramahamsa had explicitly told him to stay away from such people. The =
guru lived on a mountain with disciples and disciples could not leave him o=
nce accepted into his fold. Swami Abhedananda accepted the conditions, join=
ed them, spent some time with them, realized his folly and the wisdom of Ra=
makrishna's words. He decided to escape. He was found out and the other dis=
ciples of that guru kept pelting stones at Swami Abhedananda as he was clim=
bing down the hill. Of course, he made it down, came back to Dakshineshwar =
and fell at Ramakrishna's feet. When even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could not=
 stop a disciple from having to go through an experience with a wrong guru,=
 what can people like us do?
 Karma is powerful and some rinas cannot be av=
oided. The only way to avoid the results of certain karmas is to not perfor=
m them in the first place!

Best regards,
Narasimha
