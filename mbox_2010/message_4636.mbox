I am not regular in my homam practice, but I do it anyway. I =
tried Laghu Paddhati procedure, and it was fine, however, I feel more confi=
dent practicing the super-short procedure.

Now, as the solar eclipse comes=
 on 11th, I wish to clarify some detail, as there is no way I'll miss it: i=
s it OK to substitute the proposed mantras with Jyotirlinga mantras? I feel=
 quite in sinc with them.

BTW, did anyone notice that fire is in fact micr=
ophonic when placed in electrical field (average electric field on Earth su=
rface is ~120V/m)? I have some more "insane" ideas at hand, but I'm not qui=
te ready to share them yet.
