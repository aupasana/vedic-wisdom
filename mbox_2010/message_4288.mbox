 Since even (the gods) Vayu and Agni are unable to lift or burn a blade of
=
grass, (in the presence of God), how can an ego-ridden person accomplish
an=
ything whatever (by his own endeavour, unsustained by Grace)? (91)

=E2=80=
=9CThere are two Selves; the individual self is one; the Supreme is another=
,=E2=80=9D
so think the ignorant ones; the Self is only one, not two; the S=
upreme One
is the Real (Self); the other one is a false appearance, (94)

T=
hough you may not believe all that is said of God, believe at least this
mu=
ch there. There is God. This seed is very potent in its growth. That seed
h=
as such great might that you will not see anything other than God =E2=80=93=
 you
will not see even yourself. Verily, God is all. (All is One)

Because =
the sage has already renounced for the sake of humanity his mind and
body, =
he feels no concern under the strain of service of his mind and body
to the=
 world. He will not shun the bodily labour and will not be a friend of
any =
suffering. It is the realization of the Peace that gives him such
courage a=
nd presence of mind. (All in One)

Since the (vital) fire called Kundalini =
flames upwards, and the moon, namely
intellect, flows downwards, the Suprem=
e Self, the Sun Consciousness, who is
the (one) Source of bothm dwells betw=
een them in the Heart. (Guru Ramana
Vachana Mala, 93)

If the vasanas that =
come forth from the mind, like soldiers from within a
fort, are then and th=
ere killed by the sword of the quest of the Self, the
mind is finally conqu=
ered.So long as one single vasana remains, good or bad,
so long must we rem=
ain unrealized.

The man who is deluded by the conviction =E2=80=98I am the=
 body=E2=80=99 thinks that God=E2=80=99s
world is outside himself and far a=
way. Really God=E2=80=99s world is inside the
Heart. (No world in reality).=
 (92)

Unswervingly worship of God of your Self with the flower of mental p=
eace.
Let the children =E2=80=93 the mental modes =E2=80=93 watch this wors=
hip. Gradually they
will learn to cast away their childish pranks and desir=
e to delight like
yourself. Continue your worship patiently. (All is One)

=
Unless the thought =E2=80=98the bliss of the self=E2=80=99 has not been exp=
erienced is
completely destroyed, the experience of the self is not reveale=
d. It is not
experienced like a sense pleasure with the accompanying false =
and
superficial the activity of the mind. Indeed, the activity of the mind =
is
the obstacle to it. (All is one)

If God =E2=80=93 who is in the Heart =
=E2=80=93 does not draw the (Sadhaka=E2=80=99s) mind inwards by
the might o=
f His grace, who can attain Peace by diving into the Heart, by
the (mere) p=
ower of his own mind, which is treacherous? (Guru Ramana Vachana
Mala, 89)
=

The might of God=E2=80=99s grace and the Quest of the Self in the form of =
(the
question) =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 these two together lea=
d the seeker (Sadhaka) to the
Heart and give him the Supreme State, which i=
s the state of (his own) Real
Self. (88)

Bliss is not something to be got.=
 You have only to get rid of your ignorance
which makes you think that you =
are other than bliss. For whom is this
ignorance? For the ego. Trace the so=
urce of the ego. Then the ego is
destroyed and bliss remains ever. It is et=
ernal. (Talk, 106)

Liberation is not to be achieved through endless cycled=
 of time by reading
the scriptures or worshipping the gods or by anything e=
lse than knowledge of
the unity of Brahman and atman. (Viveka Chudamani, Tr=
. By Sri Bhagavan)

The state of Atmanishta (being fixed in the self) devoi=
d of the individual
feeling =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, in the supreme state. In t=
his state there is no room for
thinking of objects, nor for this feeling of=
 individual being. There is no
doubt of any kind in this natural state of b=
eing consciousness.

Nirvana is perfection. In the perfect state there is n=
either subject nor
object, =E2=80=98there is nothing to see, nothing to fee=
l, nothing to know. Seeing
and knowing are the functions of the mind. In ni=
rvana there is nothing but
the blissful pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=
=80=99 (Talk 406)

Actions are prescribed only for purification of the mind=
, not for
realization of the Self Knowledge of the truth of the Self is obt=
ained only
by Self enquiry and not by any number of actions. (Viveka Chudam=
ani, Tr. By
Sri Bhagavan)

As God is ever shining as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (a=
s one=E2=80=99s own relating) realizing one=E2=80=99s Self
without attribut=
es is realizing God Himself. (Upadesa Undhiar, 25)

If the light of the sun=
 is invisible to the owl, it is only the fault of
that bind and not of the =
sun. Similarly, can the unawareness by ignorant
persons of the Self, which =
is always of the nature awareness, be other than
their own fault. (Collecte=
d Works of Sri Ramana Maharshi)

Hear will be removed by the cool moon, pov=
erty by the celestial
wish-fulfilling tree, and sin by taking holy dip in t=
he ganga. But know that
all these beginning with heat, will be removed mere=
ly by having the darshan
of incomparable sadhus. (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 =
Supplement, 4)

To know the Self is to be Self as the Self (I) is not two. =
This is (to be
the Self) indeed Self-abidance. (Upadesa Undhiar, 26)

Power=
 over all and adorability by all came to God, because He never says
=E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99, even through forgetfulness. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 98)

=
Since God is verily the Self in the heart, constant meditation on the Truth=

of oneself is the devotion that is most pleasing to God. (107)

Man is gui=
lty of theft, in thinking himself to be being separate from that
Pure indiv=
isible Consciousness, which is the true nature of the Supreme one.
(110)

S=
ince the Supreme One Himself shines in the heart of every living being as
=
=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99, (it needs to be understood that) thus God teaches al=
l, saying =E2=80=9CI am
the one (Self) in all=E2=80=9D. (=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=
=99 is the description of the Real Self, becaue
His manifestation as the Se=
lf is constant while the ego is not so). (95)

God=E2=80=99s creation surel=
y leads (man), through devotion to the Guru, to the
state of Self-Realisati=
on; thus it becomes a means of liberation from
bondage, and should therefor=
e be considered as benign. (102)

God=E2=80=99s grace consists in the act t=
hat He shines in the heart of everyone as
the Self; that power of grace doe=
s not exclude anyone, whether good or
otherwise. (103)

For those great one=
s that see in their hearts the lotus-feet of God, arises
the Light of Consc=
iousness of the One Real Self, through the extinction of
their mental taint=
s. (106)

The (Supreme) Self is described as being smaller than the tiny at=
om of
greater than the greatest, because He is beyond the reach of the mind=
, which
is itself infinite and atomic. (99)

Understand that the truth of t=
he Vermilion powder (Kumkumam, used by some
devotees), is the fire of Illum=
ination, by which the delusion =E2=80=98I am the
body=E2=80=99 is burnt out=
 in the Heart, as the effect of the quest of the Self.
(122)

Like the offe=
ring of a bit of jaggery, taken off from Lord Ganesa made of
jaggery, is th=
e offering of one=E2=80=99s own self to God. Is there any entity
called the=
 self, apart from Him? (111)

He that sees the Lord in the temple, the livi=
ng body, by seeking Him within,
can alone see Him, the Infinite, in the tem=
ple of the universe, having
become the endless Eye. He that has practiced d=
evotion to God like that of
monkey, through many lives, attains supreme Ill=
umination by the grace of
God, through devotion like that of kitten. (114)
=

Ignorant ones look upon love as the seventh taste; (the truth is that) it =
is
the first and foremost of all tastes, which gives flavour to all the
(so=
-called) other tastes. (119)

Even if one who has shaken off all fruits and=
 won the divine endowment, has
gone forth from the house (as a homeless asc=
etic) and practiced discipline
(tapas), he will not win (complete) happines=
s, without the company of a
(competent) Guru. (126)

The man who has the no=
tion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 cannot possibly worship God as
formles=
s; whatever worship he makes will be worship in form alone, not
otherwise. =
(115)

The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you =
will
only receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of=
 the
ocean; the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is=

entirely upto you.

Days, planets, astrological =E2=80=98yogas;, time-peri=
ods, and constellations, are
all auspicious for practicing devotion to the =
Most Auspicious, for those
that have (sincere) devotion (to Him). (118)

Pe=
rfect devotion is just the persistence of identity with the One
all-embraci=
ng Reality, which shines forth when the false =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is destro=
yed
utterly in the Heart, by the process of seeking the Self. (123)

The se=
eker of illumination should approach (as a disciple), not the bound
one who=
 (merely) knows the sense of the sacred love, (but) the Jivanmukta,
the one=
 that is in the Supreme Silence, who is happy in unity with the
Reality. (1=
24)

Whatever one does in the world is worship of God, if he has the convic=
tion
that difference does not really exist, since all forms are only
manife=
station of God.(117)

(But) he that is unqualified for the formless obtains=
 by the grace of God in
the end the Illumination of the Real Self, by worsh=
ipping Him with form.
(116)

He that has (himself) crossed the ocean of rel=
ativity can (alone) help other
men to cross (the same); an unenlightened pe=
rson elected (as Guru) by
another unenlightened one is like a blind guide t=
o another blind one. (125)

The One (Real Self) becomes threefold; to the d=
evotee He is God; to the
seeker of illumination He becomes the Guru; when t=
he mind still in the heart
He Himself becomes (manifest as) the Real Self. =
(120)

Offering of the self to that which is the reality of God in the Hear=
t,
through the extinction of the ego, is the final outcome of sustained
dev=
otion to Him. (113)

The act of making the ego serve as the food of God, by=
 stilling the mind in
the Heart, by the power of devotion to God in his rea=
l nature (as the Self),
is real offering to Him. (112)

That auspicious and=
 immortal Reality which remains over as the residue, when
the individual (f=
alse) self is cremated in the fire of Illumination, is the
real meaning of =
the =E2=80=98holy ash=E2=80=99, (vibhuti). (121)

It is said that Hari give=
s Liberation, and that Hara gives Illumination; but
Illumination is the tru=
e nature of Liberation; hence Hari and Hara are one
and the same. (100)

Th=
ose who serve God (Siva) for the sake of objects desired do not (really)
se=
rve God; they serve the desired objects; hence they do not win the (true)
r=
eward of devotion. (105)

That God prompted Kannapa, the great devotee, to =
offer (to Himself) his own
eyes, was in order to confer on him His own stat=
e through the extinction of
his ego. (104)

<br>Days, planets, astrolo=
gical =E2=80=98yogas;, time-periods, and constellations, are all auspicious=
 for practicing devotion to the Most Auspicious, for those that have (since=
re) devotion (to Him). (118)<br><br>Perfect devotion is just the persistenc=
e of identity with the One all-embracing Reality, which shines forth when t=
he false =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is destroyed utterly in the Heart, by the proc=
ess of seeking the Self. (123)<br>

<br>The seeker of illumination should a=
pproach (as a disciple), not the bound one who (merely) knows the sense of =
the sacred love, (but) the Jivanmukta, the one that is in the Supreme Silen=
ce, who is happy in unity with the Reality. (124)<br>

<br>Whatever one doe=
s in the world is worship of God, if he has the conviction that difference =
does not really exist, since all forms are only manifestation of God.(117)<=
br><br>(But) he that is unqualified for the formless obtains by the grace o=
f God in the end the Illumination of the Real Self, by worshipping Him with=
 form. (116)<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">He that has (himself=
) crossed the ocean of relativity can (alone) help other men to cross (the =
same); an unenlightened person elected (as Guru) by another unenlightened o=
ne is like a blind guide to another blind one. (125)</span><br>

<br>The On=
e (Real Self) becomes threefold; to the devotee He is God; to the seeker of=
 illumination He becomes the Guru; when the mind still in the heart He Hims=
elf becomes (manifest as) the Real Self. (120)<br><br><span style=3D"font-w=
eight:bold">Offering of the self to that which is the reality of God in the=
 Heart, through the extinction of the ego, is the final outcome of sustaine=
d devotion to Him. (113)</span><br>

<br>The act of making the ego serve as=
 the food of God, by stilling the mind in the Heart, by the power of devoti=
on to God in his real nature (as the Self), is real offering to Him. (112)<=
br><br>That auspicious and immortal Reality which remains over as the resid=
ue, when the individual (false) self is cremated in the fire of Illuminatio=
n, is the real meaning of the =E2=80=98holy ash=E2=80=99, (vibhuti). (121)<=

<br>It is said that Hari gives Liberation, and that Hara gives Illumin=
ation; but Illumination is the true nature of Liberation; hence Hari and Ha=
ra are one and the same. (100)<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Thos=
e who serve God (Siva) for the sake of objects desired do not (really) serv=
e God; they serve the desired objects; hence they do not win the (true) rew=
ard of devotion. (105)</span><br>

<br>That God prompted Kannapa, the great=
 devotee, to offer (to Himself) his own eyes, was in order to confer on him=
 His own state through the extinction of his ego. (104)<div style=3D"clear:=
