Dear Narasimha,
I've been thinking a lot, trying to understand  what you re=
peatedly write about achieving the goal of 'detachment'... 
which seemed so=
mehow too vague to me, so please give me some feedback on my understanding =
of this and other issues share bellow.
Just for the sake of argument I will=
 mention your case as I perceive it: However powerful intellect may be, and=
 yours is undoubtly of a finest kind, it's that emotional charge, passion/e=
nthisiasm,
that gives power, that gives you the power to pursue this diffic=
ult path of 'finding' the God, that makes you so powerful communicator, tea=
cher, truth-seeker we folllow.

It occurred to me that you/and we all,  don=
't seek, struggle for, to achieve some 'universal' detachment, but rather t=
o achieve a  SHIFT of attachments- from instinctual, selfish, ego-centered.=
..to  attachment to GOD- even more emotionally charged attachment, than all=
 those /pitiful?/ 'human' attachments..  
You said in one mail that you hav=
e mixed feelings after reading Aghora- can it be that key word 'feeling' is=
 the clue here?    
Aghora /practices/ is not 'my cup of tea', but it gave =
me the insight I share here /or maybe just false understanding?/
Aghora doe=
sn't deny passion, just teaches All Pervasive Passion-for-God/Life, which m=
akes all other worldly attachments irrelevant. /If we dont to focus on, set=
 aside 'orgies' attributed to aghora which I understand as actually irrelev=
ant, it's just one /maybe even less pretentious, more difficult/ path of ac=
hieving oneness with God.
What is prayer without passion, heart, deep attac=
hment?   You can repeat mantas, prayers one million times and nothing will =
happen if you don't put your heart in it.

The most  difficult issue for me=
  is about 'dharma'. You said " In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect a=
nd intuition are the inputs" I am getting that- we need to sharpen our intu=
ition and trust it enough
"Another external input is the words of scripture=
s and learned men. One
can derive one's dharma from them. A special place i=
s given to one's
> > spiritual
> > > master. If one surrenders to a spiritu=
al master..." 
To surrender to spiritual master...isn't that again about in=
tuition? Which will tell us 'that's him" 'follow him'?

Or will He find us =
when we are ready?
My spiritual vocabulary/personal experience is limitted,=
 I always end up with 'intuition'.
I'll stop asking more Q, you must be get=
ting tired of me:)

Regards,
Anna
