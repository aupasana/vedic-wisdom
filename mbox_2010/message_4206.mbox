Kaaba a Hin=
du Temple?
[Note: A recent archeological find in Kuwait unearthed a gold-pl=
ated statue of the Hindu deity Ganesh. A Muslim resident of Kuwait requeste=
d historical research material that can help explain the connection between=
 Hindu civilisation and Arabia.]
Was the Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple?
B=
y P.N. Oak (Historian)
Glancing through some research material recently, I =
was pleasantly surprised to come across a reference to a king Vikramaditya =
inscription found in the Kaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabi=
an Peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire.
The text of the crucial Vi=
kramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaab=
a shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 of a volume known as =E2=
=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in=
 Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free English the inscription says:
"Fortunat=
e are those who were born (and lived) during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. H=
e was a noble, generous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his subjec=
ts. But at that time we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual pleas=
ures. Plotting and torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had enve=
loped our country. Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel paws =
of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was enve=
loped in a darkness so intense as on a new moon night. But the present dawn=
 and pleasant sunshine of education is the result of the favour of the nobl=
e king Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of us- =
foreigners as we were. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent sc=
holars whose brilliance shone like that of the sun from his country to ours=
. These scholars and preceptors through whose benevolence we were once agai=
n made cognisant of the presence of God, introduced to His sacred
 existenc=
e and put on the road of Truth, had come to our country to preach their rel=
igion and impart education at king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s behest."
For thos=
e who would like to read the Arabic wording I reproduce it hereunder in Rom=
an script:
"Itrashaphai Santu Ibikramatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha W=
ayosassaru Bihillahaya Samaini Ela Motakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min ho=
wa Yapakhara phajjal asari nahone osirom bayjayhalem. Yundan blabin Kajan b=
lnaya khtoryaha sadunya kanateph netephi bejehalin Atadari bilamasa- rateen=

ho watastaru hihila Yakajibaymana balay kulk amarena phaneya jaunabilamary =
Bikramatum".
(Page 315 Sayar-ul-okul) .
[Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-o=
kul=E2=80=99 signifies memorable words.]
A careful analysis of the above in=
scription enables us to draw the following conclusions:
1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the ancient Indian empires may have extended up to the=
 eastern boundaries of Arabia until Vikramaditya and that it was he who for=
 the first time conquered Arabia. Because the inscription says that king Vi=
kram who dispelled the darkness of ignorance from Arabia. 
2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatever their earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=
=99s preachers had succeeded in spreading the Vedic (based on the Vedas, th=
e Hindu sacred scriptures)) way of life in Arabia. 
3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of Indian arts and sciences was imparted by In=
dians to the Arabs directly by founding schools, academies and cultural cen=
tres. The belief, therefore, that visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to=
 their own lands through their own indefatigable efforts and scholarship is=
 unfounded. 
An ancillary conclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Mina=
r (in Delhi, India) could well be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemor=
ating his conquest of Arabia. This conclusion is strengthened by two pointe=
rs. Firstly, the inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Mi=
nar refers to the marriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princ=
ess of Balhika. This Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West As=
ia. It could be that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the rule=
r of Balkh who concluded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the=
 victor. Secondly, the township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is name=
d Mehrauli after Mihira who was the renowned astronomer-mathemat ician of k=
ing Vikram=E2=80=99s court. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=
=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 signifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and h=
is helpers and assistants working on astronomical observations made from th=
e tower.
Having seen the far reaching and history shaking implications of t=
he Arabic inscription concerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together =
the story of its find. How it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in =
Mecca. What are the other proofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were onc=
e followers of the Indian Vedic way of life and that tranquillity and educa=
tion were ushered into Arabia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educ=
ationists from an uneasy period of "ignorance and turmoil" mentioned in the=
 inscription.
In Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhata=
b-e-Sultania , which is reputed to have the largest collection of ancient W=
est Asian literature. In the Arabic section of that library is an anthology=
 of ancient Arabic poetry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work=
 in A.D. 1742 under the orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim.
The pages=
 of that volume are of Hareer =E2=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on.=
 Each page has a decorative gilded border. That anthology is known as Sayar=
-ul-Okul. It is divided into three parts. The first part contains biographi=
c details and the poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The sec=
ond part embodies accounts and verses of poets of the period beginning just=
 after prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayy=
a dynasty. The third part deals with later poets up to the end of Khalif Ha=
run-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s times.
Abu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the=
 poet Laureate of Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited =
the anthology.
The first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 =
was printed and published in Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the on=
e published in Beirut in 1932.
The collection is regarded as the most impor=
tant and authoritative anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws consid=
erable light on the social life, customs, manners and entertainment modes o=
f ancient Arabia. The book also contains an elaborate description of the an=
cient shrine of Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which use=
d to be held every year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convi=
nce readers that the annual haj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier p=
re-Islamic congregation.
But the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It prov=
ided a forum for the elite and the learned to discuss the social, religious=
, political, literary and other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading=
 Arabia. =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reache=
d at those discussions were widely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, ther=
efore, followed the Varanasi tradition (of India) of providing a venue for =
important discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there =
for spiritual bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at=
 Mecca in Arvasthan (Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Ma=
hadev (Siva) emblems can be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Musl=
im pilgrims reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba.
Arabic tradition has lo=
st trace of the founding of the Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramad=
itya inscription affords a clue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great d=
evotion to Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramadi=
tya, exists the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) as=
sociated with Vikramaditya. Since according to the Vikramaditya inscription=
 he spread the Vedic religion, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba=
 temple in Mecca?
A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars=
 the entry of any non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days =
when the Kaaba was stormed and captured solely for the newly established fa=
ith of Islam. The object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to p=
revent its recapture.
As the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to =
shave his head and beard and to don special sacred attire that consists of =
two seamless sheets of white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and t=
he other over the shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic=
 practice of entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white she=
ets.
The main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as th=
e Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates from =
the days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by camou=
flaging it.
According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 im=
ages. Traditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 de=
stroyed when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the =
Moon and yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the=
 Arabs worshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practi=
ce of =E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets=
, is still in vogue. Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon.
In India the cr=
escent moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva symbol. Since=
 that symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came to be gra=
fted on the flag of Islam.
Another Hindu tradition associated with the Kaab=
a is that of the sacred stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). A=
ccording to the Hindu tradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva em=
blem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-e=
xist. True to that association a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its wa=
ter is held sacred because it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga sinc=
e pre-Islamic times (Zam-Zam water).
[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who=
 go to the Kaaba for Haj regard this Zam-Zam water with reverence and take =
some bottled water with them as sacred water.]
Muslim pilgrims visiting the=
 Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no other mosque does the circuma=
mbulation prevail. Hindus invariably circumambulate around their deities. T=
his is yet another proof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiv=
a temple where the Hindu practice of circumambulation is still meticulously=
 observed.
The practice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskr=
it- is associated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culmin=
ating rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round=
 the sacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Sin=
ce "Makha" means fire, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca wa=
s the seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia.
It might come as a stun=
ning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself is San=
skrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify=
 a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskr=
it chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahisha=
surmardini. The Islamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but =
the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah mea=
ns mother or goddess and mother goddess.
One Koranic verse is an exact tran=
slation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This was pointed out by the great res=
earch scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in one of his articles.
[Note: Ano=
ther scholar points out that the following teaching from the Koran is exact=
ly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7).
The Koran:
"Sight p=
erceives Him not. But He perceives men's sights; for He is the knower of se=
crets, the Aware."
Kena Upanishad:
"That which cannot be seen by the eye bu=
t through which the eye itself sees, know That to be Brahman (God) and not =
what people worship here (in the manifested world)."
A simplified meaning o=
f both the above verses reads:
God is one and that He is beyond man's senso=
ry experience.
The identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani=
 is just the Arabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them=
 and administered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire.
I=
t will now be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing=
 in West Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during the last =
1300 years. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of =
Islamic practice.
The Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Min=
or too worshipped 33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar wa=
s introduced in West Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=
=98Safar=E2=80=99 signifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas)=
 in the Hindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi m=
eaning the sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =
=E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language=
). The Muslim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi=
 (Gyrah =3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.
The Islamic =
practice of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sa=
crifices of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Ee=
d for festive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskri=
t word. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancien=
t times the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occa=
sion was celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari =
Eed festival.
[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.=
] 
Since Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Isl=
amic word Idgah signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the=
 exact Sanskrit connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=
=E2=80=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98Yajna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping.
Vedic descri=
ptions about the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creatio=
n of the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 cha=
pter 2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapte=
r 10, stanzas 4 to 7.
Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin=
 to the Vedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-=
Yagna) which is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individua=
ls.
Muslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before comme=
ncing prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydh=
yartham Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99.
Four months of the year are regarded as =
very sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plun=
der and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturm=
asa i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu tr=
adition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Sinc=
e the Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times=
 immemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great=
 gusto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibar=
at.
Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the K=
aaba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to =
the correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according =
to hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some of=
 them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita.
According to extant Islamic recor=
ds, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and thei=
r life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them. At =
Ubla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that Indian=
s were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding position t=
o be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unless =
they belonged to the ruling class.
It is mentioned in the Abadis i.e., the =
authentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari that the =
Indian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99=
s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken ill, her n=
ephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that Indians =
enjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could not be th=
eirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an Indian Raja=
 (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows that the In=
dian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to send such=
 an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said to have so=
 highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake of it. T=
hese references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times Indi=
ans retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindling legacy=
 from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times.
The Islamic term =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=
=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that is worship =
of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorate their an=
cestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for their rem=
embrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=
=99 (worship of forefathers) .
The Islamic practice of observing the moon r=
ise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the Hindu cust=
om of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only after sighting=
 the moon.
Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating those dead in=
 battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradition because in=
 Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99. Hindus obs=
erve Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in battle.
The wor=
d Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The original word i=
s =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 is Sanskr=
it =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the land is =E2=80=98A=
rvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means a horse. Arvast=
han signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arabia is famous for=
 its horses.
This discovery changes the entire complexion of the history of=
 ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts about the king w=
ho had the largest empire in history. It could be that the expanse of king =
Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all others. Secondly=
, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the east and not in the we=
st beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thirdly the effeminat=
e and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country in the world cou=
ld by some age spread her benign and beatific cultural influence, language,=
 customs, manners and education over distant lands without militarily conqu=
ering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countries physically wh=
erever traces of its culture and language are still extant and the region e=
xtended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Baltic in Northern Eur=
ope and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that while Indian rule=
rs
 identified themselves with the local population and established welfare=
 states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands perpetuated untold at=
rocities over the vanquished.
=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 tells us that=
 a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held in Mecca at the annual Okaj =
fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets used to participate in it.
Poe=
ms considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved on gold plate wer=
e hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goatskin were hung outs=
ide. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasure house of the be=
st Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tradition.
That trad=
ition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic compositions were engraved =
and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. But most of the poem=
s got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaaba by Prophet Mohamm=
ad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, Hassan-bin-Sawik, wh=
o was among the invaders, captured some of the treasured poems and dumped t=
he gold plate on which they were inscribed in his own home. Sawik=E2=80=99s=
 grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried those gold plates to Khalif=E2=
=80=99s court where he met the well-known Arab scholar Abu Amir Asamai. The=
 latter received from the bearer five gold plates and 16 leather sheets wit=
h the prize-winning poems engraved on them. The bearer was sent away happy =
bestowed with a good reward.
On the five gold plates were inscribed verses =
by ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, Akhatab-bin- Turfa and Jarrham Bint=
oi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to compile a collect=
ion of all earlier compositions. One of the compositions in the collection =
is a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned Arab poet, to king=
 Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet Mohammad had recei=
ved the highest award for the best poetic compositions for three years in s=
uccession in the pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every year. All those =
three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the Kaaba temple, insc=
ribed on gold plates. One of these constituted an unreserved tribute to Kin=
g Vikramaditya for his paternal and filial rule over Arabia. That has alrea=
dy been quoted above.
Pre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s tribute to =
king Vikramaditya is a decisive evidence that it was king Vikramaditya who =
first conquered the Arabian Peninsula and made it a part of the Indian Empi=
re. This explains why starting from India towards the west we have all Sans=
krit names like Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan) , Baluchisthan, Kurdisthan, =
Tajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan, Turkestha=
n (Turkmenisthan) etc.
Historians have blundered in not giving due weight t=
o the evidence provided by Sanskrit names pervading over the entire west As=
ian region. Let us take a contemporary instance. Why did a part of India ge=
t named Nagaland even after the end of British rule over India? After all h=
istorical traces are wiped out of human memory, will a future age historian=
 be wrong if he concludes from the name Nagaland that the British or some E=
nglish speaking power must have ruled over India? Why is Portuguese spoken =
in Goa (part of India), and French in Pondichery (part of India), and both =
French and English in Canada? Is it not because those people ruled over the=
 territories where their languages are spoken? Can we not then justly concl=
ude that wherever traces of Sanskrit names and traditions exist Indians onc=
e held sway? It is unfortunate that this important piece of decisive eviden=
ce has been ignored all these centuries.
Another question which should have=
 presented itself to historians for consideration is how could it be that I=
ndian empires could extend in the east as far as Korea and Japan, while not=
 being able to make headway beyond Afghanisthan? In fact land campaigns are=
 much easier to conduct than by sea. It was the Indians who ruled the entir=
e West Asian region from Karachi to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskrit names to t=
hose lands and the towns therein, introduce their pantheon of the fire-wors=
hip, imparted education and established law and order.
It may be that Arabi=
a itself was not part of the Indian empire until king Vikrama , since Binto=
i says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time brought about a radi=
cal change in the social, cultural and political life of Arabia. It may be =
that the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian rule before Vikr=
ama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or as a remote possi=
bility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted a series of bri=
lliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region between Afghanistha=
n and Hedjaz.
Incidentally this also explains why king Vikramaditya is so f=
amous in history. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness of heart and his=
 impartial filial affection for all his subjects, whether Indian or Arab, a=
s testified by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanently enshrined in =
the pages of history because he was the world=E2=80=99s greatest ruler havi=
ng the largest empire. It should be remembered that only a monarch with a v=
ast empire gets famous in world history. Vikram Samvat (calendar still wide=
ly in use in India today) which he initiated over 2000 years ago may well m=
ark his victory over Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar (Kutub Tower in =
Delhi), a pillar commemorating that victory and the consequential marriage =
with the Vaihika (Balkh) princess as testified by the nearby iron pillar in=
scription.
A great many puzzles of ancient world history get automatically =
solved by a proper understanding of these great conquests of king Vikramadi=
tya. As recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, preachers and so=
cial workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached the Vedic way of li=
fe, manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trained the local p=
eople in irrigation and agriculture and established in those regions a demo=
cratic, orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way of life. That was =
of course, a Vedic Hindu way of life.
It is from such ancient times that In=
dian Kshtriya royal families, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks, have held sway=
 over Iran and Iraq. It is those conquests, which made the Parsees Agnihotr=
is i.e., fire-worshippers. It is therefore that we find the Kurds of Kurdis=
than speaking a Sanskritised dialect, fire temples existing thousands of mi=
les away from India, and scores of sites of ancient Indian cultural centres=
 like Navbahar in West Asia and the numerous viharas in Soviet Russia sprea=
d throughout the world. Ever since so many viharas are often dug up in Sovi=
et Russia, ancient Indian sculptures are also found in excavations in Centr=
al Asia. The same goes for West Asia.
[Note: Ancient Indian sculptures incl=
ude metal statues of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant headed god); the =
most recent find being in Kuwait].
Unfortunately these chapters of world hi=
story have been almost obliterated from public memory. They need to be care=
fully deciphered and rewritten. When these chapters are rewritten they migh=
t change the entire concept and orientation of ancient history.
In view of =
the overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scholars, students of hist=
ory and lay men alike should take note that they had better revise their te=
xt books of ancient world history. The existence of Hindu customs, shrines,=
 Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns and the Vikramaditya =
inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumping proof that Indian K=
shatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali to Baltic and Korea to =
Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.

 inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to th=

This Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be =
that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who c=
