Dear Narasimha ji

Thanks for this worderful explanation. Comparing Brahma =
Rakshasas with a spiritual seeker who has traversed half the spiritual path=
 but has gone astray makes perfect sense.

regards
Veneet

Brahma rak=

There is a spiritual seeker inside ea=

 the final goal of liberation. Demonical qualities such as pride may develo=

When o=

 matter, there is always a chance of being rewarded with some knowledge, in=
sights, special abilities etc. If the spiritual seeker inside one becomes p=
roud and gets distracted, that means that a Brahma Rakshasa has developed i=
nside one and blocks one from further spiritual progress.

 

Yes, in any s=
piritual sadhana or internal/external fire ritual, there is a risk from Bra=
hma Rakshasa. But do not expect a ghost or ghoul to appear in front of you,=
 like in movies. This is mainly an internal challenge. That is why I keep r=
epeating that spiritual experiences, obtaining of spiritual insights, getti=
ng more and more knowledge, should not increase pride and distract one from=
 the final goal of complete surrender.

 

Best regards,

Narasimha
