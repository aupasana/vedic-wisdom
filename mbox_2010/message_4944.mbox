Dear friends

After reading the previous mail from Narasimha ji, where he c=
ompared the Brahma Rakshasas of the macrocosm with the good qualities gone =
astray of the microcosm, a similar thought came to my mind which I am shari=
ng below.

In the Puranic stories or mythological movies we often see that =
Indra, the king of gods, is always engaged in watching the dance of apsasar=
as. When a sage begins to perform a severe tapas on earth, the seat of Indr=
a becomes unstable. He feels like his throne is about to be taken away and =
he grows anxious and tries to create various obstacles in the rishi's tapas=
 by creating strong winds, fire, rain or cold or by sending apsasaras.

Thi=
s corresponds beautifully with what happens in the microcosm. Indra, the ki=
ng of gods, corresponds with the mind, the king of senses. Just like Indra =
is constantly engaged in watching the apsaras similarly the mind is constan=
tly engaged in indulging in the material world. Whenever a good quality (li=
ke detachment etc) begins to manifest in us, the mind becomes=A0 unsteady=
=A0 (Indra's throne beginning to become unsteady) and it feels like it is g=
oing to be conquered (after all spiritual progress involves extinguishing t=
he mind). It grows anxious. The mind sends various thoughts like lust (send=
ing of apsaras by Indra) etc to obstruct the tapas (manifestation of good q=
ualities in us).

I do not claim originality to this idea. I am sure someon=
e else must have noticed this earlier. But this thought just came to my min=
d and I felt like sharing it here.

regards
