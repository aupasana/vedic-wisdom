Of course we may disagree but i feel you are reading my statements partiall=
y i do agree that in this age most people you have met have not shown you r=
esults and that is because most have not reached that state probably yet an=
d i am not saying chandi will become complete by mere reading of kunjika wh=
at i mean is kunjika is a coded key to unlock many secrets present it chand=
i further kunjika is saptashati in a condensed form of course these are my =
opinions lets agree to disagree :-)
