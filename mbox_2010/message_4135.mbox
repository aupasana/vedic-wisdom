ct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Full Moon effect on Meditation

   
Namaste:


I tho=
ught New Moon day is suppose to be good for meditation/sadhana, as new moon=
 phenomenon is taken as the symbol of the merger of the mind (moon) with th=
e soul (sun). This state of existence is called amohavasam (a life bereft o=
f all desires), and hence the name Amavasi. 

On the other hand during Pour=
nami, moon has power to to excite (e.g., tides) and make people run berserk=
 !

But I do know Guru Pournami is considered as very auspicious. May be ot=
her members can shed more light on this. 

Regards,
Hemanth
