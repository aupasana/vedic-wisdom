Namaste,
 
(1) Though meditating with closed eyes is conducive to experiencing nice internal states in the long run, it is ok to keep the eyes open and watch fire.
 
(2) Yes, numbers are only for a guidance and not absolute. The goal is to have a reasonable target and meet it. Don't worry if you are doing between 12 and 25 and don't know the exact count.
 
(3) Yes. If you see the super-short version, only one mantra (om gam gaNapataye namaH) is given. Offer any number of mantras, each any number of times, as you wish.
 
(4) That's fine. Try to maintain around the same time everyday (if you can).
 
(5) That is ok.
 
(6) No, it is not mandatory. If people always ate Jalebi with milk in old days, it does not mean you should not eat Jalebi if you don't have milk. Jalebi is tasty without dipping in milk too!
 
In fact, people put too much emphasis on the external ritual of sandhyavandanam and forget the essence.
 
*        *        *
 
Once I went to a Maharudram (chanting of Rudra namakam 1331 times by all participating ritviks together) conducted at a temple as a participating ritvik. After chanting the whole morning, we were given a break at noon and we were all taken outside to do our sandhyavandanam. All the learned brahmins who came as ritviks sat down in the traditional pose on the ground and did ten minutes of an external ritual by touching various body parts, sprinking water in various places etc. Clearly, they were learned in tradition and did it well. But, when they finished the ritual, they all got up and went to have food.
 
In the old days, people did ten minutes of external ritual and then did japam (meditation) with Gayatri mantra for an hour. If all you have is 5-10 minutes, it is more useful to skip sandhyavandana and do japam right away. Unfortunately, busy people of Kali yuga are making a wrong tradeoff!
 
Don't get me wrong. I do not want to downplay the importance of sandhyavandanam. However, spending 5-10 minutes in sandhyavandanam and 0 minutes on actual Gayatri japam is a bad tradeoff IMHO.
 
Taking the dal (lentil soup) in your hand, looking at it intently for 2 minutes, transferring it from one hand to another, smelling it, touching it gently with the tip of tongue may be a good ritual that makes your digestive juices flow and helps you digest better. But, if you do that ritual and then leave without eating the dal, what good is it and what strength are you going to get from it? If you are in a hurry, you are better off eating the soup without that ritual before it.
 
*        *        *
 
In my opinion, doing sadhyavandana is not mandatory for homam. It is not mandatory for even doing japam with Gayatri mantra. If you have time, do sandhyavandanam and then 5-10 maalaas of Gayatri mantra, in addition to homam. If you do not have such time, you are better off doing just homam and meditating at the end.
 
*        *        *
 
I am quite inspired to hear from several people who never lit a lamp in their life before and are enjoying homam by themselves now. Manish firmly belives that these are just the early days and homam will become a very popular spiritual practice (again!) and hundreds of thousands of people will be doing homam regularly in coming years.
 
The main goal of religion is to take one to god and make one *experience* god in some manner or the other. However, with deepening Kali, several organized religions have become corrupted and dogmatic and deviating from the main goal more and more. This is causing unneeded clashes between people of "faith" and strife in the world and dissuading more and more intelligent and educated people from the pursuit of god.
 
As shrill and empty rhetoric starts to afflict organized religions, what the world needs is not a new organized religion or a new prophet. World needs to rediscover sanatana dharma (the path of perennial righteousness). What the world needs is a sadhana of rishis, which uses the "living god" that everyone has access to (i.e. fire) and which enables people to experience god eventually. Manish belives thousands of people will make swift spiritual progress through homam and restore some tolerable level of dharma in the world.
 
*        *        *
 
(7) It may not mean anything and may not be connected to homam. Don't worry.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
