Though the question was not addressed to me.Please find the goog=
le books link to one of NIthyananda's best books. 

http://books.google.com=
/books?id=3D7M_uweo2lvkC&printsec=3Dfrontcover&dq=3DNithyananda&cd=3D2#v=3D=
onepage&q=3D&f=3Dfalse

About half of the book is available at the link. If=
 you can not let the recent stuff cloud your perception you might find it v=
ery useful.

Also one more book if you have time . Meditation is for you

h=
ttp://books.google.com/books?id=3D7qRyAk2zGcQC&printsec=3Dfrontcover&dq=3DN=
ithyananda&cd=3D4#v=3Donepage&q=3D&f=3Dfalse

About half of that book is al=
