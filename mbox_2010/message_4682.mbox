 You see how you are acting
without your intention to do so?
The Gita says =
that a man
cannot remain without acting.
The purpose of one's birth will be=
 fulfilled
whether you will it or not.
Let the purpose fulfill itself.

Eve=
ryone is the Self
by his own experience.
Still, he is not aware,
he identif=
ies the Self with the body
and feels miserable.
This is the greatest of all=
 mysteries.
One is the Self!
Why not abide as the Self
and be done with mis=
eries?

In dreamless sleep, there is no world,
no ego, and no unhappiness,
=
but the Self remains.
In the waking state, there are all these;
yet, there =
is the Self.
One has only to remove the transitory happenings
in order to r=
ealize the ever-present
beatitude of the Self.
Your nature is Bliss.
Find t=
hat on which
all the rest is superimposed
and you then remain
as the pure S=
elf.

So long as the ego is not dead, humility alone is good for a sadhaka
=
spiritual seeker); acceptance of obeisance from others is not good.

The Sa=
ge whose ego is extinct
is freed
from the three seeming states
of waking,
d=
reaming
and deep sleep.

All that remains for such a Sage
Is turiya,
the mo=
st noble state,
First, last and all-transcendent

Be what you are.
There is=
 nothing to come down
or become manifest.
All that is needed is to lose the=
 ego.
That which is is always there.
The blank is seen by you.
You are ther=
e to see the blank.
What are you waiting for?
The thought, 'I have not seen=
,'
the expectation to see,
and the desire of getting something
are all the =
working of the ego.
You have fallen into the snares of the ego.
The ego say=
s all that and not you.
Be yourself and nothing more!

As the restlessness =
of the elephant's trunk is checked by a chain held (by
the elephant), so th=
e restlessness of the mind is corrected by meditation on
(spiritual) Names =
or Forms.

He who engages in investigation
starts holding on to himself,
as=
king. "Who am I?"
and the Self becomes clear to him.

Even now you are the =
Self.
But you are confounding this consciousness
[or ego] with the absolute=
 consciousness.
This false identification is due to ignorance.
Ignorance di=
sappears along with ego.
Killing the ego is the only thing to accomplish.
R=
ealization is already there.
No attempt is needed to attain realization.
Fo=
r it is nothing external.
Nothing new.
It is always and everywhere;
Here an=
d now.

First surrender the self
and then harmonize the conflicts.

First g=
ive yourself up
and then think of the rest.

Reincarnation can be real
if y=
ou are incarnate now.
Even now you are not born.

The ego is the root of al=
l diseases.
Give it up. There will be no disease.

There is only one Master=

and that is the Self.

What is silence? It is eternal eloquence.

Each see=
ker after God should be allowed to go his own
way, the way for which he alo=
ne may be built (meant). It will
not do to convert him to another path by v=
iolence. The Guru
will go with the disciple in his own path and then gradua=
lly
turn him onto the Supreme path at the ripe moment. Suppose
a car is goi=
ng at top speed. To stop it at once or to turn it at
once would be attended=
 with disastrous consequences. - Bhagavan

Grace is in the beginning, middl=
e, and end.
Grace is the Self. Because of false identification
of the Self =
with the body,
the Guru is thought to be with body,
but from the Guru's poi=
nt of view,
the Guru is only the Self.
The Self is one only.
He states that=
 the Self alone is.
Is not then the Self your Guru?
Where else would grace =
come from?
It is from the Self alone.
All of these doubts arise
because of =
the wrong outlook and
consequent expectation of things
external to oneself.=

Nothing is external to the Self.

There is no greater mystery
than the fol=
lowing.
Ourselves being the Reality,
we seek to gain reality.
We think ther=
e is something hiding our Reality,
and that it must be destroyed,
before th=
e Reality is gained.
That is ridiculous.
A day will dawn
when you will your=
self laugh at your past efforts.
That which will be on the day you laugh,
i=
s also here and now.

In Nagamma, letters, entry 9th February 1947 the talk=
 was on getting rid of
the gunas (qualities of the mind). Then it turns on =
the Guru.
