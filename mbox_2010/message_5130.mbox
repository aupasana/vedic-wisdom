I thought Satsang means spending time in the company of good/pure people so=
 that our thoughts and behaviour will also get purified by their influence!=

Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its =
understandable. Infact, There are several people close to me have started r=
eciting Chandi in regional lagnuages as suggested by me. hence practically,=
 its the same as you suggested. However i feel that at some point its bette=

You have already written a very=
 detailed account wherein i got some informations which i never knew.

Only=
 one opinion i wish to know from you is about "Satsanga". you have given th=
e prime importance to that over everything else.
Narasimha Garu has few tim=
es repeated that "Pavaka" is a yogi and living god. when one does Homam eve=
ryday,
 He/she actually gets a very effective Satsanga with a Yogi called A=
gni-The Pavaka.
In that sense, Homam is also a ritual which automatically p=
rovides you with much required Satsanga as well. Whats your opinion on this=
.

Please take your time!

Best Regards,

Utpal

 Utpal ji's question.
> >

 question r=
egarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing t=
he big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE ques=
tion and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or sp=
ecific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an =
absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. How=
ever if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra s=
adhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.
> >=

is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cos=

 Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by eac=
h of these paths.
> > For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Adv=
aita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one=
 can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. T=

 Vaidik system it
 has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular=
 self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices =
involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for external practices=
.
> >

ice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga=
 additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the S=

ly the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.
> >

=
> > 
> > Finally I will address
 the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where a=
lone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a =
Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult=
 truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presu=
pposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain r=
egulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti m=
arga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predomi=
nantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam').=
 Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the=
 intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and =
yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.
> > 
> > Tantra's me=
thod of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like pract=
ical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bri=
ng
 results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is no=
t about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to =
experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need expe=
rience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training a=
nd experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures,=
 in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one's own consciousn=
ess whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual cons=
ciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for=
 mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the Ku=
ndalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just elabor=
ate on initiation and Guru parampara.
> > 
> > Since we are talking about S=
ri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric contex=
t too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the
 Tantric context. The Da=
sha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However th=
ere are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living tradition=
s among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi=
 sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. J=
ust to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!=
) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I=
 will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares=
 both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to=
 sadhana.
> > 
> > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is=
 not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at=
 the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra=
, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronist=
ic frequencies for each of
 these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fl=
edged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that=
 path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with S=
IVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-br=
anches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadh=
aka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern met=
aphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric ad=
vocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the con=
duit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful=
 bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where ther=
e is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up ti=
ll Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda)=
. Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.

 to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrate=
d approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Ma=

integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri=
 Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also=
 a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simu=

gasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extens=
ively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic pa=
th, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections =
through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning
 glor=
y in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-f=
ledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alon=
e exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it=
 with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central tru=
th of Advaita.

to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obviou=

 Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard =
all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possib=

 of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone wh=

practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in=

 not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or th=
e Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of read=

 one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya.=
 One may benefit from
 any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. Ho=

 importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidy=

 You are probably

 However, Chandi is also Mother and though she may be Ugraatiugra, she is a=

to Utpal ji's question.<br>> > <br>> > Utpal ji has raised an i=
mportant
 question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it=
 after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to und=
erstand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the ques=

er initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my=

he tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and mu=
ltiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In th=
e pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current c=
ontext of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are re=
levant to the discussion.<br>> > <br>> > a. Gnana marga
 (Advai=
tic/Vedantic)<br>> > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)<br>> > c.=
 Mantra marga (Tantric)<br>> > d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)<br>>=
; > e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)<br>>=
 > <br>> > Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of t=
he great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES =
particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstra=
ct truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant =
methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.<br>> > For those=
 who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even th=
e external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the w=
isdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita empha=
sises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Ad=
vaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it
 has retained=
 the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an=
 important practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way=
 with a marginal role for external practices.<br>> > <br>> > Yo=
ga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vair=
agya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally=
 emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara=
) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first =
two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.<br>> > <br>> > Bhakti =
marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will =
through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Kar=
ma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in action=
s without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the G=
ita.<br>> > <br>> > Finally I will address
 the Tantric path of=
 mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=
eby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=
ation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=
oyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=
t and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=
ed that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=
s, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=
e-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=
employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =
fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=
n.<br>> > <br>> > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with t=
he fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra em=
ploys highly powerful techniques that bring
 results more quickly it lays g=
reat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=
ualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=
upervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=
ny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=
edure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=
. However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awake=
ning the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kun=
dalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will =
refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other =
needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampa=
ra.<br>> > <br>> > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, o=
ne has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sad=
hana is one major river within the
 Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas =
cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually=
 three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dash=
aMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs=
 to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the =
picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to =
Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw atten=
tion to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advait=
ic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.<br>>=
; > <br>> > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma =
is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least =
at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mant=
ra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchroni=
stic frequencies for each of
 these three lineages. Initiation is the full-=
fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of th=
at path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with=
 SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-=
branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sa=
dhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern m=
etaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric =
advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the c=
onduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautif=
ul bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where th=
ere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =
till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabd=
a). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.<br>> > <br>> > As already state=
d Sakta sadhana seeks
 to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness =
through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana=
, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highl=
y comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the =
many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach=
. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanish=
ads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra=
. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantra=
marga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who expl=
ore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I=
 have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already incline=
d to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely p=
owerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel=
, the crowning
 glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself=
 proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a se=
cond, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?=
" (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflec=
t on the central truth of Advaita.<br>> > <br>> > The reason I =
advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language =
is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible o=
nly when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully fo=
llow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic an=
d Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri =
Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, espe=
cially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras =
or the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the =
practice
 of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Ved=
ic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic pract=
ice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully b=
ased on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with th=
e Hindu temple.<br>> > <br>> > Just as some practitioners do th=
e Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with th=
e Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do=
 the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that n=
eeds initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if o=
ne adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abh=
yasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devout=
ly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not incline=
d to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit fr=
om
 any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to be=
ar in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as wel=
l as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent o=
riginally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of init=
iation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<br>> > <br=
>> > In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the m=
erthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarap=
ranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all=
 effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc.,=
 some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioner=
s. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spirit=
ual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involv=
es Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer
 to t=
he question has to be contextualised.<br>> > <br>> > Finally on=
e last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA a=
re the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-stud=
y of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. Thi=
s is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATS=
ANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the a=
lternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. I=
t is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress =
in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtu=
e of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and s=
ants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a qua=
ntum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ram=
akrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.<br>>

 will just quote Swami Sivananda:<br>> > QUOTE // "There is a complai=

there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be=
 some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is t=
aking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and tr=
ying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, o=
ne may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be =
minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be m=
ore spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under =
the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas=
 is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in g=
arbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gent=
le deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out th=
e good
 fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi=
 or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good frui=
t comes out faster.<br>> > > ><br>> > > > At the en=

antras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize t=

 good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.<br>>

 I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not a=

In this age of Kali, She has become the later and she'll be happy if someon=
