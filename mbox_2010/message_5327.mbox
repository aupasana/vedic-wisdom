Namaste,
 
The divinizing =
of Physical body by Mahavatar Babaji is a scripture in itself, 
and since s=
uch a thing is not being idealized by any scripture, it only means 
that: "=
Scriptures other than Vedas contain partial truth". 

 
Can you name/quote/=
metion any exact references or statements from anywhere which 
explain how =
a physical immoratlity can be achieved. Mahavatar Babaji was the 
guru of L=
ahiri Mahasaya. Lahiri Mahasaya in many of his diaries speak of 
interactio=
ns between him and Babaji. But no where does Babaji state that 
physical im=
mortality is an objective to be attained or even achieveable. On the 
contr=
ary in the section where Babaji and his sister (who lives in samadhi under =

the dasasamedha ghata in Kasi) meet Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji states that he=
 is 
the only one who would be remaining in physical body till the end, no =
one else. 
Neither is this to be set as an achieveable target of spiritual =
progress, or 
else Lahiri Mahasaya and Babaji would have mentioned the same=
 clearly. 


Vedic method, worshipping the devatas, allows for immortality,=
 through Soma 
devata.
 
Why did not the Rishis of yore or even Krishna, at=
tain physical immortality till 
end of the cycle of creation? Because if on=
e is immortal in the physical body, 
one must survive in it till the end of=
 creation. Anything less is not exactly 
physical immortality, but only liv=
ing as long as it is necessary for one to 
live. Chang Dev Maharaj lived fo=
r 1400 years, and then gave up his body. He is 
not physically immortal.

N=
o one can attain liberation in Physical body, unless one divinizes it - Kri=
ya 
and Jnana are not a substitute to Iccha shakti.
 
Divinizing of the bod=
y may not necessarily be physical immortality at all. It is 
merely removin=
g impurities such that a higher consciousness can pervade 
throughout.

Namaskar,

Immortal and immortalizing =
Will is the "activating force" acting as precursor to 
all activity.

> > (=
2) Saints/yogis who ascended to the immortal planes with their physical bod=
y 
>(e.g. Sant Tukaram who was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha in his =

>*physical* body to live there forever!) never talked about such a pursuit=
.

Even yuddhisthir went to heaven in his physical body, but that is differ=
ent from 
divinizing the Physical body. Vishnu is one of the many devatas f=
rom which 
Physical consciousness finds its expression, another being Agni,=
 thus attaining 
divinity in body requires worshipping more than one devata=
 simultaneously.

> Striving for physical immortality as a great ideal can =
create such an unhealthy 
>fascination that is not idealized in any scriptu=
res.

The divinizing of Physical body by Mahavatar Babaji is a scripture in=
 itself, 
and since such a thing is not being idealized by any scripture,  =
it only means 
that: "Scriptures other than Vedas contain partial truth". 
=

They talk about the highest truth, but only Vedic method, of worshipping 
=
divinity in its numerous forms, is the most complete expression of truth fo=
r all 
the creatures in all the planes of existence. Such a worship would f=
inally lead 
to divinization of Physical body.

Vedic method, worshipping the devatas, allows for immortality, through So=
ma 
devata.

OTOH, if one doesn't perform th=

of mind, what to say of =
the body.

> All scriptures, whether it is Upanishads or Yoga Vaasishtham, =
say that you

=

Divinizing the Physical body itself will remove the sense of 
self-identif=
ication, Ahamkara, in any limited sense bound to a Physical body of 
ones' =
own possession or of the loved ones. No one can attain liberation in 
Physi=
cal body, unless one divinizes it - Kriya and Jnana are not a substitute to=
 
Iccha shakti.

<p><em></em> </p>
<p>Can you name/quote/metion any exact reference=
s or statements from anywhere which explain how a physical immoratlity can =
be achieved. Mahavatar Babaji was the guru of Lahiri Mahasaya. Lahiri Mahas=
aya in many of his diaries speak of interactions between him and Babaj=
i. But no where does Babaji state that physical immortality is an objective=
 to be attained or even achieveable. On the contrary in the section where B=
abaji and his sister (who lives in samadhi under the dasasamedha ghata in K=
asi) meet Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji states that he is the only one who would =
be remaining in physical body till the end, no one else. Neither is this&nb=
sp;to be set as an achieveable target of spiritual progress, or else L=
ahiri Mahasaya and Babaji would have mentioned the same clearly. </p>
<div>=
<br><em>Vedic method, worshipping the devatas, allows for immortality, thro=
ugh Soma devata.</em></div>
<p><em></em> </p>
<p>Why did not the Rishi=
s of yore or even Krishna, attain physical immortality till end of the cycl=
e of creation? Because if one is immortal in the physical body, one must su=
rvive in it till the end of creation. Anything less is not exactly physical=
 immortality, but only living as long as it is necessary for one to live. C=
hang Dev Maharaj lived for 1400 years, and then gave up his body. He is not=
 physically immortal.</p>
<div><br><em>No one can attain liberation in Phys=
ical body, unless one divinizes it - Kriya and Jnana are not a substitute t=
o Iccha shakti.</em></div>
<p><em></em> </p>
<p>Divinizing of the body=
 may not necessarily be physical immortality at all. It is merely removing =
impurities such that a higher consciousness can pervade throughout. </p>
