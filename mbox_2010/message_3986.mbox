The workings of karma are deep...consider this true-life example given
below.

Mr X and Mrs Y get married in 1975.

Following this, the close friend of Mr X gets married to the close friend of
Mrs Y a short while later due to the efforts of Mr X and Mrs Y. Call this
couple as AB

Thirty-odd years later on, AB helps the child of Mr X & Mr Y to get married.
Now the rnanubandhana is complete. Strange, is it not? and who can fathom
the workings of karma? Maybe an astrologer? Yes, an astrologer told Mr X and
Mr Y some 10 years back that the child would get married through one of Mr
X's friends. Hmm....

regards
Hari
