Sayantan Moshay! Bhalo na ki?

Welcome to God through Homa(m). My hearty co=
ngratulations for Homam, Varanasi trip, Financial success, spiritual awaken=
ing of parents and guidance of a friend as good as Rajarashi. I read your q=
uite an emotional message just as i finished my Ganapati Homam. thought of =
writing few things as i remembered my situation some One and Half year back=
.

I wrote this line in an email to my Guru:
"I am caught up in a dilemma f=
or starting Homa. The reasons seem to be formidable as described below...."=


I did start The Homam shortly after i wrote the above message. The first =
Homam was on the First day of Navaratri of 2008.

What i wish to emphasize =
is that, I also went through several miraculous events. I distinctly rememb=
er that once i wondered as to even one Homam per Month is also possible by =
me? and if you ask any Sadhaka, He or she will have something to share in t=
his regard (Not only Homam but for any Sadhana done for God. Looking back n=
ow i have started realizing that it is all DONE - by some power which is be=
hind the scene.
I sometime feel that My Guru's will is working in backgroun=
d.

***
For the questions you asked at the end of your message, i would say=
 that why worry if Monetary problems are getting solved fast and why worry =
if they are Not. However i would say that MahaGanapati is a fantastic God. =
HE'll not allow you or anybody to suffer on the contrary HE will ease the b=
urden of mundane trouble so that one performs the Saadhana quite comfortabl=
y. this is my experience. HE saves from many potential troubles. I suggest =
not to worry and just go ahead with Homam on DAILY Basis and also read Chan=
di Paath daily. Time is running out...Abhi nahi karega to saalaa Kabhi kare=
ga humlog. Pata nahi kab ye Diye ka tel khatm ho jaye?

And i would dare to=
 share one more phrase which i like very much and that is "Aisi ki Taisi". =
Have this attitude when you are cornered, challenged by hurdles that come i=
n your way of spiritual saadhana or when you feel very low...

Start relyin=
g on Mother, the Jagadamba...she will not let you down...

Durga Bhagavati =
Bhadra, Yayedam Dharyate Jagat

Your respected or otherwise senior :)
