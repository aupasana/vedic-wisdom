Those wh=
o follow monistic (Advaita) Vedanta, however, look upon this world as unrea=
l, like a dream. According to them Paramatman, or the Over-Soul, is the wit=
ness of the three states of consciousness, --waking, dream and dreamless sl=
eep. All these are ideas. The dream state is just as real as the waking sta=
te.=C2=A0Let me tell you a story.=C2=A0

Parable of the farmer and his only=
 child

There was a farmer who was a monist; he had attained to some realiz=
ation. He lived like any other farmer with his family, and he had a child. =
He and his wife had extreme love for this son because he was their only chi=
ld. The farmer himself was a very spiritual man.=C2=A0

He was respected an=
d loved by everyone in the village. Once he was working in the field, when =
suddenly a man brought the news of his son's severe illness. He went home, =
called physicians, took great care, but could not save the child's life.

E=
verybody in the household was overwhelmed with grief, but the farmer looked=
 as if nothing had happened. He consoled others by saying, "What can be gai=
ned by mourning over the child?" The next day he went to the field as usual=
, and after finishing his work he came home and found his wife and the othe=
r members of the family still weeping and wailing and plunged in deep sorro=
w.=C2=A0

The wife reproached him, saying: "How heartless you are! you have=
 not shed a single tear for your only child." The farmer then calmly replie=
d: "Shall I tell you why I do not weep? Last night I had a wonderful dream.=
=C2=A0

I saw that I was a king, and the father of eight beautiful children=
, and that I was enjoying all the pleasures and comforts of life. Suddenly =
I woke up and the dream passed away. Now I am in great confusion,-- whether=
 I shall weep and wail for my eight children or for this only one." [p. 93&=
 94]

The farmer was an Advaita Jnani, therefore he realized that the wakin=
g state was as unreal as the dream state, and that the one permanent Realit=
y was Atman. But I accept all states as true,--the state of Samadhi, which =
is the fourth state, and again, the waking, dream and dreamless sleep state=
. I accept Brahman the Absolute and Maya, Jiva (the individual soul) and th=
e world. If I do not take all, a portion will be missing and the weight wil=
l be less.=C2=A0
