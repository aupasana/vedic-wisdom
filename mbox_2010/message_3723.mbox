I recently found out that a small 5 year old girl(friend of my daughters) h=
as been very sick and is hospitalised. She might become bedridden for a lon=
g time or die. Her mother has been crying a lot ever since.The least I can =
do is perform homam for her. While mentally I will request god to help her =
but formally what changes need to be done in the homam manual so that my pr=
ayers get directed  towards her.Kindly suggest.

Thanks and regards,
Prm
