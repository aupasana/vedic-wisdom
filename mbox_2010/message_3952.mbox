Namaste Mitesh,

After a some thinking and going a over a few times, i felt=
 that it requires to respond to the message you have posted.

I am making f=
ew clarifications on your overall message. Like Rajarshi has mentioned, I w=
ish to say that many members of this list are well read. I assume that they=
 must have read many a books from different authors and covering many philo=
sophies. I have myself read books of various sages, yogis and philosophers.=
 It was not accurate when you said Vimalananda is the only saint, this list=
 discuss about. This assumption was not right.

I being a gruhastha, know v=
ery well, the importance of Material success, even for survival. I am not c=
ompletely against asking for some material success while doing some saadhan=
a (Say Homa, Japa etc...) but i feel that it is much better, atleast for pe=
ople who engage in serious saadhana, to consciously try for reducing and re=
moving the thoughts of some or the other wants. If i take my example, When =
i started Homam, i dont remember thinking anytime about money, fame, career=
 etc...during Homam or Japa. it is clear now to me that i was provided by M=
other what i needed to survive and even better. It also happened that I los=
t a good amount of money in a certain case but i never related to the Spiri=
tual practices especially Homam. Infact i tried not to relate any Material =
succes or losses to Homam. though I must say here that several people who a=
ttended Homam with me have been benefited materially and that has instilled=
 faith in them.
In my opinion, it is a very beautiful suggetion to leave it=
 to God to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is required and wha=
t is not for us rather than asking or doing saadhana for getting specific m=
aterial result on a *Regular basis*. but that is my personal opinion and it=
 can differ with yours and i respect that.

My message to Rajesh was on the=
 same line. as i known him, i was little personal when i wrote.

***
It is =
to be also noted that while this group is propogating Homam as Saadhana, it=
 also respect other paths such as Japa, Kirtana, Self inquiry. Narasimha an=
d others are open in that way. What i personally say is that do any saadhan=
a you like but do it with regularity, seriously and dedicatedly. Last thing=
 i (or others on the list) will want is to be fanatic about one particular =
saint or path or God or book.
However, i should also add here that after go=
ing through many books and many different forms of Saadhanas, it is better =
to get the crux, select one Saadhana or Idea to experience and stick to it.=
 reading many books has a danger of creating fascination for reading, gener=
ate confusions and stop one for engaging in to Saadhana.  

***
On some oth=
er discussions about Guru, I should put my personal experience again. I nev=
er hanker for Finding Guru. i never went out for that. Niether in Astrology=
 nor in Spirituality. As Ramakrsihna aptly used to say- "Satchidananda is t=
he real Guru". God is all knowing. i trust and relied upon. when my time wa=
s up, Guru in flash and blood came.

It is my habit to describe personal ex=
periences which may or may not be useful. As it is in fashion to say now a =
days - :Igonre me as a fool if it does not make any sense to you" and also =
"No Offence meant" is also another popular statement. 

Warm Regards,

Utpa=
l
PS: Raju, there is no pint of thinking as to how Homam will change your d=
estiny and such things. Let us review after a couple of years if anything h=
as changed.
