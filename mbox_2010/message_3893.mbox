The life of Mahalakshmi Amma is a heart-renting story. This is written by
S=
mt. T.R. Kanakammal, in Mountain Path issue of July -September 2008.

Mahal=
akshmi was the wife of Gangaraju Mallikarjuna Rao, from Vijayawada
region. =
They were Telugu Brahmins.Mr.Rao chanced to see a photo of Bhagavan
belongi=
ng to his friend, Balagopala Rao, a long time devotee from who was
living a=
t Palakottu. Mallikarjuna Rao had a darshan of Bhagavan Ramana in
1931.Bhag=
avan Ramana became his Sadguru instantaneously.For Mahalakshmi, her
mother =
was the guru. It was a good fortune for Rao that he married
Mahalakshmi.Her=
 first darshan of Bhagavan in 1933 was a deeply rewarding
experience for he=
r.Both became bhaktas of Bhagavan and visited the Asramam
frequently, never=
 missing Mahapuja and Jayanti celebrations. Bhagavan became
their family de=
ity and they performed pujas daily with offerings of various
kinds, as well=
 as regular recitation of Bhagavan's works.Mahalakshmi Amma
used to stay in=
 the house of Alamelu Athai after 6 p.m.Once on a Sri Rama
Navami day, Maha=
lakshmi prepared panakam, neer mor and vadai paruppu and
after offering to =
Sri Rama and Bhagavan's pictures at the house, rushed to
the Asaramam, with=
 bucketfuls of these items around 4 a.m! As she was not
conscious of the ti=
me, the attendants told her to go back. Bhagavan Ramana
who suddenly happen=
ed to see her, looked at her with compassion and
exclaimed: "Look! Lord Ram=
achandra has come to the Asramam so early. Come
and distribute the prasad t=
o everyone!"

This was one of the incidents to bring to light the extraordi=
nary purity of
her devotion, which was rewarded by Bhagavan Ramana.On anoth=
er day,
Mahalakshmi Amma had a dream where Bhagavan was asking her to prepa=
re some
mysorepak for Him! The next morning, Mahalakshmi Amma euphorically =
prepared
mysorepak, offered it to Bhagavan's picture in the house, and took=
 it to the
Asramam. Before that the couple decided to make a fullfledged bh=
iksha also
to Bhagavan Ramana and His devotees in the Asramam. During lunch=
, Bhagavan
and others were served by Mahalakshmi Amma herself. Bhagavan Ram=
ana, after
taking the mysorepak asked: "Will another piece be available to =
everyone?"
Mahalakshmi Amma who was in seventh heaven replied: "Why not Bha=
gavan!
Dhandikaundi!" (It is available in plenty). Bhagavan Ramana who neve=
r asked
for a second helping made an exception in her case, due to her pure=

devotion!

Mr. Mallikarjuna Rao was in transport business and owned a flee=
t of
buses.The couple thus became prosperous, but were simple souls,living
=
virtuous lives with generous charitable dispositions.Theirs was a prolific
=
family too. Mahalakshmi always had a small baby to nurse.Despite a long
jou=
rney from Vijayawada, they desired to meet Bhagavan Ramana as often as
poss=
ible, with all their children.They had five daughters and four
sons.Unfortu=
nately, all the four sons died young. The successive tragedy
broke their he=
arts and it was difficult for them to come to terms with this
tragedy.

Whe=
n a fifth son was born, they brought the child to the Asramam in its
sixth =
month for Anna Prasanam. (Introducing the child to Anna or cooked rice
for =
the first time). When they brought the child, Bhagavan Ramana agreed
saying=
, "Good!" They arranged for a bhiksha with Pal Payasam (Rice boiled in
milk=
 with sugar). When all sat for lunch, Chinnaswami brought a silver bowl
giv=
en by Mahalakshmi, with
Pal Payasam and placed it before Bhagavan.While Rao=
 was holding the child in
front of Bhagavan, He tasted a little of Payasam =
and fed the child with
Payasam three times. The child was indeed blessed. B=
ut after reaching home,
this child too unfortunately died.

The couple wond=
ered whether they were destined to have any male progeny at
all. They consu=
lted astrologers and did various rituals. Sometime in
1947-48, a sixth male=
 child was born to them. The couple decided to bring up
the child with begg=
ed food and begged clothes. The friends who knew this
peculiar "vrata" help=
ed them. After a few months, they again desired to
perform Anna Prasanam in=
 the holy presence of Bhagavan Ramana.

The family arrived in the Asramam o=
ne week in advance. They waited patiently
in front of the ladies' guesthous=
e for Bhagavan's return from the post
office. They prostrated and Rao told =
Bhagavan the reason for their visit and
then they held the child in front o=
f Bhagavan. Bhagavan Ramana playfully
snapped His thumb and middle finger t=
o attract the attention of the child.
The child, leaning towards Him and lo=
oking at Him fixedly, caught hold of
Bhagavan's hand and started to suck Hi=
s thumb! Bhagavan Ramana was amused
and said to the child, "Won't you go?" =
Rao had to forcibly take away the
child. A bhiksha was arranged for the aus=
picious day. When there were just
two days to go before the function, the c=
hild became suddenly ill, with high
fever. Dr. M.R. Krishnamoorthy, a devot=
ee of Bhagavan Ramana, who was then
at the Asramam, treated the child, but =
the fever did not subside.

Mahalakshmi Amma's heart became numb with fear.=
 She was convinced that if
Bhagavan were to touch the child and apply 'vibh=
uti' to its forehead, the
child would survive. She carried the child with s=
ome 'vibhuti' and waited
for Bhagavan Ramana to pass by from gosala. When s=
he prayed to Him, Bhagavan
Ramana remained silent for. She repeatedly begge=
d and beseeched Him and
Bhagavan, just to satisfy her, applied 'vibhuti' an=
d went on His way.
Unfortunately, the next day, the child died! Mallikarjun=
a Rao had been away
to Madras, and he was to return only the next day.

Bha=
gavan Ramana with great compassion and solicitude, sent someone to the
Rail=
way station to fetch him, with instructions to break the sad news only
on a=
pproaching the Asramam.When he did hear the news, he threw down on the
road=
 all the playthings
he had bought for his child and wept broken hearted.Whe=
n this was reported
to Bhagavan Ramana, He narrated the happening of the pr=
evious day, how
Mahalakshmi had insisted on His touching the child to apply=
 'the
vibhuti'.Bhagavan Ramana said: "Wondering why I just kept quiet in sp=
ite of
her insistence, she begged and so I applied 'the vibhuti'. The next =
day, the
child died. Nayana used to tell all devotees, 'Do not allow childr=
en to be
touched by Bhagavan. If you do, He will liberate them at once!' "
=

But a slender hope lurked in Mahalakshmi Amma, who had boundless faith in
=
and devotion to Bhagavan. She hoped that the child might, by Bhagavan's
Gra=
ce, come back to life. Those were the days, when orthodoxy reigned
supreme =
and orthodox rules forbade her to bring the lifeless body of the
child into=
 the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, although her maternal heart
yearned for H=
is Grace.

A little distance away from the path to the 'gosala' was a huge =
haystack.
With great terpidation and hesitation, she brought the lifeless c=
hild and
laid it on the ground by the haystack and waited with abundant hop=
e for
Bhagavan to pass by. Varanasi Subbalakshmi Amma, who was by her side
=
consoled her and gave moral support to the grieving mother.

When Bhagavan =
Ramana did come, Mahalakshmi was hesitant to come near and
prostrated from =
where she was. Bhagavan, the very embodiment of compassion,
stopped and res=
ted His eyes on the child with a long look of grace. He stood
in silence fo=
r sometime and proceeded on His way. The desolate mother took
in the situat=
ion and stood speechless. She resigned herself to her
'prarabdha' from whic=
h she realized that there was no escape. Next day, they
bathed the child an=
d adorned it with garlands from the Matrubhuteswara
Temple. Later that morn=
ing, they buried the child.

They then packed for the trip home. Their trai=
ts was leaving at 9 p.m. and
at 2 p.m. they came into the presence of Bhaga=
van Ramana, in the Jubilee
Hall in order to take leave of Him and avoid the=
 crowd which would gather
around for Vedaparayanam in the evening. As if to=
 do away with their grief,
the divine will prompted a devotee to pose certa=
in questions to Bhagavan
Ramana, the answers to which brought soothing comf=
ort to the sorrow stricken
parentss and lifted them from their despondency.=
 Bhagavan's responses gave
them courage and fortitude and made them feel co=
nsoled at the thought that,
as the child had given up his body in the Holy =
Abode of Bhagavan, hsi short
prarabdha had been spent, he must have attaine=
d a high state of being in his
spiritual evolution.

Early next morning, wh=
en Bhagavan Ramana enquired where the child had been
buried, he was told, '=
Somewhere outside.' Bhagavan Ramana remarked, "This
child could have been b=
uried here, but if that had been done, this place
would become a general bu=
rial ground."

When I (Kanakammal) narrated His comment to Mahalakshmi, dur=
ing her next
visit, she felt tremoundously comforted and said: "The child's=
 spiritual
future has been assured!"

Mallikarjuna Rao, was a tall, hefty a=
nd robust looking.Mahalakshmi was tall
as well, but slim and delicate. Her =
frail frame belied her mental fortitude,
resoluteness and indomitable inner=
 strength. She wore a sari in the Andhra
Brahmin style, and like Suri Nagam=
ma, was endowed with luxuriant, long, dark
hair. But she lived an austere a=
nd orthodox life with self imposed rules of
physical and mental discipline.=
She would get up at 3.30 am everyday and
after a bath,engage herself in puj=
a and parayana and reciting her favourite
book, Grantha Mala (The Complete =
Works of Bhagavan, in Telugu). Her major
occupation during the day was tell=
ing the beads of a mala (rosary) with
Bhagavan's name. Even while engaged i=
n household work, like cutting
vegetables, or cooking, she would be speakin=
g mentally to Bhagavan, saying,
" Bhagavan!I am making such and such vegeta=
ble today, as per your command."
Thus with her mind focussed on Bhagavan an=
d with all her constant thoughts
and actions centred on Bhagavan, she creat=
ed an atmosphere permeated with
the presence of Bhagavan and revelled in it=
, wherever she was.

Mahalakshmi Amma, had a large family to attend to and =
whilst doing so she
had the habit of executing all the household work as th=
ough commanded by
Bhagavan Ramana. Whatever was cooked, was eaten only afte=
r being offered to
Bhagavan. While, eating, whether at home or outside, she=
 observed silence.
Even in the Asramam, due her strict adherence to orthodo=
x rules, she used to
dine in the kitchen with the permission of the Asrmam =
management.When coming
for lunch,she would bring three small bowls in a bag=
. Receiving a small
quantity of side dishes in the bowls and rice on a leaf=
 plate, she would
never acccept a second helping. Even the served food she =
ate only after
offering it to Bhagavan Ramana. She was to be found at all o=
ther times to
remain in dhyana in Bhagavan's Hall. Even after the traged na=
rrated above,
the couple with their other children frequently visited the A=
sramam.

The entire family came to the Asramam for the 'kumbhabhisekham of =
the
Matrubhuteswara Temple. The children, especially the older ones who had=
 for
some time not had the opportunity to sit with Bhagavan during lunch, l=
onged
to sit beside Him. The day of their return home was fast approaching.=
 One
day, Mahalakshmi Amma managed to bring all of them just in time for lu=
nch.
Somehow she managed to find places for everyone except for herself and=
 the
eldest daughter, who was very disappointed as she was unsure whether s=
he
would accompany her parents the next time. Both stood at the threshold o=
f
the dining hall from where they feasted their eyes on Bhagavan. When lunc=
h
had been completely served to everyone, Bhagavan usually signalled its st=
art
by nodding His head. But this time, He looked to His left and right, to=
ld
someone to lay two more leaves, between Him and the entrance of the kitc=
hen
and asked Mahalakshmi and her daughter to seat themselves before these
=
leaves.He waited until they had been served and only then nodded, signallin=
g
the start of the lunch. As their leaves were so near Bhagavan's leaf, wit=
h
great reverence mingled with awe, they took the greatest care not to scat=
ter
any rice out of the leaves.They ate happily, enjoying the meal and the
=
profound grace of Bhagavan. They respectfully waited until Bhagavan finishe=
d
His food. Mahalakshmi often recalled this incident with tears, gratefully=

saying how fortunate their family was to be blessed by Bhagavan again and
=
again.

When they heard of the impending operation on Bhagavan for the canc=
erous
growth, they immediately travelled to the Asramam.A throng of people =
had
gathered, however, darsan for that day was over. Early next morning,
Ma=
halakshmi arrived at the Asramam and sat at the entrance of the Mother's
Te=
mple, in front of the closed doors behind which Bhagavan Ramana was
resting=
. As she was telling her beads, suddenly the doors opened and
Bhagavan emer=
ged.Looking at her, Bhagavan said, "Um...Um...", acknoweldged
her presence =
and walked to the now Mahanirvana Room. That every afternoon,
darsan re-com=
menced and they returned home after jointly seeing Bhagavan!

Later, when B=
hagavan's health had deteriorated very badly, they were unable
to stay away=
 and returned again to the Asramam, which was now swarming with
people. Mah=
alakshmi had brought with her a new towel, some raisins and sugar
cubes.She=
 stood opposite the Mother's Temple and looked towards the Nirvana
Room.Her=
 one longing was to preserve these items as relics, after wiping the
feet o=
f Bhagavan with the towel and after a simple glance at the raisins and
suga=
r cubes by Him.Tears were streaming down her cheeks.Bhagavan the living
emb=
odiment of compassion, sent a Telugu-speaking gentleman to find out what
sh=
e wanted. When she disclosed her desire, the gentleman taking the articles
=
with Him, informed Bhagavan of her desire. Then Bhagavan, the ocean of
grac=
e, stretched His feet so that he would wipe both His feet with that
towel. =
Bhagavan, who could now eat practically nothing, ate a few of the
raisins. =
When all the three items were returned to her, Mahalakshmi Amma was
overwhe=
lmed by great joy and profound grief at the same time. She preserved
these =
items as most precious relics in her puja room and worshipped them
till the=
 end of her life.

Such a tranquil life, poised in joy and serenity, was no=
w buffeted by
storms. Misfortunes befell,starting with the Mahasamadhi of B=
hagavan. Soon
aferwards, Mallikarjuna passed away.In the absence of a compe=
tent person to
conduct the family business it soon fell into decline. Their=
 affluence
faded.With only two daughters married, the entire responsibilty =
of marrying
the other two daughters, had to be borne by her, though she was=
 assisted by
her elder son-in-law.Caught as she was in the tribulations of =
supporting her
family, her visits to the Asramam became few and far between=
.But her inner
poise and serenity remained untouched. At last, when all res=
ponsibilities
had been discharged by the grace of Bhagavan, she resumed her=
 visits to the
Asramam. Though her husband had bought a huge plot of land o=
n which to build
a house, for various reasons this did not materialize, so =
she rented a
room.Now she further tightened her self-imposed disciplinary r=
ules.She at
only what she had cooked for herself -- a simple lunch in the a=
fternoon and
a light meal at night.It was a spartan life, given wholly to d=
evotional
practice and dhyana.With no more responsibilities weighing her do=
wn, she was
like a bird released from its cage. Unattached, independent, hi=
ghly
dispassionate, and beaming with joy, her life reflected her inner peac=
e.

Once she arrived back at the Asramam, after a long time.There was a
not=
iceable difference in her appearance.With the loss of her husband, she
had =
adoped the attire of a widow, white saris with a small coloured border
at t=
he bottom. But now her long hair was gone and she was dressed in the
strict=
 orthodox garb of a widow -- we saw a plain white sari with shaven
head.The=
 only ornaments were a 'rudraksha mala' and a 'spatika mala'.She
looked the=
 picture renunciation.I asked her why she had resorted to such an
extreme s=
tep of self-abnegation.She explained what had happened.

When things took a=
 turn for the worse, she had needed spiritual reassurance
to steady her inn=
er peace which was seriously threatened.The Paramacharya of
Kanchipuram [Sr=
i Chandrasekhara Saraswati Swamigal] and Abinave Vidya
Teertha of Sringeri =
Math,were both then touring Andhra Pradesh separately,
camping at various p=
laces. The high esteem in which she had held the revered
Acharya of Kanchi =
Kamakoti Math made her decide to meet him, but strict
orthodoxy stood in he=
r way.Brahmin widows with unshaven heads [in those
days] could view him onl=
y from a distance. To have a private audience with
him or to get the 'prasa=
d' of holy water from him, she had to shave her
head. The prospect of dista=
nt darsan did not satisfy her.Her tenacity of
purpose and her eagerness not=
 to let the opportuntiy slip away, decided the
issue. Her hair, that was ti=
ll luxuriant, was cut off and her head
shaved.Now she sought and got the lo=
nged-for private interview with the
Sage.The outcome was very positive. Her=
 inner poise was restored and she
followed him thorughout his tour in Andhr=
a.Thus reassured she was at peace
as never before, with all the composure o=
f still waters.

When she became old, she could not come to the Asramam, as=
 before and it was
through one of her daughters who came occasianally that =
I [Smt. Kanakammal ]
got news of her. After sometime I heard of her passing=
 away. The adversities
she had faced after the demise of her husband were i=
nnumerable. But she had
faced them with equqnimity. Because her heart was f=
amily anchored at
Bhagavan Ramana's feet, she emerged victorious from all s=
truggles, with her
inner calm unruffled.

Thus ended the inspiring life of =
a pure and holy devotee who had to wage a
heroic battle with life, armed so=
lely with the weapon of pure devotion and
the grace of Bhagavan Ramana and =
the kingdom of peace was her gain. This
echoes what the Lord said in Srimad=
 Bhagavatam, in Skandam 10, Chapter 88,
Versses 8-9:

The meaning of which =
is:

"He on whom I am going to bestow My Grace, I solemnly deprive of him o=
f all
his wealth. When his wealth has gone, all his friends,his kith and ki=
n will
desert him, making him sink into the utmost sorrow and despair. When=
 his
further efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to My will, he become=
s
filled with dispassion and becomes
associated with My devotees. On such a=
 one, I bestow My Grace."

The story of Mahalakshmi Amma illustrates that a=
 householder, amidst the
constant demands of family duty and the call of mu=
ltifarious
responsibilities, through steadfast devotion to her guru, can ri=
se higher in
esteem and greateness that ordinary ascetics and renunciates.

s child too unfortunately died.<br>

<br>The couple wondered whether they w=
ere destined to have any male progeny at all. They consulted astrologers an=
d did various rituals. Sometime in 1947-48, a sixth male child was born to =
them. The couple decided to bring up the child with begged food and begged =
clothes. The friends who knew this peculiar "vrata" helped them. =
After a few months, they again desired to perform Anna Prasanam in the holy=
 presence of Bhagavan Ramana.<br>

<br>The family arrived in the Asramam on=
e week in advance. They waited patiently in front of the ladies' guesth=
ouse for Bhagavan's return from the post office. They prostrated and Ra=
o told Bhagavan the reason for their visit and then they held the child in =
front of Bhagavan. Bhagavan Ramana playfully snapped His thumb and middle f=
inger to attract the attention of the child. The child, leaning towards Him=
 and looking at Him fixedly, caught hold of Bhagavan's hand and started=
 to suck His thumb! Bhagavan Ramana was amused and said to the child, "=
;Won't you go?" Rao had to forcibly take away the child. A bhiksha=
 was arranged for the auspicious day. When there were just two days to go b=
efore the function, the child became suddenly ill, with high fever. Dr. M.R=
. Krishnamoorthy, a devotee of Bhagavan Ramana, who was then at the Asramam=
, treated the child, but the fever did not subside.<br>

<br>Mahalakshmi Am=
ma's heart became numb with fear. She was convinced that if Bhagavan we=
re to touch the child and apply 'vibhuti' to its forehead, the chil=
d would survive. She carried the child with some 'vibhuti' and wait=
ed for Bhagavan Ramana to pass by from gosala. When she prayed to Him, Bhag=
avan Ramana remained silent for. She repeatedly begged and beseeched Him an=
d Bhagavan, just to satisfy her, applied 'vibhuti' and went on His =
way. Unfortunately, the next day, the child died! Mallikarjuna Rao had been=
 away to Madras, and he was to return only the next day.<br>

<br>Bhagavan =
Ramana with great compassion and solicitude, sent someone to the Railway st=
ation to fetch him, with instructions to break the sad news only on approac=
hing the Asramam.When he did hear the news, he threw down on the road all t=
he playthings<br>

he had bought for his child and wept broken hearted.When=
 this was reported to Bhagavan Ramana, He narrated the happening of the pre=
vious day, how Mahalakshmi had insisted on His touching the child to apply =
'the vibhuti'.Bhagavan Ramana said: "Wondering why I just kept=
 quiet in spite of her insistence, she begged and so I applied 'the vib=
huti'. The next day, the child died.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bo=
ld">Nayana used to tell all devotees, 'Do not allow children to be touc=
hed by Bhagavan. If you do, He will liberate them at once!' "</spa=
n><br>

<br>But a slender hope lurked in Mahalakshmi Amma, who had boundles=
s faith in and devotion to Bhagavan. She hoped that the child might, by Bha=
gavan's Grace, come back to life. Those were the days, when orthodoxy r=
eigned supreme and orthodox rules forbade her to bring the lifeless body of=
 the child into the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, although her maternal hear=
t yearned for His Grace.<br>

<br>A little distance away from the path to t=
he 'gosala' was a huge haystack. With great terpidation and hesitat=
ion, she brought the lifeless child and laid it on the ground by the haysta=
ck and waited with abundant hope for Bhagavan to pass by. Varanasi Subbalak=
shmi Amma, who was by her side consoled her and gave moral support to the g=
rieving mother.<br>

<br>When Bhagavan Ramana did come, Mahalakshmi was hes=
itant to come near and prostrated from where she was. Bhagavan, the very em=
bodiment of compassion, stopped and rested His eyes on the child with a lon=
g look of grace. He stood in silence for sometime and proceeded on His way.=
 The desolate mother took in the situation and stood speechless. She resign=
ed herself to her 'prarabdha' from which she realized that there wa=
s no escape. Next day, they bathed the child and adorned it with garlands f=
rom the Matrubhuteswara Temple. Later that morning, they buried the child.<=
br>

<br>They then packed for the trip home. Their traits was leaving at 9 =
p.m. and at 2 p.m. they came into the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, in the J=
ubilee Hall in order to take leave of Him and avoid the crowd which would g=
ather around for Vedaparayanam in the evening. As if to do away with their =
grief, the divine will prompted a devotee to pose certain questions to Bhag=
avan Ramana, the answers to which brought soothing comfort to the sorrow st=
ricken parentss and lifted them from their despondency. Bhagavan's resp=
onses gave them courage and fortitude and made them feel consoled at the th=
ought that, as the child had given up his body in the Holy Abode of Bhagava=
n, hsi short prarabdha had been spent, he must have attained a high state o=
f being in his spiritual evolution.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:ital=
ic">Early next morning, when Bhagavan Ramana enquired where the child had b=
een buried, he was told, 'Somewhere outside.' Bhagavan Ramana remar=
ked, "This child could have been buried here, but if that had been don=
e, this place would become a general burial ground."<br>

<br>When I (=
Kanakammal) narrated His comment to Mahalakshmi, during her next visit, she=
 felt tremoundously comforted and said: "The child's spiritual fut=
ure has been assured!"</span><br><br>Mallikarjuna Rao, was a tall, hef=
ty and robust looking.Mahalakshmi was tall as well, but slim and delicate. =
Her frail frame belied her mental fortitude, resoluteness and indomitable i=
nner strength. She wore a sari in the Andhra Brahmin style, and like Suri N=
agamma, was endowed with luxuriant, long, dark hair. But she lived an auste=
re and orthodox life with self imposed rules of physical and mental discipl=
ine.<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">She would get up at 3.30 am everyday a=
nd after a bath,engage herself in puja and parayana and reciting her favour=
ite book, Grantha Mala (The Complete Works of Bhagavan, in Telugu). Her maj=
or occupation during the day was telling the beads of a mala (rosary) with =
Bhagavan's name. Even while engaged in household work, like cutting veg=
etables, or cooking, she would be speaking mentally to Bhagavan, saying, &q=
uot; Bhagavan!I am making such and such vegetable today, as per your comman=
d." Thus with her mind focussed on Bhagavan and with all her constant =
thoughts and actions centred on Bhagavan, she created an atmosphere permeat=
ed with the presence of Bhagavan and revelled in it, wherever she was.</spa=
n><br>

<br>Mahalakshmi Amma, had a large family to attend to and whilst do=
ing so she had the habit of executing all the household work as though comm=
anded by Bhagavan Ramana. Whatever was cooked, was eaten only after being o=
ffered to Bhagavan. While, eating, whether at home or outside, she observed=
 silence. Even in the Asramam, due her strict adherence to orthodox rules, =
she used to dine in the kitchen with the=C2=A0permission of the Asrmam mana=
gement.<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">When coming for lunch,she would bri=
ng three small bowls in a bag. Receiving a small quantity of side dishes in=
 the bowls and rice on a leaf plate, she would never acccept a second helpi=
ng. Even the served food she ate only after offering it to Bhagavan Ramana.=
 She was to be found at all other times to remain in dhyana in Bhagavan'=
;s Hall. Even after the traged narrated above, the couple with their other =
children frequently visited the Asramam.</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"fon=
t-style:italic">The entire family came to the Asramam for the 'kumbhabh=
isekham of the Matrubhuteswara Temple. The children, especially the older o=
nes who had for some time not had the opportunity to sit with Bhagavan duri=
ng lunch, longed to sit beside Him. The day of their return home was fast a=
pproaching. One day, Mahalakshmi Amma managed to bring all of them just in =
time for lunch. Somehow she managed to find places for everyone except for =
herself and the eldest daughter, who was very disappointed as she was unsur=
e whether she would accompany her parents the next time. Both stood at the =
threshold of the dining hall from where they feasted their eyes on Bhagavan=
. When lunch had been completely served to everyone, Bhagavan usually signa=
lled its start by nodding His head. But this time, He looked to His left an=
d right, told someone to lay two more leaves, between Him and the entrance =
of the kitchen and asked Mahalakshmi and her daughter to seat themselves be=
fore these leaves.He waited until they had been served and only then nodded=
, signalling the start of the lunch. As their leaves were so near Bhagavan&=
#39;s leaf, with great reverence mingled with awe, they took the greatest c=
are not to scatter any rice out of the leaves.They ate happily, enjoying th=
e meal and the profound grace of Bhagavan. They respectfully waited until B=
hagavan finished His food. Mahalakshmi often recalled this incident with te=
ars, gratefully saying how fortunate their family was to be blessed by Bhag=
avan again and again.</span><br>

<br>When they heard of the impending oper=
ation on Bhagavan for the cancerous growth, they immediately travelled to t=
he Asramam.A throng of people had gathered, however, darsan for that day wa=
s over. Early next morning, Mahalakshmi arrived at the Asramam and sat at t=
he entrance of the Mother's Temple, in front of the closed doors behind=
 which Bhagavan Ramana was resting. As she was telling her beads, suddenly =
the doors opened and Bhagavan emerged.Looking at her, Bhagavan said, "=
Um...Um...", acknoweldged her presence and walked to the now Mahanirva=
na Room. That every afternoon, darsan re-commenced and they returned home a=
fter jointly seeing Bhagavan!<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Lat=
er, when Bhagavan's health had deteriorated very badly, they were unabl=
e to stay away and returned again to the Asramam, which was now swarming wi=
th people. Mahalakshmi had brought with her a new towel, some raisins and s=
ugar cubes.She stood opposite the Mother's Temple and looked towards th=
e Nirvana Room.Her one longing was to preserve these items as relics, after=
 wiping the feet of Bhagavan with the towel and after a simple glance at th=
e raisins and sugar cubes by Him.Tears were streaming down her cheeks.Bhaga=
van the living embodiment of compassion, sent a Telugu-speaking gentleman t=
o find out what she wanted. When she disclosed her desire, the gentleman ta=
king the articles with Him, informed Bhagavan of her desire. Then Bhagavan,=
 the ocean of grace, stretched His feet so that he would wipe both His feet=
 with that towel. Bhagavan, who could now eat practically nothing, ate a fe=
w of the raisins. When all the three items were returned to her, Mahalakshm=
i Amma was overwhelmed by great joy and profound grief at the same time. Sh=
e preserved these items as most precious relics in her puja room and worshi=
pped them till the end of her life.</span><br>

<br>Such a tranquil life, p=
oised in joy and serenity, was now buffeted by storms. Misfortunes befell,s=
tarting with the Mahasamadhi of Bhagavan.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:b=
old">Soon aferwards, Mallikarjuna passed away.</span>In the absence of a co=
mpetent person to conduct the family business it soon fell into decline. Th=
eir affluence faded.With only two daughters married, the entire responsibil=
ty of marrying the other two daughters, had to be borne by her, though she =
was assisted by her elder son-in-law.Caught as she was in the tribulations =
of supporting her family, her visits to the Asramam became few and far betw=
een.But her inner poise and serenity remained untouched. At last, when all =
responsibilities had been discharged by the grace of Bhagavan, she resumed =
her visits to the Asramam.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Though her=
 husband had bought a huge plot of land on which to build a house, for vari=
ous reasons this did not materialize, so she rented a room.Now she further =
tightened her self-imposed disciplinary rules.She at only what she had cook=
ed for herself -- a simple lunch in the afternoon and a light meal at night=
.</span>It was a spartan life, given wholly to devotional practice and dhya=
na.With no more responsibilities weighing her down, she was like a bird rel=
eased from its cage. Unattached, independent, highly dispassionate, and bea=
ming with joy, her life reflected her inner peace.<br>

<br><span style=3D"=
font-weight:bold">Once she arrived back at the Asramam, after a long time.T=
here was a noticeable difference in her appearance.With the loss of her hus=
band, she had adoped the attire of a widow, white saris with a small colour=
ed border at the bottom. But now her long hair was gone and she was dressed=
 in the strict orthodox garb of a widow -- we saw a plain white sari with s=
haven head.The only ornaments were a 'rudraksha mala' and a 'sp=
atika mala'.She looked the picture renunciation.I asked her why she had=
 resorted to such an extreme step of self-abnegation.She explained what had=
 happened.<br>

<br>When things took a turn for the worse, she had needed s=
piritual reassurance to steady her inner peace which was seriously threaten=
ed.The Paramacharya of Kanchipuram [Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati Swamigal] =
and Abinave Vidya Teertha of Sringeri Math,were both then touring Andhra Pr=
adesh separately, camping at various places. The high esteem in which she h=
ad held the revered Acharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Math made her decide to meet=
 him, but strict orthodoxy stood in her way.Brahmin widows with unshaven he=
ads [in those days] could view him only from a distance. To have a private =
audience with him or to get the 'prasad' of holy water from him, sh=
e had to shave her head. The prospect of distant darsan did not satisfy her=
.Her tenacity of purpose and her eagerness not to let the opportuntiy slip =
away, decided the issue. Her hair, that was till luxuriant, was cut off and=
 her head shaved.Now she sought and got the longed-for private interview wi=
th the Sage.The outcome was very positive. Her inner poise was restored and=
 she followed him thorughout his tour in Andhra.Thus reassured she was at p=
eace as never before, with all the composure of still waters.</span><br>

<=
br>When she became old, she could not come to the Asramam, as before and it=
 was through one of her daughters who came occasianally that I [Smt. Kanaka=
mmal ] got news of her. After sometime I heard of her passing away. The adv=
ersities she had faced after the demise of her husband were innumerable. Bu=
t she had faced them with equqnimity. Because her heart was family anchored=
 at Bhagavan Ramana's feet, she emerged victorious from all struggles, =
with her inner calm unruffled.<br>

<br>Thus ended the inspiring life of a =
pure and holy devotee who had to wage a heroic battle with life, armed sole=
ly with the weapon of pure devotion and the grace of Bhagavan Ramana and th=
e kingdom of peace was her gain. This echoes what the Lord said in Srimad B=
hagavatam, in Skandam 10, Chapter 88, Versses 8-9:<br>

<br>The meaning of =
which is:<br><br>"He on whom I am going to bestow My Grace, I solemnly=
 deprive of him of all his wealth. When his wealth has gone, all his friend=
s,his kith and kin will desert him, making him sink into the utmost sorrow =
and despair. When his further efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to M=
y will, he becomes filled with dispassion and becomes<br>

associated with =
My devotees. On such a one, I bestow My Grace."<br><br><span style=3D"=
