3rd September, 1948

Three Anglo-Indian lady-doctors came from Bangalore. O=
ne of them had
recently lost her husband in an air crash. She asked Sri Bha=
gavan:

Lady. Is there rebirth?

Bh. Do you know what birth is?

L. O yes, =
I know that I exist now, but I want to know if I=E2=80=99ll exist in
the fu=
ture.

Bh. Past!.... Present!.... Future!....

L. Yes, today is the result =
of yesterday, the Past, and tomorrow, the
Future, will be the result of tod=
ay, the Present. Am I right?

Bh.There is neither Past nor Future. There is=
 only the
Present.Yesterday was the present to you when you experienced it,=
 and
tomorrow will be also the present when you will experience it.
Therefo=
re experience takes place only in the present, and beyond
experience nothin=
g exists.

L. Are then Past and Future mere imagination?

Bh. Yes, even the=
 Present is mere imagination, for the sense of time
is purely mental. Space=
 is similarly mental;therefore birth and
rebirth, which take place in time =
and space cannot be other than
imagination.
