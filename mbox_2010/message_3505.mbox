 the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly=

 around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people who work =

10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pitch bla=

ot sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to react. As=
 we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of curiosity=
=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes and medit=
ated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous energy. Some=
thing of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity.=
 While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too turned. I co=
uld see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs in the sams=

> After waiting like this fo=
r about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major por=
tion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some tim=
e still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering =
was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync w=
ith his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the =
ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. =
But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to l=
ight other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pi=
eces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him n=
ot to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that=
 pyre again.

> Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =
of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=
 being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=
rom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=
 tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =
us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=
y nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=
 and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=
way to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=
ccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=
ck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=
. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it's head pointed in an an=
gular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an ani=
mal but a human being
>  watching. Just staring and observing every action.=
 Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.

he homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as=
 in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notch=
es above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.
> =A0
> Simply being in=
 a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on=
 the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body b=
urning. Both the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setti=
ng, this kind of a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart" which =
has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked=
 a feeling of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something fa=
r more real and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc wi=
ll perish as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.
> =A0

ish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to pleas=
e God through sadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor =
desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will=
 ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings =
will disturb you because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worship=
