Rudraaksh bhai !
Namaste,

>In short Bhakti is superior to Sadhana

Bhakti =
is the wonderful fruit of Severe Sadhana peformed and then Bhakti itself be=
comes a Sadhana (much refined). atleast i believe that and might be having =
incorrect understanding.
see its all cause and effect. effect is a cause re=
vealed and cause is the effect concealed...

Best Regards,

Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even k=

 My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar's take on Bhagavad Gita and I also=
 like Aadi Shankara's commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada's comme=

Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when =
you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana li=
