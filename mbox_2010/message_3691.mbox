Pranaams Shreyaji,

You can definately perform Chandi Homa. being a lady is=
 no hindrance. Only avoid to do homa during mentrual cycle.
Perform Homa an=
y time during day or night, which is comfortable for you. just take care th=
at you do not each atleast 3 to 4 hours before you start Homa. Take bath be=
fore starting Homa.

I belive that you are fluent with Chandi Paath. if not=
 than do not worry, just do the Homam with 4th and/or 11th chapter. if that=
 is not possible then just do it with 'Durga Saptashloki'.

Jai Mataji

Utp=
