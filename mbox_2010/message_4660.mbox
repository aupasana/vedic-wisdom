Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams.

In the books by Robert Svoboda, Vimalananda emphatically asserts that the
"true" Gayatri is hidden and available only to the rishis. Manish has also
given this opinion.

If this is indeed the case, then what is the relative importance of the
Gayatri mantra given in Rg Veda?

best regards
Hari
