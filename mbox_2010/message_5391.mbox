I bet very few of you perhaps ever heard such a clear and wonderful chantin=
g of Vedas.Won't write much so just go to link given below.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D+++++++=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

What is special?  


1. Three dimensional sou=
nd: viz, Sruti (Pitch) in X-axis, position of letters in Y-axis  and Svara =
(Intonation) in Z-axis is perfectly positioned through out.

2. Normally, i=
n any audio, two voices will be merged and channellised in both the  speake=
rs. Here, we are giving the two voices separately, instrumental music is  p=
laced as a background to the voices, to demonstrate and highlight, the voic=
e  synchronization and clarity, and to feel live experience of recitation. =


3. The pitch (Sruti) is maintained throughout, which is very rare. 

4. Y=
ou will be delighted to note the depth, punch, aggressiveness with force, c=
larity  and breathless recitation, though the words are very long and diffi=
cult to recite.

5. You can feel the Jeeva (that is life) in all recitation=
, since it is coming from Nabhi  (that is abdomen) of the person who recite=
s this.
