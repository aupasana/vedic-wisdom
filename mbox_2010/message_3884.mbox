Dear All,
I=C2=A0found this text useful for the group so wished to share it=
 with you.
This is from the book=C2=A0 Kumbha - India's Ageless Festival by=
 Dilip Kumar Roy and Indira Devi (Disciple of Shree Aurobindo).
Narasimha h=
as explained similar things several times, just the words are different.
Ho=
pe this is helpful to people to remove some of their doubts.
..............=
.
You go to the Vedantist seer and he will tell you solemnly that the one-w=
ithout the second is the unique dependable reality.
Next you to the Vaishna=
va saint who will tell you, in a voice choked with tears that the Divine ma=
nifest Himself through Krishna and his devotees.
=C2=A0
You go to the Shank=
arite and he will tell you categorically that only the Self can be the obje=
ct of your quest
=C2=A0
So also the Tantrik will tell you that, first and l=
ast one must take refuge in the Guru. 
=C2=A0
Tha Shaiva will say: bathe in=
 the Ganges never doubting her powers and you will be absolved from your si=
ns.
=C2=A0
The Avadhuta will tell you ironically that no Mother-Ganga cult =
will avail and that only hard austerities can purge you from evil.
=C2=A0
T=
he Shakta will tell you that by simply repeating the Name of the Mother Kal=
i will you be taken straight into Her bosom.
=C2=A0
The stern Buddhist will=
 warn you against the Phantom of Grace, add thing that nothing but your own=
 inflexible determination will lead you to the peaceful lap of Nirvana.
=C2=
=A0
One Prophet will aver that the man who walks with his woman, his shakti=
 will be the quicker to arrive. Another will admonish: beware of women =E2=
=80=93 the Lord comes on the to the solitary who fares alone to the Alone.
=
And then, O heavens! How each will quote scripture to make his point! The o=
ne with the lachrymose expression will advocate the worship of saints quoti=
ng the Bhagvat in his support
=C2=A0
To those who have not trodden the path=
 of spirituality, such virulent flings may, indeed seem called for since th=
e arguments, so far as they go, sound plausible enough. But to the authenti=
c spiritual aspirant who has had some firsthand experience of the mystic pa=
th and dived deeper for a clue to the seeming contradictions the plausibili=
ty of the indicter=E2=80=99s arguments will make little impression. For he =
will not only see that every doctrine or admonition must be judged in the c=
ontext in which it has been given, but that it did express=C2=A0 a truth wh=
ich however partial and incomplete in itself was a part of the total sympho=
ny a bead in the whole garland of wisdom. He will see that an injunction wh=
ich was beneficial in one century might well become the reverse in the late=
r one and which is more that the sages prescribed variously for various see=
kers because they came with various aspirations, receptivities, samskaras, =
needs and outlooks of life and Yoga.
 Thus for instance they did not ask th=
e householder to give up all he had trusting to the Divine Grace to maintai=
n him any more than they asked the aspirant who burned to stake everything =
for the Divine to cling to the world even when he was disgusted by the endl=
ess playing for safety of the worldly wise. Also, by means of the penetrati=
ng power of the light which they had evoked after a long and arduous=C2=A0 =
struggle with the human EGO they had achieved a deep insight into the human=
 psychology and so were able to give only such advice to as aspirant as wou=
ld proved really helpful to him. This advice was not the same for all becau=
se all could not arrive in the same way. A youthful cenobite with an unimpa=
ired body was counseled to practice asana and pranayama because he would be=
 able to bear the reaction brought on by such strenuous exercise, a middle =
aged head of a family was referred to simple meditation because he would no=
t be able to profit by a more
 austere technique, an old man was told to ta=
ke to the still simple process of just repeating a Name.
What a limited Mod=
ern mind with its insistence on reason regulating all our movements fails s=
o often to grasp is that the spiritual evolution as against that which is m=
erely moral or ethical seldom follows a straight line of ascent. Furthermor=
e the path of the spirit is the path of such strange happenings that it may=
 necessitate new orientations at every step. More explicitly what helps an =
aspirant at one stage of his evolution may hinder him at a later stage and =
conversely what hindered him at the bottom of the ascent may well help him =
when he has raised a few steps.
