In all other homams soon after making the last offering with the final mant=
ra we say vaushat. In Chandi homam after the final 700th verse should we sa=
y vaushat or swaha. 

Also the final line of the chapter 13 reads. 
" Surya=
j janm samasadhya savarnir bahvita manuh ll klim om ll "
Just confused, sho=
uld I say swaha after manuh and after klim om also.

The CHandi Path book t=
hat I have doesn't have dhyanam in the beginning of the chapters is it ok. =
Also dhyanam is followed soon after nyasa. When you say read the nyasa shou=
ld we include the dhynam also.

I want to read the kshama prarthna where ca=
n I include it. 

Thanks and Regards
