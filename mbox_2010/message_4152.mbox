Hello Nisha..

I see this stuff also. At first I thought it meant something=
 like maybe my sadhana is starting to bring towards enlightenment or some n=
onsense like that. The other thing I notice is that whenever there is some =
viewing of 'pheonomena' that my rational mind wants to interpret it, as if =
I were being shown some special nimitta that need to be interpreted. In the=
 railway station where I live the platform has these tiles coloured bright =
yellow, while waiting for train i will stare down at the ground at these ti=
les, after a while I will begin to see color purple on the ground. Interest=
ing indeed...

There is this natural occuring pheonomenon called flashing c=
olors where there is a corresponding color for every primary and simple com=
pound color. Take a bright singly coloured piece of paper or fabric and gaz=
e at it for a few minutes, then remove it and gaze at the white wall or som=
ething similar and see a luminescent flashing color. Yellow and Purple. Red=
 and Green. Blue and Orange.

Try it you'll see its very natural. It also o=
ccurs from gazing at the sun. There will be shades of indigo, purple and ma=
genta. What does it mean? nothing really....or perhaps we have only scratch=
ed the surface of truly experiencing our visual sense. From flat monochrome=
 to brilliant multidimesional luminosity.

my 2 cents.....

Ajaya
