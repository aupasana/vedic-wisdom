Dear Rama V,

"rendu ghadiala nalabhai vighadialaku aaru vela hamsa japamu =
jarugunu" 
mean? 

Rendu is two, Ghadiala , nalabhai is 40, vighadialaku, a=
aru is 6, vela is thousand, hamsa (uchvAsa and nisvAsa) Japamu, Jarugunu - =
will happen.

What this means is - In the span 2 ghadias and 40 vighadias (=
 2x24 min + 40 x24 sec =3D 54 minutes) =3D 54 minutes one can perform 6000 =
Hamsa Japam, and One be able to realize the chakras or the adhipathi at tho=
se chakras ?

This is really a herculean task, as my guru puts it, One can =
be in perfect Meditation with Pranayama for no longer than 20 minutes at a =
stretch. The goal is increase the 20 minutes to 54 minutes to achieve what =
Brahmam garu is saying. 

Hope this helps.

Thanks,

Ravi Gollapalli.
