Something related to this thread I found on internet.
Something similar men=
tioned by Vimlananda too.

>From the legendary stories of Shri Dattatreya, t=
he Adi-Naths speak of one which was short and simple, yet had vital lessons=
, and not only for the sadhus who had renounced. One story relates to the o=
pening of the Kali Yuga or Dark Age of mankind. Kali, who personifies the s=
pirit of this age, went to see Lord Brahma, to take his leave before descen=
ding to the earth to inaugurate and rule during the Kali Age. As he walked =
naked into the presence of Lord Brahma, he was holding his tongue with his =
left hand, and his penis in this right hand. Brahma looked at him, and aske=
d what was the significance of this unusual posture? Kali related that he d=
id not understand it himself, but when he had gone into the presence of Lor=
d Shiva to take his leave, he had announced that he was going to earth to h=
ave domain over all mankind. Shiva only laughed when he said this, and had =
informed him that he would have domain over most men, but not over the man =
who held his tongue
 and kept hold of his penis. Brahma also had to laugh, =
and told Kali that what Shiva had meant was that the man who kept a firm ho=
ld on his tongue and penis was not as likely to get into trouble as were me=
n who did not do so. Then it was Kali's turn to laugh, and he said, ``Don't=
 worry. I will find some way to make them let go.'' And with many he has, b=
ut the Age of Darkness is not dark to all men who have sought and found the=
 light of wisdom, no matter how dimly it burned.

arnt a very good thing today from Narasimha's message. What will be our con=

You have passionate=

thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episod=

wers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and=
 does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Bra=
hmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.

I whol=
e heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful =
in his 'Satyana Prayogo' about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual=
 matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature i=
n society. He really was a Saadhu.



There is a big difference between fal=
l of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar=
 didn't fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment fo=
r us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front o=
f the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blo=
w to faiths of general public.



I am not specific on Satyananda here beca=
use i do not know if it is really true.



If the footage is right, then i =
fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear=
 Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corru=
ption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.



> Further, in t=
his age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so >twisted and 



You hav=
e spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then say ev=
en 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very ela=
vated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains =
of sexual desires.



Finally, i would say that its high time for Big names=
 and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of  Vimal=
ananda or Mahatma Gandhi's bold approach to the subject of physical and men=
tal Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )

It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram's famous line

"Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tya=

There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the comin=
g years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating=
 them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, followin=
g, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the=
 midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, =
ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one thing leads to another and on=

 Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benef=
it whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his tea=
chings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if =
the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not beco=
