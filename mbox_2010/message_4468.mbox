The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or an=
y ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable m=
aterial or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most peop=
le have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event c=
annot fix things.

 

As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual) =
everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one's favor o=
ver the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one's spiritua=
l evolution.

 

If one has access and is able to engage a priest everyday =
or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.

Absolutely. We shoul=
d have nothing against them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging =
them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of t=
hem have no ability to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit o=
f others (like many priests of old days did) and hence people should not le=
ave the remedying of their problem completely to the priest (they are very =
likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize that they are on their=
 own and do something about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.

Jyotisha readings that you talk about the end a=

be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someo=
ne and giving a boost to one's material and spiritual pursuits (using one's=

 days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockage=
