Namaste Utpal

This is a very important question, I have asked this questi=
on myself
and searched for answers, while trying to do this, I found someth=
ing interesting. I have asked others ( people I found capable of answering)=
 this questions and gotten interesting answers.

What I found is, any type =
of sadhana homam, japan, reading chandi paath
or any remedial measures are =
very important and one must do more and 
more as capacity and capability pe=
rmits while always focusing on bhava, as bhava is the quality parameter it =
is more important than even pronounciation or time of japam  i.e 1 mala ver=
sus 10 mala for example. Always try to increase the bhava and not other phy=
sical parameters like doing japam for 2 hours versus 30 minutes or doing ho=
man daily versus weekly etc. Many times when we try to stick to a rigourous=
 schedule like doing daily atleast I have felt that many of those days the =
"bhava" is missing or mind is somewhere else.
Each individual can select wh=
at is best for him or her, I donot suggest any one way.

The "bhava" is mos=
t important measure and that needs to be increased or improved all the time=
. I could be one of the measures.

Almost most of the time while one starts=
 or appears to feel that journey on the path of sprituality is started, it =
is associated with increase in ego or other attributes that may make one ca=
reless.
Sometimes even getting a realized guru brings these distractions to=
o.

This is all play of maya or the chit vikara or accumulated sanskars in =
the mind. This has to play out, I am not sure one should attempt to avoid i=
t.

Coming back to the question, what I have found and has seen stressed ve=
ry little everywhere these days is what I call " Vaivhara Suddhi" or conduc=
t
in mind, physical form and other things. Vaivhara Suddhi opens the doors =
for Chit Suddhi or cleansing of the mind.

Doing all sadhana helps indirect=
ly to start on the journey of "Vaivhara Suddhi", But there is direct way to=
o and one can practise it directly like any sadhana on a  24 by 7 basis. It=
 is also a sadhana.

 
It is only with Vaivhara Suddhi" one can cleanse the=
 mind or Chitta. It is needed in the begining, middle and end, i.e. all tim=
es.

Once one cultivates, it becomes a true nature of oneself and then it i=
s always there but getting there is very long journey.

There are two aspec=
ts of chit suddhi, one is removing what is accumulated and stopping to accu=
mulate more sanskars.

Vaivhara Suddhi helps in stopping to accumulate more=
 and the other sadhanas that one does helps in removing the accumated sansk=
ars.

So both go hand in hand, doing one without other is no good,
it just =
adds more accumulations in the chitta.


Along with doing sadhana, one need=
s to integrate as many aspects of 
"Vaivhara Suddhi" like karma yoga, good =
behavoir, not getting angry
not screaming, forgiving, helping nature withou=
t any expectation, a disciplined life style, accept things as they are etc.=
 Again one can make a list of 10 limitations that one has, be genuine and h=
onest to oneself.

Some of the above can be monitored and one can overcome =
to a great extent by trying hard doing introspection of oneself.

One can s=
elect the top 10 limitations in oneself and try to focus on them or to star=
t with adopt 10 things and try to perfect them.

One saint suggeseted pledg=
ing everymorning and checking everynight
add the pluses and minuses and see=
 how to avoid minuses.

He also suggested in this journey one will fall dow=
n many times but
as soon as one falls down, one should get up and try again=
 to move forward.

The progress here in some ways is measurable how ever I =
must submit there is always a long way to go, it may take many lifetimes.

=
I have observed that as soon as one starts on this and becomes serious
more=
 challenges seem to come his or her way :-) my experiance

Sometimes when y=
ou try to do good, you get a lot of bad in return, may be it is all part of=
 cleansing :-).


I just narated a few observations of mine, I am sure I di=
d not answer your question here :-) ...... Enjoy the day

Best Regards on a=
 wonderful day of Akasya Trutiya
Please ignore any spelling deficiancies.
