Preface 

By Dr. Klaus=
 K. Klostermaier

"The Vedic Way of Knowing God" is obviously a work that h=
as grown over many years. While focused on Jiva Goswami's epistemology, it =
is much more than a conventional scholarly study of a particular Indian the=
ologian. It shows wide erudition and personal engagement, it is a critical =
study as well as a statement of faith. Embedding Jiva Goswami's writings in=
 the entire range of Hindu sacred literature the work shows at one and the =
same time Jiva's connectedness with the sanatana dharma and his originality=
 as a critic of some of this tradition's more extreme representatives.

Sri=
 Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales) is aware of the problems tha=
t Jiva's writings present, his apparent contradictions and the unresolved q=
uestions concerning the meaning of the Veda. Better than anyone before him,=
 he discloses Jiva's uncertainties and non-sequiturs. But he also shows how=
 one can at one and the same time avoid Jiva's obvious sectarian biases and=
 appreciate his genuine contribution to the hermeneutics of the Vedic corpu=
s, based on a Puranic tradition. 

While focusing on Jiva's epistemology th=
e Acharya provides a summary not only of Hindu, but also of Buddhist philos=
ophy and defines Jiva's place within the Indian tradition. Since shabda, "t=
he divine word" plays such a decisive role in Jiva's system the Acharya's o=
bservations on its nature and importance, are both profound and timely. The=
y are certainly relevant also for other theological traditions.

One of the=
 aims of this book is to get European and American philosophers interested =
in India's rich philosophical tradition. By showing his familiarity with We=
stern philosophy, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya acts as a bridge-builder be=
tween East and West. He also insists on the importance of "doing philosophy=
", i.e. showing the actual relevance of what is being discussed. The wide r=
ange of knowledge of Eastern as well as Western philosophy displayed in the=
 book should make it attractive even to those who so far have not been expo=
sed to Indian thought. The author's personal engagement constitutes by and =
in itself a philosophical undertaking of considerable weight. 

I hope and =
wish that this book would find many readers to continue the debate it initi=
ates. 

May the "The Vedic Way of Knowing God" be heard and followed by see=
kers in East and West!

Revealing the profound philosophical insigh=
ts of the world's most ancient spiritual philosophy, this book not only bol=
dly answers the question "How do I know God?" from the distinctly Vedic (Hi=
ndu) perspective, but also explores the further issues of what it even mean=
s to be able to know God. With greater detail than any other book ever writ=
ten to date, it reveals the precise mystical mechanisms employed for knowin=
g the Divine; the psychological conditions
necessary for such a spiritual e=
ndeavor; the transformative cognitive
experiences that occur within the spi=
ritual practitioner upon achieving God-realization; the integral relationsh=
ip between transcendent Word, spiritually revealed literature, and the impo=
rtant role of living teachers; and the vast implications of the Vedic world=
-view on contemporary global philosophy and religion. If you have ever aske=
d the question "How do I know God?", this is the book that will give you th=
e precise road-map!


"The Vedic Way of Knowing God", by Sri Dharma Pravart=
aka Acharya


PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO ALL SINCERE SPIRITUAL SEEKERS.
