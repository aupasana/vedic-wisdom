Namaskaram.

I do daily homa and am sharing here my method (which may not b=
e wholly
orthodox or correct, so take it with lots of grains of salt) to ma=
ke it
feasible. I think my prep time takes less than 5 mins; the actual hom=
a takes
me 45 - 50 mins. I also do a separate sadhana that takes me 20 mins=
--so, all
together, I spend 80-90 mins in the morning doing homa and sadhan=
a. These
are the steps I follow for the homa:

I keep the copper kunda in a=
n aluminum tray, which rests upon two bricks on
the floor, and the two bric=
ks are on top of a folded heavy-duty black
garbage bag. I don't fuss much a=
bout cleaning before and after each homa,
because this arrangement protects=
 the floor, so just on the weekends, I
clean it up properly by replacing / =
emptying the tray, and vacuuming /
wiping any residue. This havan "area" is=
 fixed and I do not remove it after
each homa--it's like a fixed altar.

Ne=
xt to the kunda area, I keep a small shrine where everything is laid out
fo=
r the daily homa. There is a small mandap for keeping the kalasha and
vigra=
has, and in front, I keep a supply of the samagri needed for the puja
(ghee=
, aarti tray with diya and dhoop stand, kumkum, gandhan, agarbatti,
etc.), =
oil for the diya, matches and a tray full of coconut halves. (I do
not cut =
the coconut halves into strips for the homa; I just use one coconut
half pe=
r homa). This arrangement prevents having to gather and
arrange everything =
from scratch each day.

The main kalasha I only exchange the water once a w=
eek; during the week, I
let the water accumulate the vrttis from the succes=
sive homas.

Accordingly, on any given day, all I have to do to prepare for=
 the homa is
the following: Empty the burnt offerings from the previous day=
's homa (which
I offer to my plants outside as "fertilizer"--they really th=
rive on it!),
fill the pancha patra with water, and cut a few flowers for t=
he homa
offerings. I bring these back to the havan kund, fill the lamp with=
 oil and
a wick, arrange the vigrhas for that day's homa (I do homa to diff=
erent
deities on different days), put the prasad in a little offering bowl,=
 and
can sit directly for homa. So, this whole procedure takes me less than=
 5
mins.

I do not bother with melting the ghee, even though I live in cold=
 climes in
England. I have a 1/2 kg container of ghee, that I use each day,=
 and I find
that after using it once, it stays in melted / liquidish form (=
if homa is
done at least every 2-3 days) and once I bring the wooden spoon =
to the kund
and heat up the ghee, and go back to scoop some more ghee from =
the
container, the heat from the spoon does the rest of the melting. (Again=
,
maybe this is not kosher and is "wrong" from a madi perspective, so pleas=
e
take with a grain of salt.)

For prasad, I use nuts, and I also use nuts =
for the bali, so I do not spend
time preparing food or cutting fruit.

I ha=
ve found this to be quite feasible to do on a daily basis--that, too,
while=
 keeping a separate sadhana that takes an additonal 20-30 mins in the
morni=
ng and working a hectic 80+ hours / week job, so it can definitely be
done!=
 Just try it for a few days and I think you'll be able to come up with
your=
 own routine.

Again, I'm not at all advising to follow what I do (because =
my shortcuts may
be wrong), but just wanted to share as a brainstorming ide=
a.

Warm regards,
Aditi

<p>Hi Everyone, <br><br>As I practise Homam more and more,=
 I want to do it on a daily basis, but I want to know how to make it faster=
 for a daily ritual. Yes there are short and supershort procedures but what=
 I notice is that I spend more time in preparing for Homam, than the actual=
 homam itself. Is it the same with everyone else? Arranging for Alumium Wra=
p around the homa kundam, and within the fire-place, and outside of it, Mel=
ting the ghee, arranging for water, Akshatas, flowers, incense sticks, camp=
hor, oil lamp, wicks, firewood, dry coconuts, Havan Samagri, water, prepara=
tion of Kalasam etc., takes at least about 15 minutes prior to starting of =
the homam. Also, preparation of maha naivedyam (either ravva kesari or swee=
t rice pudding [payasam]), which I normally do, takes another 20 minutes at=
 the minimum. For these reasons, I am unable to do it other than weekends. =
So, generally I end up doing a Ganapati homam on Sundays. Any ideas as to h=
ow to make it faster for a daily ganapati homam? Also I generally make offe=
rings with Gayatri Mantra in every homam, I want to know if there is an exc=
lusive Gayatri Homam with Gayatri being the main deity, with prana pratisht=
apana mantra etc., or can we just do the Gayatri Avahana (that we do in San=
dhyavandanam) at the homam? The reason I ask this is, I sometimes do Purasc=
haranas of Gayatri (currently doing one), usually about 24,000 over a perio=
d of 40 days and then offer 10% of the same in Homam. Those 2,400 I make an=
 offering into the fire without any exclusive prana pratishtapana of Gayatr=
i, but generally as part of Ganapati Homam itself, because I don't know=
 any other way to do this. Any advice?<br>

<br>Also as I understand Adi Sa=
nkaracharya has established six orders of religion (Ganapatyas, Koumararas,=
 Vaishnava, Shaiva, ShAktEya and Soura orders). I wonder if there is a homa=
m for Kumara Swamy. For the rest, there is one, if I am right, although I a=
m not sure if there is one exclusively for Lord Surya. I heard of Navagraha=
 homams though. <br>

<br>Also Kumaraswamy is not part of Pachayatana pooja=
, which is also established by the Jagat Guru. Why?<br><br></p></div>
