Dear Utpal,

Adding a few=C2=A0comments from my=C2=A0side on the science as=
pect of the debate:-

=C2=A0Vitamin B12 is not easily available from the pl=
ant source which is actually 
plenty in Eggs. On the other side the Vegetar=
ians can get that from Yoghurt, 
Cheese and such foods. And such many point=
s can be discussed from both the 
sides.
=C2=A0
As I kept mentioning before=
 as well, there are two aspects of this, assimilation 
and bio-availability=
. In both counts, milk and yogurt fall short as has been 
seen often (which=
 is still not a problem if correct quantity is there in intake, 
but how ma=
ny people drink enough milk or have enough yogurt on a daily basis?), 
not =
to forget the fact that the cost is far more prohibitive=C2=A0for a poor ma=
n. 
Same with essential amino acids. The veg sources of the same are far mo=
re 
costly, and the reason for this is the rarity of=C2=A0the means by whic=
h they have to 
be=C2=A0acquired compared to the non vegeterian sources.=C2=
=A0Thus=C2=A0bio-avaiabilty, which 
is a key factor in determining organic =
sources of food, is clear 
why=C2=A0meat/fish/egg is=C2=A0necessary=C2=A0an=
d became a part of standard diets way way back.
=C2=A0
Anyway, if someone w=
ants to ignore science, that is fine. But not everyone can. 
=C2=A0
In scie=
nce, at least in the science of nutrition,=C2=A0it is never about a 
argume=
nt=C2=A0vs b argument. The confusion has been created in the last decade by=
 
motivated vegans, cherry picking and=C2=A0misquoting=C2=A0from research p=
apers to suit a 
view point. The=C2=A0scientists who=C2=A0study=C2=A0nutrit=
ion and dietetics, have no such 
confusions. A 4 year course in ditetics an=
d clinical nutrition=C2=A0in the best 
universities in the world will teach=
 the same things, that without animal 
proteint diet=C2=A0assimilation beco=
mes weak and unbalanced, not to mention the=C2=A0fact 
that=C2=A0they (veg =
alternatives)=C2=A0are not=C2=A0as organic or=C2=A0rampantly available, plu=
s the 
prohibitive=C2=A0cost factor. That the gut structure of humans are i=
deally=C2=A0suited for 
omnivorous diets, that human cropping and animal pr=
otien intake was responsible 
for the three times increase in brain mass fr=
om the times of Australopithecus 
afarensis, roughly 4 to 6 million years a=
go, that the lack of caecum cannot make 
humans digest plant cellulose easi=
ly etc etc...
=C2=A0
Obviously, Nature had a good reason for making humans =
turn omnivorous.
=C2=A0
___________
=C2=A0
About=C2=A0the ethical aspects, =
it is difficult to debate on them because everyone 
has an outlook and worl=
dview which maybe different, plus, there is too much 
sentimentalism. 

=C2=
=A0
-Best regards

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Food=
 we eat

=C2=A0 
Few more thoughts on the ongoing subject=E2=80=A6

There i=
s hardly any utility to bring science in this issue to prove points on 
eit=
her side.

1) For e.g., Vitamin B12 is not easily available from the plant =
source which is 
actually plenty in Eggs. On the other side the Vegetarians=
 can get that from 
Yoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And such many points ca=
n be discussed from both 
the sides.

2) Few of the Arguments of Vegetarian=
s and vegans is that of "Formation of 
Teeth", "Formation of Intestines" et=
c=E2=80=A6 They say that Human teeth formation and 
digestive systems are n=
ot suitable for diet from the source of Animals. They 
site the examples of=
 a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and compare that 
with Humans. Whic=
h I found not proved when I see people around me. Majority of 
the populati=
on today and earlier are meat eaters and there does not seem any 
noticeabl=
e physical difference which suggest any difficulties for them. It is 
also =
noticed that because of High protein contents, they are well built. Same 
w=
ay Physical strength, stamina, recovery from Illness and such were never is=
sues 
with generations of people in India and else where who never used mea=
t and sea 
food in their diet.

So science will not be able to give definit=
ive answer for some one to decide 
between 2 strict options, unless science=
 proves without a doubt, that a certain 
disease or a Physical ailment or a=
 mental abnormality is only because of *eating 
meat* or *NOT eating meat* =
and that should also clearly visible in practical 
cases which affect large=
 section of masses. Till that time, so called science, 
will mainly be used=
 as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and 
Non-vegetarianism =
because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patients, 
Blood pressure =
problems and such many commonly seen diseases are found in all 
sections of=
 society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians. Both sections 
are liv=
ing their lives for Generations and generations.

Regarding Holistic approa=
ch, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6

1) One of My very close doctor frien=
d who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in 
Pediatrics) and a strict vegetarian=
 who also obviously contains a vast knowledge 
of medical science gave me a=
 certain interesting fact. During his studies, their 
batch was once taken =
to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of 
the biggest Sla=
ughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals are 
slaughtered =
to meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and 60% is 
export=
ed mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch could not 
st=
and the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Almost everybody=
 
including himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaughterhouse and=
 left 
the place with heavy hearts.

2) There are meat eaters who are well =
advanced in spiritual path and there are 
vegetarians who are utterly selfi=
sh and deep down in materialism hence I refrain 
to talk on that line. Only=
 I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and 
such terms should n=
ot be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something 
which is une=
thical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while better 
alterna=
te sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tickle the 
p=
alate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mars, be it =

Kaliyuga or Satyuga.

3) Solution is not to look if a Famous Saint or Phil=
osopher or any body, famous 
or otherwise, approves meat eating or disprove=
s it or suggests middle approach, 
it does not make any difference. If Vima=
lananda emphatically suggest not to eat 
meat or otherwise (Vimalananda was=
 very clear for meat eating though), does not 
make any difference. Law of =
Karma might be infinitely complex and might need 
deepest of understanding =
but that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next 
birth is there or n=
ot? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive 
should be our=
 own Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart. 
Why de=
pend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat or 
sh=
ould not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not know if =
I 
kill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I will =
be 
killed by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Hardly =
anybody 
knows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure that =
the meat I am 
eating has been of an animal that has been butchered mercile=
ssly. That much is 
known without a doubt and that should make me think. If=
 *avoidable*, I must not 
eat that. It is that simple. Do not need further =
approval of anybody and no 
amount of arguments from Science or culture or =
religions or whatever should 
stand for me. Do I need to even look at those=
? NO.

Best Regards,

Utpal

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A=
dding a few comments from my side on the science aspect of the de=
bate:-</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> <EM>Vitamin B12 is not easily ava=
ilable from the plant source which is actually plenty in Eggs. On the other=
 side the Vegetarians can get that from Yoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And=
 such many points can be discussed from both the sides.</EM></DIV>
<P><EM><=
/EM> </P>
<P>As I kept mentioning before as well, there are two aspect=
s of this, assimilation and bio-availability. In both counts, milk and yogu=
rt fall short as has been seen often (which is still not a problem if corre=
ct quantity is there in intake, but how many people drink enough milk or ha=
ve enough yogurt on a daily basis?), not to forget the fact that the cost i=
s far more prohibitive for a poor man. Same with essential amino acids=
. The veg sources of the same are far more costly, and the reason for this =
is the rarity of the means by which they have to be acquired comp=
ared to the non vegeterian sources. Thus bio-avaiabilty, which is=
 a key factor in determining organic sources of food, is clear why mea=
t/fish/egg is necessary and became a part of standard diets way w=
ay back.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Anyway, if someone wants to ignore science, t=
hat is fine. But not everyone can. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>In science, at lea=
st in the science of nutrition, it is never about a argument vs b=
 argument. The confusion has been created in the last decade by motivated v=
egans, cherry picking and misquoting from research papers to suit=
 a view point. The scientists who study nutrition and dietet=
ics, have no such confusions. A 4 year course in ditetics and clinical nutr=
ition in the best universities in the world will teach the same things=
, that without animal proteint diet assimilation becomes weak and unba=
lanced, not to mention the fact that they (veg alternatives) =
;are not as organic or rampantly available, plus the prohibitive&=
nbsp;cost factor. That the gut structure of humans are ideally suited =
for omnivorous diets, that human cropping and animal protien intake was res=
ponsible for the three times increase in brain mass from the times of Austr=
alopithecus afarensis, roughly 4 to 6 million
 years ago, that the lack of =
caecum cannot make humans digest plant cellulose easily etc etc...</P>
<P>&=
nbsp;</P>
<P>Obviously, Nature had a good reason for making humans turn omn=
ivorous.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>___________</P>
<P> </P>
<P>About t=
he ethical aspects, it is difficult to debate on them because everyone has =
an outlook and worldview which maybe different, plus, there is too much sen=
timentalism. </P>

<P>Few more thoughts on the ongoing subject=E2=80=A6<BR><BR=
>There is hardly any utility to bring science in this issue to prove points=
 on either side.<BR><BR>1) For e.g., Vitamin B12 is not easily available fr=
om the plant source which is actually plenty in Eggs. On the other side the=
 Vegetarians can get that from Yoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And such man=
y points can be discussed from both the sides.<BR><BR>2) Few of the Argumen=
ts of Vegetarians and vegans is that of "Formation of Teeth", "Formation of=
 Intestines" etc=E2=80=A6 They say that Human teeth formation and digestive=
 systems are not suitable for diet from the source of Animals. They site th=
e examples of a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and compare that with =
Humans. Which I found not proved when I see people around me. Majority of t=
he population today and earlier are meat eaters and there does not seem any=
 noticeable physical difference which suggest any difficulties for them. It=
 is also noticed that
 because of High protein contents, they are well buil=
t. Same way Physical strength, stamina, recovery from Illness and such were=
 never issues with generations of people in India and else where who never =
used meat and sea food in their diet.<BR><BR>So science will not be able to=
 give definitive answer for some one to decide between 2 strict options, un=
less science proves without a doubt, that a certain disease or a Physical a=
ilment or a mental abnormality is only because of *eating meat* or *NOT eat=
ing meat* and that should also clearly visible in practical cases which aff=
ect large section of masses. Till that time, so called science, will mainly=
 be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and Non-vegetar=
ianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patients, Blood pre=
ssure problems and such many commonly seen diseases are found in all sectio=
ns of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians. Both sections are=
 living their
 lives for Generations and generations.<BR><BR>Regarding Holi=
stic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6<BR><BR>1) One of My very c=
lose doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in Pediatrics) and a s=
trict vegetarian who also obviously contains a vast knowledge of medical sc=
ience gave me a certain interesting fact. During his studies, their batch w=
as once taken to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of th=
e biggest Slaughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals are =
slaughtered to meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and 60=
% is exported mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch co=
uld not stand the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Almost=
 everybody including himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaughter=
house and left the place with heavy hearts.<BR><BR>2) There are meat eaters=
 who are well advanced in spiritual path and there are vegetarians who are =
utterly
 selfish and deep down in materialism hence I refrain to talk on th=
at line. Only I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and such te=
rms should not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something w=
hich is unethical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while bett=
er alternate sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tic=
kle the palate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mar=
s, be it Kaliyuga or Satyuga.<BR><BR>3) Solution is not to look if a Famous=
 Saint or Philosopher or any body, famous or otherwise, approves meat eatin=
g or disproves it or suggests middle approach, it does not make any differe=
nce. If Vimalananda emphatically suggest not to eat meat or otherwise (Vima=
lananda was very clear for meat eating though), does not make any differenc=
e. Law of Karma might be infinitely complex and might need deepest of under=
standing but that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next birth is
 t=
here or not? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive shoul=
d be our own Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart.=
 Why depend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat=
 or should not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not kn=
ow if I kill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I =
will be killed by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Har=
dly anybody knows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure th=
at the meat I am eating has been of an animal that has been butchered merci=
lessly. That much is known without a doubt and that should make me think. I=
f *avoidable*, I must not eat that. It is that simple. Do not need further =
approval of anybody and no amount of arguments from Science or culture or r=
eligions or whatever should stand for me. Do I need to even look at those? =
NO.<BR><BR>Best Regards,<BR><BR>Utpal<BR><BR>--- In <A

My views are there on this subject in archives. I wanted to stay away but s=

) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so many of researches and plenty of=
 informations available on the Internet, One will never be able to come to =
a definitive conclusions.<BR>> <BR>> 2) I never argue with people (ev=
en when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea
 of vegetarian food)=
 with the above basis.<BR>> Whatever said and done, people will continue=
 eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as well. I=
 have, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing with p=
eople giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, own set=
s of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.<BR>> <BR>> 3) I=
nstead I appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topi=
c comes up, only one simple thing - "I dont want to kill for filling up my =
Stomach" and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on=
 your own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now reali=
ze the Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a..=
.., Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few=
 seconds, how you pent for the Air and Now realize the "Chhatpataahat" of a=
 fish forced out of water.<BR>> <BR>> And
 all these, because one wis=
h to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a habitual palate or both. Eve=
n vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other food stuff but the ver=
y vital difference is that such craving does not need killing!<BR>> <BR>=
> 4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan, has l=
eft eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for his l=
eaving meat is because I told my views him a few times when such discussion=
s came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion of Non-=
Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him for he =
really seems to have thought about it and dared to change his swabhava whic=
h is so very difficult.<BR>> Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to expre=
ss my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea is appreciat=
ed by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are also taken a b=
ack with this idea. All though they know
 from their hearts of hearts, it c=
omes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up. Most of u=
s are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea would have=
 gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will germinate.=
<BR>> <BR>> 5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is goo=
d and that side is bad. It'll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It i=
s to just appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the r=
ational Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a perso=
n and if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final remin=
der of "Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma" at least to those of us =
who believe in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.<BR=

 and articles
 by Peta members are far more convincing for switching to Veg=

their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on net an=

 this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.<BR>> > <BR>> &g=
t; By 'Practically impossible' I meant the cost factor and demand/supply fa=
ctor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45=
% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied b=
y Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes =
(including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nu=
ts (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn't mention), Dairy products (Mi=
lk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete=
 source), <BR>> > <BR>> > In last two years, their demand rose =
by
 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of =
population can not afford a complete balanced diet as recommended by Expert=
s which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables,=
 150 gms of fruits per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These ar=
e approx minimum quantities. Different sources may quote different quantiti=
es). There is average family size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs =
per day! And nutrition is not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of o=
ther expenditures are there<BR>> > <BR>> > Even at current pric=
es, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additional 40% is inclu=
ded in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% and I need not to=
 explain what will happen at that time.<BR>> > <BR>> > Sir, I a=
m not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for=
 milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can
 not e=
xpect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produc=
e it yourself)<BR>> > <BR>> > Again, I think and believe that p=
ractically it is impossible to shift all the population to veg sources espe=

urces<BR>> > <BR>> > It is always a questionable point. because=
 again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which=
 support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. bu=
t if we think scientifically we will find that for different sources differ=
ent sources are better. For example calcium animal sources are best (Includ=
ing milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for pro=
teins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we ca=
n not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet.
 Obviously humans=
 can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree wi=
th the values given by Rajarshi ji.<BR>> > <BR>> > Yes, I agree=
 Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetaria=

mas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting foo=
d, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after fo=
od, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spic=
