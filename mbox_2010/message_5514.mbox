      Namaskar smartxpark,

    What you say is correct, Sans=
krit and its grammar gives one a high that other languages do not. It is be=
cause the Beeja vibrations resonate with the astral centers. The secret lie=
s in choosing the right beeja for the recitation of mantras and commune wit=
h divinities of the creation. There is only one right beeja for one person,=
 amongst the 49 beejakshara from HaM to SaM constituting 49 Maruts or astra=
l-life currents, that allows a person to contact the divinities.



It is a=
lways useful to progress on the most reasonable path of ones' own choosing =
because that would safeguard one from failures and pitfalls created by othe=
rs' immature advice. 

   That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively f=
ew quarters around the world, does speak a lot about his immaturity in diss=
eminating his teachings in a useful manner.



There are people who are stu=
pid enough to call the Path/Goal of others as wrong, without trying to unde=
rstand why they are on that path in the first place. It is important to saf=
eguard oneself from these people, who act as leaders to an emaciated (spiri=
tually, mentally) following, because they feed their following on words & p=
reachings rather than Action and Knowledge.



It is always useful to stand=
 apart from the herd mentality on yahoogroups, because that would allow one=
 to see farther than the group and move towards Vedas i.e. a universal appr=
oach to evolution.



You are on a better path studying and enjoying sanksr=
it, as a Vedanga, however, sanskrit is only a tool that should be used as a=
 language of mantras for resonating ones' being with the 27 divinities enum=
erated in Jyotish (another Vedanga) as the Devas of 27 Nakshatra, in accord=
ance with the "Rules of Worship" set by RigVeda. The truth of being is more=
 likely to be found there than anywhere else including the writings of like=
s of Adi Shankara.



Regards,

Aryama
