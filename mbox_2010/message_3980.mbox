Namaste Vijay

Thanks for this, this helps, since day one I thought about =
this type of short version, this is exactly what I was looking since the fi=
rst time I saw the homam manuals.
Two or three times I started writing it o=
n piece of paper but it never went further. Then of late i.e a week or so a=
go, I even thought in a creative way to download adobe software the lets yo=
u edit the pdf files.
 
Wow I am very thankful to you, may be even this exc=
use of mine for not doing homan is gone :-)

Thanks once again to you and N=
arasimha from the bottom my heart.

Now we have Somavati Amavasya on monday=
, so a good day to do tarpana
and then devi navratri starting from tuesday.=


I read in a gujarati newspaper Somavati Amavasya is good for doing remedi=
es for pitru dosh. One can do abhishek to lord shiva on a shiva linga,
usin=
g sweet milk, sugarcane juice or ghee and chanting simple "om namah shivaya=
" or even maha mrutunjaa mantra.

Again it appears we are in some special t=
imes right now with 4 planets
in pisces. This is a special time to do spirt=
ual sadhanas.

Best Regards
Mitesh

 If you want to use it for another God/Goddess, you may have to make minor =
