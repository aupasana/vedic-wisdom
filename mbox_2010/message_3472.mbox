Namaste All,
=C2=A0
While re reading my mails after I sent them to the list=
, I found many silly errors of spelling and grammer. I was writing in a flo=
w and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read throug=
h them. As they say, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
During the =
day time, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we =
never visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, "What about the temp=
les? Won't we visit them?". Manish retorted immediately, "=C2=A0Aren't we=
=C2=A0going to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?"! I silently a=
greed. This is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters tem=
ples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roads=
ide temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then rem=
ark, "There is something here."
=C2=A0
During evening we went to visit the =
Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during t=
he 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bo=
ught some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent,=
 then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we meditated for somet=
ime, Manish did=C2=A0 pranam=C2=A0at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who wa=
s the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Sama=
dhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=
=A0 Manish, on being=C2=A0questioned, said that many sadhanas have been don=
e here in this place for long by people with no mundane desires. Therefore,=
 the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram we found som=
e quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish called Aruni=
sha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English, it read, "I=
f you have to give your head off to get a sadguru, you
 have=C2=A0got it ch=
eap".
=C2=A0
By 8 PM we sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so t=
hat we had sufficient time before going to the samshan. Ideally you should =
have an empty stomach while performing any sadhana to get the best effects.=
 The amount of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - =
Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (exi=
stential fire) which exists in the subtle body. It is the second which must=
 increase in order for one to "digest" various experiences/ideas/etc. It ca=
n only increase when the Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full =
stomach. When we are extremely focused on something and working intently on=
 the same, we forget food, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increa=
se in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agni.
=C2=A0
As we sat eating our =
food and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation=
 mentioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we =
(Manish, Arunisha and=C2=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. 
=C2=A0
Manish sa=
id, "It is the same set of=C2=A0souls who come back=C2=A0again and again in=
 different bodies and personalities at different times, who=C2=A0are respon=
sible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Prithvir=
aj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc." He continued, "They =
can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for them to =
accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land=C2=A0wh=
ich we call India=C2=A0today.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is =
Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one =
mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made P=
rithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently contemplated her fate.=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
"One very senior Rishi has decided to=C2=A0change this land back to a R=
ishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=C2=A0Ved=C2=A0Dharma will be re establ=
ished here along the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or might=
ly, be it an individual or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0can stand against the will of a=
 Rishi."=C2=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent question here. "What were the Ris=
his doing for=C2=A0one thousand years?". Manish laughed and said, " A Rishi=
 can very well spend a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then s=
uddenly=C2=A0one day=C2=A0wake up from meditation=C2=A0and see that Rishi b=
hoomi is gone=C2=A0and all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So =
He decides, it is time to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys=
 have no clue about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change=
 a universe, changing a country is child's play for Him." Wow. I let all th=
ese sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadha=
na, in some manner or the other.
=C2=A0
As night approached midnight, Manis=
h and I left for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of=
 Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghat=
s, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on=
 a pyre. He said=C2=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shi=
va. Worshipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhan=
a. Shiva is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one=
 must develop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=
=C2=A0worshipping the divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimal=
ananda says, "Let the Mother show you the face of the Father". The topic dr=
ifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikar=
nika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain=
. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then staring a=
t the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled lightly and
 added, "That man was=
 something." This was again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before =
which Mainsh continued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants if =
Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power=
 of a deity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalan=
anda has created a army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books=C2=A0are l=
ike a Bible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later =
on I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which =
Manish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the i=
mportant question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell sile=
nt hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimal=
anda does mention that a time will come when his "children" would spread ho=
mas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. 
=C2=A0
We re=
ached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place w=
here we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the bod=
y had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs c=
ame and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any mo=
re. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upward=
s=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher.=
 He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I=
 countinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and w=
hen he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came to=
wards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahad=
ev". This homa was faster. He did not use any "samputs", but a direct, stra=
ight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, =
pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was=

 enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In=
 Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of=
 the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In ol=
d times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contempo=
rary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. May=
be it is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place fo=
r these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so ma=
ny people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb,=
 everyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why =
there are people here even so late in the night.
=C2=A0
Once the final purn=
ahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster th=
an previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At one =
point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across the len=
gth and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes=
 after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an ho=
ur. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then =
a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his e=
yes. Manish remarked, " I could have just left my body and gone off. It did=
 not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I =
was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back.=
" Smiling he added, "What a sight it would have been for the people to see,=
 how the body can be left at will".=C2=A0 I did not know what to say. 
=C2=
=A0
We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt.=
 The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. The dom ca=
me forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0f=
rom the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and p=
lacing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0=
motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the=
 bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we us=
e a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both dead -=C2=
=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, "Maza aya?". I s=
miled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should write a=
bout this experience in the coming days. Let people know.
=C2=A0
By this ti=
me I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=
=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed,=
 " Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well." Manish said we had =
a rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.
=C2=A0
As w=
e were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2=A0of Sh=
iva's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "safe" sam=
shan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The trish=
ul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturb=
ance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even at 2 a=
m in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions ar=
e genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.
=C2=A0
=
While walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totally deserted, Manish=
 instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I =
caught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving fast, trying to k=
eep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thou=
ght and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Mani=
sh told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha o=
r a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do n=
ot wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water=
=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the water. Generally they may=
 not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only in=
side the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spel=
t the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city =
of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is =
their city.
=C2=A0
Next morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night'=
s homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally c=
omfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to s=
how its effects, one must get the intonation perfect. This age most people =
cannot do that. I=C2=A0enquired that I had heard from someone that a certai=
n procedure needs to be done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. =
Manish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0"Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe=
 to kuch nehi aata!".=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
While talking abo=
ut Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice b=
ecame slow and heavy,=C2=A0"The color of Rama's body is deep blue with a go=
lden tinge all=C2=A0around him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2=A0was the kavac=
ha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs.=
 It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=
=C2=A0is so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 ho=
urs he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas kha=
dga. It was a=C2=A0mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadg=
a had become part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessl=
y at the slightest=C2=A0command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the =
enemy. 
=C2=A0
And Rama removed even=C2=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought l=
ike a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which=C2=A0means; he even =
removed the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human=
. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the me=
re mention of the name of Sri Rama?". 
=C2=A0
He spoke with such an energy =
which cannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Saty=
a Hai.
=C2=A0
Thus ends my recounting of our fascinating trip to Kasi.

Dear Narasimha
=C2=A0
It may sound weird, but this is what hap=
pens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in anot=
her kind of chess game. 
=C2=A0
Great analogy. Manish had given this analog=
y to us after he=C2=A0completed a beautiful=C2=A0Ganapati homa last August.=
 There is=C2=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. 
=C2=A0=

Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention a few points=
 which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:
=C2=A0

At the =
end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standin=
g and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming day=
s you will write about this experience in a public forum. Therefore my mail=
s.
=C2=A0

Caveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhan=
a, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=
=C2=A0only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can =
try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Ma=
nish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=A0I was only doing the Chan=
di Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, tr=
y out this sadhana. 
=C2=A0

Many people have a negative=C2=A0bias towards =
Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or under=
standing of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in rec=
ent time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying the=
m as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue wh=
at they are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved =
biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-r=
ealization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some do=
n't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have =
a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual gian=
ts have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. Th=
e 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vim=
alanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand obj=
ective=C2=A0account of how a
 powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed.=
 Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.
=C2=A0

There are many people in th=
is age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for thi=
s kind of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are m=
ent to tell such=C2=A0people that these sadhanas can and do happen even tod=
ay, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerfu=
l as it was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and=C2=A0actually be=
 able to do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fi=
xed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are i=
n right now=C2=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Sab=
uri. Respect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is re=
ady to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal pro=
mise to every individual=C2=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And S=
he is so=C2=A0kind.=C2=A0 In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand=
 of God", Vimalanada says :


"Publish this book after I am gone. Let peopl=
e know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may =
read it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and th=
en Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as She did =
for me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. The progre=
ssion will go on; there is nothing to fear".
Therefore have faith, do sadha=
na.=C2=A0 

=C2=A0
Back to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi o=
f Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Variou=
s shaktis are available on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past =
midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single =
person was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we cr=
ossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blockin=
g our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the s=
amshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deit=
y to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a =
man coming from the other side who chased the dogs away.=C2=A0Without looki=
ng at me=C2=A0Manish said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but =
never become to big for your breeches".
=C2=A0
As we passed the Lalita Ghat=
 Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2=A0I did not think too much about=
 it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what i=
s to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for s=
ome shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything be=
came calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did hi=
s tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally=
, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, =
however I did not say anything.=C2=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke t=
o someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilan=
ga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I =
am a confirmed idiot.
=C2=A0
Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and a=
gain it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went righ=
t inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, agai=
n people started staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pa=
ss through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, wi=
th Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them bur=
ning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a single minute w=
hen there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the M=
ahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was obse=
rving, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to =
the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I =
could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the sams=
han. It not only the bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did=
 not ask him what. So we
 went to another side. The dom there came forward =
and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?=
". Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the =
people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the h=
eat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'll sit here its=
elf. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit co=
mfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre =
we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any=
 other city, people would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, i=
t is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for c=
ountless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these t=
hings or heard from their families and thus they do not disturb. 
=C2=A0
Th=
e homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous nig=
ht. The heat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calme=
r than the previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and=
 sat around this pyre. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least te=
n pyres burning, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplic=
able reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans l=
ike me. This homa was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would sudd=
enly look at a certain direction intently for a few second. I too would tur=
n and look that way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a spec=
ific direction or made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at t=
hat direction. At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they c=
ould see/sense things which I=C2=A0 - being such an=C2=A0ordinary person -=
=C2=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2=A0I =
could hear
 chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relatives wailing as new bodi=
es were being brought in. 
=C2=A0
Suddenly to my right there was a sound an=
d quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately s=
tarted barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, en=
tering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a=
 link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand -=
 I saw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought =
it was some relative who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was=
 a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over m=
y book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with m=
ore vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, a=
s one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presen=
ce felt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and th=
is can=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The i=
dea is to keep doing sadhana.
=C2=A0
While offering coconuts into the fire,=
 one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which =
the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wond=
ered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely =
felt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered i=
f=C2=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I w=
ould happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Ma=
nikarkina!=C2=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one=
 extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understoo=
d why.
=C2=A0
In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the =
relatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person whos bo=
dy was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not have=
 to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did not kno=
w what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is not=
hing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess =
the person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of t=
he relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge=
". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa=
. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on=
 the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burnin=
g. It was a sight to see!
=C2=A0
There is a tradition of pouring Ganges wat=
er=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling th=
e relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without perm=
issin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=A0asked if=
 they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told=
 me nothing will happen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud =
kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. Aft=
er some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, "=
 Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people c=
ame forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2=
=A0Manish's feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his b=
lessings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home=
, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubt=
s (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came
 running with tears in his eyes =
asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him no=
thing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2=A0 Later =
Manish said, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the=
 man along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and ask=
ed him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who used to live in =
Kasi. Manish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, t=
he person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home a=
s it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land i=
s what makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so =
alive. We city bred 'educated'=C2=A0people are too rational to understand t=
hese things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too sto=
od up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed on=
ly from my head to my heart, there was nothing
 below, no legs, no stomach =
,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I told Manish wha=
t happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, "Good".
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "Ther=
e is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desi=
re to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it.=
 I saw her while meditating." For a woman to come and perform these sadhana=
s is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadha=
ka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of =
a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (a=
s I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting o=
n the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he =
had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, but =
directionless. " At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess t=
hat is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, inste=
ad of merely contemplating which is of no good,=C2=A0so that you are ready =
when
 Nature decides to give you a push. 
=C2=A0
After passing the Lalita G=
hat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance=
. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Manish's camera ha=
nging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us=
 not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would=
 be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on=
.
=C2=A0
Thus ended my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral p=
yre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.

<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>While re reading my mails after I sent them to the list, I found many sil=
ly errors of spelling and grammer. I was writing in a flow and never checke=
d what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they sa=
y, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV>During the day time, we roamed around shooting at different =
places. In this 3 days we never visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked=
 him, "What about the temples? Won't we visit them?". Manish retorted immed=
iately, " Aren't we going to the most powerful temple in Kasi eve=
ry night?"! I silently agreed. This is something about Manish I have observ=
ed. He rarely enters temples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he=
 might see a small roadside temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even =
do a pranam and then remark, "There is something here."</DIV>
<DIV> </=
DIV>
<DIV>During evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Bab=
a was a Aghori who lived in Kasi during the 16th century. The place is=
 called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we w=
alked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong e=
nergies in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did  pranam&=
nbsp;at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram=
. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 co=
ntinuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.  Manish, on being quest=
ioned, said that many sadhanas have been done here in this place for long b=
y people with no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. =
While looking around the Ashram we found some quotations which were written=
 in small wooden boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one q=
uotation. Translated to English, it read, "If you have to give your head
 o=
ff to get a sadguru, you have got it cheap".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<=
DIV>By 8 PM we sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we ha=
d sufficient time before going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an e=
mpty stomach while performing any sadhana to get the best effects. The amou=
nt of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara A=
gni. One that digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential =
fire) which exists in the subtle body. It is the second which must increase=
 in order for one to "digest" various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only in=
crease when the Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. =
When we are extremely focused on something and working intently on the same=
, we forget food, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhu=
ta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agni.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we sa=
t eating our food and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The=
 conversation mentioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversa=
tion that we (Manish, Arunisha and me) had before coming to Kasi. </DI=
V>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Manish said, "It is the same set of souls wh=
o come back again and again in different bodies and personalities at d=
ifferent times, who are responsible for this land. There was Chadragup=
ta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ram=
akrishna etc." He continued, "They can come as kings, yogis, or any other f=
orm which is necessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharm=
a is connected to this land which we call India today.This land i=
s connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people whe=
n needed. Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine wha=
t happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently=
 contemplated her fate. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>"One very senior=
 Rishi has decided to change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so =
shall it happen. Ved Dharma will be re established here along the=
 length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individ=
ual or group, can stand against the will of a Rishi."  Aruni=
sha asked a pertinent question here. "What were the Rishis doing for o=
ne thousand years?". Manish laughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend=
 a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly one day=
 wake up from meditation and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone a=
nd all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So He decides, it is ti=
me to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about&=
nbsp;what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changin=
g a country is child's play for Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me s=
lowly. Therefore it is so important to keep
 doing sadhana, in some manner =
or the other.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As night approached midnight, Ma=
nish and I left for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night=
 of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the deserted g=
hats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a homa of Shiva/Bhairava=
 on a pyre. He said yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no =
Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sad=
hana. Shiva is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage =
one must develop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti for wh=
ich worshipping the divine Mother is the best way. That is why Vi=
malananda says, "Let the Mother show you the face of the Father". The topic=
 drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Mani=
karnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujj=
ain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then starin=
g at the pitch black ganges,
 Manish chuckled lightly and added, "That man =
was something." This was again an old conversation we had started befo=
re which Mainsh continued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants =
if Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the po=
wer of a deity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vima=
lananda has created a army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books ar=
e like a Bible for sadhakas, arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Lat=
er on I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to whi=
ch Manish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, th=
e important question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell s=
ilent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vi=
malanda does mention that a time will come when his "children" would spread=
 homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. </DIV>
<DI=
V> </DIV>
<DIV>We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time w=
e sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire=
 was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa.=
 As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this d=
id not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly =
lift his palm upwards and with the next ahuti immediately th=
e fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when the flam=
es were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on th=
e samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was working =
on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too r=
esponded back, "Jai Mahadev". This homa was faster. He did not use any "sam=
puts", but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and=
 stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make =
them
 burn properly. I was enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, =
listening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the S=
amshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any f=
urther claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was=
 an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise t=
he dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Manikarnik=
a is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wond=
ering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Na=
th came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan scared. B=
ut there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the night.</=
DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat for =
meditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, the medita=
tion that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my mind w=
ould just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of the Gange=
s. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or s=
o. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest moveme=
nt from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudg=
ed Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, " I co=
uld have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had a fli=
ght to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of death. J=
ust at that moment the cow and brought me back." Smiling he added, "What a =
sight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can be left at=
 will".  I did not know what to say. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We =
stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The to=
rso had become black with deep red patches all over. The dom came forw=
ard, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick) from the=
 side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and placing =
it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth motion =
of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo=
 stick, into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we use a for=
k to lift pieces of food - meat or vegetables, both dead - from o=
ur plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, "Maza aya?". I smiled bac=
k in acknowledgement. Then he commented that I should write about this=
 experience in the coming days. Let people know.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<D=
IV>By this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi p=
ath, one dog had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. H=
e exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well." Manish =
said we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.=
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we were returning, Manish said one of the =
point (the three peaks) of Shiva's trishul passes through the Manikark=
ina. Therefore, it is a "safe" samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative =
here will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit =
will cause any unnecessary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why=
 there are people here even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numb=
ers. As long as ones intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wond=
erful place to do sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While walking along=
 the ghats which were totally deserted, Manish instructed me not =
to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it&n=
bsp;with one hand and kept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manis=
h. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thought and recollected=
 that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a=
 "Mokul". A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once =
the ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do not wait along the b=
anks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water late in the ni=
ghtt. There are things in the water. Generally they may not do anything, bu=
t why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika=
 Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to =
live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-=
intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around
 naked. It is their city.</DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Next morning, as we sat recollecting the previous nig=
ht's homa, Manish talked about Vedas. Few sadhaks, if ever, are equall=
y comfortable with both paths of Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra t=
o show its effects, one must get the intonation perfect. This age most peop=
le cannot do that. I enquired that I had heard from someone that a cer=
tain procedure needs to be done before one starts any sadhana in the samsha=
n. Manish laughed and replied, "Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mu=
jhe to kuch nehi aata!". I was dumbstruck. </DIV>
<DIV> </DI=
V>
<DIV>While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly becom=
e half closed. He voice became slow and heavy, "The color of Rama's bo=
dy is deep blue with a golden tinge all around him. Like a sun blazing=
. That was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri =
with two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows,=
 the motion of his hands is so fast that a normal human eye will not a=
ble to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras. Rava=
na had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a mantra shakti he had acquired th=
rough sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would fl=
y off to kill mercilessly at the slightest command from his mind. Such=
 was the calibre of the enemy. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>And Rama remov=
ed even his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being when=
 he defeated Ravana which means; he even removed the last vestige of h=
is ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that=
 the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri=
 Rama?". </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>He spoke with such an energy which c=
annot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.<=

<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Before I continue with the narration, I would like to menti=
on a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:<=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>At the end of the third day of Chandi homa=
 at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when=
 Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experie=
nce in a public forum. Therefore my mails.</LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>=

<LI><STRONG>Caveat</STRONG>: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor&=
nbsp;sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas =
it is said only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mah=
akala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru.=
 It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis) I was only doin=
g the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on h=
is own, try out this sadhana. </LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>Many pe=
ople have a negative bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is =
party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and effic=
acy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have m=
ade films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is =
grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their=
 accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many pa=
th to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor go=
od. It is a path. Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We must follow our=
 chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths to=
o. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattat=
reya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sr=
i Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mail=
s are intended to give a first hand
 objective account of how a powerf=
ul sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicl=
er.</LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>There are many people in this age =
who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind =
of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to =
tell such people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it =
is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it=
 was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and actually be able t=
o do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed pro=
cedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right=
 now and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Re=
spect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to =
wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to=
 every individual because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is s=
o kind.  In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand of God=
", Vimalanada says :</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr=
>
<DIV>"Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let t=
hem know what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few =
will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will =
make arrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they will b=
e taught according to their capabilities. <U>The progression will go on; th=
ere is nothing to fear</U>".</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=3Dltr>Therefore have=
 faith, do sadhana.

Back to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. M=
anish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are avail=
able on this night which can destroy Ashuras. Past midnight we were wa=
lking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be se=
en anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we =
found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stop=
ped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started m=
entally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journ=
ey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the=
 other side who chased the dogs away. Without looking at me Manis=
h said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=
 for your breeches".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we passed the Lalita G=
hat Manish said this is a wonderful place. I did not think too much ab=
out it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of wha=
t is to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat fo=
r some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything=
 became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did=
 his tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical menta=
lly, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different gha=
t, however I did not say anything. Later on returning to Mumbai I spok=
e to someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Tri=
langa Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion,=
 I am a confirmed idiot.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Back to midnight. We =
reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we d=
id not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable c=
hita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfu=
lly made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood =
exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There we=
re about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has n=
ot been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. The=
refore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my ri=
ght which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come=
 and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull lo=
oked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to t=
he other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,  but there is some=
thing else as well. I did not ask him
 what. So we went to another side. Th=
e dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log kaun se chi=
ta me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then =
went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make space for=
 us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it=
's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all ma=
de space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others=
 not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique =
about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not h=
ere. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas hav=
e been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have eithe=
r themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thus they d=
o not disturb. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The homa, as usual was awesome=
. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong=
. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. W=
ithin ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This =
was strange because there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of =
them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far=
 subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This homa was extend=
ed longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direc=
tion intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw =
nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some =
gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point =
I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which =
I  - being such an ordinary person - obviously had no clue a=
bout. In the middle of the Chandi
 path I could hear chants of "Ram Na=
m Satya Hai" and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. </D=
IV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite=
 abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started =
barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering =
the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link t=
o this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw =
a human shadow pass over the pages of the book. I thought it was =
some relative who was standing behind me. I looked back and was a shoc=
ked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book =
once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vig=
or and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).  Manish later said, as one d=
oes sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt=
, even if slightly. It is not an imagination but reality and this can&=
nbsp;happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is =
to keep doing
 sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While offering coconut=
s into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bam=
boo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut pie=
ce inside.I wondered if I had been a dom in any of my past lives, beca=
use I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre the way the domes do. I=
 even wondered if there was any company which would may me for this ki=
nd of a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than be=
come a dom at Manikarkina! Interestingly, I then remembered that Manis=
h had bought one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas.=
 Now I understood why.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In the middle of the ho=
ma, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and=
 told him that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and =
that they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already lat=
e in the night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explai=
ned to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We =
are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering abo=
ut what is going on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, "=
Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them t=
o sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly =
Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse  I saw the skin on t=
he face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water at the =
end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not=
 to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Mani=
sh. Finally at the end they came to Manish and asked if they could pou=
r some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing wil=
l happen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of =
water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, =
after some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi samn=
e khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and=
 reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch Manish's fee=
t, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He di=
stributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was =
very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish =
had
 addressed earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forg=
iveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry,=
 he has done no wrong, everything is all right.  Later Manish said, if=
 it was some other time of the day he would have brought the man along for =
a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he wa=
s a certain saint (a famous saint) who used to live in Kasi. Manish wi=
thout responding to his query asked him where was he from, the person repli=
ed interior Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late i=
n the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes In=
dia so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city =
bred 'educated' people are too rational to understand these things. Go=
d loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pra=
nam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my
 hea=
d to my heart, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach , as if&nb=
sp;I was simply floating on thin air! I told Manish what happened, he =
just gave a curt one word reply, "Good".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we were walking back from Manikarnik=
a Manish suddenly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manik=
arnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does=
 not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to c=
ome and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unle=
ss she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not=
 be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when =
we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, loo=
king foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me th=
at, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the s=
amshan. "She has desire, but directionless. " At that time there was nothin=
g more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing so=
me sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good=
, so that you are
 ready when Nature decides to give you a push. </DIV=
>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,&nbs=
p;we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like a=
ny other tourist, specially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck =
;and the tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Man=
ikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing=
 us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>Thus ended my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyr=
e at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.</DIV>
