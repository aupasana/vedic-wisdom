 One day, while Ramana was sitting absorbed in meditation in the
thousand-p=
illared hall, he was pelted with stones from behind,which,
fortunately, did=
 not hit him. As a result he nevertheless decided, in order
to escape such =
troubles in future, to withdraw to a windowless underground
vault under the=
 thousand-pillared hall,known as the Patala Lingam (patala =3D
snakes cave,=
 underworld, a kind of hell). There was a Shiva lingam, behind
which he sat=
 down,leaning his back against the wall. The cellar was never
used or visit=
ed and therefore never cleaned. The rays of the sun never
penetrated here. =
It was also damp and overrun with vermin such as woodlice,
ants, bees and w=
asps. Despite being bitten by mosquitoes Ramana sat unmoved
in yoga posture=
 with legs crossed, impervious to the world. His thighs,
where they met the=
 ground, were soon covered with ulcers, from which blood
and pus oozed. The=
 scars were to remain visible for the rest of his life.

Here the children =
left him in peace. He reported, =E2=80=9CChildren used to run
after me, and=
 when I hid myself in Patala Lingam, from the outside they
would pelt me wi=
th stones and potsherds, but none of it reached me as I used
to sit in the =
south east corner. The urchins never dared to come in because
of the extrem=
e darkness that prevailed
in the pit, the broken steps of which could not e=
ven be seen from the
surface.=E2=80=9D

A pious woman named Ratnammal found=
 him there, she spoke to him and brought
him something to eat. She urgently=
 begged him to leave the place and come to
stay at her home. But the young =
Swami made no reply, either through words or
gestures. She laid a
clean pie=
ce of cloth beside him and bade him to use it as a bed or to sit on
to keep=
 at least some of the vermin away, but he took no notice and did not
even t=
ouch it. He also made no effort to obtain any food. People therefore
used t=
o place food in his mouth, but he was not aware of it. When later he
was as=
ked if he had any food
during the time of his stay in the vault, he answere=
d, =E2=80=9CFood was forthcoming
=E2=80=93 milk, fruits =E2=80=93 but whoev=
er thought of food?=E2=80=9D Sri Ramana neither spoke nor
moved. People who=
 saw him like this thought he was practising an intense
kind of spiritual e=
xercise
(tapas).

Because he was silent, people were of the opinion that he=
 had taken a vow of
silence (mauna). But for him all this was no spiritual =
exercise at all, it
was merely something that happened to him, =E2=80=9CI h=
ave never done any sadhana. I
did not even know what sadhana was. Only long=
 afterwards I came to know what
sadhana was and how many different kinds of=
 it there were. Only if there was
a goal to attain, I should have made sadh=
ana to attain that goal.There was
nothing which I wanted to obtain. I am no=
w sitting with my eyes open. I was
then sitting with my eyes closed. That w=
as all
the difference. I was not doing any sadhana even then. As I sat with=
 my eyes
closed, people said I was in samadhi. As I was not talking,they sa=
id I was
in mauna. The fact is, I did nothing. Some Higher Power took hold =
of me and
I was entirely in Its hand.=E2=80=9D


There is little or no info=
rmation about how long Ramana stayed in samadhi in
the Patala Lingam. It wa=
s probably several weeks. One Venkatachala Mudali, a
visitor to the temple,=
 finally brought him out of there, after Seshadri had
drawn his attention t=
o the alarming bodily condition of the young
Swami. Venkatachala
Mudali rep=
orts,=E2=80=9COne day, going near the thousand-pillared hall, I found a
gro=
up of boys, mostly Moslems, hurling stones in the direction of the pit.
Enr=
aged at the sight I seized a twig, and ran towards the young scamps who
fle=
d promptly. Suddenly from the dark recesses of the hall there issued
forth =
the figure of Seshadri. I was taken aback, but, soon recovering
myself, enq=
uired of the Swami if the stones pelted by the boys had hurt him.
=E2=80=98=
Oh no,=E2=80=99 replied the Swami, =E2=80=98but go and see the Chinnaswami =
there=E2=80=99, pointed
towards the pit, and went away. Proceeding inside, =
I could make out nothing
for a while, as I was coming from the glare into t=
he darkness.In a few
minutes, the faint outlines of a young face became dis=
cernible in that pit.
Somewhat frightened, I went out to the adjoining flow=
er-garden where a sadhu
was working with his disciples.Mentioning the facts=
 to them I took some of
them with me. Even then the youthful figure sat mot=
ionless and with closed
eyes, despite the noise of our footsteps. Then we l=
ifted the Swami from the
pit, carried him from the hall up a flight of step=
s and deposited him in
front of a shrine of Subrahmanya. The Swami still re=
mained unconscious, his
eyes closed; evidently he was in deep samadhi.

We =
noted the large number of sores on the nether side of his thighs and
legs, =
with blood and pus flowing from some of them, and wondered how any one
coul=
d remain unconscious of the body amidst such torture. Regarding it as
irrev=
erence, nay impertinence,to make any further noise in such presence, we
bow=
ed and came away.=E2=80=9D
