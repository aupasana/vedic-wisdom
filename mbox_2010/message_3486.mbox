Dear Rajmohan,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Nice website. If you could add some more parts=
 to the pancha Yaj=C3=B1a section, giving more details about the different =
aspects of the =C5=9Arauta rituals of fire - Agnihotra, Aupasana (new moon/=
full moon rituals)=C2=A0and the bigger ones like Agnistoma - it will be fan=
tastic. I have been very curious about the details of these rituals as cond=
ucted by Nambuduris of Kerala.
=C2=A0
Is there any fire sacrifice which can=
 be performed for pitris in Srauta tradition? 
=C2=A0

Dear=
 everyone,

I am part of a group of friends who have launched a website htt=
p://vedakalpatar u.com

The site is dedicated to deissemination of basic pr=
inciples and higher philosophical ideals of Hinduism. This initiative was t=
aken at the behest of a great saint and also as our response to great apath=
y among Hindus in India and across the world the basic principles and highe=
r philosophical ideals of Hinduism. 

I request all the friends to visit th=
e site and give me a frank opinion so that we can improve our work. Everyon=
e is also welcome to contribute articles, suggestions etc.

Thanks,
Rajmoha=
