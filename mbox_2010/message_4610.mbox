 On 2.8.1939, Sri Annamalai Swami himself asked Bhagavan Ramana:

"Bhagavan=
! You have said that once a person abides in Jnana, he has no three
karmas,=
 Prarabdha,Agami and Sanchita.But Kaivalya Navaneetam says that even
a Jnan=
i has to undergo the effects of Prarabhda. How is it?"

Bhagavan Ramana rep=
lied:

"Since Prarabdha has been declared to a person even before his attai=
ning
Jnana, the onlookers say that a Jnani should also undergo the effects =
of
Prarabdha. There are several examples given in scriptures.

1.Like an ar=
row that had left the bow upon a direction.The arrow will hit
even a cow in=
 place of a tiger, even though the cow was not at all to be
injured.

2.Lik=
e an electric fan, which revolves a few rotations, even after electric
conn=
ection is switched off.

3.The burnt rope also looks like a good rope, but =
is not useful.

4.Even the trunk of the tree which remains after being cut =
off,looks green
but will not grow.

5.The roasted seeds look like any other=
 seeds, but will not grow when
planted on the soil.

"The Jnani's Prarabhda=
 is also like these five examples. In Jnani's look,
there is no prarabdha f=
or him, but onlookers observe that he is experiencing
prarabdha."
