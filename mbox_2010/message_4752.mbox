Dear Narayana, namaste.

Please find below some lines on Devi Mahatmyam (ak=
a Chandi Path, Durga
Saptashati)written by the Guru who taught me this proc=
edure. There is a
seven part procedure (saptaha) butone can read it in 3 pa=
rts on 3 days:
Chaps 1-4, Chap 5 - 10, Chaps 11 - 13. In addition, Narasimh=
a has written a
elaborate note on this in the same forum; you can find it f=
rom the archives.

best regards
Hari
|Om Gurave Namah|
|Om Saraswataye Nama=
h|

A very good account and explanation of Saptashati has been presented by=
 Sri
Narasimha. The deeper meaning is something very thought provoking. Whi=
le I
agree to all that is given, I wish to add a few things which were taug=
ht and
told to me by my late father Pandita Shastri Gita Ram, who was an ar=
dent
believer in the shakti of Chandi and was a learned man in vedas, shast=
ras
and puranas (he studied at Lahore).

1. He always addressed the saptash=
ati as Bhagavati which as per the
Vaikritika Rahasyam (1st shloka) is the s=
atvika rupa of the Goddess. The
other rupas are triguni (chandi rupa) and t=
amasi (Durga rupa).

2. For general well being, it is always better to conc=
entrate on satvika
rupa. However other rupas have their own significance.

=
3. Chandi patha is chanting of triguni rupa and must be done with due
proce=
dure as given below, particularly for shanti karma:
          (a) Shapodhar=
a - Beeja mantra 7 times
          (b) Utkeelna - 21 times
          (c) Ka=
vach patha
          (d) Argala stotram
          (e) Keelkam
          (f)=
 Tantrokte Ratri Suklam
          (g) Navarna (Dhyana, nyasa, japa (108))
 =
         (h) Patha (1st to 13th chapter)
          (i) Navarna (Dhyana, nya=
sa, japa (108))
          (j) Devi suklam
          (k) Rahasya trayam - Pr=
adhamtrau Rahasyam, Vaikritika Rahasyam,
Murty Rahasyam
          (l) Shapd=
hara - 7 times
          (m) Utkeelna - 21 times

4. The above procedure is=
 one chandipatha.

5. Done 9 times, it is Nav chandi; done 100 times, it is=
 shat chandi; done
1000 times it is sahasrara chandi.

6. On completion of =
the patha (9, 100 or 1000 times as the case may be), the
following be perfo=
rmed
       (a) Homam 1/10th of patha (1, 10, 100 patha with every shatoka)=

       (b) Tarpana 1/10th of homam
       (c) Marjanam 1/10th of tarpana
 =
     (d) Brahmana bhoga 1/10th of marjana

7. A a regular routine (without =
elaborate procedure), saptashati may be
chanted as under:

   (a) if suffic=
ient time (1.5 - 2 hours) - full patha (1 to 13 chapters)
   (b) if less ti=
me ( < 1 hour) - 1st adhyaya & 3rd adhyaya
   (c) if very less time (1/2 ho=
ur) - Madhyama adhyaya (2nd chapter)

8. Every shloka of saptashati is to b=
e treated as mantra

9. Chandipatha is the ultimate remedy in shanti karma
=

||saptajanmarjite ghore brahmhatyasame api patha matren mantranam uchyate
=
savekilvishe||

" sanchita papakarma from last seven births (even if like b=
rahmahatya) can
be remedied by chandipath mantra"

About deities

Tamoguna =
Mahakali - Dasabhuja/dasavaktra (10 arms/organs)
Triguna Mahalakshmi - Asta=
dasabhuja (18 arms)
Satviki Mahasaraswati - Astabhuja (8 arms)

All above w=
ith respective aayudhas as explained in Vaikritika Rahasyam.

11. I have lo=
t of other information for which I shall revert later.
