Namaste, 
There are three main 'Dhyaanams' which I want to read Mahakali,Ma=
halakshmi,Mahasarawathi. Am I supposed to put swaha after all those.Also I =
have observed in some of the Chandi Path books few words are slightly diffe=
rent, uvacha is also in different place. Can I ignore it and continue the w=
ay it is written? 
While doing Chandi homam the deepam got extinguished as =
it didn't have the capacity for holding more than 5 hours.=C2=A0 Also somet=
imes=C2=A0during homam even after constant care=C2=A0while doing pranaprati=
shta the fire goes away. Is it all considered inauspicious and should I tak=
e care from preventing the flame from going off? 
Thanks for answering my q=
uery,

Best=C2=A0Regards
Prm

Namaste,

At the end of 700th Verse, one should=
 say 'Vaushat' and Vaushat should be logically added after 'Klim Om'.

It i=
s ok to Skip 'Dhyaanam' which comes at the begining of each chapter.

I sug=
gest 'Kshama Prartha' to be recited after Meditation and just BEFORE taking=
 Mother back in the heart.

some learned members can correct me if i am not=
 accurate.

Best Regards,

Utpal
