 Sri Bhagavan: Why do you think you are a householder? The similar thought
=
that you are a sannyasi will haunt you even if you go forth as one. Whether=

you continue in the household or renounce it and go to live in the forest,=

your mind haunts you. The ego is the source of thought. It creates the bod=
y
and the world and makes you think of being a householder. If you renounce=
,
it will only substitute the thought of renunciation for that of the famil=
y
and the environment of the forest for that of the household. But the ment=
al
obstacles are always there for you. They even increase greatly in the ne=
w
surroundings. Change of environment is no help. The one obstacle is the
m=
ind, and this must be overcome whether in the home or in the forest. If you=

can do it in the forest why not in the home? So why change the environment=
?
Your efforts can be made even now, whatever be the environment.

Devotee:=
 Is it possible to enjoy samadhi while busy with worldly work?

Sri Bhagava=
n: It is the feeling `I work' that is the hindrance. Ask
yourself: `Who wor=
ks?' Remember who you are. Then the work will not bind
you. It will go on a=
utomatically. Make no effort either to work or to
renounce; your effort is =
the bondage. What is destined to happen will
happen. If you are destined to=
 work, you will not be able to avoid it; you
will be forced to engage in it=
. So leave it to the Higher Power. It is not
really your choice whether you=
 renounce or retain.
