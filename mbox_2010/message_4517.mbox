Namaste Sindhu Ji,

Now the debate is settled, can i ask you a straight que=
stion?

Do you feel that Homam (as per the guidelines of Narasimha) which i=
s now being performed regularly by over 100 people, has the Power of Chandi=
ka behind it? do you think its an effective Saadhana in current times or ju=
st a waste of time?

Mother Bless !!!

Best Regards,

Utpal
