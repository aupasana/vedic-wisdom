This was long time back during the introductory phases of this group that N=
arasimha mentioned this:

Namaste,
>>
>> I mentioned my guru Dr Manish Pand=
it and the command of the Divine Mother
>> when she appeared before him in =
March 2006 regarding teaching simple
>> homam procedures to people. I want =
to mention a small story about his
>> past. This is an incident that had a =
profound impact on his spiritual
>> evolution in this life.
>>
>> * * *
>>
=
>> When Manish was young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mother was
>> h=
ighly spiritual and religious and he naturally knew some prayers, but
>> di=
d not do much spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outside Pune
>> =
with friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.
>>
>> When in college, he got=
 bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to
>> go to college oneday to=
 fight and increase his marks. When he was about
>> to leave house, a teena=
ged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good
>> tejas in face came to his =
house. He asked Manish where he was going. He
>> then said, "do not go out =
today. Going out today will ruin your life.
>> Just stay home and think of =
god. I will make sure that your marks with be
>> increased. Leave it to me =
and don't worry about it." He then strongly
>> suggested to Manish that he =
should wear a diamond ring on his right hand
>> index finger and it would c=
hange his life. Interestingly, Manish has
>> Meena lagna and Venus is a mal=
efic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th
>> house) with 3 other planets,=
 people would normally avoid diamond in this
>> case to be safe. Moreover, =
most people do not put diamond on index
>> finger, which is associated with=
 Jupiter, an enemy of Venus. So nobody
>> would normally recommend him diam=
ond, that too on the index finger. This
>> is an unusual suggestion.
>>
>> =
That brahmin boy then asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand
>=
> and said that this act would do him good. There was no tea at their house=

>> and Manish fed him some sugar. He ate it and left after saying, "when y=
ou
>> come to Shirdi next, come to so and so room in so and so place. That =
is
>> where I live. Also, I need to give a glass of water to your mother.
>=
> Please come to Shirdi with her."
>>
>> * * *
>>
>> Barely a minute after =
he left, Manish had a question and ran to the door
>> of his compound wall.=
 He found no person in orange clothes walking on the
>> road. He asked the =
persons standing outside whether they could tell him
>> in which direction =
a person who came out of the house in orange clothes
>> had gone. They said=
 nobody went in or came out of the house in an hour.
>> Manish went around =
the area to check if anybody saw a young Brahmin in
>> orange clothes. Nobo=
dy in that area saw anyone like that. So this seemed
>> like a miracle. Man=
ish was puzzled.
>>
>> Later his marks in the exam were automatically incre=
ased and his problem
>> was solved by itself, without his doing anything.
>=
>
>> * * *
>>
>> A few months later, they went to Shirdi. They wanted to me=
et that young
>> Brahmin. They went to the place he mentioned. Manish's mot=
her was waiting
>> downstairs and they went upstairs to the room number men=
tioned by him to
>> find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in that room a=
nd there was a
>> life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. When they=
 asked, they
>> were told that that room had always been empty and only the=
 picture was
>> there. Nobody ever lived in that room.
>>
>> When they came=
 downstairs, Manish's mother told them that she suddenly
>> became very thi=
rsty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink
>> some water fr=
om his hands and left in a hurry.
>>
>> * * *
>>
>> After this, Manish did =
buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine
>> visitor and wore it on his=
 right hand index finger. He still wears it.
>> Perhaps wearing a strong mo=
ksha trikona lord's gem on the moksha finger
>> (the four fingers represent=
 the 4 purusharthas and thumb shows self)
>> strengthens moksha trikona. Th=
ough this was an unusual (and risky)
>> suggestion, perhaps this is very ap=
propriate in this case for spiritual
>> progress.
>>
>> Soon after this, an=
other miraculous incident involving a deity happened,
>> which I do not wan=
t to mention now. Then started his spiritual
>> transformation. Manish beca=
me very serious about spiritual sadhana after
>> that and started spending =
many hours everyday in spiritual sadhana. He
>> had visions - internal and =
external - of many deities and special beings,
>> including Shirdi Sai Baba=
 too, and had many experiences. His life changed
>> completely after this e=
xperience.
>>
>> * * *
>>
>> Today many people do not believe that miraculo=
us and magical things can
>> happen. When they hear unbelievable stories ab=
out saints like Sai Baba,
>> Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Tr=
ilinga Swami, Mahavatar
>> Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds=
 trained in rational
>> thinking assume that the stories are made up by som=
eone. Healthy
>> skepticism is justified because many fake people are there=
 today, who
>> abuse people's faith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. S=
uch things
>> are possible.
>>
>> But one word on miracles and siddhis. Mir=
acles and siddhis are secondary
>> to self-realization. The important thing=
 is to do spiritual sadhana,
>> realize self, and live as a liberated perso=
n (jeevanmukta) continuing to
>> discharge the job assigned to one by Natur=
e, with an equanimous mind and
>> neither attraction nor repulsion to anyth=
ing. Nature assigns different
>> jobs to different persons. Personalities l=
ike Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi,
>> Raghavendra Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar
>> Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, =
Ramanujacharya,
>> Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did different jobs on thi=
s earth, but what
>> is common between them is that they completely overcam=
e their limited
>> personalities, became realized and then went on to fulfi=
ll the tasks
>> given to them by the Power that runs the universe, with an =
equanimous
>> mind.

>> Best regards,
