Dear Narasimha and others,

Just further to our conversation on t=
his topic last night,
If one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is ass=
ociated with naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the=
 opposite sex in a different way. This comes from millions of janmas and sa=
mskaras. 

My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used to say in a slightly diff=
erent context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.
I applied it =
to this as well and it works quite well. 
Two things are going to be useful=
, 
1. Continue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuation=
 of your sadhana.
2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not =
be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the thing in your mi=
nd which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked fema=
le(or male as may be the case) body is like a landscape picture just like a=
ny other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, y=
ou need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly feel that the picture is =
very beautiful but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta S=
akala jagatsu, tyaikiya.......
Once this stage is reached then the mind cea=
ses to think of sex all the while.
Yes you may still encounter it, but that=
 is another story.

to read. But, it is possible that he also likes the book and starts enjoyin=

  If meditation is li=
ke reading a book, weakness for sex is like the friend and sexual thoughts =
that arise in the mind are like the distractions caused by the friend, then=
 aghora's sadhana I mentioned is like getting the friend to read the book a=
long with you.

  However, as I said, there are no guarantees. This friend =
may get interested in the book and stop distracting you, or he may continue=
 to distract you and make it worse by being right next to you through the r=

    Namaste,

    It is perf=
ectly fine to combine the sadhanas of different aspects of the Mother, incl=
uding Lalita and Chandi.

    Sri Vidya consists of symbolic practices that=
 eventually enable one to understand various layers of Maayaa surrounding t=
rue Self. The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* unde=
rstands and appreciates it.

    Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of=
 wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and ov=
ercome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these=
 stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one tha=
t fights these weaknesses.

    There is nothing wrong in understanding Maa=
yaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mot=
her creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and =
bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to=
 overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. Whe=
n one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally=
 sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially=
 true Self.

    *        *        *

    > Also, I have started to read th=
e Aghora series books by Dr. Robert
    > Svobodha. For now I have very mix=
ed feelings on the subject.
    > Perhaps I need to read more! 

    Aghora=
 series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone's cup of tea.=
 It is normal to have mixed feelings.

    Ghora means terrible. Aghora mea=
ns "not terrible". One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora =
(aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as=
 impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the m=
ind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestation=
s of god.

    When someone dies, north Indians chant "Raama naam satya hai=
" while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means "only the name of L=
ord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion". The idea is to remind=
 oneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lor=
d is real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ulti=
mate truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly=
 great thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can't w=
e tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises a=
re temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on te=
mporary illusions"? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want =
to get it, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing that s=
eems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary il=
lusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusio=
ns"? When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or ang=
ry, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are tempora=
ry illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary il=
lusions"?"

    A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama naam satya hai" always. =
His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwel=
ling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and =
thinking about them with attraction/aversion) and tries to find and focus o=
n what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.

    *        *        *
=

    Vedanta says "all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion". An=
 aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant ill=
usions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions=
 why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is =
eaten. But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Percei=
ving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent mani=
festation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eatin=
g feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dwellin=
g on the impermenant manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it. A suc=
cessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on th=
e fact that he is eating "feces" with certain properties and will not feel =
any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating S=
elf.

    Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants=
 vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean "I am Self and I am =
consuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not=
 be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the=
 impermanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinj=
al curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on the pe=
rmanent (Self).

    Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves =
the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impul=
se. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure res=
ults in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive i=
n forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Ve=
dic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty ladd=
us and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Sel=
f while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-=
so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other=
 hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces=
, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very b=
ad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.

    Howe=
ver, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely =
because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.

   =
 *        *        *

    Take another simple example. Suppose someone is d=
oing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for =
sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in th=
e middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.

=
    A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away fr=
om sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts.=
 After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keep=
s celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the =
mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fasci=
nation some minds may have for sex?

    An aghora will take it to an extre=
me. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind.=
 Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure a=
nd the other impure), he may combine them into one without such distinction=
s of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting =
naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titill=
ate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. =
But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Ev=
entually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing =
something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his=
 mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures p=
hysically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke though=
ts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in t=
he head may not lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and dist=
raction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. Afte=
r spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the a=
ttraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken =
down. Overall, the person's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone la=
rgely.

    Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and t=
he thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of=
 these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those str=
uctures.

    However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also =
possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex a=
nd thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of m=
editation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/=
ready to start with.

    *        *        *

    Bottomline is that an ag=
hora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight =
with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet a=
nd fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicabl=
e to all.

    *        *        *

    Like Manish said in a mail earlier,=
 "what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to =
understand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a hig=
h stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many m=
ay feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it =
based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=
 Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract =
some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora =
and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how on=
e absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant.
=

    BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual pat=
hs and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the con=
text of aghora.

            Dear Narasimhagaru,

  =
          Thank you for your reply. 

            I understand that Chandi =
and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother. But what I am t=
rying to understand is that how to worship both forms simultaneously. For i=
nstance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divi=
ne Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who =
was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis mentio=
n great details about all the nine avaranas and different forms of the divi=
ne mother as one goes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of those, =
in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'.=
 That line tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, =
in that form. 

            So my question was in that perspective. Anyway,=
 your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surround=
ed by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. 

            I ha=
ve started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it flu=
ently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navarat=
ri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati!=
 Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. 

            Also,=
 I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For=
 now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more=
!

              Namaste,

=
              Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performing =
a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, =
there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to r=
ead Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing=
 Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiri=
ng.

              Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that =
needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two=
 sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the tim=
e between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig =
10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one want=
s to find water.

              One possibility is to do a homam and then m=
editate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached t=
o.

              I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, fro=
m the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representatio=
n of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unrave=
l the layer of duality and realize Self.

              Lalita means gentle=
 one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you =
gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict=
, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are vali=
d paths.

takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you ac=
complish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, =
I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 1=
08 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparad=
hana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. P=
lus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1=
 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyo=
pasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vi=
dya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi =
Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because=
 I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Mutht=
huswami Dikshitar recently.

<DIV>Dear Narasimha and others,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Jus=
t further to our conversation on this topic last night,</DIV>
<DIV>If one l=
ooks into the mind, one finds that sex is associated with naked 
men/women,=
 etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex in a 
different=
 way. This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. </DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV>My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used to say in a slightly=
 different 
context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.</DIV>
<=
DIV>I applied it to this as well and it works quite well. </DIV>
<DIV>=
Two things are going to be useful, </DIV>
<DIV>1. Continue your m=
antra during the act and it will act as a continuation of 
your sadhana.</D=
IV>
<DIV>2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be dishea=
rtened by 
failure initially. As time goes on, the thing in your mind =
which thinks of 
sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female=
(or male as may 
be the case) body is like a landscape picture ju=
st like any other picture 
made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Ang=
kor Wat, you need not be 
disturbed by it, you can certainly feel that=
 the picture is very 
beautiful but you need not be aroused by it=
). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala 
jagatsu, tyaikiya.......</DIV>
<DIV>Once =
this stage is reached then the mind ceases to think of sex all the 
while.<=
/DIV>
<DIV>Yes you may still encounter it, but that is another story.</DIV>=

    and remove fascination from the mind. Inst=
ead of keeping sadhana and sex as 
    two different activities (one pure a=
nd the other impure), he may combine 
    them into one without such distin=
ctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora 
    sits naked with his partne=
r sitting naked on his lap and then does his 
    japam. In the beginning, =
this may titillate and result in sex. He may think 
    that his sadhana is=
 being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam 
    like that for=
 several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He 
    may no=
 longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel 
    =
titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be 
=
    broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer=
 
    evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small th=
oughts 
    related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to d=
enser and 
    denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, =
but they may now 
    take the mind back to meditation. After spending so m=
uch time in meditation 
    while sitting naked intimately, the attraction =
and thrill mind may feel for 
    nakedness or intimacy may be broken down.=
 Overall, the person's fascination 
    and weakness for sex may be gone la=
rgely.</DIV>
    <DIV> </DIV>
    <DIV>Mind has a lot of conditioning =
based on prior experiences and the 
    thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora =
sometimes tries to break down some of 
    these structures by engaging in =
certain practices that undermine those 
    structures.</DIV>
    <DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
    <DIV>However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is a=
lso possible 
    that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely =
for sex and thinks 
    of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=
 thinking of meditation 
    everytime he sees naked partner), if one was n=

    <DIV> </DIV>Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and wea=

 </DIV>Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and 
    w=
hat is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb 
=
    Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan.=
 
    However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel avers=
ion. 
    More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on=
 a wrong 
    understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.&nb=
sp;Aghora 
    stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* a=
ttract some 
    people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenet=
s of Aghora and 
    Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to a=
ccelerates how one 
    absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making fai=
lure very 
    unpleasant.</DIV>
    <DIV> </DIV>
    <DIV>BTW, the fo=
llowing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual 
    paths and expl=
ains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the 
    context o=
f aghora.</DIV>

            <DIV><FONT fa=

            <DIV>I understand that Chandi an=
d Lalita are two different forms of 
            the Universal Mother. =
;But what I am trying to 
            understand is that how to worshi=
p both forms simultaneously. 
            For instance, Sri Muththuswa=
my Diskshitar, was a great composer 
            (one of the Divine Trinity=
 of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja 
            and Shyama Sastry), w=
ho was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His 
            Kamalamba Navavarn=
a Krithis mention great details about 
            all the n=
ine avaranas and different forms of the divine mother 
            as one g=
oes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of 
            th=
ose, in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta 
            =
kalpalatike, ChanDike'. That line tells me that even 
           =
 through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that 
            form.&nb=

            <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
         =
   <DIV>So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was 
   =
         a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by 
=
            layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. </DIV>

       <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>

              <DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Sanskrit is almost=
 like a mother tongue to

eryday should hardly be 
              awe-inspiring. On the other hand, th=
ere are some people who do not 
              know Sanskrit at all and took=
 4 hours to read Chandipath with 
              great difficulty in their f=
irst attempt. THEY are doing Chandi 
              homam everyday and it ta=
kes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is 
              awe-inspiring.<BR><BR>Integr=
ating various sadhanas is a personal 
              problem that needs a pe=
rsonal solution. In general, it is a good 
              idea to pick one o=
r two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on 
              them, instead =
of splitting the time between ten things. As 
              Ramakrishna Par=
amahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one 
              place ra=

              about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam=

              in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108=
 Gayatri (20

nutes), a short 
              rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deepara=
dhana etc. (5-10 
              minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes=
 daily ritual. Plus I 
              sometimes do special rituals several t=
imes a week, that takes 
              about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to =
integrate these along with 
              homam? Is Sri vidyopasana differe=

              please explain what is sri V=
idya and how it is to be learnt? I am 
              very motivated to lear=
