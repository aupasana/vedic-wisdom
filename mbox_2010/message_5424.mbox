Namaste,
 
If one can do the same sadhana to the same deity on all occasions, it is ideal. But, if there is a feeling of guilt or regret in the mind ("today is so and so day. I wish I could also pray to so and so deity"), then one is perhaps not ready for commitment to one deity and an attraction to various forms is still there in the mind.
 
Then it is perhaps a good idea to worship other deities also. One can worship the other deity in addition to regular deity (ishta devata), in idol or fire.
 
Slowly, one can cultivate the thinking that all other deities are manifestations of one's ishta devata and imagine one's ishta devata even when worshipping any other deity using any other mantra. Over the time, this firmly embeds in one's mind the understanding that all is One and one's ishta devata becomes the avenue to realizing that One. Then, one does not feel any guilt when one worships ishta devata on all days and leaves other forms.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
