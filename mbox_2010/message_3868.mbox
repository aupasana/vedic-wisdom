Namaste Nagraj garu,

If one goes in the =
path of a tornado, aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one will stil=
l be consumed by it.
 
If the question is of fairness, well, is it fair tha=
t tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of people ev=
ery year? Well, Natural order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. I=
t is just an "order". Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience =
the fruits of your actions, as determined by the order of nature. A person =
may happen to be doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike=
 there and kill him. If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of w=
hich he is placed there at that time.
 
In the case of the priest in the st=
ory, his mistake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no =
way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the wo=
rship, he should've given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere=
 devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool.
 
See, when Ramakrishna went =
there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remarked =
that this is Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortunate. Y=
ou only saw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond=
 it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Ju=
st because of external parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.
 
H=
itting a person who still has a limited self-identification is one thing an=
d hitting a person who has no limited self-identification and identifies wi=
th the entire universe or with a deity is different.
 
*        *        *
=
 
In any case, do not worry about that priest that much. For all you know, =
he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact=
 a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not,=
 he was lucky to enact an important role in an interesting divine drama.
 
=
*        *        *
 
Jeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are difficult=
 to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They become ins=
truments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swa=
mi may help several people question, challenge and overcome their biases an=
d learn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.
 
*        *=
        *
 
Regarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints so=
metimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a spec=
ific set of people.
 
There is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooj=
a room and worshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. Ho=
wever, Vimalananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachings ma=
y be addressed at some other people to come in the coming years who he has =
rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some=
 work. There is an intended audience for every work and no work can be perf=
ect for all audience.
 
If the goal is either liberation or a deity's darsh=
an (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one de=
ity is the best thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deitie=
s and keep switching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled w=
ith that deity's name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from th=
e mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for=
 vision/company of deities. He probably thought some people he has a rina w=
ith would come to earth with such a potential.
 
*        *        *
 
Thya=
garaja did compose songs on many deities. But, he first had a darshan of Ra=
ma. He spent several years chanting Rama's name and had a darshan. Then he =
composed songs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as different em=
anations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.
 
Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththus=
wamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and others.
 
When one achieves perfection=
 in surrender to one deity, one's life is made. After that, one will see th=
e same deity in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If one is swit=
ching between ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in filling the=
 mind with thoughts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deities as dif=
ferent objects and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still, as I said=
, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. That's fine.
 
But, if you really =
want to taste the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pick one de=
ity and fill the mind with his/her thoughts.

Though I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I=

But my guru blessed me that I will be able to give excellent replies to spi=

i in the presence of many of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep d=
evotion that have immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramany=
a, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So were many great composers of Carna=

any difference between any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a=
 great poet of Andhra who

 are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelash=
