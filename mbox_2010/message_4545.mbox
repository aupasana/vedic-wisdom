jay shree krshna !
 
To the elevated souls.

A self realised person is one,=
 who knows how
to distance himself from his borrowed mind and material body=
. For him the mind
and its activity have ceased; the body is just an abode,=
 a vehicle which is
used for closing his unfinished accounts of his earlier=
 births. For him he is
not identified with his body and his mind is used on=
ly for identifying and remembering.
He remains passive, utterly passive. He=
 simply watches and witnesses.  He moves in awareness and is identified wit=
h
awareness. And awareness is light and it brings light into his being. Tha=
t takes him beyond misery.
And he becomes  the bliss. And every act
of his =
becomes wise; Whatsoever he does  it happens to be right and wise. He need
=
not to discriminate, need not to think, he simply feels and throws his
awar=
eness everywhere, and in that light he moves. Wherever he moves, he is
righ=
t. Whatever he does it is right.  It
is like a man with the eye, when wants=
 to get out from a room, he simply moves
out of the door unlike a blind man=
. When  a blind man has to go out, he will be asking
where the door is  And=
 then too he tries
to find it. He will knock many places with his cane; he =
will grope, and think
continuously in the mind =E2=80=9CIs it the door or t=
he wall?  Am I going right?" And when he reaches
the door, he thinks, "Yes,=
 now this is the door." All this happens
because he is blind. He has to dis=
criminate;  he  has to think because he
is  blind; he has  to believe in ri=
ght and wrong because he
is  blind; he has  to be in discipline and moralit=
y because he
is  blind. A self realised  remains happy with happy people, f=
riendly and compassion with the
miserable, joy with the virtuous, indiffere=
nce with the evil ones. He will not have power as he is not using the mind.=
 Miracle may happen here and there around him frequently not on account of =
him but  on account of the trust and faith of people who fallow him.

I have listene=
d to many folks
talking about Kundalini, Yoga, different practices and ritu=
als, et al, but in
all truth none of it interests me, and these things just=
 happen anyway, I never
found that they needed any help :- )  Yes, the Self=
 realisation in that timeless mode was fascinating
and illuminating, but I =
was not looking for it or expecting anything, it just
happened, I did not h=
ave to do anything. But the only experience I found
(twenty years later) wh=
ich was better than that was when the self and all the parts
of ones being =
resonated with all the stuff in the world in a kind of dance, a
different k=
ind of union. The self realisation event was a re-union with the
SELF but t=
he second one was a union with everything. But I don't know why it is
but f=
olks don't seem to describe these experiences in detail. Maybe they are
not=
 interested. Or maybe they have not known them.  I think they are worth doc=
umenting for the record of human
experience.
