Namaste,

=C2=A0There was/is lot of tension in my life and hence I turned s=
piritual. I have been praying God sincerely since then. Things have definit=
ely improved. But what I learned during this time is that there is no short=
cut for happiness. Everything happens as per one's karma and one has to bea=
r it.=C2=A0When I think of the mistakes I made the karma I am paying for is=
 nothing. Accepting punishment is greatness on=C2=A0our part. 
If you are l=
ooking for happiness keep praying God.=C2=A0I find immense bliss when I pra=
y. There are special homams, puja done by priests for specific tasks. You c=
an consult a local priest for solution.=C2=A0If happiness is there in your =
fate good things may happen. Or Surrender yourself completely to God and le=
t him take care of your life.
