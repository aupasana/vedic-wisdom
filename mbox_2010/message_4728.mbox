Talk 498.


Ramana Maharshi:

People often say that a muk=
ta purusha should go out and preach his message
to the people. They argue, =
how can anyone be a mukta so long as there is
misery by his side? True. But=
 who is a mukta? Does he see misery beside
him? They want to determine the =
state of a mukta without themselves
realising the state. From the standpoin=
t of the mukta their contention
amounts to this: a man dreams a dream in wh=
ich he finds several persons. On
waking up, he asks, =E2=80=9CHave the drea=
m individuals also wakened?=E2=80=9D It is
ridiculous.

Again, a good man s=
ays, =E2=80=9CIt does not matter even if I do not get mukti.Or
let me be th=
e last man to get it so that I shall help all others to be
muktas before I =
am one.=E2=80=9D It is all very good. Imagine a dreamer saying, =E2=80=9CMa=
y
all these wake up before I do=E2=80=9D. The dreamer is no more absurd tha=
n the
amiable(Disposed to please) philosopher aforesaid.
