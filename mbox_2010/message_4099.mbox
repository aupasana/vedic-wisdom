Dear KK,
=C2=A0
Great question!
=C2=A0
Also, I personally do not agree that=
 a saint cannot interfere in the political situation of a country. Dharma d=
epends on the desh-kaal-patra. Swami Ramdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspired=
 Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the Moghuls. Had it not been so, today Ka=
shi would have remained Muhammadabad and Mathura and Prayag would have beco=
me Mecca and Medina.
=C2=A0
However at the same time I am sure there were p=
robably other self-realized saints in India who never bothered themselves w=
ith the political situation of the land. 
=C2=A0
So everyone to his/her pat=
h. If you feel a strong urge for something, probably your swa-dharma crosse=
s through those points.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Hi=
.
=C2=A0
"Why is he interfering in all these instead of keeping quiet?=E2=
=80=99"
=C2=A0
Many a times even i think why all these spiritual men like K=
anchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi has to talk about the ongoing Political crisis=
 and land into controversies. It is good to remain quite and do whatever jo=
b one has to perform.
=C2=A0
But the trick is how to identify what job i'm =
sent for to this world????
=C2=A0
Cheers
KK

2-2-46 Morning

A visitor told Bhaga=
van that he was working for Harijan uplift, that he and his co-workers in t=
he cause had darshan of Mahatma Gandhi and got his blessings, that Mahatma =
Gandhi told them that if they could bring about marriages between Harijan g=
irls and higher caste gentlemen, such marriages would have his blessings; a=
nd that he (visitor) would like to have Bhagavan=E2=80=99s views in the mat=
ter.=C2=A0

Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CIf Mahatma Gandhi has said so, we will =
all hear what he has said. What more is there for us to do? He is a disting=
uished man and is working in that field.What have we to do with that?=E2=80=
=9D=C2=A0

Turning to us, Bhagavan added,=E2=80=9CIf I open my mouth, somet=
hing will appear in the papers that so-and-so has also said such-and-such a=
 thing. The next day there will be people to criticise it. Our business is =
to keep quiet. If we enter into all these, people will naturally ask, and j=
ustifiably, =E2=80=98Why is he interfering in all these instead of keeping =
quiet?=E2=80=99=C2=A0

Similarly if Mahatma Gandhi keeps quiet leaving asid=
e all his activities,they will ask, =E2=80=98Why is he keeping quiet instea=
d of engaging in all these activities?=E2=80=99 He must do what he has come=
 for. We must do what we have come for.=E2=80=9D
