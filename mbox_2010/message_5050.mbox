Dear friends,

In several small towns and villages in Andhra Pradesh, i fou=
nd a strange practice of sleeping at temples in the nights during navratri =
and also doing pradakshina (parikrama)around midnight. A friend of mine tol=
d me that sleeping at temples during nights is prohibited in Hindu samprada=
yas and also only certain left handed practices mandate worship and pradaks=
hina during midnight. He does not have any substantiation. Are these only l=
ocal practices or is there any text(s) that deal with this.

I request scho=
larly friends to enlighten me on this/

Love to all,
Rajmohan
