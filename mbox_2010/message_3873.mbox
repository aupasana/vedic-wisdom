Namaste Narasimharaogaru, 
=C2=A0
Again a brilliant reply that clarified ma=
ny questions. Now coming to Sadhana on just one form of Almighty, I have a =
tough time choosing who. I love=C2=A0Mata Parvati=C2=A0as Mother, Shiva as =
Father, Gananatha and Karthikeya as my own siblings. I have such love for t=
he family that I don't start my day without praying to all the four! Daily =
I do abhishekham for a small Spatika Lingam, in which I see both Shiva and =
Parvathi, I do ganapathi mantra japam everyday and I recite Subramanya Kara=
valamba stotram. When I don't do it, it is not=C2=A0a day for me. ('Deva De=
vuni Chintinchu dinamu dinamu.......' !) And I get tears when I listen to B=
hagavatam or Thyagaraja/Dikshitar/Annamayya=C2=A0et al...=C2=A0Krithis. In =
spite of having won some recognition in my small community as a musician/vi=
dwan, releasing a CD playing my chosen instrument Veena, I cannot even sing=
 some compositons some times because of the overwhelming emotion. And those=
 are some songs on Shiva, Parvati, Rama and
 Krishna. 
=C2=A0
But if I have=
 to narrow down to one name, I don't know how and how to leave any one form=
! Anyway, that apart, I did Gayatri Sadhana for sometime now and want to co=
ntinue someday in the method you/Manishji suggested, like the hundred day d=
iksha! I don't know when the time will come for that! I don't know if it is=
 good to announce the mantra that I practise, contrary to Sri Vimalananda's=
 advice, but again.. oh well!... 
=C2=A0
In the meanwhile my Sadhana of=C2=
=A0Ganapathi homam on Sundays,=C2=A0nitya pooja everyday=C2=A0are=C2=A0cont=
inuing, by God's grace! But then they are eating into my music practise tim=
e! Again, the=C2=A0positive side is, when I practise these days, the practi=
se is so much more rewarding..........! I cannot express it well here......=
.......
=C2=A0
BTW, Since this group is such an understanding group and=C2=
=A0one that always gives a positive energy, I want to confess something her=
e. I have a weakness for alcoholic drinks, that I take almost every weekend=
, because of the kind of company I have here.=C2=A0Although over-indulgence=
 in that sometimes weakens my resolve to do any kind of Sadhanas,=C2=A0my n=
ormal weekend poojas/daily poojas/music practise=C2=A0do not suffer at all =
because of this. In fact sometimes, I feel that I perform my music much bet=
ter with a couple of Drinks than without - Although this is such a shame=C2=
=A0tand=C2=A0opposite to what all our philosophers/gurus have always=C2=A0p=
reached. 
=C2=A0
I want an advice from the group=C2=A0about=C2=A0this and=
=C2=A0want to know if it is such a sin to drink any amount at all! 
=C2=A0
=
Thanks to everyone for reading=C2=A0such a big=C2=A0email.

Namaste Nagraj garu,

If one goes in the path of a tornado, aware or unaware that a=
 tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it.

If the question is o=
f fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc sh=
ould kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natural order of the univer=
se is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an "order". Your actions gets opp=
osite reactions. You experience the fruits of your actions, as determined b=
y the order of nature. A person may happen to be doing what he sees as his =
dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him. If so, there must be a=
 previous karma as a result of which he is placed there at that time.

In t=
he case of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he slapped a person=
 worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the =
mind of the person doing the worship, he should've given the benefit of dou=
bt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool=
.

See, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately =
knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha himself. However, oth=
ers may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with some body parts and s=
ome clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and tre=
at kindly and respectfully. Just because of external parameters, do not jud=
ge a person and act harsh.

Hitting a person who still has a limited self-i=
dentification is one thing and hitting a person who has no limited self-ide=
ntification and identifies with the entire universe or with a deity is diff=
erent.

* * *

In any case, do not worry about that priest that much. For a=
ll you know, he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga S=
wami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva.=
 Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important role in an interesting div=
ine drama.

* * *

Jeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are difficult to=
 comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They become instru=
ments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami =
may help several people question, challenge and overcome their biases and l=
earn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.

* * *

Regardi=
ng many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advice=
s based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of people.=


There is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and worshippi=
ng all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda m=
ay not be concerned about such people. His teachings may be addressed at so=
me other people to come in the coming years who he has rina with and who ar=
e meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There is an i=
ntended audience for every work and no work can be perfect for all audience=
.

If the goal is either liberation or a deity's darshan (vision) or saayuj=
ya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the best thing=
 to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching.=
 A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that deity's name=
 and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda p=
erhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/company of de=
ities. He probably thought some people he has a rina with would come to ear=
th with such a potential.

* * *

Thyagaraja did compose songs on many deit=
ies. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting R=
ama's name and had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deities. Howev=
er, he saw all of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in al=
l.

Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and o=
thers.

When one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one's life =
is made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities even if he =
worships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities before that, =
it may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of those dei=
ties. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not fully surren=
der to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life=
. That's fine.

But, if you really want to taste the nectar of complete sur=
render, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoug=
hts.

Though I had some spiritual experien=

an immature mind. But my guru blessed me that I will be able to give excell=
ent replies to spiritual questions if I think of him and then write what co=

 to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of former and kris=
