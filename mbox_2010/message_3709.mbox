 Ganapati Sastri, also called Ganapati Muni =E2=80=93 Muni means the wise,t=
he
scholar, the saint =E2=80=93 was the most famous and erudite of Sri Rama=
na=E2=80=99s
disciples. He hailed from Andhra Pradesh and was a Brahmin. In=
 his youth he
had already written literary works and could speak and write =
Sanskrit
fluently at the age of fourteen.When he was 22 he took part in a m=
eeting of
learned Sanskrit scholars and writers, he was awarded the title K=
avya-Kantha
(one from whose throat poetry arises spontaneously) because of =
his
virtuosity in poetical improvisation.

In 1903 he came to Tiruvannamala=
i for the first time to practise intense
tapas (spiritual ascetic exercises=
). He stayed for one year and during that
time he twice visited the Swami, =
who was approximately the same age as
himself. On both occasions his erudit=
ion was noticed. Finally he took up the
post of school teacher at Vellore.
=
But it was the renewal of India which was closest to his heart and to which=

he devoted most of his energy. Through intense tapas, in particular throug=
h
mantra japa, he believed he would obtain the energy required to achieve t=
his
goal. He dreamed of an ideal society based on the Vedas, in which there=

would be material prosperity
and social justice as well as spirituality. H=
e used to hold long public
discourses on this theme and soon gained a circl=
e of followers.

It was on the ninth day of the Kartikai festival, 18th Nov=
ember 1907 at
about half past one, when, in the midday heat, he climbed up =
the hill to the
Virupaksha Cave. He was trembling with emotion.The young Sw=
ami was seated
alone in front of his cave. Although,because of the festival=
, there were
crowds of people everywhere,there was nobody at all near the S=
wami. Even
Palaniswami was not there. Ganapati Muni fell prostrate on the g=
round,
grasped Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s feet with both hands and uttered trembl=
ing, =E2=80=9CAll that
has to be read I have read. Even Vedanta Sastra [the=
 holy scriptures of
Vedanta] I have fully understood. I have performed japa=
 to my heart=E2=80=99s
content. Yet I have not up to this time understood w=
hat tapas is. Hence have
I sought refuge at thy feet. Pray enlighten me abo=
ut the nature of tapas.=E2=80=9D

For 15 minutes the Swami kept silent and =
looked at Ganapati, who sat at his
feet full of expectation. Then he answer=
ed, =E2=80=9CIf one watches whence this
notion of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 sprin=
gs, the mind will be absorbed into that. That is tapas.
If a mantra is repe=
ated, and attention directed to the source whence the
mantra-sound is produ=
ced, the mind will be absorbed in that. That is tapas.=E2=80=9D

This was t=
he first time that Sri Ramana gave a verbal answer to a
question. Until
the=
n he had kept silent and had always written the answers down. It is
remarka=
ble how he led the mantra practice of his new disciple back to the
method o=
f Self-enquiry. For Ganapati Muni this was a real revelation. His
heart was=
 filled with ecstatic joy and he meditated at the feet of his new
master un=
til the evening.

The following day Ganapati Muni wrote full of enthusiasm =
to his family and
his disciples, =E2=80=9CI have found my Master, my Guru. =
He is the Sage of
Arunachala known as Brahmanaswami. He is no ordinary Swam=
i. He is a great
Seer, a mighty spiritual personality. To me and to you all=
 he is Bhagavan
Sri Ramana Maharshi [elevated great Seer Ramana]. Let the w=
hole world know
him as such.=E2=80=9D

>From that moment on the Swami became=
 known as the Maharshi,Bhagavan or
simply Ramana. Ganapati Muni and his fol=
lowers made Sri Ramana known to a
wide circle in India.

Ganapati Muni spen=
t his whole life moving around and was often accompanied
by his wife Visala=
kshi, who also led a spiritual life.

The relationship between them remaine=
d close all their lives. Sri Ramana
called Ganapati Muni by the pet name Na=
yana, which his disciples also used.
The Telugu word Nayana is used to addr=
ess one=E2=80=99s father as well as one=E2=80=99s
disciple and one=E2=80=99=
s child.

Ganapati Muni died in 1936, aged 58, in Kharagpur, West-Bengal,wh=
ere his
devotees had built an ashram for him. When Ramana was informed abou=
t his
death by telegram, he said, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, =
=E2=80=9CWhere
can we find another like him?=E2=80=9D

Some of the other sa=
dhus who lived on the mountain, watched Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s
increasing fam=
e with suspicion and envy. An elderly sadhu felt particularly
envious and w=
anted to drive Ramana out of the Virupaksha Cave. He threw some
rocks over =
a ledge at the young Swami sitting under it, but they missed.
When the sadh=
u tried it again, Ramana got up and caught him. But the sadhu
only laughed =
and said that it was meant only as an innocent joke. Without
rebuking him R=
amana let him go.
