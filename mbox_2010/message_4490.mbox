 Talk 469

What is Realisation? Is it to see God with four hands, bearing c=
onch, wheel,
club, etc.? Even if God should appear in that form,how is the =
disciple=E2=80=99s
ignorance wiped out? The truth must be eternal realisati=
on. The direct
perception is ever-present Experience.God Himself is known a=
s directly
perceived. It does not mean that He appears before the devotee a=
s said
above.

Unless the Realisation be eternal it cannot serve any useful=
 purpose. Can
the appearance with four hands be eternal realisation? It is =
phenomenal and
illusory.There must be a seer. The seer alone is real and et=
ernal.

Let God appear as the light of a million suns: Is it pratyaksha? To=
 see it,
the eyes, the mind, etc. are necessary. It is indirect knowledge,w=
hereas the
seer is direct experience. The seer alone is pratyaksha.

All ot=
her perceptions are only secondary knowledge. The present
super-imposition =
of the body as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is so deep-rooted, that the vision
befor=
e the eyes is considered pratyaksha but not the seer himself.No one
wants r=
ealisation because there is no one who is not realised.

Can anyone say tha=
t he is not already realised or that he is apart from the
Self? No. Evident=
ly all are realised. What makes him unhappy is the desire
to exercise extra=
ordinary powers. He knows that he cannot do so. Therefore
he wants God to a=
ppear before him, confer all His powers on the devotee, and
keep Himself in=
 the background. In short,God should abdicate His powers in
favour of the m=
an.

D.: It is all right for mahatmas like Sri Bhagavan to speak out so
pla=
inly.Because the Truth does not swerve from you, you consider it easy for
a=
ll others. Nevertheless, the common folk have a real difficulty.

M.: Then =
does anyone say that he is not the Self?

D.: I meant to say that no one el=
se has the courage to put things straight
like Maharshi.

M.: Where is the =
courage in saying things as they are?
