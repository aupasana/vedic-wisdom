Dear Narsimha          - Namaste







We both belong to same
age group =
so no need of Sir.

=C2=A0

It is valid to say that
one gets blessings of a deity thr=
ough deity's krupa (kindness and compassion).
But then, why do you need a

=
"technician"
and "mediator" to apply for the "kindness and compassion"
of A=
lmighty god??? Why cannot one directly interact with the kind and
compassio=
nate deity, without a "mediator" in between?

At least, you thing my
point =
to be valid for reply. I was hoping that being a Sanskrit scholar you
will =
easily understand meaning of krupa in this context but it seems I was
wrong=
 so let me explain. I replace word kripa by [=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=
=A4=B8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6] prasada which will make this
simple. We do all ri=
tuals through priests pleasing the devata due to which we
get prasada. Now =
this doesn=E2=80=99t include kindness, compassion qualities of devata
and m=
akes the understanding clear. From my side this is due to mixing of religio=
n and
spirituality. Religion as a whole is for all four purusharthas i.e. d=
harma,
artha, kama and moksha while spirituality is
for moksha only. In oth=
er words you may think this as pathway to desire
fulfillment and pathway to=
 god. Desire fulfillment has nothing to do with
moksha and for moksha vasan=
akshaya, desire elimination is needed. In this
perspective you can understa=
nd me better.

We need remedies to
fulfill our desires which are blocked by=
 our own sins, curses, papa etc. So law
of karma including devatas will not=
 forgive us for our sins; so where is the
question of kindness, compassion?=
 Due to some past birth sins you don=E2=80=99t have
that much punya so you =
have to generate that by doing some rituals, japa etc. I
think you didn=E2=
=80=99t read my aacharyavarana and shreyodana words in real sense
though yo=
u know some vedic karmakanda concepts. To understand mediator think of
whol=
e process of getting a job i.e. application, call letter, interview, perks
=
negotiation etc. You want job so you do all these things; in the same way y=
ou
need solution for puzzle of your own karma so you must do all these thin=
gs. I
affirmed that you are also a mediator to all those who are doing homa=
 by
following your homa manuals. If you understand my affirmation it will b=
e easy
for you to know real meaning of mediator. Mediator understand needs =
of both
parties as he is qualified, trained for that so he can show us way =
to desire
fulfillment. 

Regarding whether the
result is from the priest's =
account or deity's account, both viewpoints are
correct in their own way. L=
et me elaborate. 

Deities are present in
microcosmic form in everyone. Whe=
n one prays to a deity and contemplates on the
deity's nature and

qualitie=
s, an interaction
occurs between one's consciousness and the *microcosmic* =
representation of the
deity within one's

consciousness (which is
identical=
 to the [macro]cosmic deity!). A tangible result - material or
spiritual - =
may occur as a result.

One can say that it is
bestowed by the deity's krup=
a. One can also say that a veil in one's
consciousness has been removed,

a=
llowed one to interact
with the microcosmic representation of the deity and=
 get some shakti (from the
deity). Whether you say

that one has accumulate=
d
shakti now or it is god's shakti is a matter of terminology. Bottomline i=
s that
one could not access that shakti earlier (due to dense impurities in=
 one's
consciousness that blocked one's consciousness from interacting with=
 the

microcosmic
representation of deity within one's consciousness). With=
 sadhana, those
impurities were removed and one could

access the shakti. A=
s
simple as that. BTW, one may look at the word "shakti" in an egoistic
way=
, but shakti comes with humility

and purity. Shakti is
almost synonymous t=
o purity.

Now, the same holds for a
priest. Just because one is born in a =
specific family, learnt to repeat a few
sentences and a few actions, one's =
consciousness does not automatically have an
open access to the microcosmic=
 representation of the deity within it. One is born
with the same kind of v=
eil and needs to be develop purity to remove it. In the
old days, most peop=
le from the priestly class were very pure and had a free
access to the divi=
nity within them. Unfortunately, though I have seen excellent
priests, they=
 are a very very small minority today.

Truth will always have
one face onl=
y. We can=E2=80=99t say both sides of coin are same. Should we accept A+B=
=3DC
and A+B=3DD? I again replace word krupa by Prasad for better understan=
ding. Let
us understand veil removal concept. Consider veil as a dark shado=
w / covering
of past karma. When we sit in closed room we don=E2=80=99t hav=
e access to sunlight due
to room walls, but if we come out of it we get lig=
ht. In same way room walls is
our karma, sun is deity and the effort of com=
ing out of that room is Prayers.
Here we don=E2=80=99t accumulate any shakt=
i but our darkness is removed due to sunlight
and in this light we can see =
things more clearly. Do we become stronger in sunlight?
I don=E2=80=99t kno=
w what you mean as shakthi i.e. purity; but if I understood
correctly punya=
 and shakti are totally different things. By shakthi you can
have a standin=
g to have negotiations with devata if you wish and by punya you
have ticket=
 for your aspirations in any birth. Do we have standing by doing
some japa =
etc for some years to have interaction with devata ? That really
requires =
=C2=A0authority[=E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0]
i.e=
. a state of trans which comes from lot of penance in many births. There ar=
e
and were many pure, noble people by mind, heart but that is not a criteri=
on,
qualification for devata interaction. Vasanakshaya [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=
=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=AF] up to
cert=
ain extent,
depth of dharana is imp to have interaction with divine. Same h=
olds good for yesterdays
or today=E2=80=99s priests and that=E2=80=99s why =
fruits were/are given by devatas from their
bank balance. 

If we say pries=
t must
have shakti how can we count his nature of shakti in terms of qualit=
y,
quantity, depth and need? Should we consider shakti to beget baby, remov=
e
diseases, give immense wealth is same?, how to differentiate priest with =
and
without shakthi, most imp who will differentiate priests with or withou=
t
shakti, what are the parameters to define this, what are the tools to
und=
erstand all these subtle points, etc will be the complex issues before
yaja=
mana/us when he/we think of doing any remedy. Do we have any universal
syst=
em for this? If you think over these issues you will come to know the
truth=
. If a priest perform a puja every third day he must have at least tons of
=
shakti to give results. Only person who is in unmani/trans avashta can have=

such a huge shakti [even great sages don=E2=80=99t have such shakti as per=
 vishvamitra,
trishanku story] =C2=A0and such person will
not use his power=
 to wash sins of so many people unless asked by his superiors
to do this. S=
uch great shakthi is not accumulated in one birth and no wise man
will wast=
e his shakti obtained from penances of so many births to wash sins of
peopl=
e for money. We read lot of stories of saints, sages refusing to change,
in=
tervene in prarbdhha of people. Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa didn=E2=80=99t r=
escue
mathurbabu, akshay from death trap though he was having immense shakt=
i. If you
give some serious thinking on this topic I hope you will understa=
nd futility of
shakti concept. Can you proclaim that predictions of all ast=
rologers always
come true? Can you give guaranty that if there is X yoga th=
ere will be Y
results?=C2=A0 Today maximum astrologers are
unable to give c=
orrect predictions so do you call for learning astrology on their
own to fi=
x remedies? Now a days many astrologers are giving fake remedies,
wrong pre=
dictions so will you say that don=E2=80=99t visit astrologers but learn
ast=
rology to have remedies for your bad yogas in horoscope?=C2=A0 The main dut=
y of priests is to have
substantially good knowledge / practice of rituals,=
mantras etc. with accuracy
and not sadhana as a mortal human being can not =
bless yajamana. That
responsibility rest with devatas; a divine powerhouse.=
 

=C2=A0

One can disagree with me,
but cannot change the facts on the gro=
und. Remedies done by most people with
blind faith in priests do not work. =
As a result, generation after generation is
losing faith in god, in sanatan=
a dharma and in remedies. The current sorry
state of sanatana dharma cannot=
 be improved by sticking to the letter (of
orthodoxy) and ignoring the spir=
it (of shastras). If people directly put faith
in god (instead of priests),=
 surrender to god and do small amount of sadhana
themselves, they will get =
better results. If more and more people (possibly
laymen) do safe and effec=
tive spiritual sadhanas such as homam and start to see
the material and spi=
ritual benefits, I am confident that eventually faith in
god and sanatana d=
harma will be improved in the coming generations. The proof
of the pudding =
is in eating it. If you do a sadhana or remedy, there must be
some tangible=
 result. Either you get a desired goal or something related ot you
see a si=
gnificant transformation in your attitude and thinking, or some such
clear =
result. In their first meeting, do you know what Swami Vivekananda told
his=
 foremost disciple Sister Nivedita? He said, "religion is not a matter
of f=
aith. It is a matter of experience."

=C2=A0

I think we are discussing
pri=
ests, remedies, astrology etc so we should stick to this only. I understand=
,
appreciate your stress for sadhana, spreading of sanatana dharma principl=
es but
in doing so we must not spread wrong ideas or interpret scriptures i=
n a wrong
way. People do or get done remedies for fulfilling their desires =
and at that
point they don=E2=80=99t need divine experiences; but they want=
 money, happiness, good
husband etc. If some body wants money desperately a=
nd by doing remedy if he
gets great peace of mind but no money; will he be =
satisfied? We need food,
love, happiness etc. to survive in this world and =
mere peace can=E2=80=99t make us to
survive.=C2=A0 People are loosing faith=
 in
dharma, remedies due to nature of kaliyuga as low morals, more desires,=
 less
faith for almighty, fake spiritualists etc. will be a majority and no=
t due to
vedics or priests. Spiritual experiences come under the fourth pur=
ushartha i.e.
moksha and all remedies comes under other three purusharthas,=
 mainly dharma,
artha and kama. 

=C2=A0

> WE, the jIvAs are
not beggars b=
ut anshA of GOD. ????? ???????

Well, if, as you said,
results are bestowed=
 essentially due to the kindness and compassion (krupa) of
god, what is wro=
ng in

becoming a beggar for
them? Begging strangers on the street for a do=
llar and begging god for his
"krupa" are not the same and so

don't look at=
 the word
beggar with contempt.

=C2=A0

I
didn=E2=80=99t looked word begga=
r with contempt. You might have missed my last
sentences like thousands wil=
l read you and hundreds will follow you. Swami
Vivekananda every time criti=
cized the words sins and sinner in some Christian
prayers. He at that time =
always spoke of amrutasya putra. When your approach is
not correct how you =
will have good interaction and desired results? When we
stand in front of g=
od should we get bog down by our dharana [=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=
=A3=E0=A4=BE]? See krupa and daya i.e.
blessings and mercy are two differen=
t things. When we call GOD we want HIM with
his krupa and when one begs he =
only wants alms with no need of his donor=E2=80=99s
existence. I think scho=
lar of your status will understand my real meaning. =C2=A0=C2=A0

DearNasim=
ha, either =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=

=8B=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=83=E0=A5=A4 To be
frank all this brain exercise is havin=
g very little spiritual value and doing
sadhana for self realization is the=
 key and that is the sole aim of all shruti,
smriti. But I posted an object=
ion only to request all members to have real
understanding of true nature o=
f above mentioned imp points as for me
materialistic world is a part and pa=
rcel of our existence; so materialistic
desires also. I do not want to defe=
nd or support vedic priests but scripture
references are very much differen=
t from your concepts. So I just wrote because
thousands will read you and h=
undreds will follow you.
