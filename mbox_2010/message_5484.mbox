Namaste ,

i have no words to express my thanks to NarasimhaJi for making o=
ut some time to read my chart...
Narasimhaji ...u may be right because i ha=
ve been attacked by black magic again and again.....this time, it may be th=
e same....

i have a few questions regarding the remedy you told me to do..=
.

i wanted to ask if its fine to do a hanuman homam at home instead of rea=
ding the chalisa 54 times for 120 days.....after all the homam has chalisa =
inbuilt in it...

If its fine...then....
1. wat should be the number of day=
s dat i must perform homam ?? should they be at a strech ???

2.while perfo=
rming homam...how many times do i make offering of the hanuman chalisa ever=
yday ??...

3.wat are the restrictions that apply to this sadhana apart fro=
m vegeterian food and celibacy ???...

4.can i do a homa of mahaganapati an=
d then switch to hanuman ji in the same homa....since we do a quick homa fo=
r mahaganapati first ??...
i wanted to offer mahaganapati mool mantra 21 ti=
mes and then offer the atharvashirsham ..?


If not...then i will do exactl=
y as u have outlined me.....chanting hanuman chalisa sitting on a yellow as=
an facing east 54 times daily....i wanted to know in that case does the 120=
 days have to be at a strech ???


Lookin forward to ur guidance,

Parijat =
Dutta
