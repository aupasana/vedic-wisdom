Respected Sir and members,

In the absence of Narsimha Sir, may I request t=
he learned members to kindly answer my questions.

I will be living in my m=
others place for some time. Is it ok to perform homam in a new place? What =
I mean is Sir was mentioning that homam has to be done at the same time and=
 same location everyday. So is new location fine?

Narsimha sir, the other =
day I was in store and saw a table of height two feet.Would the table be an=
 appropriate height for placing the havan kunda if one decides to do homa i=
n a table and chair? If No then can you please give exact specifications?

=
I have two yantras and an idol in which pranpratishta has been done. The ho=
use will be empty and no one will be there to take care of it. So will it b=
e ok to carry them along and pray at my mothers place. My mother says that =
once prana pratishta is done idols and yantras shouldn't be moved. 

There =
are some birth habits which I find very hard to let go, how to fight them.W=
hen I get angry I start using some abusive words which I later regret how t=
o fight them. Does anyone know of any nice discourses in youtube or good ti=
ps which can help in fighting anger. 

Thanks and regards,
Priya
