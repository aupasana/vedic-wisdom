Namaskaram Narsimhagaru,

You had mentioned that for some...after doing hom=
am karmic cleansing can be months, for some years and for some lifetime. So=
 obviously a person who undergoes karmic cleansing for lifetime doesn't get=
 much spiritual progress. Does it mean that person also doesn't attain salv=
ation or merge with God in this birth? Will he have to take rebirth to fini=
sh the leftover job? 
Many thanks for helping me come so far..
Best Regards=
,
Priya
