Dear Nagraj ji,
=C2=A0
Let me try to explain the second part. Once a person=
 attains a certain degree of realization through one path, one deity, if he=
 has an inclination, he can very easily then do sadhana of other paths and =
deities, in my opinion.
=C2=A0
But before you attain to a certain stage of =
realization/communion, and it may become very,very, very difficult to attai=
n the same if you keep changing your sadhana and deity every few years or m=
onths. After success is attain in ONE sadhana, one is free to move to any o=
ther. But at one point, one should ideally stick to one for the simple reas=
on that success with the worship of even one deity is so difficult. It does=
 not come in one day and in fact it may ofen take many lifetimes for ordina=
ry souls like us. Therefore, it is the most practical=C2=A0 strategy to foc=
us on one at a time rather than many simultaneously and in the process achi=
eve nothing. 
=C2=A0
Sri Aadi Shankaracharya probably attained self-realiza=
tion through the single marg=C2=A0of gyana/meditation and then went on to c=
ompose various hymns to other aspects of teh divine. Same maybe the case wi=
th Sri Muththuswamy Dikshitar. You see even Ramakrishna had visions and exp=
eriences of so many deities from Krishna to Shiva to Jesus and Kaali. But h=
is first communion was with Kaali. 
=C2=A0
If you achieve success in the sa=
dhana of one deity and then want to experience other deities, that maybe qu=
ite possible. But to reach a stage of realization, one should ideally stick=
 to one path/one sadhana one deity.
=C2=A0
I hope I could explain what I am=
 trying to get at.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Dear Sri Utpalji and Rajarshiji, 
=C2=A0
T=
hank you for the response. I do understand that Telang Swamy might have bee=
n a great yogi but my point is how are we to understand that greatness and =
in that context what is ununsual in the priest's reaction that God had to p=
unish him that hard! If priest was aware and still did that, then I can und=
erstand the consequence. I haven't yet the second book though! Probably tha=
t will explain. 
=C2=A0
Also, I understand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa' s famou=
s 'Dig at one place 10 feet instead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to f=
ind water'. But contrary to that we find great saints / composers / poets f=
rom India have indeed worshipped many forms of the God and were successful =
in that approach as well. For instance, there is not a single deity form th=
at was not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was =
famous that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and =
he left his mortal coil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence=
 of many of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have=
 immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on=
. So was Thyagaraja. So=C2=A0were many great composers of Carnatic Music in=
 that path. In fact they were all great advaitis and never saw any differen=
ce=C2=A0between any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great =
poet of Andhra who
 translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems,=
=C2=A0pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi=
, Durga, Lakshmi in that order before declaring that he got the divine insp=
iration from Lord Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the differ=
ence between any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehe=
nd why Vimalananda accuses=C2=A0many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just b=
ecause their puja mandirams are filled with many photographs/ idols of diff=
erent murthis of Almighty.

Nagaraj Garu,

I thought exactly the =
same way when I recently read the book. If i would have been there, i would=
 have done probably the same thing unless i knew Trailanga swami very well.=
 
But the matter is clarified in Aghora Part-2.
If i remember correctly, In=
 Aghora Part-2, Vimalananda has clarified the seemingly extreme behavior of=
 Trailanga Swami. I don't remember the chapter now but it was said that Tra=
ilanga swami, being a very advance Saadhaka exactly knew how to convert fac=
es and urine in to Nectar or some divine substance or else how he could hav=
e dared to commit such act.

Beautiful... i find vima=
lananda' s extreme views, very appealing and full of wisdom. The underlying=
 advise in those external rough words is same as Thakur Ramakrishna used to=
 say "Dig at one place rather than digging at many places...". It does not =
require to disrespect or disbelive other deities or faith.

Jusr my 2 cents=
...

Utpal
