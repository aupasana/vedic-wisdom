 Talk 101.

A gentleman from Ambala asked: What is the rationalistic explan=
ation of
Draupadi=E2=80=99s sari becoming endless?

M.: Spiritual matters c=
annot be fitted into rationalism*. Spirituality is
transcendental. The mira=
cle was after Draupadi had surrendered herself. The
secret lies in surrende=
r.

More Over Verse 468 Of Guru Vachaka Kovai Says,

In ancient days the ch=
aste lady [Draupadi] had her honour saved and her sari
lengthened by the Gr=
ace of Lord Krishna only when at last, letting go of her
own hold on her sa=
ri, she lifted up both her hands in complete surrender to
Him; and the stro=
ng wicked one [Duchasana] who was stripping her fell down
abashed.

Sadhu O=
m: So long as Draupadi was trying to hold her sari by her own hands
lest it=
 should be stripped off and was calling Sri Krishna for help, His
Grace did=
 not begin to function. But as soon as, having complete faith in
His gracio=
us protection, she gave up holding her clothes with her own hands
and lifte=
d them above her head,
her surrender became complete and hence His Grace be=
gan to function by
making her sari grow unendingly and by making the wicked=
 Duchasana, who was
stripping her, fall down in a swoon.

This incident is =
pointed out there in order to instruct us that we should
give up the sense =
of doership and should thus surrender to God completely
and unreservedly.
