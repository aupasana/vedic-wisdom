Namaskar,

> Lord Rama defeated and killed Ravana.
    Killing Ravana was n=
ot a great deed.
Ravana had done that 10 times himself, beheading his own h=
ead, but the shakti of his sadhana was such that he got a new head every ti=
me to continue the sadhana. On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally eff=
ects the death of Physical consciousness, so even that part is not in the h=
ands of a mortal Physical form.

> If you still put Ravana above Rama in sh=
akti, I 
> question your understanding of what "shakti" is.
    On a mundan=
e level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was r=
eminded of it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because=
 of the curse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to remember =
the series of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective o=
f the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by the asso=
ciation with Rama. Ravana didn't have perfect memory, else he would have at=
tempted to kill Vibhishana sooner than later.

    The use of shakti agains=
t avatar, binding the physical body of both Ram and Lakshman, by a mortal (=
Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the motherly love of Yashoda could=
n't bind Krishna avatar by a rope. Meghnaad was son of Ravana. If it were n=
ot for Hanumaan, and Garuda using divine powers, the result would have been=
 different.

    Despite all, without Vibhishana revealing the secrets, it =
was impossible to kill Ravana.

> Even a high level of understanding of the=
 field of duality and even > a

s in the field of duality,

 it.

    What does the "highest shakti" do ? Compete with lower shakti ? W=
hy then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ? Instead, just =
order Rudra to finish the life of all ones' enemies ?

    Egolessness is n=
ot a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness, in the same manner as Ego=
 is a quality of Physical creation. It reveals a manner of operating harmon=
iously with Nature, without creating conflicts, something that Ravana didn'=
t know.

Regards,
Aryama
