Namaste,

For those who don't know Hindi, this cou=
plet can be loosely translated as: "He looks in the mirror to check that he=
 looks good, but also ensures that nobody catches him looking at the mirror=
!"

There may indeed be many gurus today who are image-conscious, hypocriti=
cal and manipulative. It is a sign of the times we live in. People get the =
gurus that they deserve.

However, I humbly suggest that our critical abili=
ties should not be wasted on people and things that we do not have a respon=
sibility to change. Critical abilities should be directed inward to critiqu=
e oneself, towards people one has a responsibility towards, such as one's s=
ishyas, and towards things where one has a duty to accomplish something. Wh=
y criticize other people? Let them engage in their games and make progress =
at their own pace. Apne ko kya lena dena (what have we got to do with them)=
?

Best regards,
Narasimha
