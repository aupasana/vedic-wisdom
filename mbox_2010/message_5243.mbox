Dear Utpal
In Iskcon they use word Prabhu for other devotees,example if I a=
m Iskconite and if I meet you that I shall call you hello Prabhu now the st=
ory behind this(from their own words)that when they call you prabhu means y=
ou are under their Radar ! Means be watchful,careful from them!
I honestly =
did not want to start this discussion because of one reason and that is thi=
s our very group is free from such topics and even Shri Satya Prakashji ind=
irectly also pointed to this plus point of this group but I could not stop =
myself even in past and in present and my blood start boiling when they use=
 word Demi God for my shivji,who are they to use such barometer for our dev=
i and devatas?
Further there are numerous examples of such devotees giving =
pravachanas when you visit some temples,here I am omitting the names of tho=
se temples and one devotee who came from USA,a white man from Iskcon recent=
ly visited one temple and he unfortunately was present in some pravachana g=
iven there by some lady from Bangalore,he then wrote several posts in many =
groups with his views and objections on such theories.T
This hard path was =
one of the reason why they had to close their own discussion forum called I=
ndia Divine recently as there were some stupid comments on Shiva,Durga etc.=
.thing is they just cannot neglect Shiva because Shiva has a special place =
in Hinduism and nothing will move against his will.
If anybody has soft cor=
ner for Iskcon,I shall NOT say sorry for them for what I have=C2=A0written =
and said here,truth is a truth and let it be bitter for them.Glad to know t=
hat you controlled your self,its indeed a very very difficult job after lis=
tening to their pravachana(thats what they say else it is a hopeless speech=
 in real).I agree totally with your views that after listing to those lines=
 even Shri Krishna must have run away from that place.If you go to Dwarka t=
here is a huge gate made by them(Iskcon)and local people just take no notic=
e of that gate what so ever till this date and this what they deserve.
rega=
rds and pranams,no sympothies to those who are really blind.

Namaskaar Narasimha Garu,

As it happenned, =
i visited a close family friend's house and attended "Damodara Pujan" condu=

i attended the same Puja in the sam=

her ISCON devotee who did it last time but this time My friend requested me=
 not to object anything that person says.

I tell you that I had a very har=

he Damodar Aarati and Damodar Ashtakam, but after that the middle aged and =
soft natured devotee started "Pravachan", There was bigotry all over. The p=

als amongst Gods such as Shiva, Sun, Durga and such and mounting on them in=
sult after insults...
I am sure that after Aarati, even Krushna would have =
ran away from the place like Ranchhod Ray.

However, It also proved to me t=
hat My self control has little bit improved since last year though :).

wit=

shna that He never entangle me to ISCON ever. I am much much much better of=

I must say that there are good hearted, sin=

I thank krishna for he has=

I am sorry if i used very stro=

Yours,

 Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when=
 you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana l=
ifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly b=
ecome a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatr=
iyas and vaisyas.

<DIV>In Iskcon they use=
 word Prabhu for other devotees,example if I am Iskconite and if I meet you=
 that I shall call you hello Prabhu now the story behind this(from their ow=
n words)that when they call you prabhu means you are under their Radar ! Me=
ans be watchful,careful from them!</DIV>
<DIV>I honestly did not want to st=
art this discussion because of one reason and that is this our very group i=
s free from such topics and even Shri Satya Prakashji indirectly also point=
ed to this plus point of this group but I could not stop myself even in pas=
t and in present and my blood start boiling when they use word Demi God for=
 my shivji,who are they to use such barometer for our devi and devatas?</DI=
V>
<DIV>Further there are numerous examples of such devotees giving pravach=
anas when you visit some temples,here I am omitting the names of those temp=
les and one devotee who came from USA,a white man from Iskcon recently visi=
ted one temple and he unfortunately was present in some pravachana given th=
ere by some lady from Bangalore,he then wrote several posts in many groups =
with his views and objections on such theories.T</DIV>
<DIV>This hard path =
was one of the reason why they had to close their own discussion forum call=
ed India Divine recently as there were some stupid comments on Shiva,Durga =
etc..thing is they just cannot neglect Shiva because Shiva has a special pl=
ace in Hinduism and nothing will move against his will.</DIV>
<DIV>If anybo=
dy has soft corner for Iskcon,I shall NOT say sorry for them for what I hav=
e written and said here,truth is a truth and let it be bitter for them=
.Glad to know that you controlled your self,its indeed a very very difficul=
t job after listening to their pravachana(thats what they say else it is a =
hopeless speech in real).I agree totally with your views that after listing=
 to those lines even Shri Krishna must have run away from that place.If you=
 go to Dwarka there is a huge gate made by them(Iskcon)and local people jus=
t take no notice of that gate what so ever till this date and this what the=
y deserve.</DIV>

 top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite di=

will see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees=
 all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths=
 to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with different o=
bstacles. One path may have some snow. One
 path may be too steep. One path=
 may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen=
 trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can re=
ach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obst=
acles and reaching the top.<BR>> <BR>> Let people follow the paths ch=

 Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not real=

of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there =
are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rit=
