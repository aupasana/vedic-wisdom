Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Two R=
eplies (Agnivas and Special Days/Times)

=C2=A0 
Namaste Ashutosh and Rajar=
shi,

There are several technicalities like this, which apply when one does=
 a ritual to ensure a specific material result. Some of them are meaningful=
 to an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millenn=
ia by intellectuals.

However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for =
the pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.

T=
here are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam ev=
eryday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these tech=
nicalities.

* * *

If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to =
heavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on=
 earth. You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow=
 of signals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all =
times. Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certain=
ly capable of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and ma=
king them reach various deities.

* * *

If you want to get your father (or=
 mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may=
 want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not=
 tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course=
, even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your=
 father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such age=
ndas and only want to tell your father "I love you" and take whatever he gi=
ves, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favor=
ed by parents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to g=
ive.

Similarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are s=
everal technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you=
 may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many c=
orruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of gettin=
g specific material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best app=
roach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express you=
r love and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad.=
 Such a person will be favored by deities over the long run.

* * *

Namast=
e Ramakishore,

Different points of space and different points of time have=
 a different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana =
in Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the sam=
e as sadhana on Pournima.

If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally =
(e.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly=
 Krishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned wi=
th the energy of that deity.

However, one can only make so much progress w=
ith occasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, m=
ore intense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra=
/deity, one can do it every day and at all times.

* * *

A lot of beggars =
may be standing at the gate of a king's palace, waiting for the king to see=
 them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king =
may be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so=
 and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gat=
e on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many =
beggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the =
other hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king's eyes may fall =
on you someday!

Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, kee=
p doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity's gra=
ce. That is a sureshot formula for success.

* * *

The issue of auspicious=
 days and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more=
 auspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For exampl=
e, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to =
go there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, G=
ambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you m=
ay still get out cheaply.

Instead of helping, sadhana done on a particular=
ly good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I r=
emember one incident.

A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I w=
anted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for t=
he whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anythin=
g like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned i=
t to Manish and he said, "excellent, go ahead". I meditated with Gayatri ma=
ntra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute break=
s and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day.=
 When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.

Next morning, I real=
ized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, bir=
thday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said th=
at spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective =
than a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened t=
o be an auspicious day.

I mentioned it to Manish. He said, "I knew it was =
Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me". I asked him w=
hy he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, "knowing you were d=
oing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have i=
nstead distracted you."

He was right. As such, I was a little "proud" of t=
he sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement=
 and expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted=
 my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadh=
ana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of usel=
ess excitement would've been higher and distracted me even more!

Bottomlin=
e: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of y=
our mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excite=
ment and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and p=
atiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foo=
lproof strategy. My 2 cents..

Best regards,
Narasimha
