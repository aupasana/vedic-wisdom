Dear Priya,
=C2=A0
Why not? There are lot of people who stay at home, lead =
a normal family life and yet do homas. Nothing wrong in that. She can very =
well do homams.

I would like to ask a q=
uestion on behalf of my friend who is very young and recently married. She =
says that as she is very young and not seen the world yet she is not ready =
for renounciation. There are two kinds of spiritual people. One who renounc=
es everything and gives himself to God, other one who doesn't renounce anyt=
hing but still wishes to pray God. She believes she is the latter. Based on=
 this can she perform the homam.?Are any changes to be done to the existing=
 manual. 

Thanks and regards,
Priya
