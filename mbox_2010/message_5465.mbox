My=C2=A0Pranams to you,
Do not commit so called Sin,try this remedy which I=
 firmly belive most of Hindus perhaps forgot or not putting much attention =
on it.
The most powerful and sacred objects on earth is Rudraksha,there are=
 sereral ways to wear it,few wear them as devotee of Shri Shivji,some takes=
 astrologer's advise and wear them though at no place in shashtra/purana(Sp=
ecially Shri Shivamahapurana)one can find=C2=A0any connections with planets=
 but somehow astrologers are mentioning connections of Rudraksha with speci=
fic planets like 1 and 12 mukhi for Surya,2 mukhi for Chandra etc.Let me ad=
mit that only Rudraksha has such powers that they can lift the malefic plan=
ets and turn them benific for us,Gems cannot do this and it is a total bogu=
s theory to subscribe Gems for malefic planets.My=C2=A0respected friend Mr.=

I wish first you start with simple panch mukhi mala made of 5 mukhi =
beads.You should use 32 plus 1(meru bead)=3Dtotal 33 beads here and beads s=
hould be bigger and not old fashioned 0 size type.Do a proper pooja of this=
 mala and do not forget to offer this mala on the feet of Maa in temple,ene=
rgy will only flow once you do this as she is param shakti and ultimate for=
ce in this universe.Offer a sparsh of Shri Shivalingam and then energize yo=
ur mala with proper beeja mantra,these mantras you can find in Shri Shivama=
hapurana or in other purana(use google).
One last=C2=A0advise,do ganthan i.=
e making of mala in such a way that it should be mouth to mouth and tail to=
 tail formation,Rudraksha is a bead and it has one part which is pointed ca=
lled mouth and other part is flat which is tail.Put a knot in between the t=
wo beads,I can built this mala in 1 hour and made many and my life time gur=
antee to you that slowly but surely all your problems will be solved.
One o=
f the most remarkable thing on Rudraksha is,if I die wearing Rudraksha mala=
 on my body,there is a sure place for me in heaven even though I am not ent=
itled to get moksha,this is a life time=C2=A0promise of Shri Shivji till th=
is universe lasts.Sad thing is we forgot or ignore this holy bead being Hin=
dus and that as per me is the sadest part of Hindu religion.A simple 5 mukh=
i bead only cost Rupee 5 or 7=C2=A0 maximum!
Last but not the least- Rudrak=
sha is THE ONLY PLANT or BEAD born from Shri Rudra's tears,no other plant i=
n hinduism is so sacrd like it and having=C2=A0such direct connection with =
any other Devi or Devas,trust me and see the huge swing in your life.
I cam=
e to this group only because of Rudraksha !!!

Dear All,


I h=
ave tried to make spiritual progress for long, and made little progress (bu=
t not significant). Ever since my childhood, primarily because of my upbrin=
ging, I have been trying and observing a lot of "Good" things. I have been =
reading texts on spirituality and was a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda'=
s writings. I always found Kabir's following lines, as a best (and most com=
pact) commentary on the two prominent paths of spirituality: -


"Ek kahoon=
 to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari"
"Hai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vicha=
ree"


i.e.
"If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is contemplation"
"L=
et it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation"


Until last year, my =
faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last year made gave =
me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to think. I have come up=
 with several doubts (just a few given below) about spirituality and God an=
d Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifted towards atheism (sus=
prisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi, when am observing a fa=
st). If someone can help me understand the problesm with my doubts, it woul=
d be great help:-=C2=A0


- Isn't "Ishwar Paridhaan" i.e. "Ishwar yat karot=
i shobhanam karoti" same as stockholm syndrome?=C2=A0
- Most people with go=
od conduct I see these days are suffering and those who happily claim thems=
elves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the supreme power's =
role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but last year made m=
e realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak spiritually too. So=
, I dont see them to be connected somehow.
- I do understand that in Kali Y=
uga, the patience levels are low, and so called Godly correction of the wro=
ng doing, takes its own time. But doesn't that promotes the bad karma in it=
self, specially in this yuga? And how long can one wait?
- Suicide is consi=
dered a greatest sin, as it is throwing away the best gift we get from the =
lord. But, I am not sure that if people do it for fun. God presents a perso=
n with tough situations in the name of testing times, and some day the limi=
t is reached. Then isn't god accomplice in this so called crime.
- In first=
 place, why does he need to test us?


As I said that all these question ma=
ke me feel that I am losing the faith in His goodness. All my spiritual pro=
gress if any has been corrupted by these testing times. And no help came to=
 me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer, faced a lot of troubl=
es themselves and are also suffering now. This is what makes me go mad abou=
t it, as I am unable to bear this that I have passed my agony to someone.

=

Despite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied my mind for quite some t=
ime, I feel that I still survive a chance to get back to my faith in real t=
erms and not driven by materialistic desire. This is the reason I am writin=
g this mail. May be someone can make me see what I am missing here. Else, I=
 see myself getting totally crazy, insane and moving towards atheism and qu=
it possibly committing the so called "Sin".


Regards,
Sri
