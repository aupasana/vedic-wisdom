Gentlemen,

I have been reading these messages with great interest.  My tak=
e on vegetarian vs non vegetarian food has to be about ahimsa.  Basically w=
e do not want to impart undue suffering on other living entities unless it =
is absolutely necessary for our survival and it should be our last resort. =
 I prefer and am a vegetarian solely on this consideration.  The last time =
I checked nearly 200000 cattle per day are slaughtered for human consumptio=
n in the US. Think about it, Is this really necessary for our survival?

Go=
d bless you all

Namaste Narasimha,
 
I dis=
gree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with=
 the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained right a=
t the beginning).
 
(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Natio=
nal Public Radio) several months back. They conducted an experiment on gori=
llas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The other set was fed with nut=
s, fruits etc. After several months, researchers found a gap in the intelli=
gence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were duller.

If you have any=
 references for this, in terms of whether they published any paper on the s=
ame, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I am open to lear=
ning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.
 
Their=
 theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with =
nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of br=
ain. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or=
 not,  a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual d=
evelopment.
 
This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned=
, because human stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds ce=
rtain animal products far easier to digest than most planet based products.=
 In my other mail, I have qoted from a couple of research papers and books =
on clinical nutrition and dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; wh=
ich may take a few days since I have to get them from people who deal with =
these topics professionally, but time is not a problem. All the papers are =
from the most accepted and reputed scientific journals. There is no confusi=
on. Which is why I said, it is myth that vegeterian foods are easier to dig=
est, if digestibility is the criteria. 
 
Further, in my experience, I neve=
r found traditional vegeterians to be any more dull or smarter than traditi=
onal omnivores. 
 
(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own v=
aasanas and their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good.=
 Otherwise, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.
 
An animal has a s=
pecific physical structure and needs to maintain the same. But if trained t=
hey can 'adjust' to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding vegeteria=
n diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body structu=
re is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of su=
rvival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and weak=
nesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result fr=
om an unnatural diet to an animal? 
 
Not that all dogs who are feed a veg =
diet end up being diseased, but the chances increase a lot. It is like not =
all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one susceptible to cancer. It =
increases the probability. Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal =
if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best way possible, providin=
g it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.
 
 
____________=
___
 
 
A question for you.
 
Scientists studying evolution and human body =
structures have concluded that meat eating along with cropping and fruits h=
as been prevelant since at least 4 million years. That, without a diet whic=
h was omnivorous, the structure of the human stomach (lack of a developed c=
aecum), and the threefold increase in brain size (from archeological eviden=
ces) could never have been what it is today. Which means, an omnivorous die=
t has been a natural process, so ingrained that it has changed the very str=
ucture of the human body. This cannot be done consciously, but only by the =
work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will provide relevent resear=
ch papers to prove my claim).
 
What is your take on this?

Subject: [ved=
ic-wisdom] Food we eat

  
Namaste friends,

There has been a lot of discus=
sion on food. A few quick comments.

(1) We are we we eat. Production of va=
rious chemicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what =
we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.

(2) Much has been w=
ritten on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. Th=
ere are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.

Eating the flesh or body par=
ts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a k=
arma. Self-identification of plants with their physical body is much subtle=
r and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.

Espe=
cially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by corpo=
rations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their s=
uffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.

(3) I heard an inter=
view with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. T=
hey conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with m=
eat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, res=
earchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with=
 meat were duller.

Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more e=
nergy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towa=
rds the development of brain. Though they were not sure if the same thing a=
pplies to human beings or not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maxim=
ize one's intellectual development.

(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may =
feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well on work that requires alertness a=
nd skill. That is because the digestive process is using up a lot of energy=
 (also known as agni or fire) and there isn't much agni available for other=
 activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the min=
d. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni a=
nd that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy m=
eal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.
=

(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried=
 food with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are con=
sumed more frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and th=
ere is less agni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual idea=
s and experiences. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (s=
imple grains, simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with =
mild spices, and fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more =
agni is available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and exp=
eriences.

(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks =
of dry grass may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of inter=
nal fire may be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a p=
erson with excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of in=
ternal fire may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructi=
ons (wet grass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis a=
nd chakras.

One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of a=
gni on digesting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another pe=
rson may eat saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual trans=
formation and yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best cours=
e of action for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All =
other things being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual p=
rogress.

(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas a=
nd their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwis=
e, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.

(8) One should eat to live =
and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself s=
o that one can fulfil one's dharma in the material world using physical bod=
y and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritu=
al sadhana.

Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific=
 days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are mor=
e important for transformation and success, than occasional practices.

(9)=
 By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food=
 to be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on ho=
w deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one inte=
rnally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing =
(e.g. eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.

o do sadhana before eating.<br><br>(5) If foods that light up a higher dige=
stive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with more oil, spicy foods that sti=
mulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more frequently, agni is diverted t=
owards digestion more often and there is less agni available for assimilari=
ng intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If one eats saattwik f=
ood that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple lentils and simple v=
egetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), less agni is di=
verted towards digestion and more agni is available for assimilaring intell=
ectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.<br><br>(6) Even a big fire cann=
ot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be burnt by just o=
ne spark! Similarly, little bit of internal
 fire may be enough to assimila=
te spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent vaasanas and =
few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed in a per=
son with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all depe=
nds on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.<br><br>One person may =
eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting them and ye=
t make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik food, =
maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle t=
o progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ig=
nore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, th=
at maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.<br><br>(7) Regardin=
g Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an =
animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fello=
w whatever he/she needs.<br><br>(8)
 One should eat to live and not live to=
 eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one can =
fulfil one's dharma in the material world using physical body and make spir=
itual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.<br>=
<br>Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it=
 is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more importa=
nt for transformation and success, than occasional practices.<br><br>(9) By=
 merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food to=
 be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how d=
eeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one interna=
lly feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.=
g. eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.<br><br>Best regar=
