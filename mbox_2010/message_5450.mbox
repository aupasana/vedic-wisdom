 Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya

   
Namaste,
 
Th=
ere are some interesting information about the Naths including GorakshaNath=
, 
and quite a bit of misinformation too.
 
Firstly, the 9 Naths are consid=
ered to be immortals. They are worshipped mostly 
in Maharastra in India. T=
hose who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhaktisar. 
That text is not a m=
ere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayana of which 
can give seriou=
s spiritual benefits. There are some very old books in Bengali 
too which s=
peak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. But authentic 
sources tel=
l me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta is based on 
the na=
me of Chowrungee Nath.
 
 
In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are consid=
ered to be household deities. 
Coming to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar=
 details stories of all the 9 nath, 
their origin and their lives. Lineages=
 of the Nath are found in plenty and 
maximum in Maharastra. This is infact=
 considered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna 
decided to come down as Dyaneshwar,=
 and 9 spiritual giants came along with him 
to work. These were the Nath.
=
 
In Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru of GorakshaNath i=
s 
associated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. 

 
There are Kan-phattas wh=
o consider themselves to be of the lineage of Naths. 
They pierce their ear=
lobes as a process of initiation. Similarly there are many 
wandering mendi=
cants and Aghoris who also trace their lineage to the Naths.
 
To say the X=
 or Y Ashram in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is based on a 
fallac=
ious understanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. 

 
Just like many i=
gnorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world are 
present in K=
asi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.That is one 
linea=
ge, but more are there which may or may not be in public view. Similarly, 
=
the tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghoris - are varied and myriar=
d. 
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi

Namaste friends,

I am forwarding a mail from Vinay ji that was c=
c'ed to vedic-wisdom but not 
delivered due to non-membership.

Namaste Vin=
ay ji,

> In your message above, I read "I am the body". This feeling

As you correctly ju=
dged, I do identify with this body most of the time, except 
at the time of=
 experiences like the one described below. All we can do is to 
endeavour t=
o overcome it..

> This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-=
realization.

When this discussion on siddhis and shakti started a while ba=
ck, that is 
essentially what I said. I am in full agreement with you.

Of =
course, knowing intellectually is one thing, tasting it now and then is 
an=
other and being it always is yet another! As you said, this requires Tapas.=
 
Having wrong goals like obtaining this siddhi or that siddhi or physical =

immortality does not help  one in that.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<div>Namaste,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There ar=
e some interesting information about the Naths including GorakshaNath,=
 and quite a bit of misinformation too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Firstl=
y, the 9 Naths are considered to be immortals. They are worshipped mostly i=
n Maharastra in India. Those who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhaktisa=
r. That text is not a mere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayana of=
 which can give serious spiritual benefits. There are some very old books i=
n Bengali too which speak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. But a=
uthentic sources tell me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta=
 is based on the name of Chowrungee Nath.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&nbs=
p;</div>
<div>In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are considered to be ho=
usehold deities. Coming to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar details stori=
es of all the 9 nath, their origin and their lives. Lineages of the Nath ar=
e found in plenty and maximum in Maharastra. This is infact considered=
 to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna decided to come down as Dyaneshwar, and 9 spiri=
tual giants came along with him to work. These were the Nath.</div>
<div>&n=
bsp;</div>
<div>In Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru of =
GorakshaNath is associated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. </div>
<div>&nb=
sp;</div>
<div>There are Kan-phattas who consider themselves to be of the l=
ineage of Naths. They pierce their earlobes as a process of initiation. Sim=
ilarly there are many wandering mendicants and Aghoris who also trace their=
 lineage to the Naths.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To say the X or Y Ashra=
m in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is based on a fallacious underst=
anding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ju=
st like many ignorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world are=
 present in Kasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.That =
is one lineage, but more are there which may or may not be in public v=
iew. Similarly, the tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghoris - =
are varied and myriard. </div>

;<br>> I like to hear and read spiritual talks by others, but I really<b=

e<br>> purpose. In your message above, I read "I am the body". This feel=
ing<br>> is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years. Due t=
o my<br>> efforts of self-purification, which included overcoming Deep S=
leep and<br>> ensure constant Japa even throughout night, I was blessed =
with the<br>> visits of many deities and siddhas and it will be foolish =
to describe<br>> these
 experiences to everone. I was gaining some siddh=
is, but I left<br>> that road due to some unsavoury incidents. The only =
siddhi, if you can<br>> call it a siddhi, that I gained through Tapa and=
 Blessings and which I<br>> want to keep is my enhanced capacity to judg=
e things, books, persons<br>> and events. Earlier, I wasted years torn i=
n the horns of the dilemma<br>> of to be or not to be a part of the fals=
e melodrama known as Samsaara,<br>> lingering in the labyrinths of Doubt=
s of all sorts. I got the correct<br>> answer later : To be AND not to b=
e at the same time. To be, but with a<br>> Saaksheebhaava. To watch not =
only others, but our own actions and<br>> thoughts, dreams, etc, as a me=
re Onlooker and not as a participant;<br>> hence Not to be too. Shri Mad=
-Bhaagavata says : "aashaa hi paramam<br>> duHkham, nairaashyam paramam =
sukham".<br>><br>> One personal experience I want to share is that th=
e Ego I was
 thinking<br>> as my real Self got detached from me long ago=
, but I have not got good<br>> riddance from it : it now abuses me but I=
 do not care for it. I<br>> sometimes keep a pretence of Ego to deal wit=
h worldly persons, but the<br>> real Ego is a detached powerless entity =
watched by me. Years ago, once<br>> I felt my existence sinking down at =
night. I asked my<br>> Upastha/Jananendriya to come up; it answered : Br=
ahmaa ji made my<br>> place at bottom, how can I come up?? Then I realiz=
ed my folly. The<br>> Praana should come up. Others may laugh at me, but=
 the fact is that I<br>> could hear my indriyas and could talk to them a=
s if they were separate<br>> beings!! I gradually realized that they acc=
ompany me from time<br>> immemorial, but I do not really belong to them,=
 or to this ephemeral<br>> Body.<br>> This is the real Siddhi we shou=
ld all strive for : Seal-realization.<br>> Japa, tapa, homam, dhyaana, e=
tc
 are all means. The end is Constant<br>> Self-Awareness, awareness of=
 the real Self which is omnipresent,<br>> omniscient, disinrested and de=
tached, yet one with everone. Veda does<br>> not differentiate between i=
ndividual soul and God. Last verse of White<br>> YV : "yo asau Aaditya p=
urushaH so asau aham". This normal state of<br>> Atman is sama-aadhi, op=
posed to egoistical state which is Vyaadhi.<br>> Both states can be easi=
ly attained and retained, provided constant<br>> practice is made. Vyaad=
hi or Vyutthaana is easier due to past habits<br>> of mind and indriyas.=
 That is why Tapa is required for Samaadhi.<br>> Samaadhi needs statue-l=
ike fixation of the body as well as of the<br>> mind, which can be attai=
ned only through Tapa for normal humans. But<br>> most of the mortals in=
 Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. They do<br>> not know that real =
Dhyaana is a painful Tapa till it becomes a normal<br>> habit of the
 pu=
rified mind, after which dhyaana opens the road to<br>> Bliss. No worldl=
y pleasue can be compared to the siritual bliss when<br>> Soul is Itself=
 and Only Itself.<br>> -vj<br>><br>> On 12/12/10, Narasimha PVR Ra=
