At several places in the scriptures, especially in Puranas, we find example=
s of phala-shruti. For example if one has listened to a particular upakhaya=
na or story one would get certain results. In particular:

1. One very ofte=
n finds statements like "if one has read even one shloka, or half a shloka =
or even one fourth a shloka one shall be delivered of all sins".

2. Anothe=
r example one story in harivamsha purana says that if one has listened to i=
t, one shall never be born in a tiryak or animal yoni.

3. Padma purana giv=
es phala shurti for each chapter of the Gita.

There are many many such sta=
tements that one can find in texts. By reading them, one gets a feeling tha=
t these statements must be exaggerations since how can one get delievered o=
f all sins by simply reading one-fourth of a shloka? But then, such stateme=
nts being made by scriptures, cannot be doubted so easily.

What should be =
made out of such statements? Is reading one-fourth of a shloka really so po=
werful?
