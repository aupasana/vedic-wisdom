Respected members,

In lalit ji's mail, I found no contradictions to Narasi=
mha Ji's teachings except that Lalit ji misinterpreted a couple of sentence=
s from Narasimha ji's mail.

It happens usually and i also receive similar =
responses when i repost Narasimha ji's posts in forum. And responders are m=
ostly non members of vedic wisdom group. I advice them to read his post-com=
pilation book to get a better idea of Narasimha ji's point of view.

Person=
ally, I think Narasimha ji's teachings contain 'core essence' of spirituali=
ty which is common in all the religions and paths but unfortunately not hig=
hlighted in most of the paths now a days. most probably this is the reason =
for misunderstandings and conflicts.

Please forgive me for my mistaken and=
 wrongly choosen words.

Regards
Atul
