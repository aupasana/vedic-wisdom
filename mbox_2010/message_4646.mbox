Namaste,
 
Verses 10-23 below are the actual 108 names (i.e. starting from =
"prakR^itiM vikR^itiM vidyAM sarva bhUta hitapradaaM" and ending at "brahma=
 viShNu shivaatmikaaM trikaalaGYaana sampannaaM namaami bhuvaneshvarIM"). I=
t is 14 anushtup verses in all.
 
It is actually given in the Mahalakshmi h=
omam manual as one of the options for the main homam, apart from Sri Sookta=
m and Mahalakshyashtakam. The 14 verses can be found in the manual.
 
Best =
regards,
Narasimha
