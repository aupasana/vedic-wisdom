Namaste Rajarshi,
 
Some people associate detachment with aversion to things and inaction, in their minds. So it may ring an alarm to them and they may object.
 
But, the way we use the word in sanatana dharma, detachment means neither attraction nor aversion. A detached person neither runs for something nor runs away from something. One will accept what natures throws at one and does the best job one can. Irrespective of what happens as a result, there is neither excitement nor disappointment/regret. As you said, Krishna highlighted the path of detached action (nishkaama karma yoga). Essentially, that is what Vasishtha said in Yoga Vaasishtham too.

First of all, detachment from money does not mean insulting money or looking down upon money.
 
Secondly, deities do not get hurt. If you say "I am not attracted to money", she may test you a bit by seeing if you are just saying it or it is really so.
 
It is not that Mahalakshmi wants you to pursue money. She gives prosperity of various types and not just money. If money is what matters to you, she may give you money. If you think that you are not attracted to money, she may test you by either giving a lot of money or giving a loss. If you pass the tests and you are truly indifferent to big gains or big losses financially, then she may give you another kind of prosperity. She is capable of giving prosperity in various matters.

> What is a god or a goddess?  Know Thy Self.
 
A god or goddess is a manifestation of "Thy Self" in high concentrations of subtle qualities. The Self is beyond all qualities (gunas). But Self manifests as various beings having various gunas (qualities). Most people are made of dense qualities and realizing the Self that is beyond qualities is not easy for them. Gods and goddesses are manifestations of Self with such subtle qualities that they are nearly beyond qualities. If one reaches a god or a goddess, it is far easier to "Know Thy Self" from there.
 
Though "knowing Thy Self" is not the sole property of any single religious tradition, sanatana dharma offers many ways based on extensive and exhaustive experimentation by seers.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Detachment is never neglect of Dharma. But performing ones dharma with zero attachments.  That is what Krishna has taught us to do. If that state has been achieved, it is excellent. If not, keep trying.

You need enough to get by on here. The idea of detachment with things is silly, they need to be danced with and loved. Life is good. Books might help if you need them but you don't get experience from books, you get it from life and living it. Study your self and study life. Same thing. You do not HAVE life, you are it.

During this process I have frequently observed anything I speak about money she gets hurt as I immediately see some financial loss. If one says I don't want money it is like offending the Goddess and when one says I want money it becomes desire. So how to detach mind from money the right way? I am spiritually connected to that Goddess and have seen her visions almost all my life and don't wish to hurt her in anyway. I am also sorry if my question sounds silly but whatever I am today is only because of your teachings. I don't have much spiritual knowledge and neither do I get time to read books. I rely completely on your teachings and any words of wisdom coming from you would be of great help. Kindly guide,
