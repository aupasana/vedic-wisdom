Namaste Vishal ji,
 
Do feel free to tell others and teach those interested. A building may be made of thousands of bricks, but each brick is important.
 
However, let us not be forceful or agreessive like the missionaries. Also, let us do our work without any kind of expectations. If we passionately tell someone about the importance of spiritual sadhana and homam, for example, we should do so without an expectation that that person will start acting on our words. We cannot (and should not try to) compel anyone to do even what we believe to be worthy.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
