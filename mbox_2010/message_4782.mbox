Namaste,
 
1. Regarding Krishna and gopis:
 
The love of gopis for Krishna =
is not physical. Gopis were re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher l=
okas (realms of consciousness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as t=
hey were aware that Krishna was the perfected being. They had perfect surre=
nder to the perfected being and aspired for his company always.
 
The story=
 of vastraapaharana (Krishna stealing the clothes of gopis from the riverba=
nk while they were bathing in the river and forcing them to come out of the=
 river without clothes) explains complete surrender and has an esoteric mea=
ning. The sensual overtones some may perceive in the story are an unfortuna=
te side effect of the overly sensualized society we live in.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
Let me talk about the esoteric meaning.
 
Gopi literally means th=
e shakti that has control over the cows. Cows and horses in RigVeda symboli=
ze the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas respectively. After all, this is the m=
eaning in "Sri Sooktam" also, where we encounter "ashvadaayI ca godaayI", t=
hough that line has been superficially interpreted by scholars as "one who =
gives cows and horses". Extolling Sri Maha Lakshmi as the giver of two spec=
ific kinds of cattle would be too frivolous for RigVeda, which represents t=
he timeless and uncreated absolute knowledge rather than relative knowledge=
 bound by space and time. The true meaning is that our jnanendriyas and kar=
mendriyas come into being and operate through the shakti of the Mother. Any=
way, let us go back to gopis.
 
*        *        *
 
Within us, gopis repr=
esent the control over the senses. Control of various kinds over the senses=
 will restrict the sense activity and safeguard one's purity. But, merely b=
y controlling or restricting the senses, one cannot reach god or merge in g=
od. The goal of the shaktis that represent control over senses is to merge =
in the Infinite. That is what the desire of gopis to be with Krishna repres=
ents.
 
Clothes represent conditioning with gunas. Even as one controls/res=
tricts sense activity, there may be pride about it and several other types =
of conditioning that colors the control exerted over sense activity. That i=
s what the clothes of gopis represent! Gopis going to Krishna without cloth=
es represents pride and other conditioning being withdrawn from one's contr=
ol over senses, one's self-control becoming pure and devoid of ANY conditio=
ning and then merging in the Supreme.
 
As I said, the sensual overtones so=
me may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the overly s=
ensualized society we live in.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding all people=
 being women and the Supreme being a man:
 
This is also an esotetic concep=
t and not physical or sensual in nature.
 
In this universe, masculine spir=
it represents the potential energy and feminine spirit represents the kinet=
ic energy. Supreme Cosmic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potentialit=
y behind the entire universe. He is the potential energy. Shakti or the kin=
etic energy that is running the show in this entire universe manifests in e=
ach person as his/her Kundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini shakti =
that one is aware of the universe and acts in it. One's awareness of the wo=
rld is colored by one's conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, rises, p=
urifies herself and drops off all conditioning that colors one's self-aware=
ness, it will rise to sahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. Instea=
d of being aware of oneself as a limited object that perceives and interact=
s with so many other objects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of the S=
upreme Potentiality of the entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one's self-aw=
areness) is symbolically represented as a female deity. She awakens (one st=
arts to search for true self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (condit=
ioning that colors one's self-awareness) and ultimately has a union with th=
e supreme being in sahasrara.
 
All this is symbolic and esoteric in meanin=
g. Any sensuality one perceives in this depiction is simply due to the cond=
itioning of one's mind.

hibited language in the remainder of this mail MAY offend some sensitive an=
d conservative readers.]
 
2. Regarding references to body parts:
 
There i=
s nothing inherently "titillating" in a breast or other body parts. When a =
baby sees the breast, for example, the baby thinks of milk and nourishment.=
 There are no other thoughts in the baby's mind!
 
Our problems and weaknes=
ses do not lie in external objects. They lie in our own minds. When one see=
s a luxury car, one can just appreciate its elegance, power and beauty and =
leave it at that. One need not think, "I must somehow have this car" or ima=
gine what one can do if one has that car. When one sees a briefcase contain=
ing one million dollars, one can just appreciate that it is a lot of money =
and a lot of things can be bought with it. One need not think, "I must some=
how have this money" or imagine what one can do if one has that money. Simi=
larly, when one sees a breast, one can just appreciate its ability to nurtu=
re new life. One need not imagine what one can do with it. When one sees a =
vagina, one can just appreciate it as the source of new life.
 
*        * =
       *
 
Unfortunately, ego and conditioning make one think unnecessary t=
houghts about every object perceived by senses. Ego and mental conditioning=
 make one introduce oneself mentally in the middle of all objects perceived=
 by senses and engage in mental actions with those objects. Those mental ac=
tions are of course shaped by one's own conditioning! THAT is the problem. =
The over-materialization and over-sexualization prevalent in our society ma=
kes the conditioning deeper and more difficult to shake off. But the goal o=
f sadhana is to shake off all conditioning.
 
*        *        *
 
When an=
 evolved yogi sees a beautiful naked body, he need not close eyes and run a=
way. He need not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed or self-conscious when l=
ooking at or talking about it. There is nothing inherently wrong or sinful =
in a naked body. It is not an object of lust by itself, though it may seem =
like an object of lust to a mind conditioned with lust. Even if such a cond=
itioned person takes sannyasa and remains in a forest for 30 years away fro=
m everybody, he may feel lust if he suddenly sees a beautiful naked body af=
ter those 30 years of brahmacharya. On the other hand, when an evolved yogi=
 who overcame this conditioning sees a beautiful naked body, he may not clo=
se eyes and run away. He may notice its beauty (just like one may notice th=
e beauty of a roadside scenery or waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or =
a sunrise over a lake etc) and appreciate the Creator for creating objects =
of infinite variety and beauty. Thoughts of lust (e.g. I can do so and so t=
hing with this body, it will be nice to do so and so thing with this body, =
etc) may not even arise in his mind!
 
Of course, when one is lustful, the =
best thing to do is to keep oneself away from objects that provoke lust. Bu=
t the final goal is to reach the above state.
 
*        *        *
 
When =
you encounter references of body parts in ancient devotional literature, yo=
u should realize that those authors had overcome lust and were childlike. T=
alking of a breast or navel would not make them lustful or uncomfortable or=
 embarrassed. There was no difference between talking about a breast or a n=
avel that they saw and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfall o=
ver a mountain or sunrise over a lake that they saw.
 
When a goddess revea=
led herself to them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes repres=
ent covering by additional conditioning and gunas. If goddess revealed hers=
elf to one with more conditioning, there was a need for more clothes, jewel=
lery etc. If goddess revealed herself to a childlike one with no conditioni=
ng, unconditioned raw form is just fine. After all, a woman may feel comfor=
table standing naked in front of a baby, while she will cover herself prope=
rly when coming in front of a twenty year old son whose mind looks at thing=
s differently.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: Those yogis and authors =
were unconditioned by lust and were shown what they were ready to see and t=
hey described what they saw. Moreover, everything has a symbolic meaning to=
o. However, if you are teaching a young and conditioned mind, I'd suggest n=
ot teaching verses that can appear to be explicit or provocative. It is eas=
y to misunderstand or get erotic thoughts in the mind, though that is not t=
he intention of the author. After all, let me give an analogy. Suppose seei=
ng anything red makes a person remember a bloodbath one saw earlier, become=
 enraged and go and kill the enemies. Suppose you have a picture of abhishe=
kam of a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better=
 not show the picture to that person..

Narasimha
