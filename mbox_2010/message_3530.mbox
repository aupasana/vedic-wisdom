 Ganapati Muni

I never met Ganapati Muni, but I remember being with Kapali=
 Sastri in
Aurobindo Ashram when the news of his death arrived. I saw Sastr=
i openly
weep, lamenting the Muni's death. At that time Kapali Sastri had s=
o much
faith in Aurobindo and Mother, I heard him say, "If Nayana was here =
(at
Aurobindo Ashram) he would not have died."

Bhagavan was once talking a=
bout him to me and said, "If Nayana had not come
here (meaning to himself) =
and had his mind turned inwards to the Self, he
would have certainly ended =
up in jail." Nayana had in his earlier years a
predilection for political a=
ctivity.

Aurobindo and the Mother recognized Ganapati Muni's extraordinary=
 gifts.
Kapali Sastri once took the Muni to Aurobindo Ashram and everyone t=
here was
eager that he should stay. He was given a royal welcome and offere=
d a house
and all the necessary conveniences for him and his family. Someon=
e back at
Sri Ramanasramam informed Bhagavan of how Nayana was being entice=
d to stay
in Aurobindo Ashram. While this person was describing it all to B=
hagavan, he
expressed the opinion that Nayana, indeed, might very well sett=
le down
there. Bhagavan looked at the man in surprise and said, "Nayana ? S=
ettle
down at Aurobindo Ashram? Impossible!"

Learned Scholars

Many learne=
d scholars and sannyasins would often visit Bhagavan and ask
questions. Bha=
gavan's response to these visitors, and also to other
visitors, was not alw=
ays uniform. To some people he would give much
attention, either by talking=
 to them or pouring out his grace through a
silent look; others he would st=
oically ignore. All these variations were not
governed by status, wealth, o=
r fame.

One morning a famous swami of Ahmedabad arrived at the ashram. I u=
nderstood
he had many wealthy disciples and was himself attired in a costly=
 silk,
ochre-colored cloth. He also had several pieces of luggage, which cl=
early
indicated he was a man of some means. The swami came into the Guest H=
ouse
for Gentlemen and introduced himself to me. He wanted to know when he =
could
see the Maharshi. I told him at 10 a.m. I would be going to the hall =
and he
could accompany me and at that time I would introduce him to the Mah=
arshi.

During that period, between 10 and 11 a.m. every morning in the Old=
 Hall,
Devaraja Mudaliar, Munagala Venkataramiah and I were going through
V=
enkataramiah's English translation of a Tamil scripture. Bhagavan would
ope=
n and hold the Tamil book in his hand and we would read the English
transla=
tion for each verse. Then we would discuss it until we found it
acceptable =
to Bhagavan.

The swami entered the hall with me at 10 a.m. and I introduce=
d him to
Bhagavan. He was fluent in Sanskrit and other languages, and also =
was well
versed in all the scriptures. He inquired if he was allowed to ask=
 a
question. The consent was given and he asked Bhagavan if Ishwara, the
pe=
rsonal God, actually existed. The Maharshi replied with one of his
standard=
 rejoinders: "We do not know about Ishwara or whether he exists or
not. But=
 what we do know is that we exist. Find out who that 'I' is that
exists. Th=
at is all that is required."

The swami was not satisfied with this answer =
and continued to discuss the
matter, quoting from various scriptures. Bhaga=
van then said, "If the
scriptures say all this about it, why question me fu=
rther?"

This also was not acceptable to the swami and he proceeded with mo=
re
elucidation, at which point Bhagavan cut him off by turning to us and
sa=
ying, "Come on. Let us begin our work." It is needless to say that the
swam=
i became quite annoyed and soon left the hall.

Later in the day I met him =
and he told me that my Maharshi doesn't seem to
know very much. I simply re=
plied, "Yes." And although this visitor was
originally planning on staying =
for three days, he cut his visit short and
left that very afternoon, withou=
t ever going back into the hall to see the
Maharshi. Bhagavan later asked m=
e what the swami said before leaving. When I
told him, he simply smiled.

A=
nother incident comes to my mind when yet one more learned swami visited
Bh=
agavan. He questioned Bhagavan in Sanskrit and Bhagavan, once again,
patien=
tly answered in Malayalam, the swami's mother tongue. As the session
contin=
ued it became clear that this swami's sole intention was to defeat
Bhagavan=
 in argument. Eventually Bhagavan said, "Will you be satisfied if I
issue y=
ou a certificate stating you have defeated me in the argument?" But
even th=
at did not silence the swami's impertinence.

Jagadish Sastri, a Sanskrit p=
undit, was quietly listening to the
proceedings. When he saw that the swami=
 was incorrigible, he blurted out in
Sanskrit, "He dushta bahirgachha," whi=
ch means "O wicked man, get out!" I
don't remember anyone ever making such =
an aggressive remark in the presence
of Bhagavan. But it worked. The swami =
finally got the message and left the
hall.

Once a group of influential dev=
otees from Madras came up with a scheme to
take Bhagavan away to Madras. In=
 an attempt to execute this plan, a number
of them arrived at the ashram an=
d came into the hall. It wasn't long before
they realized that Bhagavan wou=
ld never consent to leave Ramanasramam, and
eventually they left.

One old =
devotee was sitting in the corner of the hall quietly watching the
whole dr=
ama unfold. He said nothing while the discussion was underway,
though he wa=
s secretly in collusion with the group from Madras. After the
group left, B=
hagavan turned to one of his attendants and said, "Some people
will sit qui=
etly as if they have nothing to do with what is taking place
before them. B=
ut on the contrary, they have everything to do with what is
going on."

The=
 old devotee questioned, "Bhagavan, are you testing me?"

Bhagavan simply r=
emained silent. Any acts of insincerity were easily known
to Bhagavan and h=
e did not hesitate to point them out.

Foreigners and the English Language
=

Bhagavan was familiar with, and had respect for, the classical English
wor=
ks. He had read many English books and would daily read an English
newspape=
r. W. Y. Evans-Wentz had given Bhagavan copies of his published
books, and =
of these books Bhagavan liked best Tibet's Great Yogi, Melarepa.
He once re=
quested me to read it.

Although he read and understood English quite well,=
 he rarely spoke it. If
people spoke English to him with clear diction and =
pronunciation he would
not have much trouble understanding them. Once he sa=
id to me, "I couldn't
understand a word Chadwick said." Which shows he did =
fail to understand
English at times if not spoken clearly.

The State of a =
Jnani

On another occasion there was a French visitor named Jean Herbert, w=
ho had
written several books on India, its holy men, and ashrams, etc. I sa=
w him
while he was on his second visit to the ashram. During this visit he
=
requested the publication rights of all of the ashram literature, as he
pla=
nned on using this material in his books. The ashram authorities were at
fi=
rst enthusiastic about books being published in the West on Bhagavan and
hi=
s teachings. I told Bhagavan that Jean Herbert also requested the same
perm=
ission from Aurobindo Ashram, but they decided not to give it. Perhaps
they=
 felt he would exploit Aurobindo's writings. When I had told Bhagavan
this,=
 he requested me to go to the office and explain it to them. I did, and
the=
 permission was withheld.

In this way, I observed Bhagavan taking special =
interest in the affairs of
the ashram and, at times, personally directing t=
hem. It might not always
have been so apparent as in the two cases above, b=
ut it was, no doubt,
forthcoming.

Though Bhagavan generally opposed any fu=
nds being solicited for the ashram,
he did not object in all cases.

Krishn=
aprem visits the Ashram

After my visit with Krishnaprem in 1938, I had cor=
responded with him a few
times. In each of his letters he promised that he =
would soon be coming to
see the Maharshi. But he never came and I began to =
think that he would miss
his chance to have darshan of Bhagavan. This all c=
hanged on a December
morning in 1948.

I was sitting with my eyes closed ne=
xt to Bhagavan, outside on the verandah.
When I opened my eyes, who did I s=
ee sitting before me but Krishnaprem. I
said to him, "You have finally come=
. Why didn't you write and let me know
you were coming?"

He said, "After w=
riting to you so many times and promising to come, but
didn't, I was embarr=
assed to write you again."

During this visit, Krishnaprem handed over his =
small Gopala Krishna idol to
Bhagavan. Bhagavan tenderly turned it this way=
 and that, looking at it
intently, and then returned it to Krishnaprem. In =
other places it has
already been recorded about Krishnaprem's vision and in=
ner experiences while
sitting before Bhagavan in the Old Hall.

>From Sri Ra=
manasramam he travelled to Sri Aurobindo's Ashram. After staying
there a fe=
w days we planned that he and I would rendezvous at the Villupuram
train st=
ation, from where we would depart together and travel south,
visiting sever=
al famous temples and holy places. My train from
Tiruvannamalai was schedul=
ed to leave at 1 P.M. So, immediately after lunch
I approached Bhagavan to =
take leave of him. He had just then finished his
meal and was massaging his=
 rheumatic knee joints=E2=80=94in his old age he had to do
this prior to wa=
lking. I prostrated before him and informed him of my
departure. He already=
 knew all the details relating to this trip, and he
also knew I was plannin=
g on visiting Kanyakumari. He said to me, "These
people (meaning the manage=
ment) have written to an advocate-devotee of
Nagerkoil to send us the three=
 different-coloured sands that are available
at Kanyakumari. These are need=
ed for the Kumbhabhishekam of the
Matrubhuteswara Temple. So far, he has no=
t sent them." Though Bhagavan did
not say specifically that I should bring =
those sands, I naturally understood
what was on his mind. In fact, he often=
 employed this manner of speaking,
asking us indirectly, when he wanted som=
ething done. Before leaving he also
asked me to write and send him details =
about the pilgrimage.

When I arrived in Kanyakumari I discovered that the =
government had enforced
a law prohibiting the removal of any sand from the =
beaches of Kanyakumari.
Uranium, the mineral used for making atomic bombs, =
had been found in some of
the sand. Nevertheless, I thought I should take m=
y chances and stealthily
proceeded to gather the three different sands. I f=
illed three bags with the
sands and concealed them in my bedroll. At the tr=
ain station I hired a man
to carry my bedroll and luggage and moved on towa=
rds the station gate.
Standing at the gate, I saw the ticket collector and =
two policemen. The
ticket collector was checking tickets and the policemen =
were checking
baggage for illegal sand. I asked my man to stop and we both =
stood there
momentarily as I contemplated the situation. Pondering over my =
next move, I
mentally prayed to Bhagavan, "You wanted me to bring this sand=
. Now look at
this=E2=80=94police! What am I to do?" As soon as I had praye=
d thus, the policemen,
for some unknown reason, turned and looked in a cert=
ain direction and walked
away from the gate. I immediately told my man, "Le=
t's go," and we passed
through the gate and boarded the train.

When I retu=
rned to the ashram and brought the bags of sands to Bhagavan, he
called eve=
ryone around to come and look. Later, the sands expected from the
advocate =
arrived by post, but the bags had broken en route and the three
varieties o=
f sands mixed, making them useless. When Bhagavan heard that he
remarked, "=
If Balaram Reddy had not brought the sands, how could we have
gotten a fres=
h consignment on time for the consecration ceremony?"Krishnaprem
finally re=
turned to North India after his tour of the South.

ally that I should bring those sands, I naturally understood what was on hi=
s mind. In fact, he often employed this manner of speaking, asking us indir=
ectly, when he wanted something done.</span>=C2=A0Before leaving he also as=
ked me to write and send him details about the pilgrimage.<br>

<br><span s=
tyle=3D"font-weight:bold">When I arrived in Kanyakumari I discovered that t=
he government had enforced a law prohibiting the removal of any sand from t=
he beaches of Kanyakumari. Uranium, the mineral used for making atomic bomb=
s, had been found in some of the sand. Nevertheless, I thought I should tak=
e my chances and stealthily proceeded to gather the three different sands.<=
/span>=C2=A0I filled three bags with the sands and concealed them in my bed=
roll. At the train station I hired a man to carry my bedroll and luggage an=
d moved on towards the station gate. Standing at the gate, I saw the ticket=
 collector and two policemen.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">The tic=
ket collector was checking tickets and the policemen were checking baggage =
for illegal sand. I asked my man to stop and we both stood there momentaril=
y as I contemplated the situation. Pondering over my next move, I mentally =
prayed to Bhagavan, "You wanted me to bring this sand. Now look at thi=
s=E2=80=94police! What am I to do?" As soon as I had prayed thus, the =
policemen, for some unknown reason, turned and looked in a certain directio=
n and walked away from the gate.</span>=C2=A0I immediately told my man, &qu=
ot;Let's go," and we passed through the gate and boarded the train=
.<br>

<br>When I returned to the ashram and brought the bags of sands to B=
hagavan, he called everyone around to come and look. Later, the sands expec=
ted from the advocate arrived by post, but the bags had broken en route and=
 the three varieties of sands mixed, making them useless.=C2=A0<span style=
