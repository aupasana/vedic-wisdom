 A. Venkateswara Sarma and Smt. Sala SRI VENKATESWARA SARMA, a native of
Ke=
elapasalai Village, Ramnad Dt., is an old devotee of Sri Bhagavan,who
along=
 with his wife, Smt. Sala, equally devoted to Sri Bhagavan, lived in
Sri Ra=
mana Nagar. Both are closely related to Sri Bhagavan.

For over a decade he=
 studied the Kavya (poetical literature in Sanskrit)
gaining mastery in the=
 same and also became an adept in the science of
astrology by training he h=
ad for years at Vidyalaya in Kerala. In his early
days while staying at Kan=
danur,
he had a remarkable experience.

He saw the portrait of Sri Bhagavan=
 in his majestic standing posture with a
penetrating look which not merely =
seemed but was really felt as directed
only to him and which thrilled his w=
hole being. This experience provoked a
great urge to have Sri Bhagavan=E2=
=80=99s darshan immediately.

He started the very next day and arrived at T=
iruvannamalai,his luggage
consisting of a panchangam (almanac) in one hand =
and an umbrella in the
other. That was in 1920. He climbed up the hill to S=
kandashram, and
recognising Sri Bhagavan who was seated then under a nelli =
tree he hastened
to prostrate at his feet, spontaneously reciting in a stat=
e of ecstatic
inspiration the first sloka of Sri Dakshinamurthi Ashtakam.

=
=E2=80=9CLook, look at the visitor who has come =E2=80=94 Subbu=E2=80=99s s=
on, is it not?=E2=80=9D So
exclaimed
Sri Bhagavan, turning to his mother wh=
o was there.

The mother gave him a hearty welcome and made him feel at hom=
e.Delighted by
the stay with Sri Bhagavan that night, he was guided to perf=
orm
giripradakshina (circumambulation of Holy Arunachala) next day.

He exp=
ressed an ardent desire to stay with Sri Bhagavan for good and pleaded
that=
 he did not want to marry but wished to remain with him and serve him
and d=
o pujas. The mother would have none of it, he had duties to perform,
she re=
minded him and an uncle=E2=80=99s daughter awaited marriage with him.

He w=
as then 22 years old.Sri Bhagavan consoled him, =E2=80=9CWhat does it matte=
r if
you do puja or get married or whether you are here or elsewhere?=E2=80=
=9D And so he
left! Since then Sri Sarma was coming to Sri Bhagavan from ti=
me to time,
often staying for a month or two and benefitting by Sri Bhagava=
n=E2=80=99s
utterances and his silent influence with devotion and piety.

T=
hough a successful astrologer by profession, especially in the branch of
pr=
asna (astrological forecasting on the basis of the exact time of the
client=
=E2=80=99s question), Sri Venkateswara Sarma felt the futility of leading a=

bread-earning life and hence came to Sri Ramanasramam in 1939, along with
=
his wife, and lived with Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s sister=E2=80=99s family.

I=
n 1946 they took up abode at Adi Annamalai, four miles away from the Ashram=

on the circumambulation path, after duly informing Sri Bhagavan.They went
=
round the hill daily and sometimes twice a day and thus had darshan of Sri
=
Bhagavan on the way.

Sri Sarma compiled a short history of Sri Bhagavan=E2=
=80=99s life consisting of 120
slokas in Sanskrit, known as Ramana Charitam=
rutasaram, which Sri Bhagavan
graciously perused and corrected.

He also co=
mposed songs in Tamil and presented them to Sri Bhagavan, who used
to corre=
ct them only sparingly. Such corrections were not only grammatical
in conte=
nt but also vitally enriched them with spiritual depth.

For instance, in t=
he following verse: =E2=80=9CThose who are caught in the mouth of
a great t=
iger are certain to die in this world;but all those, caught in the
glance (=
drishti) of the great tiger adorning the slopes of Arunachala, known
as gre=
at Ramana,get merged with natural ease in the eternal
happiness,discarding =
fear of even the Lord of Death,=E2=80=9D Sri Bhagavan put in
the word with =
natural ease =E2=80=98(iyal) in the place of daily=E2=80=99
(nidham) of Sri=
 Sarma=E2=80=99s!

Since 1948, he settled with his wife and only son in Tir=
uvannamalai town.
The son passed away four years later.Both parents feel th=
ey survived that
shock only by Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Grace.

They continued to=
 render service at the Shrines of Sri Bhagavan and the
Mother, assisting in=
 the daily routine =E2=80=94 perhaps as a fulfilment of his
former sankalpa=
 (desire) to do puja to Sri Bhagavan! He felt: =E2=80=9CSri Bhagavan
is eve=
r present in my mind and heart, in jagrat and swapna and his manifest
Grace=
 only is sustaining us in
all circumstances and at all times!=E2=80=9D
