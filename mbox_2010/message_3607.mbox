Hello KK,

A Strange=
 and Bad incident happened with me once about 11 months back and i informed=
 Narasimha about it. I reproduce it if it can help you:

Following is my em=
ail to him:
[
About the strange incident:

Today after Purnaahuti Mantra, w=
hen i was about to offer/or just at the time of offering the Dry Halve coco=
nut, one insect (a kind of butterfly i suppose with big wings) suddenly cam=
e and fell in the Homa agni. it got stuck under a burning coconut piece and=
 couldn't come out even i couldn't do anything because every thing happened=
 in a flash, within span of 4/5 seconds. it pained me and shocked me. The i=
nsect got burnt immediately as the fire was burning very bright. Fortunatel=
y i could not see that sight because it was under coconut pieces.
> 
> i cl=
ose my eyes and prayed Mahaganapati for Sadgati of that soul.
> 
> What is =
your feeling about this issue? Does the accidental sacrifice of the insect =
signify some Ashubh tatva? How should i take this? Or simply forget.

Naras=
imha replied me not to worry about the incident and I forgot it completely.=
 I just removed it from my mind.

***
I think you need not worry about the =
particular incident. Homam should make one very strong and 'worry-less' . O=
ne should be compassionate but at the same time, need not worry about such =
incidents on which one can not do anything. I suggest you all pray for the =
souls of kittens during your prayer/Homam and forget the incident.

Hope th=
is helps.

Utpal
