Namaste,


"" Same is happening today, Many of us wonder (to some extent my=
self) as to how Kalki avatar, with just a horse and sword, is going to rid =
the world of all  anti-elements given that the world is burgeoning rapidly =
in that direction.""

Can any one discribe the physical features of Vishnu =
Avtar in Kali Yug?

Regards
