Dear All,

I have tried to make spiritual progress for long, and made littl=
e progress (but 
not significant). Ever since my childhood, primarily becau=
se of my upbringing, I 
have been trying and observing a lot of "Good" thin=
gs. I have been reading texts 
on spirituality and was a lot impressed by S=
wami Vivekananda's writings. I 
always found Kabir's following lines, as a =
best (and most compact) commentary on 
the two prominent paths of spiritual=
ity: -

"Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari"
"Hai jaisa taisa rahe,=
 kahat kabir vicharee"

i.e.
"If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is =
contemplation"
"Let it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation"

Unti=
l last year, my faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last=
 
year made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to thin=
k. I 
have come up with several doubts (just a few given below) about spiri=
tuality and 
God and Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifted t=
owards atheism 
(susprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi, wh=
en am observing a 
fast). If someone can help me understand the problesm wi=
th my doubts, it would 
be great help:- 

- Isn't "Ishwar Paridhaan" i.e. "=
Ishwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti" same as 
stockholm syndrome? 
- Most pe=
ople with good conduct I see these days are suffering and those who 
happil=
y claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the 
su=
preme power's role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but la=
st 
year made me realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak spir=
itually 
too. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.
- I do understan=
d that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low, and so called 
Godly corr=
ection of the wrong doing, takes its own time. But doesn't that 
promotes t=
he bad karma in itself, specially in this yuga? And how long can one 
wait?=

- Suicide is considered a greatest sin, as it is throwing away the best gi=
ft we 
get from the lord. But, I am not sure that if people do it for fun. =
God presents 
a person with tough situations in the name of testing times, =
and some day the 
limit is reached. Then isn't god accomplice in this so ca=
lled crime.
- In first place, why does he need to test us?

As I said that =
all these question make me feel that I am losing the faith in His 
goodness=
. All my spiritual progress if any has been corrupted by these testing 
tim=
es. And no help came to me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer=
, 
faced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering now. This is w=
hat 
makes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this that I have pass=
ed my 
agony to someone.

Despite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied=
 my mind for quite some time, I 
feel that I still survive a chance to get =
back to my faith in real terms and not 
driven by materialistic desire. Thi=
s is the reason I am writing this mail. May 
be someone can make me see wha=
t I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting 
totally crazy, insane and =
moving towards atheism and quit possibly committing 
the so called "Sin".

=
Regards,
Sri
