Some say that unless all the des=
ires are done away with (fulfilled like that of Bhartuhari) a person will n=
ot turn to God. What i mean is the example which Thakur used to give - 'Whe=
n child is finished playing with toys then only throws away everything and =
cries for mother.

There is no way of knowing if we are done away with desi=
res.

So only thing i understand is that the ONLY way to tun away desires &=
 concentration from sense objects so that they start listening to Intellige=
nce is to engage in any Saadhanaa and keep doing it till the goal is reache=
d.

Best Regards,

Utpal
