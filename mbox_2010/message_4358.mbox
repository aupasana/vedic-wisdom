I have a general question for the group. I am thinking about moving, and
since I like to do daily homa, I'm curious as to which system works best for
people in terms of avoiding damage to the walls from smoke, etc. A
fireplace? A specially installed exhaust fan? Simply doing the homa on a
balcony or with balcony doors / windows open? I'd be grateful for people's
thoughts or experiences.

Warm regards,
Aditi
