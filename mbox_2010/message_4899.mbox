Dear Utpal,

I've recited Chandi along with Kunjika Stotra for quite some t=
ime in the past. 
Reciting "Kunjika Stotra" is an experience by itself. 


=
I have no objection to that at all! But my disagreement is with the belief =
that 
the Kunjika is equal to the 700 verses or that the merely reading the=
 Kunjika is 
equal to reading the=C2=A0Chandi. No it is not. =C2=A0To under=
stand the difference one has 
to do sadhana of the full=C2=A0Chandi (700 ve=
rses) for 108 days=C2=A0vs merely reading the 
Kunjika for 108 days.

*=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0*=C2=A0 =C2=A0*

I believe the Kunjika was created to obtain spec=
ific results in Chandi sadhana, 
which means, the 700 verses are the cake o=
n which the Kunjika=C2=A0*can be* an=C2=A0icing. 
But for that, one needs t=
he cake first!=C2=A0 


However, in time people became lazy.=C2=A0So they s=
tuck to the Kunjika only without 
spending time in mastering the main 700 v=
erses which needs discipline and 
effort. And thus, though=C2=A0some local =
traditions accepted this idea, many of the 
major kaula paramparas rejected=
 this idea (merely reading the Kunjika is equal 
to reading the full 700 ve=
rses).

At this present=C2=A0time, I strongly feel the reason why 99.99 per=
cent sadhakas 
cannot use the Kunjika to any real affect is because Chandi =
Herself has put some 
brakes (locks) on the Kunjika. To borrow an example f=
rom an older mail of 
Narasimha, the Kunjika is a=C2=A0gun whose safety cat=
ch has been locked by Her 
firmly. Therefore, no one is able to fire that w=
eapon. All one is able to do is 
use it as a stick to dig a few potatoes he=
re and there. In time, even this will 
vanish.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

I've recit=
ed Chandi along with Kunjika Stotra for quite some time in the past. 
Recit=
ing "Kunjika Stotra" is an experience by itself. The sound pattern 
generat=
ed by reciting typically arranged bijaksharas is wonderful. The rhythm 
gen=
erated, when recited a little loud, gives a kick to the mind! I enjoyed it =

thoroughly and it was like waiting to recite that Stotra after finishing r=
egular 
Chandi paath.

I like to believe the words of Shiva and I tend to a=
gree with what KK has 
mentioned above but in the same breath its difficult=
 to explain and experience 
and get convinced. Probably, only very very adv=
anced saadhakas can illumine us 
about the real importance of the "Kunjika =
Stotra" or we can get the answer by 
self efforts :)

P>Namaste KK & Rajarshi,<BR><BR>>i mean is kunjika is a coded key to=
 unlock many secrets present it >chandi further kunjika is saptashati in=
 a condensed form <BR><BR>I've recited Chandi along with Kunjika Stotra for=
 quite some time in the past. Reciting "Kunjika Stotra" is an experience by=
 itself. The sound pattern generated by reciting typically arranged bijaksh=
aras is wonderful. The rhythm generated, when recited a little loud, gives =
a kick to the mind! I enjoyed it thoroughly and it was like waiting to reci=
te that Stotra after finishing regular Chandi paath.<BR><BR>I like to belie=
ve the words of Shiva and I tend to agree with what KK has mentioned above =
but in the same breath its difficult to explain and experience and get conv=
inced. Probably, only very very advanced saadhakas can illumine us about th=
e real importance of the "Kunjika Stotra" or we can get the answer by self =
efforts :)<BR><BR>My 2 cent...<BR><BR>Best
