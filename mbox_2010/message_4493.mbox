Sorry my previous mail went off incomplete!
=C2=A0
Namaste,
=C2=A0
Welcome =
to this forum. I would like to make a few brief points regarding some of yo=
ur ideas as mentioned below.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I suggest reading of the volumnou=
s work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these =
steps.
=C2=A0
Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals understanding of t=
he vedic=C2=A0ritual is naive at best and criminally incorrect at worst. He=
 had written a huge, lengthy article on why and how mantras are nothing but=
 sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancient people, and they are s=
upposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A person with such a shallow und=
erstanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be expected =
to=C2=A0recognize=C2=A0the spiritual essence=C2=A0and depth of "Agni". Veda=
s, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of rituals/history/or even dharma,=
 but probably a testimony of the various spiritual realities on the path to=
 self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical verses. Therefore, Fritz =
Staals, in probably the wrong guy to comment on what is and what is not the=
 essence and significance of Agni.
=C2=A0
Swami Vivekananda was self-realiz=
ed saint. During his last days, he once called one of his disciples and men=
tioned that the interpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as oth=
ers were, in his opinion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence o=
f what the Vedas really are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate =
on the verses and in future, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a mo=
re holistic and deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesti=
ng coincidence that Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivek=
anada instructed him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri A=
urobindo came up with a=C2=A0new perspective on the Vedas and specially the=
 hymns of Agni.
=C2=A0
21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowle=
dge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almig=
hty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.
=C2=A0
There are different homa=
m proceudures followed by different paramparas in different parts of India.=
 I am sure none of them is incorrect. The final=C2=A0judge of the success o=
f any sustained sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/exper=
iencer himself. If the sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=
=A0etc etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0I=
t is not the number of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally t=
he internal transformations that you experience which are crucial. There ar=
e people who follow a million rules of procedure for performing various rit=
uals and yet never experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no=
 transformations. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a pra=
ctical science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever doe=
s not is bad. In this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are pra=
ctical, doable sadhanas, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to
 transform=
 an individual. Many have experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0=
future. And all this has been possible only because the Divine Mother wants=
 it so. And we are confident, by Her grace millions of people will do short=
, simple homams on a daily basis in the decades to come!
=C2=A0
5. The proc=
edure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=
e deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=
ures. 
=C2=A0
Well, to use the words of a self-realized man, "what is Vedic=
 or what is tantrik (or aghor for that matter)", but different paths to rea=
lize the same goals. Fixation with the path deviates the sadhaka from his g=
oal and God. The aim of the homa manuals is to create a group of decent sad=
hakas who worship in fire on a regular basis, and thus experience divinty i=
nside them, rather than a bunch of theoritical scholars with zero practical=
 experience of any sort of divine=C2=A0realization. The paths are tools, wh=
ich can come and go as the Mother wills it, but the goal is eternal and irr=
espective of the path chosen. 
=C2=A0
I am yet to read a Shastra which spea=
ks of Aghor sadhanas (for example a khanda-manda yoga or an aajgara sadhana=
 etc)=C2=A0in details, and yet many self-realized saints have adopted those=
 paths and reached the final goals. The validity of a path/sadhana is the t=
ransformation it can produce in a sadhaka. Rest is mere stale=C2=A0theory.
=
=C2=A0
Therefore in short, the proof of the pudding is in eating it!
=C2=A0=

Dear Members,

At the outset, thanks to =
Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message =
in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on "efficacy of reme=
dies". I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing thes=
e topics.

I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji=
 and the video of a homam being performed and have the following observatio=
ns to make.

1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which des=
cribe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a =
vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).

2. A=
ll steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some ex=
ist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody t=
o judge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down=
 by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.

3. There are variations in pro=
cedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, as=
valayana sutra etc., but no omissions.

4. The ordinary materials such as f=
ire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they ar=
e divinised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine proced=
ure. Otherwise it is only a "fire ritual" as named. I suggest reading of th=
e volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance=
 of these steps.

5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any =
of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mi=
x of vedic and tantrik procedures. 

6. In paristarana or laying the darbha=
 aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeed=
ing darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.

7. The dire=
ction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra "deva savit=
a prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not=
 be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from N=
E corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).

8 Patraasadanam or =
keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.
=

9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is =
missing.

10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.

11. Pr=
aneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchada=
nam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.

12. Brahma varanam ( at=
 least a koorcha brahma) is missing.

13. Ajya samskaram or purification of=
 the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.=


14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missi=
ng. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).

15. Placement of paridhi=
 and aagharasamit is missing.

16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed n=
umber of samits in the agni iis missing.

17. It is seen in the video that =
with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in dr=
ops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise i=
t will lead to dravyalopa.

and many more ............

18. Strictly speaki=
ng, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone e=
xists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka)=
. Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries th=
e offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam=
 (secondary or not necessary)

18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is i=
nvoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the dei=
ty or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering =
the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.

19. Very good alternate homa proce=
dures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for exampl=
e) ideal for sadhakas. They don't involve veda mantras so that you don't ha=
ve to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures =
are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can b=
e easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.

20. Homam should not be =
seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. I=
t involves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision=
 and perfection.

21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge i=
n its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty h=
elp to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.
