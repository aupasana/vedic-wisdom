My dear niece,
I appreciate you for expressing what you have experienced, a=
nd say,"Can someone please help me on how to overcome the following weaknes=
s of mine?". It is a humble request.
We also visited Varanasi and the place=
s around 10 years back. Our Master was telling all of us while we were proc=
eeding to Varanasi, during the course of journey.
"All of you may find so m=
uch of unclean environment there in Varanasi. You also see cows lying acros=
s the narrow streets leading to the Temple, with all urine and dung split o=
n the road. After taking a holy bath in the Ganges, you may have have to wa=
lk on such narrow paths leading to the Diety and you may feel hatred for th=
e place. The Purohits at the Ganges demand huge amounts of money and many p=
eople seem to take advantage of our needs and encash illegally. But underst=
and that the people born at Varanasi are fortunate. People desire and make =
attempts to have their last breath there, but it is not possible to all.

N=
ow let you realize a truth behind this. In Varanasi, there are lakhs and la=
khs of SIVALINGAS in the earth, and anywhere you try to dig, you get one.. =
That means you are virtually walking with your feet over the Lord, all alon=
g the places in Varanasi. How painful it is to keep your feet and walk over=
 The Almighty. So remember the energies floating in the place and even belo=
w your feet Lord is present. Don't get hatredness and feel bad about the un=
cleanliness environment. 

Make yourself modified, transformed to contain s=
uch unclean environment, and see only the abundant energy prevailing there.=
 It is but very difficult to improve on whatever is said about the cleanles=
sness.Whenever we visit a holy place, when we come back from the visit, we =
have to learn some positive lessons, and the lesson here is "STOP HATING AN=
YONE, EVEN IN SLUMS AND MOST UN-HYGENIC PLACES, TRY TO SEE THE ALMIGHTY IN =
THOSE DIRTY AND SMELLING AREAS. REALIZE THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS PREVAILING=
 TO SOME OF OUR CO-HUMANS."

So when we visit Varanasi and see all kinds of=
 hopeless things as described by you, we should try to weigh them in the ba=
ck drop of the High Energies prevailing there, and from that point, we shou=
ld learn to love people as and when, it is an instant that have to hate the=
m.

This requires a transformation in us, and we should go only with such p=
rior preparation=C2=A0 for pilgrimages. We should also find some positive c=
hanges in our performance, character, behavior after any visit to a holy pl=
ace , a temple or a Master. Then the purpose served.

When you will leave s=
omething in the Ganges, with a vow not to have it in future, you observe pe=
ople leaving vegetables, fruits etc. You may also find many leaving things =
they really do not like.

But what you have to leave for ever in Ganges, is=
 the angular points of character to be rounded off, anger, hatreds, jealous=
y,narrow mind,stubbornness and so on. Thus every visit makes us polished.

=
This is not to hurt the feelings, or not to look down the deficiencies poin=
ted out. But to accept the realities, expect the unexpected and utilize the=
 visit as an opportunity to make amends to personality.
Love and Blessings =
to you.
Uncle Bala Krishna Murthi, Vijayawada.

      Namaste a=
ll,



Can someone please help me on how to overcome the following weakness=
 of mine?



How much importance should we give to the cleanliness of the h=
oly places like Haridwar, Varanasi etc? When I visited those places I find =
it very hard to concentrate on God especially while taking bath in the sacr=
ed Ganges. I couldn't bear the scenes of dead bodies floating in the river.=
 I am not a yogi to be able to see God even in the trash and garbage and my=
 mind is still attached to this physical world. I know how holy those place=
s are but for me cleanliness is very important. How can I change my thinkin=
g and get benefited from pilgrimages?



Regards,

Padmaja
