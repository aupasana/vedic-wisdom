 ONCE a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came back
and told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour
on a certain tree.The second man replied: "When i went into the wood, I also
saw that animal.But why do you call it red? It is green."

Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was
yellow. Presently others arrived and contended that it was grey,violet,
blue, and so forth and so on. At last they started quarrelling among
themselves. To settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw a man
sitting under it.

On being asked, he replied:'Yes, I live under this tree and I know the
animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red,
sometimes yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey and so forth- It is
a chameleon.

And sometimes it has no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has
none."

In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature;
he alone knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and
aspects. God has attributes; then again He has none. Only the man who lives
under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in various colours, and
he knows further that the animal at times has no colour at all. It is the
others who suffer from the agony of futile argument.
