 home .. in Kolkata (Calcutta) i'll be starting Maha Ganapati=A0 homam.. at=
least in the weekends if not .. regularly as i was having a very bad situat=
ion both financially and in the home front as well .. i brought a Baneshwar=
 from there as well. while coming back to home i was severely ill and was h=
aving Fever with stomach upset as well... i didnt bother much about my heal=
th as i had a feeling may be its coz of the past bad karmas i am facing it =
..since i have been lucky enough in getting guidance from two of Manish ji'=
s direct disciples.. my friend who
 have been doing Ganapati homam for quit=
e a long time and now he is doing Chandi homam.. showed me how to do it ,,a=
nd there again i met another friend of mine who is regular in doing Chandi =
homams who inspired me to start as well... i was very tensed to start off a=
s i didnt had even that much of money to start off regularly.. and there ag=
ain i was a bit tensed about how my parents would react to the things like =
.. i am turning out to be a veg and will be doing homams on a regular basis=
.. where as my income was nil at that time .. !!

now comes the suprises as=
 follows:-

1) Manish ji=A0 called up my friend who was staying in my home =
,who was staying in my home .. after we had returned .. from Venaras..

2) =
I was so happy and excited about the fact that without even knowing .. how =
.. i just took the decision .. that i am going to start ..my Homams DAILY.
=

3) To my=A0 very surprise.. my parents did not objected, to my decision of=
 doing Homams on a regular basis.

4) The very 1st day i did my homam.. i g=
ot a call for regular work.

5) By profession i am an Actor / Anchor .. so =
i dont have any permanent salaried job..it implies of a inconsistent income=
 .. now .. i get calls for a lot works regularly .. 

6) My mom started to =
recite Chandi ..path regularly and the biggest of all suprises.. my Dad who=
