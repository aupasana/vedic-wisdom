I totally agree with Nithinji on this and once there was a very long discus=
sion on Shri Shiva's status in their pantha in other forum(s).
Better use a=
 ref.from reliable source like Gita press for this.

Namaste,

I was refe=
rring to Vyasa'a Sanskrit version.

One can access easy English translation=
s by Srila Prabhupada of various scriptures (including Srimad Bhagavatam) a=
t http://vedabase.net.

In Potana's Telugu version, chapters may be arrange=
d slightly differently. I do not have the text and cannot comment.

Yes, Po=
tana is special among Telugu poets. Poets like Potana and musicians like Th=
yagaraja dedicated themselves to Lord Rama, and preferred to live in povert=
y and write (or sing) on god, rather than writing (or singing) on kings and=
 mundane matters.

Best regards,
Narasimha
