 Devotee: God is perfect. Why did He create the world imperfect? The work
s=
hares the nature of the author. But here it is not so.

Sri Bhagavan: Who i=
s it that raises the question?

D.: I - the individual.

M.: Are you apart =
from God that you ask this question?

So long as you consider yourself the =
body you see the world as external. The
imperfections appear to you. God is=
 perfection. His work also is perfection.
But you see it as imperfection be=
cause of your wrong identification.

D.: Why did the Self manifest as this =
miserable world?

M.: In order that you might seek it. Your eyes cannot see=
 themselves. Place
a mirror before them and they see themselves. Similarly =
with the creation."See
yourself first and then see the whole world as the S=
elf."

D.: So it amounts to this - that I should always look within.

M.: Y=
es.

D.: Should I not see the world at all?

M.: You are not instructed to =
shut your eyes from the world. You are only to
"see yourself first and then=
 see the whole world as the Self". If you
consider yourself as the body the=
 world appears to be external. If you are
the Self the world appears as Bra=
hman.
