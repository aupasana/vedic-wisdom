He wasn't saying to indulge in anything, but to realize that one shouldn't
=
get hung up in the other direction either. The objective is to have neither=

aversion nor attachment. For most of us, we have to practice not having
at=
tachment, because we indulge excessively, but this is a pointer to not go
t=
oo much the other way, because that creates its own unhealthy
attachment/av=
ersion. So even while we practice renunciation we should keep
in mind that =
this is a practice, and the objective is balance not just
avoidance of plea=
sures for the sake of avoidance. Excessive wearing of hair
shirts or self-f=
lagellation (literal or figurative) leads to a perverse
enlargement of the =
ego and a reverse attachment, so one has to be balanced.
I think that's the=
 point of the article.

He wasn't saying to indulge in anything, but to realize that one should=
n't get hung up in the other direction either. The objective is to have=
 neither aversion nor attachment. For most of us, we have to practice not h=
aving attachment, because we indulge excessively, but this is a pointer to =
not go too much the other way, because that creates its own unhealthy attac=
hment/aversion. So even while we practice renunciation we should keep in mi=
nd that this is a practice, and the objective is balance not just avoidance=
 of pleasures for the sake of avoidance. Excessive wearing of hair shirts o=
r self-flagellation (literal or figurative) leads to a perverse enlargement=
 of the ego and a reverse attachment, so one has to be balanced. I think th=
at's the point of the article. <br>

<div>SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA (MESSAGE 4)<br><br>Vaira=
gya, or Dispassion, now continues.<br><br>------------ --------- ---<br><br=
>Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of Tapas is highly deprecable.=
 This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is condemned by Lord Krishn=
a in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It is an instrument f=
or Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body is not kept stro=
ng and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment to =
sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana of Sadhus and San=
nyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana of worldly perso=
ns.<br>

<br>Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult to get r=
id of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. The feeling=
, "I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhimana. The body=
 of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a pub=
lic
 property. He has no claim on it because he denies the existence of bod=
y and tries to feel always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public wil=
l take care of his body.<br><br>Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe a=
usterities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He hea=
rd the song:<br>

<br>"Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar's tune=
d, <br><br>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. <br><br>And we will danc=
e away the hearts of men <br><br>The string o'erstretched breaks and th=
e music flies,<br>

<br>The string o'erslack is dumb and music dies, <b=
r><br>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high."<br><br>Then he ate food=
, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme ascet=
icism is not at all necessary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is s=
trong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit=
 for the practice of severe austerities. The body will drop down if you tax=
 it too much by way of rigid
 Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in t=
he name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for t=
he body. Be prepared to give it up at any time for a noble cause.<br><br>Th=
e care-taker of the horse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-wo=
rked, when it is ailing. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, t=
his body should be injected with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn o=
ut good work. Then only it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of=
 overwork or ailment. Work will suffer if the body is not well attended to.=
 When the body grows old it must be well-protected against cold and well-lo=
oked after. If hard Titiksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Conse=
quently, the other shore of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.=
<br>

<br>O Ram, neglect not this body. The society and Prakriti will extra=
ct and continue to extract as much work as possible from those selfless wor=
kers who have dedicated
 their lives to the service of humanity. They are y=
oked to service till the last breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instr=
ucts Prahlada, "My dear Prahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of y=
our body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far =
and wide." Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as a "Maha Tyagi" an=
d "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced the idea of "I am a Tyagi&=
quot; and "I am a Vairagi", who neither accepts nor rejects thing=
s that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, t=
he Immortal Atma, who feels always "I am Akarta (non-doer)", &quo=
t;I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) " even while moving amidst objects. The G=
ita says, "But the disciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with =
senses free from attraction and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to<br=
>

Peace." Chapter II-64.<br><br>Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose=
 themselves for "Maha Tyagins" or "Maha Bhogins" and qu=
ote scriptures also: "We eat without
 tongues; we see without eyes&quo=
t;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like t=
he people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and quo=
te Gita:=97"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chain=
am Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=97"Weapons cleave him not=
, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away".=
 Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellects! T=
he gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines unde=
r borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas a=
nd Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite wi=
thout difficulty.<br>

<br>A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to ac=
cept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he wil=
l not crave for them. He will not say, "I have enjoyed today good mang=
oes or good milk." If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not
 a=
ble to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk=
, if he has no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually off=
ers of his own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteri=
ously. He takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of variou=
s persons.<br>

<br>The child sometimes eats food at night while he is slee=
ping. If the mother asks the child in the morning. "Baby, you took foo=
d last night," he replies, "I have not taken anything last night.=
 You are playing and joking with me." Such is the condition of a Jeeva=
nmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He =
eats without a mouth and smells without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at ni=
ght when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes to waking consciousness, &=
quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last night when you were dreaming=
?" He replies "I do not remember anything." Such is the stat=
e of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha
 Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.<br><br>Durvasa ate a su=
mptuous meal and yet he said, "I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat anyt=
hing. I take grass juice only", because he identified himself with the=
 Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regard=
ed as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama.=
 Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, "My beloved! Say unto the river t=
hat my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give path of way.=
 She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat." She repe=
ated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She was qu=
ite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, "My Lord! You ar=
e living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am str=
uck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy." Tiruva=
lluvar replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through dire=
ct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the
 silent witness. Th=
e senses,<br>body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely dis=
tinct from them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife understood the nature of th=
e soul and then she became silent.<br><br>Ordinary aspirants with delicate =
health should not take recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He =
who has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is a=
damantine. If an aspirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to l=
ive on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is that he will get various so=
rts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obt=
ained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.<br>

<br>If you have mastery o=
ver the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense hea=
t and intense cold, if you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri,=
 this is highly creditable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you at=
tempt to stand before the sun in summer for some hours, if
 you throw off y=
our clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunst=
roke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to take recourse to these hard pr=
actices. What little you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth wil=
l be lost, and you have lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to =
reach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.<br>

<br>An aspirant =
gave up his clothing all at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarge=
d spleen and died within a short time. During the period of sickness all cr=
avings that were temporarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled=
 force. He became a slave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of fo=
od. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute d=
iarrhoea.<br>

<br>An aspirant said, "I have not realised the Self tho=
ugh I did meditation for some years. I am going to commit suicide with the =
Bhava, "I am immortal Atma". I have got full Vairagya. No sin
 wi=
ll cling to me, because my motive is pure. I will attain self-realisation. =
" He actually committed the abominable act. Do you find such a stateme=
nt anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. This is extreme foolishness. =
Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature of true Vairagya, who have no=
t lived under the guidance of their masters for some time, commit such igno=
ble acts. They can never get salvation by taking to wrong Tapas though thei=
r Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot entertain the Bhava "I am At=
ma" just at the time of committing the act. Horrible thoughts will cro=
wd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obviously the fate of =
Pretas (ghosts).<br>

<br>The mind should gradually be weaned off its old h=
abits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasure centres, it wil=
l get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who take to too much =
Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You should train the=
 mind
 in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner bliss. Gradually=
 it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you can get yourself=
 established in true Vairagya.<br><br>The more the Viveka, the more the tru=
e Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the garden of Antahka=
rana from the understanding that the world is a mere appearance and full of=
 miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full of knowledge and =
bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and association with th=
e realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all objects of the wo=
rld appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or worthless things. H=
e will not give up his new spiritual life even if the wealth of the whole w=
orld is offered to him.<br>

<br>Aspirants should give up those articles of=
 food which they like best for some time. They should discipline all the In=
driyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple life. They
 sh=
ould always eat simple food. But they should not become slaves of Vairagya.=
 Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this in his devotees =
in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.<br><br>May you all =
become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from the canker of=
 Vairagya Abhimana!<br>

<br>May you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya=
!!<br><br>May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !<br><br>Real Vairagy=
a<br><br>There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titikshu. He could=
 bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for some hours. =
In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He used to sleep o=
n a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.<br>

<br>On one occasion one of h=
is admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided him a cot to =
sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to provide a =
bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremely
 difficult =
for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swami a bed of=
 grass with great difficulty.<br><br>Sri Ram said: "Swamiji, it is ver=
y difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindly use th=
e cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced Sannyas=
i. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on a cot?&=
quot; The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of gra=
ss only. You must bring it anyhow."<br>

<br>Attachment to Vairagya is=
 as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wi=
sdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage=
 has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, h=
e is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats,=
 milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good foo=
d. He always takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external object=
s.
 This is the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or =
not. A worldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of fo=
od which he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A rea=
lised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.<br>

<br=
>Suka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate =
for some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranee=
s served him and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom=
.<br>

<br>Obviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had =
not attained equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Va=
iragya even after several years of spiritual practice. He was not completel=
y free from all sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. H=
e did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite =
indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the
 b=
ed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeli=
ng.<br><br>He who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is cal=
led a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Va=
iragya, but it is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.<br>

<b=
r>Some Sannyasins who are working for the public good make resolves: "=
We will not travel in trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fru=
its, etc. We will not use fountain pens or watch." These are not desir=
able resolves. This is not the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attac=
hed to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect. They want to do service. I=
f they move in cars or trains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, th=
ey can do more service in a short space of time. Those who do much writing-=
work can turn out much work if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes=
 various forms. This is one kind. It does not leave even educated persons o=
r
 cultured Sannyasins.<br><br>Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order t=
o gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God knows the motives of all, as H=
e is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.<br><br>Where is =
the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where there is no tem=
ptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not renounced anyth=
ing, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects o=
f the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the objects of the=
 world even though he shows externally that he is a great Virakta or dispas=
sionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only i=
n his hand?<br>

<br>Raja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People report=
ed that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. T=
hat is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a real great Virakta.<br><br>Y=
oung aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take
 a=
dvantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be pract=
ised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beg=
inners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Va=
iragya to the very letter and spirit.<br>

<br>May you all transcend Raga a=
nd Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. May you all understand the tr=
ue nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.<br><br>Vairagya is the rein by which th=
e uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to=
 Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything other than Atma.<br>

<br>I=
f one considers the position and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a =
cow, then only he has developed a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting=
 dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainmen=
t of Self-realisation.<br>

<br>It is common to have dispassion for some pa=
rticular objects by some cause or other. But by having dispassion for
 all =
objects at all times, one will get knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-=
Jnana soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion to him, and by practice of=
 what he instructs.<br><br>Do not fall a victim of Moha even if you happen =
to move in towns with young and well-adored fashionable ladies of high civi=
lised societies. Resolve to attain Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vani=
sh of its own accord.<br>

<br>Devotion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma a=
re the three means of salvation. Dispassion is desirelessness This All-full=
 Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and so everybody has this Atma.<=
br><br>Light on Vairagya<br>

<br>Vairagya is born of Viveka, discriminatio=
n between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real a=
nd unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes through disinterested selfless=
 service done in several births and through Puja and Aradhana, and through =
the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vairagya. It gives
 spiritual st=
rength.<br><br>A man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. It is lik=
e a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Va=
iragya produces concentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates burning Mum=
ukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Release.<br>

=
<br>Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, the=
re is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are =
one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Pat=
anjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoi=
sm), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). Firs=
t, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmit=
a, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, =
the clinging to this life.<br>

<br>Vairagya is of different types or degre=
es=97Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate and
 intense). Intense Vair=
agya only will help the aspirant to stick to this path. If it is of a dull =
type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, the mind will simply be wai=
ting to get back the objects that were renounced previously, and the aspira=
nt will get a downfall. He will not be able to climb again to the heights h=
e formerly reached. So aspirants should be careful. Even though the Vairagy=
a is of a mild type, they should try to make it moderate; and then intense =
Vairagya comes through looking into the defects of sensual life. Sensual pl=
easure is not real happiness. It is illusory, transient, impermanent. It is=
 mixed with pain. So again and again by looking into the defects of sensual=
 life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened through study of spiritual=
 books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.<br>

<br>Simply living in nudity and=
 eating neem leaves, and drinking cow's urine does not constitute real =
Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of
 discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. =
By these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like=
 a thread=97Thanumanasi=97 and then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and=
 again you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudity and these external th=
ings will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enqu=
iry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us lasting happiness. They lead=
 us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in =
for a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for =
an aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted=
. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if=
 the mind runs towards objects, at once it will point out that there is pai=
n there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause<br>

for rebirth and intense s=
uffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually through intense pra=
ctice, it is established in
 real, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.<br=
><br>Vairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para =
Vairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation. The whole world then loo=
ks like a straw. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.=
<br>

<br>Without Vairagya there cannot be any real spiritual progress. In =
Vedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, al=
l other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says "Abhy=
aasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=97"The mind is controlled by =
meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya." They are the two wings of the asp=
irant to soar high into the realm of Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Kr=
ishna also says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihyate"=
=97"The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya, dispassion, inten=
se detachment." By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He who works in a d=
etached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants' duty to
 cultiva=
te this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.<br><br>Vairagya is doubtless=
 a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual grooves. It move=
s towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and yet she ha=
d absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the world, she had=
 mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affected in the =
least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she ruled a kingd=
om; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renouncing his kin=
gdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to the body, =
he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any one object.<=
br>

<br>You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he will=
 fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. This =
is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that one has=
 Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not
 belong to thi=
s extreme type of Vairagya=97wearing only a rope around the waist. He was a=
midst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had that mental s=
tate of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.<br>

<br>Lord K=
rishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. "Karshayan=
tah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham tan vi=
dhyasuranischayan ."=97"They torture all the elements in the body=
 and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha also tortured his bo=
dy, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; a=
nd then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by t=
he middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisa=
tion. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should=
 not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You=
 should not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you
 s=
hould practise "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm in taking=
 good, healthy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. Y=
ou should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cann=
ot sit for a long<br>

time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanapras=
h or some fruits. You should have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya in=
ternally and at the same time follow the middle path externally.<br><br>Gen=
erally, aspirants say: "I have given up umbrella."=85 "I tak=
e only one meal." Their whole Sadhana is: "I have given up shirt.=
"=85 "I have given up sweater."=85 "I have given up sho=
es."=85 "I live only on bread and dhal." Their Sadhana consi=
sts in "giving up"=97give up this, give up that. Real spiritual l=
ife does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or taki=
ng. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you are=
 very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of mi=
lk.
 Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It w=
ill hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.<br><br>At the=
 present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a great Vai=
ragi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing in the icy r=
egion and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a very go=
od description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a wonderful =
man and made him his Guru.<br>

<br>Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi=
. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He alway=
s slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep=
 on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sl=
eep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cul=
t. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, and they w=
ear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This is
 Vair=
agya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Ta=
pas. They have got a physical body.<br><br>There is another great Vairagi, =
our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to =
take food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after meals. &qu=
ot;Avadhootas" are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real A=
vadhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas ar=
e destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere =
life. He was Poornabodha' s Guru and Swami Krishnananda' s Guru. On=
ce in his Ashram, they prepared very good food, and Brahmendra Swami ordere=
d the food to be given to cows. He used to make severe tests. Sankarananda =
is also his disciple. He had a very strong body and lived an austere life.<=
