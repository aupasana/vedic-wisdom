Namaste,

Let me state my understanding of the issue.

When a person become=
s one with his deity, it is the deity who stays and work 
through him/her a=
t all times. A deity, any deity, has a birds eye view of the 
karmic links =
in any particular situation and know what needs to be done, based 
on the s=
pecific karmas of the specifc persons interacting at that time. When the 
d=
eity is an ugra devata, his/her action may not be gentle, but it always has=
 
some higher purpose. 


For example as Vimalananda mentions, the curse of=
 Rishi is always benefitial. 
Even if it puts a person through some discomf=
ort, it eventually helps the person 
to come out spiritually stronger. And =
added to this, if we understand that death 
is merely a comma, and one keep=
s continuing his spiritual journey, then there is 
no confusion at all. In =
my understanding, same applies to deities as well. Thus 
what Vimalananda d=
id and its consequences cannot be correctly judged and/or 
understood by=C2=
=A0an average mind like ours. 


Thus is most occasions it not Vimalananda =
the man who operated, but Smashan 
Taara who did. The marvel of Vimalananda=
 is that he had been able to remove his 
I-ness and let Smashan Taara work =
through him. She knows what karmas are pilling 
up for whom in what situati=
on, and does appropiately. 


To achieve a state where the deity remians wi=
th one always, one must remove his 
sense of I completely through teevra sa=
dhana.=C2=A0 Then the deity can fill a 
person's consciousness and remain w=
ith him 24/7. In that case anything he/she 
does is no more done from a sen=
se of I am doing anything, but of he/she - deity 
-=C2=A0doing it. The acti=
ons, need not necessarily be as we expect by our normal 
mind. Neither is i=
t always happy and nice. But it always has a higher purpose 
for the people=
 involved, irrespective of whether they understand the same at 
that moment=
 or not.

A child who has a dog bite needs to take anti rabies injections. =
He may not like 
the pain of the injection and wonder why that maybe necess=
ary at all. But the 
doctor knows the risks and fatal consequences when not=
 given the injection 
(immediate pain). Same way a deity knows what and how=
 a person can be made 
better even if that may require an immediate pain, m=
ental or physical.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Namaste Atul Ji,

Vimalana=
nda certainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to say 
t=
hat sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn =
well 
is an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when he=
 goes to a 
cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After=
 a brief 
argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he dies! Sim=
ilarly when Robert 
Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV int=
erview, Vimalananda goes 
mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reaso=
ns for not acknowledging him. 
Vimalanada did not like to draw attention to=
 himself and secondly he was 
sick,=C2=A0and that was the reason why Robert=
 did not acknowledge any help he had 
received from Vimalananda - to avoid =
people crowding at his door, but 
Vimalananda could not be pacified and had=
 the TV transmission disabled at the 
time the interview was going to be ai=
red. Why was Vimalananda seeking 
acknowledgement even when he claims he do=
es not like public attention! Probably 
transmission breaking down was agai=
n part of divine will you think? Robert 
Sbvoboda himself mentions in the o=
pening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda 
was impossible especially whe=
n one knows he is wrong but will never admit to his 
mistake.

Then there w=
as the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience by a 
sick =
sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses this ill 
=
sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally succumbs to tha=
t and 
dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am denied audience, do I cu=
rse them to 
death?

The examples I give above does not illustrate a pictur=
e of people who were 
compassionate and always willing to forgive and forge=
t. But still, they were 
hugely successful in their sadhana in their own wa=
y. And that is what we are 
talking about here....the pre-requisite to succ=
ess in sadhana. Nobody here I 
thinks expects to acheive liberation repeati=
ng a few rounds of rosary for a 
particular mantra....but certianly what is=
 required such that our sadhana 
produces results that are easily noticeabl=
e to us. I am getting a feeling though 
that there is really no prerequisit=
e or nobody really knows those 
pre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to p=
ut in their best effort and continue 
without to let things unfold themselv=
es=C2=A0gradually.

Thanks,
Bhupendra.

=C2=A0 
Respected Bhupendra ji and Narasimha ji=
,

I am not able enough to say anything and still an ignorant flick but I w=
ant to 
add my two cents with a hope that you will forgive me for my mistak=
es.

As you know that sadhna increase flow of spiritual energy in our subtl=
e body and 
for accomodating that increased intensity and flow of spiritual=
 energy we need 
clean and open channels. ( or nadis - sorry if i am choosi=
ng bad words) if those 
channels are not clean then that energy flow can cr=
eate unpleasant experiences 
like increased anger, lust etc. and opposite i=
f channels are clean enough.

Rishis have clean channels and they flow alon=
g with divine will. curses and 
blessings they give are just part of divine=
 will. like curse given to lord 
vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana=
. similarly curses given to yadav 
vansh and king prikshit played an import=
ant role. vimlananda was a cool guy 
except few times when he was markedly =
irritated.Like in an incidence where one 
of his female disciple tried to i=
llude him by coming almost naked in front of 
him to learn how to become a =
bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that his 
student did not learnt=
 well what he taught to her. 


On other side people with some impurities l=
ike i-ness and pride may not be able 
to handle that energy well. and can e=
xperience increased anger lust etc. like 
ravana and sadhaka u are mentioni=
ng. Although i personally believe that this is 
also part of divine will. 
=


Please forgive me for my mistakes

Regards
Atul
