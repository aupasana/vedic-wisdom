Namaste Alok Bhai,

You 2 cents are very valuable. I agree to your suggesti=
ons completely and add that if the tendency of asking can not be kept aside=
 then one should ask only Spiritual progress for oneself and Well being for=
 other suffering souls around.

Thanks for the message!

Best Regards,

Utp=
