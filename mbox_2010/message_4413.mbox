MY search for a Master who would lead me to salvation began when I was 40
y=
ears old. It was ten years later, in 1927, that I went to Tiruvannamalai in=

the company of three ladies. When I went to Ramanasramam, Bhagavan was
sea=
ted on a cot in a grass-thatched shed. As soon as I saw him I knew that
he =
was God in human form. Muruganar, who was a native of Ramnad like me, was
b=
y his side. I bowed to Bhagavan and said, "Today I am blessed. Please grant=

that my mind does not trouble me any more". Bhagavan turned to Muruganar a=
nd
said, "Ask her to find out whether there is such a thing as mind. If the=
re
is, ask her to describe it". I stood still, not knowing what to say.
Mur=
uganar explained to me, "Don't you see? You have been initiated in the
sear=
ch for the Self.

We stayed for forty days. We would cook some food, and ta=
ke it to the
Ashram.Bhagavan would taste it and the rest was given to the d=
evotees. In
those days, Bhagavan's brother Chinnaswami was cooking in the A=
shram. Often
there were no curries or sambar, only plain rice and pickles. =
Though I
wanted to stay on until Bhagavan's birthday, my companions had to =
leave.
When I went to Bhagavan to take his leave, He asked me to wait a day=
 longer
for the newly printed Upadesa Saram . The next day he gave me a cop=
y with
his own hands. The thought of leaving him broke my heart and I wept
=
bitterly. Bhagavan graciously said, "You are going to Ramnad, but you are
n=
ot leaving Arunachala. Go and come soon".

Bhagavan used to be active worki=
ng both in the kitchen and outside.He would
clean grain, shell nuts, grind =
seeds, stick together the leaf plates we ate
from and so on. We would join =
him in every task and listen to his stories,
jokes, reminiscences and spiri=
tual teachings. Occasionally he would scold us
lovingly like a mother. Ever=
ything we did, every problem we faced, was made
use of in teaching the art =
of total reliance on him.

The European

One morning a European came in a h=
orse carriage to the Ashram and went
straight to Bhagavan. He wrote somethi=
ng on a piece of paper and showed it
to Bhagavan. Bhagavan did not answer, =
instead he gazed at the stranger
steadily. The stranger stared back at him.=
 Then Bhagavan closed his eyes and
the stranger also closed his. Time passe=
d and the whole atmosphere was
silent and still. Lunch hour struck but Bhag=
avan would not open his eyes.
Madhavaswami, the attendant, got Bhagavan's w=
ater pot and stood ready to
lead him out of the hall. Bhagavan would not st=
ir. We felt afraid to go
near, such was the intensity around him. His face =
was glowing with a strange
light. Chinnaswami was talking loudly to attract=
 Bhagavan's attention. Even
vessels were banged about, but all in vain. Whe=
n the clock was striking
twelve Bhagavan opened his eyes. They were glowing=
 very brightly.
Madhavaswami took up the water jug; the European got into t=
he carriage and
went away. It was the last we saw of him. Everybody was won=
derstruck at the
great good fortune of the man, to have received such immed=
iate initiation
from Bhagavan.

Maharaja of Mysore

Once the Maharaja of My=
sore visited the Ashram. He asked for a private
interview. Of course, Bhaga=
van never allowed such a thing. Finally it was
decided that Maharaja be bro=
ught in when Bhagavan was having his bath. Trays
and trays of sweets and ot=
her costly presents were laid at Bhagavan's feet.
For ten minutes the Mahar=
aja just stood looking and then prostrated before
Bhagavan. Tears flowing f=
rom his eyes made Bhagavan's feet wet. He told
Bhagavan, "They made me a Ma=
haraja and bound me to a throne. For the sin of
being born a king, I lost t=
he chance of sitting at your feet and serving in
your glorious presence. I =
do not hope to come again. Only these few minutes
are mine. I pray for your=
 grace".

The Harijan

In the early days of the Ashram, a harijan used to s=
tand near the well and
accompany Bhagavan whenever he went up the hill. One=
 day Bhagavan called him
near and said, "Go on repeating `Shiva, Shiva'". I=
t was very unusual for an
untouchable to receive this kind of initiation. H=
e could never have secured
it without Bhagavan's infinite grace. After that=
 the man disappeared.

Kitchen and other stories

A visitor while taking le=
ave of Bhagavan expressed a wish that Bhagavan
should keep him in mind as h=
e was going very far away and would probably not
come back to the Ashram. B=
hagavan replied:

A jnani has no mind. How can one without a mind remember =
or even think? This
man goes somewhere and I have to go there and look afte=
r him? Can I keep on
remembering all these prayers? Well, I shall transmit =
your prayer to the
Lord of the Universe. He will look after you. It is his =
business.

After the devotee departed, Bhagavan turned towards us and said:=


People imagine that the devotees crowding around a jnani [?] get special
=
favours from him. If a Guru shows partiality, how can he be a jnani? Is he
=
so foolish as to be flattered by people's attendance on him and the service=

they do? Does distance matter? The Guru is pleased with him only who gives=

himself up entirely, who abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken car=
e
of wherever he may be. He need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The=

frog lives by the side of the fragrant lotus, but it is the bee that gets
=
the honey.

One day, when I was still new in the kitchen, I served Bhagavan=
 with a few
more pieces of potato than the rest. Bhagavan noticed it and go=
t very angry
with me. He turned his face away and did not look at those who=
 were serving
food. In the evening the women working in the kitchen would t=
ake leave of
him. Usually he would exchange a few words with us. That eveni=
ng he called
me near and asked:

"What did you do today"?

"I don't know Bh=
agavan. Have I done something wrong"?

"You served me more curry than you s=
erved others".

"What does it matter. I did it with love and devotion".

"I=
 felt ashamed to eat more than others. Have you come all this way to stuff
=
me with food? You should always serve me less than the others. Do you hope
=
to earn grace through a potato curry"?

"Out of my love for you I committed=
 a blunder. Forgive me Bhagavan".

"The more you love my people, the more y=
ou love me", said Bhagavan.
