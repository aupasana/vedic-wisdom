 Hierarchy of needs By Abraham Maslow, American Psychologist

Abraham Maslo=
w, American Psychologist, the Propounder of "Self
Actualization" in his pap=
er "Hierarchy of needs" on Human Motivation has
included his observation on=
 Humans innate curiosity and needs.

Maslow puts it this way, every human h=
as this Hierarchy of needs in the
process where one is Self Actualized or i=
n our terms Self Realisation:

Physiological needs - These are the most bas=
ic human needs which are
important for sustenance like food, water, warmth,=
 shelter, sleep etc.
Maslow argued that unless physiological needs are sati=
sfied to a degree, no
other motivating factor can work.

Safety or Security=
 needs - These are needs to be free of physical danger and
emotional harm l=
ike the fear of losing a job, property, food or shelter. It
relates to secu=
rity, protection and stability in the personal events of
everyday life.

So=
cial Needs - These are needs for love, affection and belongingness and
soci=
al acceptance.People are social beings and try to satisfy their needs
for a=
cceptance and friendship.

Esteem - Once people's social needs are satisfie=
d, they look for esteem
(reputation). This need produces such satisfaction =
as power, prestige status
and self confidence. It includes both internal es=
teem factors like
self-respect, autonomy, achievements and external esteem =
factors such as
recognition and attention as well as personal sense of comp=
etence. (Source)

Self actualization - This need is the drive to become wha=
t one is capable of
becoming. It's the need to grow and use abilities to th=
e fullest potential.
It includes growth and self-fulfillment by achieving o=
ne's potential to
accomplish something

Similarly,

The Pancha Koshas can b=
e roughly understood as the 5 Needs of Humans, The
'Sheath' or 'Koshas' are=
 actually called 'cells' in Human Body,
Psychologically we can take it as o=
ur Physiological needs. The Sheath or the
invisible layers of our body need=
s to be nourished systematically.

The Pancha Koshas or the 5 Sheath's are:=


Annamaya Kosha - Physiological needs (Food Nourishment)
Praanamaya Kosha =
- Safety or Security needs - (Energy)
Manomaya Kosha - Social Needs - (Emot=
ions)
Vijnanamaya Kosha - Esteem (Ego)
Anandamaya Kosha - Self actualizatio=
n (Brahman)


Being born as a Human being, the most primordial and basic ne=
ed to to keep
it going is to fuel it. therefore every human begins his jour=
ney into
eternity from the Anna Maya Kosha or the Food Sheath. Here the Hum=
an
primarily needs Food and Water for survival. His needs are limited to
wo=
rking out his way for his Food.

The Second need is energy. Praana simply m=
eans Energy. From the need for
Food originates the energy. They are interre=
lated to each other. This is
primarily signified by our breath. Our breath =
is our basic energy. The Nadis
or the Nerves carry out the energy to all pa=
rts of the body to different
organs to keep the body going. Here the Humans=
 need is to develop the
Energies in his Body.

Thirdly, Every human develop=
s emotion. Emotional bonding with others and
himself. Here Human tries to u=
nderstand whatever is happening to him. He
develops an Emotive ability in d=
etermining and fulfilling all his emotions. The
Love and understanding the =
other, the need for a company, to Co
exist.According to Scriptures there ar=
e supposed to be Nava Rasas of 9 types
of emotions.Here Human evolves himse=
lf in the Nava Rasas.

Fourthly, Vijnanamaya Kosha is Mental level, It clea=
rly signifies the
Intellectual abilities, discrimination, here the Human is=
 really able to
understand and appreciate the Truth! He begins to face the =
reality face to
face. Here the Ego 'I' is more dominant than ever. In all t=
he previous
stages above, the HUman is not aware of even His Ego. It is onl=
y when he is
traveling in Vijnanamaya Kosha that he is able to learn about =
himself the
Ego in Him. Most of us reside in Vijnanamaya Kosha fluctuating =
between other
Koshas. Here in when the Discriminative ability is Prominent.=


Ananda Maya Kosha is the Sheath of Bliss or Sat Chit Ananda Here Perfecti=
on
is achieved or what is called the Self Actualization by Maslow. This is =
the
most Natural State of the Human or the Soul. There is no more needs to =
be
fulfilled. ABsolute Completeness. Brahman.

These are the invisible Shea=
th or layers or cloths that cover the Soul or
Atman or Brahman. When differ=
ent needs are met, it discards its layers one
by one and finally in Vijnana=
maya Kosha or Self Esteem when the Ego Drops
the Brahman is only to be foun=
d and is COMPLETE. and it has no more layers
or Sheath to itself and it onl=
y IS.

Bhagavan Ramana has explained that these are all inter oven,like a h=
and
kerchief.The hand kerchief has got a thickness, a colour, a texture, a =
size,
and then the smell, depending upon the perfume one uses.All the five =
sheaths
are interoven as all the above things are interoven in the handkerc=
hief.

Marshall McLuhan, a Canadean Philosopher coined in the Term "The wor=
ld is a
Global Village"

In the Vedas we have this idea from time immemoria=
l "Vasdeiva Kutumbakam"
The world world in one family

"Ekam Sat Vipraha ba=
hudha vadanti" from The Rig Veda
There is but one God, learned scholars cal=
l this God by different names
