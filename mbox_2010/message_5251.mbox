Namaste Sir,

There is a samskritam subashitam available just to answer this particular
question!

vijetavyA laMkA  charaNataraNIyo jalanidhi

Explanation:-
For defeating Lanka, (Lord Rama) had to walk across the sea.
His opponent was the powerful son of rishi pulastya: Ravaan, and his
army was of monkeys  (i.e. All odds were against Rama). Inspite of
that Rama  killed all the demons. ***Success of great men depend
solely on their own capacities, and not on the means they get to
use***

(i don't have the exact text with me now, but this is the closest
version available on the net, may be scholars on the forum will post
an accurate version, I have also split up the lines to see the simple
translation verbatim)

My additional 2c: If I could go back in time say -5000 years B.R
(before Lord Raam) and tell the folks that one person would walk
across the country, cross the ocean, and defeat a powerful rakshasa
with just an army of monkeys, the listener would have laughed
(presumably) in disbelief. Same is happening today, Many of us wonder
(to some extent myself) as to how Kalki avatar, with just a horse and
sword, is going to rid the world of all  anti-elements given that the
world is burgeoning rapidly in that direction.

I guess the point of all this is, god even when apparently ni-hattha,
is infinitely powerful.

Regards.
