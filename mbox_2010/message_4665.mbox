 It was in the year 1933 that a friend of mine spoke to me about Bhagavan
S=
ri Ramana Maharshi and suggested that I should meet him.

On reaching Sri R=
amanasramam,I went direct to where Sri Bhagavan was seated,
prostrated myse=
lf before him and sat down on the floor at some distance.

One or two incid=
ents during this period may be recounted here, miracles to
the faithful, bu=
t casual coincidences to the sceptics.

One evening in the year 1936 when I=
 visited the Ashram I decided to ask an
important question of Sri Bhagavan =
concerning certain spiritual practices.
But amidst the solemn hours of Veda=
 Parayana in the evening and during
meditation that followed I could not ma=
ke up my mind to ask the question,and
returned home somewhat disappointed.
=

Early next morning, when I was lying half awake, Sri Bhagavan appeared
bef=
ore me in a dream and answered the very question which I had failed to
put =
to him the previous evening. And before he vanished he also told me that
he=
 wanted a note-book. I said I had only one readily available and that it
wa=
s of the octavo pocket-size. He said it was enough. I woke up with a
pleasa=
nt thrill.

The dream or vision, whatever one may call it, made such a deep=
 impression
on my mind that I could not delay carrying out the behest, howe=
ver strange
it might seem. After early bath and ablutions I traced out the =
pocket
note-book and hurried to the Ashram. Prostrating myself before Sri B=
hagavan
as usual, I handed over the note-book to him. He received it smilin=
g, and
asked me why I took it to him, when I related to him, in a whisper, =
all
about my dream.

Immediately he called his personal attendant, the late=
 Madhavaswami, and
remarked to him =E2=80=9CDid I not ask you last evening =
to fetch a good notebook to
write down a Malayalam translation of the Sansk=
rit text of Sri Ramana Gita?
You didn=E2=80=99t bring one. Here is Nambiar =
who has brought it for me. It seems he
had a dream in which I asked him for=
 the book, and he has brought it.=E2=80=9D This
incident aroused a great de=
al of interest among the devotees.

On another occasion in the same year I =
dreamt of Maharshi as seated on his
couch as usual, surrounded by a number =
of devotees seated on the floor and
engaged in meditation. Among them I rec=
ognised a young devotee from Goa,
seated in padmasana performing pranayama.=
 I think he was known by the name,
Sridhar. While he was doing pranayama, I=
 saw, in the dream, sparks of fire
rising from the base of his vertebral co=
lumn up to his head. Bhagavan,who
was watching this practicant, interjected=
 =E2=80=9CThere is no need for all this
gymnastics with breath-control. It =
is easier and safer to follow the method
of Self-enquiry as enunciated by m=
e.=E2=80=9D That is the sum and substance of the
dream I had.Next day, when=
 I went to the Ashram, I sought out this young
Goanese Swami. I had no prev=
ious acquaintance with him and no occasion even
to speak to him before. I g=
ave him a full description of the dream I had. He
was visibly moved and, so=
mewhat to my embarrassment, embraced me with
delight in the North Indian fa=
shion.

He said =E2=80=9CBrother, I was all the while waiting for an opport=
unity to ask
Bhagavan whether I should continue or give up this practice of=
 pranayama
which I have been steadily carrying on for the past several year=
s. Indeed,
last night while sitting in the presence of Sri Bhagavan I eager=
ly awaited
an opportunity to put him the question but I couldn=E2=80=99t fi=
nd a suitable
occasion for the purpose. Now, there is no need for me to ask=
 him about it.
Bhagavan answered it through you.=E2=80=9D

When I was in En=
gland last year, I went to see a venerable, old lady, by
name Mrs. Victoria=
 Doe. She must be nearing 80 and lives in a quiet house at
17. St. Martin=
=E2=80=99s Avenue, Epsom, Surrey, with her only daughter, Miss. Leena
Doe. =
She has never come to India, never seen Bhagavan Sri Ramana in flesh
and bl=
ood. Yet, I was deeply moved by her devotion to him. She had read
about him=
, prayed to him,meditated on him, and lives in him day in and day
out.

She=
 showed me sheaves of letters she took from a corner of a shelf, and
kissed=
 them with great reverence before handing them to me. All the letters
were =
from the Ashram and were meticulously preserved for the past several
years.=
 She had also with her all the English publications of Sri
Ramanasramam. Sh=
e opened one of the books and, running her shaky finger
along the writing o=
n the first page =E2=80=9CWith Gracious Blessings from Sri
Bhagavan=E2=80=
=9D burst into tears of joy and devotion. She said =E2=80=9CMr. Nambiar,how=

lucky you are to have been able to be with him, to see him and hear him
sp=
eak. Here, we treasure these books and letters as representing him. Now he
=
has sent you here. I feel that he is with us now.=E2=80=9D Such love, such =
devotion
to the Sage, so tenderly expressed to me, a total stranger to her =
till the
other day, moved me to the depths of my being.

I do not profess c=
ompetence to interpret Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s philosophy and
teachings. The=
 first publication I remember to have read on his teachings is
the booklet =
entitled =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D. Having read it, I felt no need to rea=
d
other books propounding some different approach to the realisation of the=

Eternal Truth. I am convinced that the method of Selfenquiry suggested in
=
that great little book is all that is needed for the highest achievement in=

life, namely, Self-realisation.
