Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,

Can Pitru Tarpanam be peformed during Navratri? As I get only a chnace to do 
this on Sundays, tomorrow is such a day. I would like to know if it could be 
done. Missing a day is probably not much of an issue but here in Canada, as 
winter takes its full effect, I will not be able to do this anyways as this has 
to be done outside the house. So I am trying to do as much as I can while 
weather still permits.

Thanks,
Bhupendra
