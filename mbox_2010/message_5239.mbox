Dear Utpal,

In the actual=C2=A0Mahabharata, before the=C2=A0actual story s=
tarts there are many parts 
and descriptions of different things and spirit=
ual lineages. There is history to 
the place of Kurukshetra it says.=C2=A0
=

It is mentions=C2=A0that once there was a time when - due to the actions o=
f Sri 
Parashurama - the brahmanas gained supremacy and they started marryi=
ng kashtriya 
women. This resulted, in ashuric forces being born in this ma=
terial plane of 
existence. So all the deities came to Narayan asking for h=
elp. Narayan consoled 
them saying he will come down to earth himself and t=
hat they - the gods and 
rishis=C2=A0- too must sent down their own amsa al=
ong with him and chose which 
ashuras they must fight. 


Thus during the c=
ourse of the Mahabharata, at many times Krishna made Arjuna 
fight and dest=
roy different cluster of ashuras and finally made sure Ashuras do 
not take=
 birth in human forms. Aurobindo says these days an Ashura can influence 
t=
he minds of people, not come down directly.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

"Between me and You, there is only me. 
Take away the me, so only You r=
emain" - Hallaj

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I=
n the actual Mahabharata, before the actual story starts there ar=
e many parts and descriptions of different things and spiritual lineages. T=
here is history to the place of Kurukshetra it says. </DIV>
<DIV> =
;</DIV>
<DIV>It is mentions that once there was a time when - due to t=
he actions of Sri Parashurama - the brahmanas gained supremacy and they sta=
rted marrying kashtriya women. This resulted, in ashuric forces being born =
in this material plane of existence. So all the deities came to Narayan ask=
ing for help. Narayan consoled them saying he will come down to earth himse=
lf and that they - the gods and rishis - too must sent down their own =
amsa along with him and chose which ashuras they must fight. </DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thus during the course of the Mahabharata, at many times Kr=
ishna made Arjuna fight and destroy different cluster of ashuras and finall=
y made sure Ashuras do not take birth in human forms. Aurobindo says these =
days an Ashura can influence the minds of people, not come down directly.</=
