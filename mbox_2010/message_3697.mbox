 Soon after his mother and his brother returned home Sri Ramana left
Pavala=
kkunru and moved up the hill. He lived for a short time in the Satguru
Swam=
i Cave on the south-eastern slope, then in the Namasivaya Cave. He
finally =
settled down in the Virupaksha Cave,where he remained from 1899 to
1916.

A=
t the time Ramana took up abode there nobody felt responsible for the
Virup=
aksha math and the cave was empty. There was a lawsuit in progress
between =
two different groups, who both claimed possession of, and the income
from, =
the math. But as no decision had yet been made, nobody was caring for
it. T=
he issue of possession was, in fact, only resolved some years later. At
the=
 following Kartikai festival the successful litigants came up to the cave
a=
nd started charging a fee to visit it. So access to the Swami who lived
the=
re suddenly became conditional upon payment of a fee, although he himself
w=
as not informed of the matter. As large numbers of people were now coming
u=
p to see him, quite a few had to go away disappointed when they were told
t=
hey had to pay.

When Ramana heard about this practice, he left the cave an=
d sat down under a
tree. Those collecting the fees then declared this place=
 also to be an outer
area belonging to the math and continued to demand mon=
ey from all those who
wanted to approach him. He had no alternative, theref=
ore, but to go away
again. At first he lived in the Satguru Swami Cave whic=
h was lower down,
then in another cave, consequently the Virupaksha Cave wa=
s no longer a
source of revenue. The owners of the cave finally understood =
that they could
not misuse the young Swami for their own purpose, so they g=
ave up the fees
they had collected and asked him to continue to live in the=
 cave. As a
result Ramana returned and stayed there until 1916.

In winter =
Virupaksha was a fine lodging, but not so in summer,when the
adjoining rive=
rbed dried up and there was not the slightest breeze. In
addition, as there=
 were almost no trees, the cave was exposed to the sun, so
that it became u=
nbearably hot.

A little higher up the hill, at the foot of a mango tree th=
ere was a cave
known as the Mango Tree Cave. The nearby Mulaipal Teertham a=
lways had a
supply of clean water. The first time Ramana had seen it, it ha=
d been
uninhabitable. But since then two brothers had removed the overhangi=
ng rock,
had built a small wall with a door and had made the cave inhabitab=
le. They
asked the Swami to use it, so he used to spend the summer months h=
ere.

Life at the Virupaksha Cave and Mango Tree Cave was rich in privation=
s but
carefree, as Ramana himself stated, =E2=80=9CPalaniswami asked me to =
copy out and
give him some stanzas of Shankara, but where were notebooks or=
 paper with us
at the time? I collected every scrap of paper I could, stitc=
hed them
together into a notebook,wrote out the stanzas and gave them to hi=
m. At that
time we had nothing but a pot; we did not have even a towel. In =
the early
days of our stay in the Virupaksha Cave, Palaniswami alone had a =
towel to
wrap around him. The cave had no iron doors then; it had a wooden =
door with
a wooden latch. We would fasten it from the outside with a small =
stick, go
around the hill, wander hither and yon, return after a week or te=
n days,
then open the door with the help of another stick. That was our key=
 at the
time; no need to keep it anywhere! This notebook was the only artic=
le we
took with us. As Palaniswami wore a towel, he used to fold the book a=
nd tuck
it into his waist. That was enough for us.=E2=80=9D

His loincloth =
was also in a poor state, =E2=80=9CMy koupina got torn. I do not
usually as=
k anyone for anything. Bodily privacy has however to be
maintained. Where c=
ould I get a needle and thread available to mend the
koupina? At last, I go=
t hold of a thorn, made a hole in it,took out a thread
from the koupina its=
elf, put it into the hole and
thus mended the cloth, and, so as to hide the=
 place where it was mended, I
used to fold it suitably before putting it on=
. Time passed like that. What
did we need? Such were those days!=E2=80=9D

=
Sri Ramana never wore shoes, not even during the hottest months.Rangan, a
f=
ormer classmate, reports, =E2=80=9CWhen Bhagavan and I climbed up to the to=
p of
Arunachala, a thorn pricked my foot.Noting that I was lagging behind,
=
Bhagavan removed it. A few yards later a big thorn pricked his foot. When I=

looked at his foot there were so many unremoved thorns in it. Then I
exami=
ned the other foot, but the position was not different. =E2=80=98Which one =
will
you remove, the new thorn or the old ones?=E2=80=99, he queried. He br=
oke the thorn
by pushing his foot to the ground and started walking again.=
=E2=80=9D


There was no cooking in the Virupaksha Cave. Visitors used to b=
ring milk,
fruits, cake and other food. Gradually more followers came to li=
ve with
Ramana and Palaniswami. Any food donated was always evenly distribu=
ted. But
as it was not possible to rely on sufficient food for all being br=
ought by
visitors, Palaniswami and other devotees would go down to the town=
 to beg
for additional food. Then Ramana would mix up all the food donated,=
 make a
mash by pouring hot water over it and gave each one a glassful.Ofte=
n there
was not even any salt to flavour it, but Ramana
thought it better t=
o be without than to beg anyone for it, =E2=80=9CIf once we begin
to ask fo=
r salt, we would feel like asking for dhal, and when we ask for
dhal, we wo=
uld feel like asking for payasam and so on. So we felt that we
should not a=
sk for anything, and swallowed the gruel as it was. We used to
feel extreme=
ly happy over such diet.=E2=80=9D

The begging mission to town followed a f=
ix course. At least four of Ramana=E2=80=99s
devotees started on their way,=
 announcing their arri-val to the inhabitants
by blowing their conches. The=
y then went through the streets singing and
collecting what was given to th=
em.

Some days there was not enough of anything, on other days there was mo=
re
than enough eatables. At times Ramana, so as not to disappoint anyone, e=
nded
up overeating. There is a well-known story of how one day he planned a=
 day
of fasting and started off
early in the morning to walk alone on the h=
ill. There he met several women
who competed with each other to serve him f=
ood. He had to eat all that they
served him. Some hours later he met them a=
gain and again they forced him to
eat. Then he lay down in a mantapam to sl=
eep. In the evening he wanted to
return to the Virupaksha Cave when a devot=
ee met him, bringing him mangoes
cooked in rasam. He ate this too. Jokingly=
 he said, =E2=80=9CIt is like the story of
the man who fled the town of mic=
e and found himself in the land of tigers.=E2=80=9D

Sometimes people would=
 also send their carriages to pick him up for a meal.
But he always refused=
, as he feared that if he accepted there would be no
end to the invitations=
.
