The Observers Effect on Objective Reality



The real question here is as =
to what Objective Reality would be like if 
there were no observer/s to obs=
erve it. That way one could make an
analysis of before and after being obse=
rved. But how are you going to do
that?  Why not try not existing and then =
observe what Objective Reality
is like with nothing observing it.   :- ) It=
 is the same as asking as to
what would be the content of consciousness if =
nothing were conscious. 
The Observer cannot be taken out of the equation. =
Consciousness permits
observation.



However, that which is Observed and k=
nown in the Timeless mode of being
in the ground of our cognitive existence=
 is nothing like that which is
being observed in Spacetime. You can only ve=
rify this fact by going
there to find out for yourself. So don't play silly=
 guessing games
or come the old `in my opinion' or `I believe', for all
tha=
t is hogwash and bunkum. Go there and find out and then you will
KNOW.



O=
ne of the very first questions I had to ask myself after finding that
Timel=
ess mode of being was `WHY'?  Not as to why that existed,
because all that =
bit made sense; but rather as to why time and space
existed and me out here=
 existed, and all this stuff out here existed. 
It took me another twenty y=
ears to find out why.



You can take all your religions, all your beliefs,=
 all your opinions,
and stick them up that dark place.  But IF you are seri=
ous about
learning, and serious about the meaning of the words Honour, Dign=
ity,
and Integrity, (let alone love) then I suggest humanity take a course =
in
learning instead of paying homage and reverence to their silly retarded
=
antiquated prehistoric belief packages. Will that happen in the
foreseeable=
 future?  In the meantime pay attention as to what effect
Objectivity has o=
n the Observer. It was doing just that which kicked me
into all of this. Yo=
u try it.



No matter where you exist, or when, in Time or Beyond, conscio=
usness
will ALWAYS contain CONTENT.  It would be prudent and wise to study =
its
CONTENT. And whilst also studying what it is that Consciousness
permeat=
es. It permeates you does it not. IF objective reality could
speak then IT =
would say `If you want to know me then first study
yourself'. You cant have=
 one without the other.



But in time and space not all beings are at the =
same place at the same
time. Life delegates responsibility and action. Lear=
n these thing for
yourself by studying IT and yourself. That we are all the=
 same stuff
beyond Time yet all different in Time and Space is the greatest=
 wonder
of all wonders. And it is good. Here is LIFE, what are you going to=
 do
with it whilst you have the opportunity to do anything?  It is a pity
t=
hat so many do not know what they have until it is gone. But they will
lear=
n, for learning is not an option.



Dick Richardson.
