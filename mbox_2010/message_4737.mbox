 "Attachment is bondage. Attachment
disappears with the elimination of the
=
ego."

"Guru is non other than the Self."

"Guru is said to be external fro=
m the
seeker. The inward turning of the mind
is brought about by the Guru. =
Since
the seeker is outward-bent, he is
advised to learn from a Guru whom
h=
e will in due course find to be the
Self."

"Grace is always there."

[from=
] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-Jan 6th, 1937-

"Be the Self. There will be =
no second
thing to cause fear."

"Do your actions without caring for
the re=
sult. Do not think that you
are the doer. Dedicate the work
to God. That is=
 the skill and also
the way to gain it."

"The seer is only one. The divers=
e
phenomena do not appear without
the seer. There is no change in the
seer,=
 however much other things
may change."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi
=

-recorded Jan 7th, 1937-

"The Self comprises all,
it is the screen, the p=
ictures,
the seer, the actor,
the operator,
the light,
and all else.

Imagi=
ne the actor in the picture asking if
he could enact a scene without a scre=
en.
Such is the case of the man who
thinks of his acting apart from the Sel=
f."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Jan 2, 1937-

"Efforts m=
ust be made only in the waking state,
and the true Self realized here and n=
ow."

"Existence of God follows from our conception
of God. Let us first kn=
ow Who's concept He is.
The concept will be only in accordance with the
one=
 who conceives.
Find out Who you are and the other problem
will take care o=
f itself."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Dec 31, 1036-

"T=
he "I" which rises
will again subside.
That is the individual
"I" or the "I=
" concept.
That which does not
rise, will not subside.
It IS and will be fo=
rever:
That is the universal "I,"
the perfect "I," or
realization of the Se=
lf."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Jan 2, 1937-

"Meditati=
on is your true nature now.
You call it meditation, because there
are other=
 thoughts distracting you.
When these thoughts are dispelled,
you remain al=
one: in the state of
meditation free from thoughts; and
THAT is your real n=
ature."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Jan 1, 1937-

"The S=
elf is all.
Now I ask you:
Are you apart from the Self?
Can the work go on =
apart from the Self?
Or is the body apart from the Self?
None of them
could=
 be apart from the Self.
The Self is universal.
The Self is beyond
knowledg=
e and ignorance."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Jan 2nd, 1=
937-

"The Real Existence
is the only One devoid of objective knowledge.
Th=
at is Absolute consciousness.
That is the state of happiness,
as admitted b=
y all of us.
That state must be brought about
even in this waking state.
It=
 is called finding the Self.
That is freedom."

[from] Talks with Ramana Ma=
harshi

-recorded, Jan, 2, 1937-

"A HIGHER POWER
IS LEADING YOU.
THE HIGHE=
R POWER
KNOWS WHAT TO DO
AND HOW TO DO IT.
TRUST IT.
