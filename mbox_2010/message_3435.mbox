Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
In this story, Ramana Maharshi teaches the true mea=
ning of "guru".
=C2=A0
This story reminds me of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and=
 Girish. Ramakrishna made Girish give a kaarmik power of attorney to him so=
 that all sins committed by Girish would go to Ramakrishna.
=C2=A0
Girish w=
as a famous playwright, director and actor in Calcutta theater. He was a dr=
unkard and a womanizer. He reformed in later years, but continued to move i=
n the same circles and showed the spiritual path to many fallen people. He =
was held in high esteem for his wisdom and level of realization by Swami Vi=
vekananda and other sishyas of Ramakrishna.
=C2=A0
Rajarshi, I hope you had=
 a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that your signature changed aft=
er the trip.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

It was a summer evening, and we were all sitting outsid=
e in the open space by the well. Suddenly one of the visitors started weepi=
ng bitterly.

'I am a horrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming t=
o you, but there is no change in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am=
 I to wait? When I am here near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave=
 this place, I become a beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be --=
 hardly a human being. Am I to remain a sinner forever?'

'Why do you come =
to me? What have I to do with you?' demanded Bhagavan. 'What is there betwe=
en us that you should come here and weep and cry in front of me?'

The man =
started moaning and crying even more, as if his heart were breaking.

'All =
my hopes of salvation are gone. You were my last refuge and you say you hav=
e nothing to do with me! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To whom=
 am I to go?'

Bhagavan watched him for some time and
 said, 'Am I your Gur=
u that I should be responsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I =
am your Master?'

'If you are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, =
if not my Master? You are my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take=
 pity me and release me from my sins!'

He started sobbing and crying again=
.

We all sat silent, overcome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and ma=
tter-of-fact.

'If I am your Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay =
me for my services.'

'But you won't take anything,' cried the visitor. 'Wh=
at can I give you?'

'Did I ever say that I don't take anything? And did yo=
u ever ask me what you can give me?'

'If you would take, then ask me. Ther=
e is nothing I would not give you.'

'All right. Now I am asking. Give me. =
What will you give me?'

'Take anything. Everything I have is yours.'

'The=
n give me all the good you have done in this
 world.'

'What good could I h=
ave done? I have not a single virtue to my credit.'

'You have promised to =
give. Now give. Don't talk of your credit. Just give away all the good you =
have done in your past.'

'Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell m=
e how the giving is done and I shall give.'

'Say like this: "All the good =
I have done in the past I am giving away entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I =
have no merit from it nor have I any concern with it." Say it with your who=
le heart.'

'All right, Swami. "I am giving away to you all the good I have=
 done so far, if I have done any, and all its good effects. I am giving it =
to you gladly, for you are my Master and you are asking me to give it all a=
way to you.'

'But this is not enough,' said Bhagavan sternly.

'I gave you=
 all I have and all you asked me to give. I have nothing more to give.'

'N=
o, you have. Give me all your sins.'

The man looked wildly
 at Bhagavan, t=
error stricken.=C2=A0

'You do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If=
 you knew, you would not ask me. If you take over my sins, your body will r=
ot and burn. You do not know me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask=
 me for my sins.'=C2=A0

He wept bitterly.

'I shall look after myself. Don=
't you worry about me,' said Bhagavan. 'All I want from you is your sins.'
=

For a long time the bargain would not go through. The man refused to part =
with his sins. But Bhagavan was adamant.

'Either give me your sins along w=
ith your merits, or keep both and don't think of me as your Master."

In th=
e end the visitor's scruples broke down and he declared, 'Whatever sins I h=
ave done, they are no longer mine. All of them and their results, too, belo=
ng to Ramana.'

Bhagavan seemed to be satisfied. 'From now on there is no g=
ood nor bad in you. You are just pure. Go and do nothing, either good or ba=
d. Remain
 yourself. Remain what you are.'

A great peace fell over the man=
 and over us all. No one knows what happened to the fortunate visitor, for =
he was never seen in the ashram again. He might have had no further need to=
 come.
