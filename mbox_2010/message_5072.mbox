Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] "Invading =
the Sacred"

   
I'm one of the co-editors of the book. Thanks for the mess=
ages of support. There 
is a lot of work to be done in this area. For examp=
le, Wendy Doniger, who is the 
culprit behind a lot of negative misportraya=
ls of Hindus and Hinduism (as 
described in the book) recently wrote a hist=
ory of Hinduism book (though she 
admits she is not a historian) that she i=
s aiming to have be used as a standard 
textbook in Indian schools in the h=
igh school levels (as stated in the 
introduction to the book). There have =
been some articles and other reports 
written critiquing the book--for exam=
ple, I wrote an article in Outlook India 
refuting her claim that Rama thre=
w out Sita because he was afraid of becoming a 
sex addict like his father,=
 Dasaratha, etc.--but there needs to be more of a 
coordinated movement not=
 only to refute such writings but to produce scholarly 
and objective descr=
iptions of Hinduism that can replace the more bigoted / 
denigratory writin=
gs. 

 
I am not really into politics, but I can tell you from having been =
born and 
raised in America, that the school envirionment (including at the=
 very liberal 
schools I attended) is poisoned for learning about Hinduism.=
 The most 
frustrating thing for me as a young girl wanting to learn about =
Hinduism was the 
lack of resources--I would go to the Hinduism shelf at th=
e library or 
bookstore only to find exposes on the "cult of the Hare Krish=
nas" or trashy 
books on Tantric sex, or go read textbooks or other scholar=
ly books on Hinduism 
at school only to be inundated with denouncements of =
caste and mockeries of the 
Hindu pantheon as, at best, amusing mythology o=
r, at worst, as a mythology that 
reflected certain disturbing pathologies =
of the Indic people.
 
Had I not the great fortune of finding my guru and o=
ther true acharyas who were 
able to provide me a correct understanding of =
Hinduism, I may have eventually 
given up my search and lost out not only o=
n knowing my heritage but on finding 
the path of sadhana.
 
It is for this=
 reason that I think this work is so important and urgent.
 
More informati=
on on these issues in general is available at 
www.invadingthesacred.com. I=
 also have many extra copies of the book. If you or 
someone you know would=
 be interested, please let me know and I can arrange to 
have copies shippe=
d. We are trying to provide copies to temples and local 
libraries so that =
it is there as a resource for those who are interested. 

 
Warm regards,

<p>Nama=
ste friends,<br><br>A member of this group gifted me a book when he met me =
for a saamoohika Satya Narayana vratam we conducted at Cary, North Carolina=
 last year. I finally got to read a little from it. I am impressed with thi=
s work.<br>

<br>The book is called "Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hi=
nduism Studies in America" (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas=
 and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.=
<br>

<br>Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look do=
wn upon India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted pervert=
ed researches in the name of academic freedom at the religious studies depa=
rtments of western universities, published them and gained name and fame, t=
rampling the sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with =
this will not improve the situation or solve the problem. Interested religi=
ous scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique these works in the same a=
cademic style, in order to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.<br>

<b=
r>Several papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by =
western scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious=
, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lie=
s.<br>

<br>* * *<br><br>I will just give an example of the offensive work =
that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offens=
ive writings should skip the next three paragraphs.]<br><br>Jeffrey Kripal =
from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal and did res=
earch on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there enthusiastically hel=
ped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced is utterly nonsensi=
cal and filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation without showing=
 it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or linguistic inaccu=
racies. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he produced only ye=
ars later, after his book "Kali's Child" based on the PhD dissertation won =
great acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal Academy of Relig=
ion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was sadly mentioned=
 in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for learning
 ab=
out Ramakrishna.<br>

<br>In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexual=
ly perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali =
or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from any Bengali people at =
the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty translations, willful dis=
tortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and damning)=
 conclusions. For example, he translated a word that means "lap" as "genita=
ls", in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and =
a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna's lap. He translated a word that m=
eans "touching softly" as "uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penise=
s of boys".<br>

<br>Even in places where there was no material to mis-tran=
slate, he simply speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of T=
otapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri =
taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali an=
d experience nirvikalpa samadhi: "What it must have been like for Ramakrish=
na, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut wi=
th another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man's =
nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna's =
attention. How could it not?" Please note that he is not referring to any s=
ource and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based on his perverted=
 agenda!<br>

<br>* * *<br><br>If you see the book, you will see many examp=
les of such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that=
 many perverted people under asuric influences make their livelihood, money=
 and fame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and =
Hindu saints.<br>

<br>Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha =
against this may ignore this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if e=
nough people do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things =
will automatically weaken. However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-sch=
olars academically is really required on the ground. We need to give our en=
couragement to the pioneers who are doing this important scholarly rebuttal=
