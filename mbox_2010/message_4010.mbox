> While the funds come mostly from=
 upper strata participants in India and

ses have been allocated to develop

mmon folks, mostly from the lower strata of

 Christians have returned to Hinduism by getting

his organization. The swami himself has spoken

as also stated that the Dravidian movement had

ual in their lives, and that this had caused

<strong>Why Swami Ni=
thyananda Must Resign Now <br>Wednesday, 17 March 2010 18:40 Rajiv Malhotra=
</strong><br><br>When the sex scandal of Swami Nithyananda suddenly erupted=
 on March 2, 2010, I was already in Delhi as part of a group to go to Kumbh=
 Mela. I was also finalizing my new book which deals specifically with Tami=
l Nadu religious politics, and in particular with the role of various nexus=
es based overseas. So I decided to jump into the eye of the storm of this s=
candal in order to investigate whether similar nexuses were at work in this=
 case. Naturally, at one level I have seen this scandal through the framewo=
rk of a civilization encounter in which Vedic culture is pitted against the=
 Dravidian divisiveness that is being backed by Christian evangelism. At an=
other level, I found that the sensationalized media reports were too one-si=
ded, and none of them had a single statement to report from the swami himse=
lf. Furthermore, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami=
 Nithyananda's inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned out=
 differently had they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will ela=
borate later in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has been=
 to extrapolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu organiz=
ations, which I predict will face similar scandals as and when their weakne=
sses become understood by those opposed to them. This article highlights my=
 findings at these multiple levels and issues.<br>


<br>During this 2-week=
 investigative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to give Swami Nithyan=
anda's organization the benefit of doubt and to report their side of th=
e story. Besides wanting to balance out the one-sided media depictions, I w=
anted access to the ashram's core group for my own research on the broa=
der subject of civilization encounters. I respect the sensitivities of that=
 organization consisting of many decent and dedicated devotees who have sac=
rificed a great deal and stand to lose a lot.<br>


<br>But I have conclude=
d that the situation is now beyond repair for Swami Nithyananda and that hi=
s continued involvement can only damage the broader interests of dharma as =
well as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two other sympathizers who ar=
e not ashramites, I have personally recommended to Swami Nithyananda that t=
he best course at this stage would be for him to resign completely from his=
 organization. He should turn it over to a small team of senior Hindu mahat=
mas, so that the assets can be used in the best interests of dharma. Furthe=
r, under the guidance of these mahatmas he must live a quiet life as a sadh=
u devoid of any institutional responsibilities. Because the head of any org=
anization must accept responsibility that "the buck stops here," =
only such a move can salvage the organization and the reputation of dharma =
at large. Over several years, this resignation would hopefully reduce the m=
assive pressure that has built up against him personally, and enable him to=
 live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up to him to accept or reject this advic=
e. The basis for this conclusion becomes clearer once the reader has gone t=
hrough the rest of this article. <br>


I want to begin by examining some p=
rinciples about the relationships between siddhis (extraordinary yogic powe=
rs), morality, Tantra and sex. This will provide the framework in which to =
interpret what has happened. Then I will turn to my initial interest in pur=
suing the challenges facing Hinduism in south India from a variety of force=
s.<br>


<br><br>Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality<br>A few=
 days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation with S=
ri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced myself as an i=
ndependent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian civilizati=
on in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. One of my vol=
umes will be specifically on the major global gurus since the 1960s =96 inc=
luding Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Pabhupada, am=
ong others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri Sri himself. I have=
 been investigating what happened to such gurus, in terms of the shifts in =
their Western followers over time, their scandals, their Indian followers a=
nd critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her position sandwiched b=
etween Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western modernity on the other. The=
 relevance of this in the context of Swami Nithyananda will become clear ve=
ry soon.<br>


<br>The first provocative question I asked Sri Sri concerned=
 the nature of yogic powers: What is the relationship between siddhis and m=
orality? If siddhis are a scientific phenomena dealing with powers that can=
 be harnessed by all humans then one must bear in mind that science deals w=
ith truths that are morally neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived=
 an immoral life it would not invalidate his scientific theories. A person =
who designs aircrafts or any other complex technological systems may or may=
 not be moral in order to be effective in his technical work. In other word=
s, rtam (the patterns of the cosmos), which we discover and call science, f=
unctions independently of human morality. This is why a scientific principl=
e can be used either morally or immorally, because it is independent of mor=
ality. There are moral persons who lack any siddhis or even ordinary scient=
ific competence. Conversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana) who lack=
 morality. Sri Sri's pranayama techniques would also produce results fo=
r an immoral person. <br>


<br>Sri Sri seemed impressed by this question, =
and agreed with my overall position on the independence between siddhis and=
 morality. But he pointed out that the moral dimension, while not determini=
ng the siddhis, was also important because it led to receiving the grace of=
 the divine. I agree with him. <br>


<br>So there are two separate phenome=
na involved: (i) spiritual technologies that are objective and that allow a=
nyone to harness spiritual energies, and (ii) morality which is important i=
n itself, not for attaining siddhis, but in order to have a positive relati=
onship with the divine. Either one can be developed without the other; howe=
ver, the dharma tradition encourages us to cultivate both. The reason that =
meditation systems prescribe things like vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is b=
ecause an inappropriate lifestyle interferes with the mental tranquility re=
quired to advance. This lifestyle change can be appreciated regardless of w=
hether one believes in a personal God or not. This absence of a personal Go=
d is clear in Buddhist meditation. Different Hindu systems place different =
levels of emphasis upon a personal God for the yoga to function. This is wh=
y many secular and scientifically minded persons are also drawn towards med=
itation techniques. In other words, something cannot be a science if it dep=
ends upon morality, because science is objective and stands independent of =
morality.<br>


<br>The relevance of this question is as follows: Many pers=
ons who have learned advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to kno=
w if any moral breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of ac=
hieving higher states of consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal agains=
t the legendary Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges by=
 a large number of his Western female disciples, the Western academy rashly=
 condemned not only one man's morality, but also the whole legitimacy o=
f the Indian tradition itself. In that series of debates (with RISA scholar=
s like Sarah Caldwell, etc.), I took the same position then as I am taking =
now: that Muktananda's capabilities in harnessing spiritual energies ar=
e separate and independent from whether or not he violated any code of mora=
lity. <br>


<br>Patanjali warns against getting lured by siddhis which app=
ear along the way when one practices advanced meditation persistently. One =
is not supposed to indulge in them. This warning is found in various Hindu =
systems that deal with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, becau=
se these energies are very powerful and can get out of control. Another poi=
nt that is worth noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithyananda =
are not his original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly
