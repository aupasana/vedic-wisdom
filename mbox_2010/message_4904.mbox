Dear Rajarshi,

[[[
disagreement is with the belief that the Kunjika is equ=
al to the 700 verses or that the merely reading the Kunjika is equal to rea=
ding the=C2 Chandi.

I strongly feel the reason why 99.99 percent sadhakas =
cannot use the Kunjika to any real affect is because Chandi Herself has put=
 some brakes (locks) on the Kunjika.
]]]

A couple of years back i asked my=
 father to recite Chandi paath on a particular day and he asked me over pho=
ne if he can recite Kunjika Stotra only in case he can not manage the full =
paath. I strongly objected and told him that there is no use of reciting Ku=
njika Stotra alone. I agree that many choose this Stotra for their convenie=
nce or out of ignorance and that should be discouraged. Period

Though you =
are in disagreement with the notion that Kunjika is equal to 700 verses, yo=
u still believe that Chandi herself has put some brakes on the Kunjika. Thi=
s means that you too acknowledge that this Stotra has some important hidden=
 potential.

I firmly believe that Kunjika is equal to 700 verses but only =
for those very few who have crossed the threshold by merging themselves in =
the 700 verses and found out the "Kunji" by their sheer efforts and devotio=
n to the mother Chandi.

As Narasimha said and you reproduced....for most o=
f us Kunjika is a gun whose safety catch has been locked by mother and in m=
y opinion, 700 verses are the praise to please the mother to remove the loc=
k or fire the Gun for us.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
