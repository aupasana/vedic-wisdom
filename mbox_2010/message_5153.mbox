Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Translations, Initiation,=
 Vedic vs Tantrik

=C2=A0 


Namaste friends,

Essentially I agree with Nar=
asimha garu in most matters in this discussion. The 
only major point where=
 I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path 
*without initiation*=
. The rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs 
some clarifica=
tion as there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few 
pointers:

1. =
There are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas =

etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, st=
otras, 
kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahama=
ntras and 
mantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as =
mantras.

2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the orig=
inal. Reading a 
translation is not even comparable to chanting the origina=
l chant. So far it is 
fine.

3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all =
based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes 
a distinction between them.

4. As per=
 the traditional view one doesn't need to be initiated to chant a 
stotra o=
r dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras 
containing =
bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need 
initiation. Th=
is is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not 
the same=
 as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally 
referred=
 to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the 
actual =
idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct 
spiri=
tual specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such 
=
as Kali or Sri.

5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc =
do not need initiation 
as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasaha=
sranama and Devi Mahatmyam 
are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras =
or parts of puranas. They have a 
larger status as integral parts of a Maha=
vidya sadhana. Chanting them without 
initiation is not recommended especia=
lly when the reader combines the navarna or 
shodashi mantras too as an int=
egral part of the chanting.

6. I know from personal interaction that achar=
yas belonging to both Kanchi as 
well as Sringeri paramparas recommend init=
iation for both the sadhanas of Sri 
Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with th=
eir respective NAVAKSHARI AND 
SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as a=
n INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the 
sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions h=
old that one needs to be initiated 
to chant the Navarna as well as shodash=
akshari mantras.

7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great=
 text that has an 
independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It =
is simultaneously a 
Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in=
 the spirit of the 
Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an inte=
gral part of Sri Sri 
Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs t=
o be initiated to chant it. 
However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga=
-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of 
the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacre=
d myth in the vernacular has been 
recommended in my write-up, as chanting =
the original along with the navakshari 
amounts to practicing the sadhana o=
f a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended 
to be initiated and go throu=
gh the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.

8. Arguably if an uni=
nitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original 
Sanskrit as part =
of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an 
inherent prob=
lem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of 
Devi Mah=
atmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers 
inadvert=
ently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the 
Siddh=
akunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.

9. I you carefully per=
use my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, 
nowhere do I pu=
t down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I 
attempted to wri=
te a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the 
power of th=
e original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know 
the e=
ssence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. 
=
Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! 


1=
0. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, =

there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level =
of 
samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it.=
 
Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please =
keep 
doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadha=
na. As 
Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the =
sadhana 
WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself wi=
ll reduce a 
lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own =
accord in the 
natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. 
=


Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. 

Regards,
Satya =
Prakash

<P><BR><BR>Namaste friends,<BR>=
<BR>Essentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matters in this discuss=
ion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Ch=
andi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion on translation of=
 mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some unnecessary con=
fusion. A few pointers:<BR><BR>1. There are various sacred chants embedded =
within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants =
can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotra=
s too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita portion of t=
he Vedas too is referred to as mantras.<BR><BR>2. Undoubtedly mantras and s=
totras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is not eve=
n comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.<BR><BR>3. W=
hilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition make=
s a distinction between
 them.<BR><BR>4. As per the traditional view one do=
esn't need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not th=
e same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, m=
antras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Man=
tras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that nee=
d initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Wh=
atever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are int=
egral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiat=
ion, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.<BR><BR>5. Vishnusaha=
sranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they=
 fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are =
traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a=
 larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them with=
out initiation is
 not recommended especially when the reader combines the =
navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.<BR><BR=
>6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi=
 as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas =
of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND =
SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the s=
adhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be initiat=
ed to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.<BR><BR>7. Recapp=
ing my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independe=
nt status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidy=
a, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads=
. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi pa=
th***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant it. How=
ever if one
 wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects=
 of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has bee=
n recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navak=
shari amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is =
recommended to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properl=
y under guidance.<BR><BR>8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Dev=
i Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and=
 not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our times. The problem w=
ith attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without=
 initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Na=
varna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain=
 the bijaksharas.<BR><BR>9. I you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi =
Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra eve=
n in
 writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commentary on it. Transl=
ations of mantras do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or =
Vak. However it is recommended to know the essence or import (artha) of the=
 mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha' is the import, th=
e essence of `Vak', not a translation! <BR><BR>10. For those who are alread=
y doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no need to worry o=
r be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted =
to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be do=
ing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are do=
ing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has right=
ly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any f=
avours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential =
problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow.
 Leave=
 the rest to the compassionate Goddess. <BR><BR>Hope the above pointers hel=
p in clearing any confusion. <BR><BR>Regards,<BR>Satya Prakash <BR><BR>=3D=
