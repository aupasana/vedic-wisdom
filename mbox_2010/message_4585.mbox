Namaste

Respected Shree Maa has a ashram in Napa Valley, a couple hour dri=
ve from bay area. She and the Swamiji in the ashram are very authentic and =
very spiritual. One cannot go wrong in my humble opinion.

You seem to be l=
ucky to be close to that ashram where they have conducted the most Chandi H=
omas in all over USA.

if you google you can find the address and the web s=
ite.

Best Regards
Mitesh
