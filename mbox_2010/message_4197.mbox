Dear Rajarshi,

The procedure you taught proves that the homam pr=
ocedure could be change according to ones needs, it maybe restricted beyond=
 limit...Now, I want to ask you a follow-up question, whether I could add s=
ome extra part (mantra/ahuti/poornahuti/material used/different deities/or =
anything) to the main homam procedure to get relief in troubles created by =
my psychic wife! (she is simply destroying almost everything of my life! th=
ough the only positive thing - troubles leads me to the spiritual life!)
