Namaste,
While performing Chandi homam, different types of havyas(pumpkin,s=
ugarcane,pomgranate,banana,arec nuts,guava,coconut etc along with cow's ghe=
e)=C2=A0are offered at the end of each of the 13 =C2=A0chapters =C2=A0in a =
specified sequence.
May I request you to explain the significance of this b=
ased on your deep knowledge of the subject, your discussions with sadhaks=
=C2=A0and your experiences in sadhana?
I will be highly obliged if you can =
touch upon this.

Best regards,
(Dr. M.NARAYANA RAO)

=C2=A0 



Nam=
aste,

1) Yes, some people split "Nya" in "vareNyaM" as "Niya" to give it 2=
4 syllables. However, I have always practiced Gayatri mantra the way it is =
given in original Vedic texts and whatever I experienced was with that. I n=
ever considered the other versions. So I have no comment.

2) I am not awar=
e of this view and practice.

Goddess Swaahaa being the shakti of Agni, Agn=
i acts through swaahaa. Whenever we use Agni for a work (e.g. carrying an o=
blation to Savita or some other deity), it is a good idea to think of Agni'=
s shakti. So adding swaahaa at the end of mantras is customary.

However, i=
deally speaking, even if you just say a mantra without swaahaa and make an =
offering, but having the mental intention that Agni should carry that oblat=
ion to a deity, won't Agni know it and act on it? If you do not specificall=
y say the name of Swaahaa devi, won't Agni's shakti be invoked?

So, some p=
eople may advocate skipping swaahaa at the end of some Veda mantras, so tha=
t those who are not comfortable with the rules may use wrong intonation on =
the last syllable. After all, if you add "swaahaa" to a Veda mantra, the in=
tonation of the last syllables may have to change accordingly and some peop=
le may not know. Instead of explicitly acknowledging Mother Swaahaa and mes=
sing up the intonation of the Veda mantra, some may think it better to not =
explicitly acknowledge Mother Swaahaa and be safe with the intonation.

3) =
Never worry about offending me and feel free to be frank. Learned persons l=
ike you are always humble and have saattwik intentions.

Generally speaking=
, Ganapathi atharvaseersham, Narayana sooktam, Chandipath, Savitru Gayatri =
mantra etc are all very similar in spirit and essence, but there are subtle=
 differences.

Gayatri mantra stresses the absolute Truth that all is supre=
me consciousness. Chandipath stresses that all is supreme consciousness man=
ifesting as various beings and things ("aham vibhutyaa bahubhiriha rUpairya=
dA sthitA"), but also acknowledges that there is doubt regarding that and e=
xplains how that doubt is overcome. Gayatri mantra is about the end target =
and Chandipath is about the end target and also a path to it.

Certain sadh=
anas like Chandi homam can clear the undesired conditioning powerfully and =
maximize one's experience with various other mantras.

Even with various im=
purities in one's consciousness, one may be able to experience *something* =
with Gayatri mantra japam (or some other such staple mantra) and that can b=
e enough to *sustain* one's spiritual life. However, Chandi homam can clear=
 the impurities further and help one experience higher. One with weak diges=
tion may eat a sumptuous food item and digest it reasonably, but, if the sa=
me person takes herbs that improve one's digestion, one can digest better.
=

We are living in deeply polluted times, both materially and spiritually. T=
here are negative influences all around us. It is very difficult to remain =
free from them. If one is capable of handling sadhana of an ugra devata suc=
h as Chandi, it can help in accelerating one's spiritual progress.

Of cour=
se, sadhana of any deity will help eventually in cleansing one's consciousn=
ess. One should in the end feel comfortable with the sadhana one does and f=
eel some attachment.

Best regards
Narasimha
