Dear Ashutosh,

> Someone told me that at the time of homam agnivas is to =
be
ascertained,i.e. it is at prithvi or AkAsh or pAtAl and homam at wrong
a=
gnivas may give adverse results. Is this true? How agnivas can be
ascertain=
ed/determined and what are the impacts of doing homam in
different agnivas?=

>

All these factors may come into play when you are doing homa of any
spe=
cific deity to achieve any specific material result.

Otherwise, if your ai=
m is to please God and nothing more, just as the
homam sankalpa in the manu=
als of Narasimha mention, then one can safely
ignore these factors and just=
 keep doing homa and trying to surrender
ones sense of I-ness.

-Regards

 Rajarshi
