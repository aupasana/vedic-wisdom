Dear Narasimha,

The Shiva Purana also mentions worshipping Shiva on Krish=
na Chaturdashi
of Jyeshtha with mahaardra yoga (i.e. ardra nakshatra coinci=
ding with
surya sankranti). Here it does not specify sankranti into which r=
asi.

This combination does not happen every year.

Last time it happened w=
as in Mid-June 2007.

At that time, Sun was entering Mithuna and Moon was i=
n Ardra nakshatra.

Previous to that it was in Mid-June 1988.

How do we ac=
count for this?

mysticalsense.

The pendulum of the mind alternates betwee=
n sense and nonsense, not
between right and wrong.
