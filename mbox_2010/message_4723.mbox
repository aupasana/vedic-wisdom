Traditional pre-Confucian Chinese beliefs f=
rom the Chinese mythology and Chinese 
folk religions such as Taoism and Sh=
enism coexisted with Confucianism for many 
centuries. For example, Han dyn=
asty declared Confucianism as the official state 
culture and Taoism as the=
 official religion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, 
xians, supernatura=
l beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in 
these folk =
religions were not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they 
co-existed. M=
oreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which 
extended =
to proper social behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.

Thus, even if Chin=
ese may not explicitly believe in a specific definition of 
God, an implici=
t concept of god has influenced the evolution of the value 
system, philoso=
phy and culture they so faithfully followed.

* * *

Of course, communist r=
ule changed things. Any society has to receive the fruits 
of its collectiv=
e karmas when the right time comes.

* * *

I've never been to China, but I=
 went to Seoul, South Korea on office work a 
couple of years back. As I co=
uld not do my daily homam in the hotel room there, 
I mentally did the homa=
m procedure in the fire that is within and then 
meditated. I felt nice ene=
rgy as I meditated. Though Korea is not as good as 
India, it is better tha=
n US in spiritual energy. I am quite convinced that some 
great souls did e=
xcellent sadhana in that area in the past.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<P>Namaste Dev ji,<BR><BR>> But I have practical =
interaction with Chinese people, most of<BR>> them don't believe in God =
but surprisingly follow "this is right<BR>> and that is wrong!!" as it c=
omes from within.<BR><BR>Traditional pre-Confucian Chinese beliefs from the=
 Chinese mythology and Chinese folk religions such as Taoism and Shenism co=
existed with Confucianism for many centuries. For example, Han dynasty decl=
ared Confucianism as the official state culture and Taoism as the official =
religion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, xians, supernatural beings (e=
.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in these folk religions we=
re not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they co-existed. Moreover, Conf=
ucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which extended to proper soci=
al behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.<BR><BR>Thus, even if Chinese may =
not explicitly believe in a specific definition of God, an implicit concept=
 of god has
 influenced the evolution of the value system, philosophy and c=
ulture they so faithfully followed.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Of course, communis=
t rule changed things. Any society has to receive the fruits of its collect=

o China, but I went to Seoul, South Korea on office work a couple of years =
back. As I could not do my daily homam in the hotel room there, I mentally =
did the homam procedure in the fire that is within and then meditated. I fe=
lt nice energy as I meditated. Though Korea is not as good as India, it is =
better than US in spiritual energy. I am quite convinced that some great so=
uls did excellent sadhana in that area in the past.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR=
