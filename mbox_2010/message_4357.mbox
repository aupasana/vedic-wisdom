Dear Sir,

As far as he is our creator he is our father.  It is given in al=
l sources that Brahma created Devas, Manushyas and Rakshasas.  He created t=
he first manu.  All the Devarishis are created by him as well as the prajap=
atis the Vasus etc.  He therefore needs to be worshipped as our creator who=
 we need to thank for all that we are and all that we have.

It is sad that=
 man sees God only as a source of something- happiness, wealth, knowledge, =
etc.  

Do we worship our parents just because they give us something or be=
cause we love them?

Brahman occupies all the known universe and beyond.  H=
is manifestation in this creation is as Saguna brahman with the manifestati=
on as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.  Only because the Vaishnavaite and Shai=
vite sampradayas have developed this discrepancy is obvious. All three are =
equally the manifestation of the Brahman and therefore need to be worshippe=
d out of love not out of desire.

Nirguna Brahman has all the Gunas and no =
one guna and all the Upanishads recommend the worship of the Divine in this=
 form.  The inability of most ordinary mortals to concentrate on a formless=
 diety is cited as the most common reason for Pratima puja and Ishta Devata=
 puja.

Please forgive me if I am wrong in my thoughts but I feel I should =
clarify my doubts.

 more effective than on a normal day.
