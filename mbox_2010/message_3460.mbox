One more thing .the total narration and the events dont know why felt to me=
 like "Svoboda and Vimalananda part 2".
Plese again requesting rajarshi and=
 narasimha please pass on my pranams to him coz i feel the simple utterance=
 of my name to him will purify me a lot.fell jealous of you and narasimha i=
f i could also get a mentor like manish.but alas done too much bad deeds in=
 previous lifes so time has maybe still not arrived.

ation. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is=
 a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this nig=
ht which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking towards Manik=
arnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any =
of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dog=
s, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if t=
here was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a =
mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincide=
ntally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who cha=
sed the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, "Sometimes a simp=
le prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breeches".
> > =
=A0
> > As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful place.=
=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind was already pre occ=
upied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning when we ag=
ain came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure o=
n my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and said th=
is is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are still here=
. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilang=
a Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=A0Later on=
 returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that perso=
n confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and =
do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.
> > =A0
> > Back to mid=
night. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this=
 time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a =
suitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they=
 respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan.=
 We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas=
. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years t=
here has not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in=
 here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chit=
a to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size=
 bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, t=
he bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let =
us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but there =
is something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we
> >  went to anoth=
er side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=A0kau=
n se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the do=
me then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make s=
pace for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish=
 said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, bu=
t all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructin=
g others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very=
 unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, b=
ut not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadh=
anas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes ha=
ve either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thu=
s they do not disturb. 
> > =A0
> > The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyr=
e was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focu=
s was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten=
 minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was stran=
ge because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose t=
his specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sen=
se perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. E=
very now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intentl=
y for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But=
, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, th=
e dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost fel=
t a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being=
 such an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle o=
f the Chandi path=A0I could hear

> > Suddenly t=
o my right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer b=
ursting. The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said th=
e Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bu=
rsting of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - th=
e Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages =
of the=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=
=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And =
the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back. J=
ust kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=A0=
 Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe an=
d make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination =
but reality and this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana =
anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.
> > =A0
> > While offering coc=
onuts into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long=
 bamboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut=
 piece inside.I wondered if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, bec=
ause I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I e=
ven wondered if=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of=
 a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become =
a dom at Manikarkina!=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bo=
ught one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I u=
nderstood why.
> > =A0

d one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the pers=
on whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do n=
ot have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did =
not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there=
 is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I=
 guess the person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then anoth=
er of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi =
jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with t=
he homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the =
skin on the corpse=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was bu=
rning. It was a sight to see!
> > =A0
> > There is a tradition of pouring G=
anges water=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes tell=
ing the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there withou=
t permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=A0asked=
 if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice t=
old me nothing will happen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large m=
ud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. =
After some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said=
, " Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people c=
ame forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0=
Manish's feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his bles=
sings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home, s=
ince it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (=
whom Manish had addressed earlier) came
> >  running with tears in his eyes=
 asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him n=
othing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=A0 Later Ma=
nish said, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the m=
an along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked=
 him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=A0who used to live in Kasi.=
 Manish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, the pe=
rson replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was=
 late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what m=
akes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. W=
e city bred 'educated'=A0people are too rational to understand these things=
. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do=
 pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my =
head to my heart, there was nothing

if=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he j=

 were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "There is a forei=
gner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perfor=
m sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her w=
hile meditating." For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practic=
ally difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great =
calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, sa=
id Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentione=
d above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks.=
 Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen las=
t night in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, but directionles=
s." At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it=
 is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely =
