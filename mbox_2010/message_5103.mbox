Happy Dasara to everyone. 
=C2=A0
Dear Sri Narasimha, 
=C2=A0
It is a wonde=
rful gift during these Navaratris. This=C2=A0material in this document is p=
retty inspiring. I am very happy to tell you=C2=A0that I was able to do Cha=
ndi Homam all the nine days, thanks to your=C2=A0manual and encouragement=
=C2=A0on this forum all the while. I=C2=A0did 6 homams with SaptaSloki and=
=C2=A0did three homams with SaptaSati. It was an amazing experience. Last t=
ime I did with Sapta Sati, I became very emotional while reading "Sarva man=
gala mangalye" verse in 11th chapter and started forgetting swaha after eac=
h verse, but was putting ahutis in the fire at the end of each verse, after=
 a few verses, I composed myself again and resume saying "swaha" as usual. =
I was able to constantly feel that the mother was right there in front of m=
y eyes in the fire and was filled with joy. I did not do argala, kavacham a=
nd keelaka and suktams etc. I just did recite Siddha Kunjika Stotram at the=
 end on each day, whether I did the homam with sapta sloki or saptasati. Pl=
ease
 confirm if I am doing the right thing. Someday I plan to add everythi=
ng, for now, saptasati itself is overwhelming for me. 
=C2=A0
Regarding the=
 initiation, here is what I feel. It is better to be initiated if one has a=
 chance. But otherwise that should not stop you from doing your sadhana, si=
nce the assurance is given by none other than the Mother herself. In 11th s=
loka of 12th chapter, she says, "jaanata ajaanata vapi balipujaam tathaa kr=
taam, pratIchchishyaamaham preetyaa vahnihomam thaa krtaam" - that translat=
es to "I will accept with love this balipooja and homam, whether you do it =
with knowledge of doing it or not".=C2=A0When she herself is saying this, w=
hy do we need any additional approvals from anyone? Am I interpreting this =
well in this context, please confirm. 
=C2=A0
Also, is the navaavarna mantr=
am same as "Om aim hrim srim chamundaayai vichche" ?
=C2=A0

Dear Rajarshi,

It is my personal opinion that Strong and long =
standing urge should be considered as Initiation at least in this age.
I kn=
ow a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able t=
o almost for a year. He didnt have formal Guru then but he started oneday o=
n regular basis without any initiation. later he ispired few people to star=
t reading CP.

If one looks at this group, many have started CP and homam j=
ust by positive influences and no formal initiation.

You are probably very=
 right in your assumption when you say Adhikara to recite CP may be sprung =
up due to Chandi is Ugraatiugra.

However, Chandi is also Mother and though=
 she may be Ugraatiugra, she is also Sumyaatisaumya. In this age of Kali, S=
he has become the later and she'll be happy if someone just prays with *sli=
ghtest* of devotion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this is a =
strong conviction developed in me. Jo Dar gaya vo samjo mar gaya!

Best Reg=
ards,

Utpal
