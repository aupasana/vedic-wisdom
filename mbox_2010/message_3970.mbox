Dear Biswajit,

I am not clear about your requirements.
Let me assume: you =
are asking that Short procedure (Standard procedure) which takes about 45 m=
inutes is sometimes not possible due to time constraint and The super short=
 procedure does not give you satisfaction- in this case what can be done?

=
If i've understood accurately, then my take is as under:

The very idea of =
super short procedure is for the reason of time constraint only. If 45 minu=
te is long time, sometimes, and you wish to do Homam in 25 minutes then it =
is a good idea to use Mantras (Poorvaangam, Aahvaahan, Main Homam, Uttarang=
am etc...) given in Super short.
In any Homam, Most Important parts are Spe=
cific Aahutis offered with Mantras of the relevant deities AND Meditation. =
So i suggest removing that thought of 'Lack of Satisfaction' from your mind=
. For improving the feeling of Contentment, It may be a good idea to select=
 one mantra in particular and offer it say for 21 or 54 or 108 times. IMHO,=
 another `Trim down' version may not be a good idea. 

I do not know if i c=
ould answer you.

Regards,

Utpal

 Currently the short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, yes I know th=
ere is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-verse a=
nd sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum.

trim down the homam process in the case of time constraint but mind should =
be satisfy enough for the purpose...
