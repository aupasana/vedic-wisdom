Namaste,
 
For those who don't know Hindi, this couplet can be loosely translated as: "He looks in the mirror to check that he looks good, but also ensures that nobody catches him looking at the mirror!"
 
There may indeed be many gurus today who are image-conscious, hypocritical and manipulative. It is a sign of the times we live in. People get the gurus that they deserve.
 
However, I humbly suggest that our critical abilities should not be wasted on people and things that we do not have a responsibility to change. Critical abilities should be directed inward to critique oneself, towards people one has a responsibility towards, such as one's sishyas, and towards things where one has a duty to accomplish something. Why criticize other people? Let them engage in their games and make progress at their own pace. Apne ko kya lena dena (what have we got to do with them)?
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
