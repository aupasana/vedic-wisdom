Namashkaram Narsimha Garu,

You have given a wonderful guidance on how to f=
ollow Mantra-Sadhana. I see
you have mentioned couple of time to "focus on =
mantra". what is the focus on
mantra? do we focus on the literal meaning of=
 the mantra? do we focus on the
deity of the mantra? Mind needs a pin to ti=
e its thoughts on to. Which part
of the Mantra can be used as a PIN to focu=
s on? Some mantras are small and
some are long. What and how to focus on ma=
ntra.

Please further guide us.

Hari Om

Jitu

Sabda (vibration) of mantras repeat=
ed by one does create a protective layer around one, but the Sanskrit word =
sabda is far subtler than the English word "sound". Sabda is vibr=
ation. When you speak something loud, motion of your vocal cords will move =
air particles around you and the vibration will eventually move the the dia=
phragm in someone's physical ear and someone will perceive the sound.<b=

 <br>
But, this is the vibration caused in the domain of the gross phy=
sical body. These gross vibrations are accompanied by some subtle vibration=
s. In the domain of the subtle body, the thoughts of the subtle mind and th=
e intentions will cause vibration of subtle matter around one and reach the=
 subtle bodies of people around one.<br>


 <br>
The vibrations produced by=
 mantras at various levels combine together to form a protective layer. Eve=
n if one chants a mantra loud and with perfect pronunciation, there may be =
undesirable thoughts in the mind and the overall vibration may be bad or we=
ak. The real (or more important) aspect of the vibrations caused by mantras=
 are at the subtle levels and not at the gross level. Thus, what thoughts y=
ou are getting and how focused your mind is is far more important than how =
loud and clearly you are pronouncing.<br>


 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 =
<br>
Having said that, do your best to pronounce correctly. If you suspect =
your pronunciation is wrong, slow down a little, watch carefully, practice =
and rectify errors.<br>
 <br>
If your mind is not focused and getting distr=
acted by undesirable thoughts, keep trying to focus it better. Rome is not =
built in a day. Try to remove the expectation that something will happen no=
w. Try to remove the guilt that you are unable to do good sadhana or making=
 mistakes. Try to remove mental agitation whenever you discover that your f=
ocus is not good.<br>


 <br>
The weird thoughts that you mentioned are lik=
e a heckler who disrupts a speech you are giving. Do not panic and do not d=
ebate with the heckler. Let the heckler say what he says. Just take note of=
 him and move on with the speech. In other words, when your mind is aware t=
hat it is focusing on a weird thought instead of mantra, do not panic, take=
 note of that fact and move on. Consciously (but with no panic or guilt or =
agitation) steer the mind back to mantra. Of course, it may move to another=
 weird thought soon. THAT is the nature of mind. Keep pulling it back to fo=
cus on the mantra.<br>


 <br>
As you keep doing it, oneday it may click an=
