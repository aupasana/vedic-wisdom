No, it is a false story



[  "There is a very interesting story: When God=
 created humanity he
wanted feedback from people. Every day people would co=
me to him with
their suggestions & complaints and ask him to make changes. =
Finally he
got sick of their complaints. He wanted to run away from humanit=
y. He
wanted to hide where man would not look for him easily. So he asked f=
or
a emergency meeting of his advisors. The big question was, where should
=
he hide? Some said go to the Everest, go live on the Moon, hide in the
Ocea=
n but God said man would find him some day. Finally one very old
advisor su=
ggested to God. Hide in the Man itself as man would never look
there, he wa=
s right.. We never look within. Start from the body & move
within, there is=
 no other way.  Society has crippled humanity to its
core. Humans are livin=
g the lives of machines in today's materialistic
world, machines are better=
 cared for than humans."]



It is the Essence of Man and the Life Force wh=
ich is buried deep within
Human Beings.  Some look there and some don't. Bu=
t looking is not
that easy. But it is there to find, INWARDS.  But society =
does not do
this to Man unless people let it. They don't all let it. And th=
ere
is nothing wrong with material objects. A tree is one, my body is one,
=
so is yours; use it well and use it wisely, with that primordial inner
wisd=
om which is ours from the beginning and unto the end of time and
beyond. Ip=
so.
