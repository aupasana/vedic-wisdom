=C2=A0 


Namate friends,

Note: A major co=
nstraint in writing on certain topics related to sadhana (esp 
mantras) is =
how much and what to put in writing in a public forum. There are 
bound to =
be various perspectives and this may distract or confuse the initial 
pract=
itioner. Moreover the tyranny of over-intellectualization has to be kept in=
 
mind. To any such reader my advice is- please follow what you are doing 
=
currently. Things will evolve and happen on their own accord. Whatever is s=
uited 
to you will happen in the natural flow of Life. 


In this post I wi=
ll also touch upon certain other topics raised in some related 
posts while=
 primarily addressing Rajarshi ji's queries.

>>>I had talked to a few peop=
le who adhere to different paramparas >>>within the 
>>>broader subset of K=
alikula. They said that the >>>initiation in Chandi sadhana 
>>>in required=
 for not only the parayana >>>but also (mostly?) because of the main 
>>>ma=
ntra. Normally we are >>>accustomed with only the navarna mantra, but there=
 
>>>are various >>>other mantras of the different aspects of the Universal=
 Chandi, 
>>>of >>>which the navarna we know of, is probably the mildest. T=
o chant >>>one of 
>>>these mantras and awaken the same needs initiation. T=
his, >>>they said, is a 
>>>part of the >>>entire Chandi sadhana. What is y=
our >>opinion on this?>>>

Broadly speaking most of the above is true from =
the traditional *Sakta* 
perspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as enjoined by=
 Kalikula emphasises MANTRA 
sadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Mahatmyam te=
xt is not the same as Sri Sri 
Chandi sadhana, as per this view. It has var=
ious mantric nuances and practices 
including other mantras and bijas and w=
ays to make them work. I will expand on 
this at the end of this post after=
 addressing your other points.

>>>As a corollary to your above paragraph, =
one can therefore read the >>>text of 
>>>the Chandi in a pouranik approach=
, as a sacred myth? There >>>are people, 
>>>specially in Bengal, who do a =
Chandipath on their own >>>without having 
>>>undergone any formal initiati=
on. How good or bad is >>>this practise?

As always there will be varied be=
liefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid 
traditional extreme to the =
very liberal and casual new-age extreme based on 
one's personal affiliatio=
ns, family and cultural influences. I will speak for 
*myself*. I prefer th=
e moderate view that is respectful to tradition but does 
not allow traditi=
on to be one more fetter. 


Quite often many of our beliefs are fear-based=
 rather than knowledge-based. 
However undigested, unassimilated and unharm=
onised information gathered from the 
internet or even the print media is n=
ot knowledge. There is no need to be 
fearful as long as one is not experim=
enting with mantramarga based on fragmented 
information gathered from book=
s or worse still the internet. As long as one does 
the parayana along with=
 other supportive practices such as kirtan, swadhyaya, 
reflection and bhak=
ti bhava, initiation need not be a binding factor. However if 
one wishes t=
o do Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in a full-fledged manner as per the 
traditiona=
l Sakta perspective, better be initiated. If one strongly wills it 
(sankal=
pa) and is suited to it, the external guru and initiation will happen on 
t=
heir own accord. For the rest who are not predominantly suited to or inclin=
ed 
towards mantramarga, this discussion is not relevant. 


>>>There >>>ar=
e people, specially in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on >>>their own 
>>>>>>w=
ithout having undergone any formal initiation. How >>>good or bad is >>>thi=
s 
>>>practise?

Bengal is one of the areas of the subcontinent where Kalik=
ula flourished in a 
full-fledged manner at one time. So at the collective =
level Kalikula is deeply 
embedded in the collective unconscious and thereb=
y the tendency to do Chandipath 
irrespective of initiation. To undertand t=
his one needs to appreciate the 
dynamics between Kundalini and *KULA* KUND=
ALINII which are akin to the 
individual unconscious and collective unconsc=
ious. If a particular 
family/significant member of the family has practice=
d the sadhana of a devata 
for sometime, the descendants automatically have=
 its influence in their 
unconscious. That is why we are advised to worship=
 the kuladevata along with 
ishta devata though ishta devata remains a majo=
r focus. The same applies to 
parayana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbed=
 for the living and breathing 
tradition of Kalikula. Though we do not see =
its flowering at the same level or 
in the same form today, at the unseen a=
nd unconscious collective level, the 
age-old Kalikula is very much alive a=
nd breathing. 


Spiritual life is all about Awareness and oversimplifying =
it further, making the 
unconscious conscious is what Awareness is about. I=
n true Advaitic fashion the 
collective and individual consciousness are no=
t separate. The advent of Sri 
Ramakrishna is a predictable culmination of =
the flowering of Kalikula at a 
collective level. His advent marks a major =
milestone in not just Kalikula 
sadhana but Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespect=
ive of the physical death of Sri 
Ramakrishna, his satsangha is possible fo=
r all sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya 
of the Kathamrta is the easiest wa=
y to revel in his Satsangha, it is possible to 
connect with him through a =
combination of trust (sraddha) and sense of 
belongingness too. If you cons=
ider him as your APTA, he automatically becomes 
your apta at a manasik lev=
el. This sense of belongingness straightaway opens the 
doors of your heart=
 and makes his grace and protection possible. 


In view of the above discu=
ssed factors, it might be okay to do Chandi parayana 
without initiation, i=
n our times. Initiation could happen in the long run if it 
is meant to be.=
 However traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath without 
initiation is u=
nimaginable as Sri Sri Chandi's integrated sadhana includes 
various other =
mantras and bijas that are generally not written in texts though 
some text=
s talk about them without giving the complete details. Diksha includes 
all=
 this and much more. Here a word on `diksha' itself is in order to clarify =

the difference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya parayana and initiated Sr=
i Sri 
Chandi sadhana. 


Diksha differs in accordance with the sampradaya =
or the lineage within Kalikula 
or Srikula. To understand `diksha' itself, =
one needs to examine certain 
differences (bhedas), of which the following =
are most important:

1. Guru Parampara: This forms the core of Devi Upasana=
 and the other bhedas 
(differences) are in a way based on this.

2. Sampra=
daya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily belong to one of 
th=
e recognized sampradayas. 


3. Diksha: Depending on the disciple's eligibi=
lity and the Guru's capability, 
the type of diksha too varies. 


4. Yaga =
Bheda: There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, 
Bahiryaga,Mahay=
aga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or more of 
these pa=
ths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabilities) of the 
s=
adhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discussion. I have=
 
already expanded on this in another post on Yajna. 


5. Devata Bheda: Th=
ough the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and 
vasana of the ini=
tiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and thus 
the paths =
of Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. 


6. Achara Bheda: Depe=
nding on the initiate's samskara and adhikara, broadly 
speaking there are =
seven acharas- Vedachara, Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, 
Dakshinachara, Vamach=
ara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework 
of Sakta sadhan=
a, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaulachara. 
It is hi=
ghly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara over the 
other=
. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the means of 
wors=
hip, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperaments of the 
p=
ractitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana are equally 
r=
espectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to the practiti=
oner 
and NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degrade or cri=
ticize any 
path or deity. All upasanas lead to the Devi and all sadhakas h=
ave the Devi 
within them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga or rupa=
 of the Devi 
amounts to insulting the Devi Herself. As Sri Bhaskararaya ob=
serves with 
characteristic tolerance, "all vidyas are not different, a com=
parison of one to 
another (in the texts) is merely for the sake of praisin=
g and encouraging its 
performance". One could as well extend this toleranc=
e (if not acceptance) to all 
forms of God and all paths of attaining Her/H=
im. In the ultimate reckoning, any 
division is relative as there is only t=
he ONE. Advaita is the true essence of 
Sakta sadhana. All paths are practi=
cally along a *circular* continuum. An 
intellectual debate on the differen=
ces between various paths is irrelevant to 
sadhana itself though it has re=
levance to academicians or to the respective 
world-view of the sadhaka. In=
stead sadhakas should focus on the underlying unity 
of all paths and the u=
ltimate Oneness of all forms of the Divine. This is a 
major tenet of Sakta=
 sadhana.

7. Mantra Bheda =E2=80=93 Based on certain factors including the=
 sadhaka's adhikara 
bheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It is =
not uncommon that the same 
sadhaka is initiated into various forms of the =
mantra progressively in a gradual 
manner if he persists with commitment. F=
or instance in Sri Vidya upasana the 
mantra of Sri has five variant versio=
ns- Bala, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para 
shodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala ma=
ntra is the entry level or preparatory level 
mantra for Sri Vidya. Likewis=
e the navakshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN 
VARIANT versions, of whic=
h the Navarna mantra that most written texts include is 
the mildest and ak=
in to the entry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. 


The *details* of=
 the seven variant versions of the navakshari or the twelve 
different ways=
 of doing Sri Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our 
current discus=
sion. Instead in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its 
central =
importance in sadhana as per the Sakta world-view. 


Finally a word on `Va=
k and `artha' too is in order here. It is true that one 
derives great bene=
fit by chanting a mantra in its original form. No doubt 
translation of a m=
antra is NOT the same as the mantra in its original form as 
`vak'. Undoubt=
edly `Sabda' comes first and then only the `artha' follows ("Artha 
Srishta=
eh Purvam Sabda srushtih"). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak' 
and=
 `Artha' are interdependent and inseparable. I will elaborate on 
Sabda/Vak=
/Artha in my next post along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin's commentary 
and=
 the importance accorded to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a 
man=
tra, so much so that he even affirms that, "the mere utterance of sabda 
wi=
thout a knowledge of the true import bears no fruit, even as the offering 
=
thrown over ashes in the absence of fire does not burst into flame". I will=
 
examine both sides of `sabda' and `artha' in my next post as and when I c=
an. All 
Indian traditions that explore `Vak' or `Sabda' agree that both ar=
e inseparable. 
The very mention of the words `sabda' and `artha' brings to=
 my mind the most 
beautiful mangala sloka from Kalidasa's `Raghuvamsa' whe=
rein he compares the 
inseparable and interdependent nature of `Vak' and `A=
rtha' to `Siva' and `Sakti' 
the parents of the entire universe =E2=80=A6.

<P><BR><BR>Namate friends,<BR><BR>Note: A major constraint in writi=
ng on certain topics related to sadhana (esp mantras) is how much and what =
to put in writing in a public forum. There are bound to be various perspect=
ives and this may distract or confuse the initial practitioner. Moreover th=
e tyranny of over-intellectualization has to be kept in mind. To any such r=
eader my advice is- please follow what you are doing currently. Things will=
 evolve and happen on their own accord. Whatever is suited to you will happ=
en in the natural flow of Life. <BR><BR>In this post I will also touch upon=
 certain other topics raised in some related posts while primarily addressi=
ng Rajarshi ji's queries.<BR><BR>>>>I had talked to a few people w=
ho adhere to different paramparas >>>within the broader subset of =
Kalikula. They said that the >>>initiation in Chandi sadhana in re=
quired for not only the parayana >>>but also (mostly?) because of
=
 the main mantra. Normally we are >>>accustomed with only the nava=
rna mantra, but there are various >>>other mantras of the differen=
t aspects of the Universal Chandi, of >>>which the navarna we know=
 of, is probably the mildest. To chant >>>one of these mantras and=
 awaken the same needs initiation. This, >>>they said, is a part o=
f the >>>entire Chandi sadhana. What is your >>opinion on th=
is?>>><BR><BR>Broadly speaking most of the above is true from the =
traditional *Sakta* perspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as enjoined by Kali=
kula emphasises MANTRA sadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Mahatmyam text is =
not the same as Sri Sri Chandi sadhana, as per this view. It has various ma=
ntric nuances and practices including other mantras and bijas and ways to m=
ake them work. I will expand on this at the end of this post after addressi=
ng your other points.<BR><BR>>>>As a corollary to your
 above para=
graph, one can therefore read the >>>text of the Chandi in a poura=
nik approach, as a sacred myth? There >>>are people, specially in =
Bengal, who do a Chandipath on their own >>>without having undergo=
ne any formal initiation. How good or bad is >>>this practise?<BR>=
<BR>As always there will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the ve=
ry rigid traditional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme=
 based on one's personal affiliations, family and cultural influences. I wi=
ll speak for *myself*. I prefer the moderate view that is respectful to tra=
dition but does not allow tradition to be one more fetter. <BR><BR>Quite of=
ten many of our beliefs are fear-based rather than knowledge-based. However=
 undigested, unassimilated and unharmonised information gathered from the i=
nternet or even the print media is not knowledge. There is no need to be fe=
arful as long as one is not experimenting with
 mantramarga based on fragme=
nted information gathered from books or worse still the internet. As long a=
s one does the parayana along with other supportive practices such as kirta=
n, swadhyaya, reflection and bhakti bhava, initiation need not be a binding=
 factor. However if one wishes to do Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in a full-fledg=
ed manner as per the traditional Sakta perspective, better be initiated. If=
 one strongly wills it (sankalpa) and is suited to it, the external guru an=
d initiation will happen on their own accord. For the rest who are not pred=
ominantly suited to or inclined towards mantramarga, this discussion is not=
 relevant. <BR><BR>>>>There >>>are people, specially in B=
engal, who do a Chandipath on >>>their own >>>without hav=
ing undergone any formal initiation. How >>>good or bad is >>=
;>this practise?<BR><BR>Bengal is one of the areas of the subcontinent w=
here Kalikula flourished in a
 full-fledged manner at one time. So at the c=
ollective level Kalikula is deeply embedded in the collective unconscious a=
nd thereby the tendency to do Chandipath irrespective of initiation. To und=
ertand this one needs to appreciate the dynamics between Kundalini and *KUL=
A* KUNDALINII which are akin to the individual unconscious and collective u=
nconscious. If a particular family/significant member of the family has pra=
cticed the sadhana of a devata for sometime, the descendants automatically =
have its influence in their unconscious. That is why we are advised to wors=
hip the kuladevata along with ishta devata though ishta devata remains a ma=
jor focus. The same applies to parayana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbe=
d for the living and breathing tradition of Kalikula. Though we do not see =
its flowering at the same level or in the same form today, at the unseen an=
d unconscious collective level, the age-old Kalikula is very much alive and=
 breathing.
 <BR><BR>Spiritual life is all about Awareness and oversimplify=
ing it further, making the unconscious conscious is what Awareness is about=
. In true Advaitic fashion the collective and individual consciousness are =
not separate. The advent of Sri Ramakrishna is a predictable culmination of=
 the flowering of Kalikula at a collective level. His advent marks a major =
milestone in not just Kalikula sadhana but Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespecti=
ve of the physical death of Sri Ramakrishna, his satsangha is possible for =
all sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya of the Kathamrta is the easiest way t=
o revel in his Satsangha, it is possible to connect with him through a comb=
ination of trust (sraddha) and sense of belongingness too. If you consider =
him as your APTA, he automatically becomes your apta at a manasik level. Th=
is sense of belongingness straightaway opens the doors of your heart and ma=
kes his grace and protection possible. <BR><BR>In view of the above discuss=
ed
 factors, it might be okay to do Chandi parayana without initiation, in =
our times. Initiation could happen in the long run if it is meant to be. Ho=
wever traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath without initiation is unima=
ginable as Sri Sri Chandi's integrated sadhana includes various other mantr=
as and bijas that are generally not written in texts though some texts talk=
 about them without giving the complete details. Diksha includes all this a=
nd much more. Here a word on `diksha' itself is in order to clarify the dif=
ference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya parayana and initiated Sri Sri Ch=
andi sadhana. <BR><BR>Diksha differs in accordance with the sampradaya or t=
he lineage within Kalikula or Srikula. To understand `diksha' itself, one n=
eeds to examine certain differences (bhedas), of which the following are mo=
st important:<BR><BR>1. Guru Parampara: This forms the core of Devi Upasana=
 and the other bhedas (differences) are in a way based on
 this.<BR><BR>2. =
Sampradaya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily belong to one =
of the recognized sampradayas. <BR><BR>3. Diksha: Depending on the disciple=
's eligibility and the Guru's capability, the type of diksha too varies. <B=
R><BR>4. Yaga Bheda: There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, Ba=
hiryaga,Mahayaga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or more=
 of these paths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabilitie=
s) of the sadhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discuss=
ion. I have already expanded on this in another post on Yajna. <BR><BR>5. D=
evata Bheda: Though the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and vas=
ana of the initiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and th=
us the paths of Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. <BR><BR>6. =
Achara Bheda: Depending on the initiate's samskara and adhikara, broadly sp=
eaking there are seven acharas- Vedachara,
 Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, Daks=
hinachara, Vamachara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework=
 of Sakta sadhana, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaula=
chara. It is highly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara =
over the other. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the =
means of worship, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperame=
nts of the practitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana ar=
e equally respectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to t=
he practitioner and NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degr=
ade or criticize any path or deity. All upasanas lead to the Devi and all s=
adhakas have the Devi within them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga=
 or rupa of the Devi amounts to insulting the Devi Herself. As Sri Bhaskara=
raya observes with characteristic tolerance, "all vidyas are not different,=
 a comparison of one to another (in
 the texts) is merely for the sake of p=
raising and encouraging its performance". One could as well extend this tol=
erance (if not acceptance) to all forms of God and all paths of attaining H=
er/Him. In the ultimate reckoning, any division is relative as there is onl=
y the ONE. Advaita is the true essence of Sakta sadhana. All paths are prac=
tically along a *circular* continuum. An intellectual debate on the differe=
nces between various paths is irrelevant to sadhana itself though it has re=
levance to academicians or to the respective world-view of the sadhaka. Ins=
tead sadhakas should focus on the underlying unity of all paths and the ult=
imate Oneness of all forms of the Divine. This is a major tenet of Sakta sa=
dhana.<BR><BR>7. Mantra Bheda =E2=80=93 Based on certain factors including =
the sadhaka's adhikara bheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It i=
s not uncommon that the same sadhaka is initiated into various forms of the=
 mantra progressively in a gradual
 manner if he persists with commitment. =
For instance in Sri Vidya upasana the mantra of Sri has five variant versio=
ns- Bala, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para shodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala man=
tra is the entry level or preparatory level mantra for Sri Vidya. Likewise =
the navakshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN VARIANT versions, of which t=
he Navarna mantra that most written texts include is the mildest and akin t=
o the entry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. <BR><BR>The *details* o=
f the seven variant versions of the navakshari or the twelve different ways=
 of doing Sri Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our current discuss=
ion. Instead in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its central im=
portance in sadhana as per the Sakta world-view. <BR><BR>Finally a word on =
`Vak and `artha' too is in order here. It is true that one derives great be=
nefit by chanting a mantra in its original form. No doubt translation of a =
mantra is NOT the same as
 the mantra in its original form as `vak'. Undoub=
tedly `Sabda' comes first and then only the `artha' follows ("Artha Srishta=
eh Purvam Sabda srushtih"). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak' and =
`Artha' are interdependent and inseparable. I will elaborate on Sabda/Vak/A=
rtha in my next post along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin's commentary and th=
e importance accorded to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a mantra,=
 so much so that he even affirms that, "the mere utterance of sabda without=
 a knowledge of the true import bears no fruit, even as the offering thrown=
 over ashes in the absence of fire does not burst into flame". I will exami=
ne both sides of `sabda' and `artha' in my next post as and when I can. All=
 Indian traditions that explore `Vak' or `Sabda' agree that both are insepa=
rable. The very mention of the words `sabda' and `artha' brings to my mind =
the most beautiful mangala sloka from Kalidasa's `Raghuvamsa' wherein he co=
mpares the
 inseparable and interdependent nature of `Vak' and `Artha' to `=
Siva' and `Sakti' the parents of the entire universe =E2=80=A6.<BR><BR>vaga=
