Namaste friends,
 
There are deficiencies in the spiritual understanding of=
 many people in this age. That is the nature of this age. If you can transf=
orm someone, please do it. Otherwise, leave them alone to walk the path the=
y've chosen and mind your own sadhana.
 
It is not that I have a soft corne=
r or hard corner for someone. I simply do not want the list to waste its ti=
me and energy on unproductive discussions that spiral out of control. Pleas=
e remember that loko bhinnaruchih and that people with all kinds of vasanas=
 exist here!
 
The goal should not be to just speak truth. The goal should =
be to speak truth *purposefully*.
 
Relax guys. I've sit through many immat=
ure pravachans (discourses) of various kinds myself. It can be difficult to=
 tolerate what one sees as a clearly immature discourse. But then, what is =
sadhana for? Knowing when to act and when to keep quiet is a virtue. Unpurp=
oseful action wastes one's shakti.
 
Best regards
Narasimha

 Doing rituals for one's own upliftment is one thing and doing it for other=
s is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is f=
orced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else's dirty place=
 and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is no=
t protected, one may be affected.

ults of one's previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes =
out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may b=

deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good f=
ruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruit=
s are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected=
 by the spillage.

sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of =
today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start mes=

> > > > >
> > > > > Secondly, many priests=
 of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brah=
mana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahman=

any brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or=
 of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They =
are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on ear=
