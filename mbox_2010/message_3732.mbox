Dear Biswajit,
The following is repost of repost, where Guruji Manish Pandi=
t answered Why people should start with Ganapati Homam. See the mid section=
 highlighted which directly answer your questions.
------------------------=
------------------------------
I do not remember the exact source of this m=
essage but had in my hard disk so doing a reproduction from there.

Dear Na=
rasimha, Sanjay and others

Ganesha. Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudr=
a or Chandika or Mahakala.
In fact can anybody actually worship any deity.
=

1. The fact of the matter is that one's mind will be drawn to the worship =
of deities which one has worshipped in past lives.
2. But, whether one will=
 achive or not with that aspect of the divine is based on
a. What is the re=
sidue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera basically is responsibl=
e for this.One in a million
individuals will achieve the burning of the Kar=
ana Shareera. But when this is being done, then every karma done to that pe=
rson
to his body or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred times mor=
e intensity result, like for like.

b. What is the intensity of the desire =
of that person for the Divine Beloved?
Which again boils down to the amount=
 of karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas,=
 the lesser the desire to actually perform any kind of worship.

People tal=
k about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.
I find that it simply does not =
matter.
Every mantra is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).
So, when=
 the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.
Where is the rupa forming?
In =
the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.
So the deity will actually =
occupy the person.
But when can this happen?
Only when the body is dead. No=
t dead physically, but in a different sense.
ie. ASANA: the mind forgets th=
e body exists after a few hours of sitting really still for a few hours a d=
ay.
Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and feels it is alive, it tr=
ies to still the breath.
Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the mind, r=
emember the body is dead for the mind at this stage.
Dharana: The mind perc=
ieves that form of God which is the object of the consciousness, but dualit=
y exists.
Pratyahara: a phenomenon where the eyes do not see, the ears do n=
ot hear.
Samadhi: the rupa is so well established, that the ultimate form o=
f that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.

So the emptiness must com=
e about in the mind and body about one's own identity before God fills it u=
p with His form.
So, mantra is simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybod=
y can do mantras, but most people's internal fire or Agni is
not really cha=
rged up to digest these.
Japa is no doubt great, but it is involved with th=
e purification of air, whereas fire is involved in the purification of inte=
rnal fire.
When internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise yo=
ur deity becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Ag=
ni is a living God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes=
.
It moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it conti=
nues to live on within the sadhaka.
In Kali Yuga, this ability to call a li=
ving God into the house is so powerful and so exhalting that later on japa =
after homam
brings very fast results.
*******************************
Why G=
anesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in any case are not desti=
ned to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they will pursue some=
 sadhana is if they are given some material result quite quickly by their s=
adhana.
Those who have problems in career, litigation, problems with marria=
ge or in finding life partner, problems with education or speech can really=
 advance their mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.
I have seen this nu=
merous times myself with people who are in this movement and outside.
That =
is not to say that Ganapati can't give Mukti. The ultimate form of Ganapati=
 is the word of God.
And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.
**********=
**************************
The mahamantras are many and I agree that some m=
ay say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.
BUT,
The Vedic mahamantras req=
uire the kind of intonation so perfect with visualisation at different bits=
 of the body with various syllables, that for most people this is not feasi=
ble, especially since their Sanskrit itself is somewhat imperfect.(remember=
 name is form, if name is not repeated properly then how will the form be?)=
(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for rakshati in Pune many years=
 ago).
And then there are mahamantras which are ok with almost any intonati=
on. If someone wants to follow this that is also ok.
But, with any mantra s=
adhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, the entrance to Shakti at Sus=
humna is guarded by Him.

Again some doubt comes into people's heads about =
some mantras harming them when recited:
If somebody experiences bad things =
when a mantra of a certain deity is recited then all it means is that the k=
armas of the Karana shareera are being dealt with(by the deity) quite fast,=
 so they have to be experienced. It actually means that the Devata is close=
 and more intense sadhana is needed.

Actually, all this business about man=
tra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.
Us pa=
rvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.

NAMASKAR

Dear Gurujis,

I have =
started MAHAGANAPATI HOMAM, though started with super-short procedure, now =
I am including more rituals and sanskrit verse from the short procedure eve=
ntually.. .

Now I am asking some bare minimum questions...

1. What is the=
 sign that my Ganapati Homam are successful or not?

2. Is it possible to i=
nclude more verse for prosperity and peace? (as my family life in trouble) =
if yes, please suggest.

best regards,
Biswajit
