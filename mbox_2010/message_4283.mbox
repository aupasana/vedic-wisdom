Dear Narasimha Garu,

Nice to see your caring and eloborated mail.

Bhagava=
n Ramana Maharshi always says Advaita should be in bhava only.

Below are f=
ew imp talks of ramana maharshi regarding advaita and dvaita.

Dvaita and A=
dvaita are relative terms. They are based on the sense of
duality. The Self=
 is as It is. There is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM
THAT I AM. Simple B=
e-ing is the Self.(Talks, 433).

Those who do not know themselves to be the=
 one (non-dual) Self will perish
daily, vainly suffering in fear (because o=
f seeing the world as something
other than themselves). (Therefore) destroy=
ing the notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99,
the root (of all misery), b=
y gaining the firm knowledge of your real Self,
attain the state of non-dua=
lity (advaita).   ( GVK - 955)

Advaita should be in bhava, in the disposit=
ion of the mind; it will not do
for outside, worldly affairs. You are asked=
 to look at everything with
equality (sama drishti) but can we eat the same=
 food that a dog eats? A
handful of grain will do for a bird but will that =
do for us? We eat a
certain quantity of food but will that be enough for an=
 elephant? So you
should have the attitude of Advaita only in bhava, in the=
 mind, but you
should follow the world in other matters.  - Letter 41

It is certainl=
y wise to "remain without fear in the supreme state of non-duality&quo=
t;. However, as you pointed out, "[even] great devas are disturbed by =
fear". Then how easy can it be for other beings, including members of =
this list, to "remain without fear in the supreme state of non-duality=
"?<br>


<br>
Please don't get me wrong. I am not against adwaita =
or non-duality at all, as those familiar with my writings should know by no=
w. But I accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual seekers are mean=
t to remain in duality for many many more lives. A message other than "=
;attain the supreme state of non-duality" may be more useful to them a=
t their current stage!<br>

A great cricket batsman may not make the greate=
st coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him and he may simply say, &=
quot;look at the ball and hit it." That much instruction is certainly =
not enough for a budding player to start playing like that great player.<br=

<br>
Another gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of the bu=
dding player and give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful than t=
he inspiring words from the great player! Of course, no matter how good ins=
tructions one gets, the budding player may not play like that great player =
anytime soon! Nevertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!<br>

Some=
 great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philosophy, are like the great c=
ricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you what is obvious and natu=
ral to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.<br>
<br>
Some other teachers=
 fine-tune their message for an audience. They show a real path (instead of=
 a lofty target) using which one can start making progress. One may or may =
not reach a supreme state anytime soon, but one will start making progress.=

Different spiritual teachers come for different purposes. The role pl=
ayed by each one is important in its own right. Ramana maharshi was undoubt=
edly a great master. However, when it comes to the second category of teach=
ers I mentioned above, one name that strikes to me instantly is that of Ram=
akrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master at fine-tuning his message for the in=
dividual. While most great masters were adepts in one path (jnaana yoga or =
bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga), he was unique in that he experienc=
ed the supreme through each path and was equally comfortable guiding people=
 in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Krishna bhakti, Kaali bhakti, Shiva bhak=
ti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, tantra etc, having experienced all. He=
 even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic sadhanas and experienced Jesus Christ.=
 He is a unique teacher in the last few millennia. Many other masters take =
disciples on the path they walked. Having walked all paths to the summit, R=
amakrishna guided disciples on different paths based on their aptitude.<br>=

Though upanishads and Bhagavad Gita are teaching Adwaita clearly, some gr=
eat masters came in the last few millennia who taught variations in the Upa=
nishadic philosophy veering towards duality to various degrees. I think thi=
s happened for a purpose. As true Adwaita as taught by Upanishads and Bhaga=
vad Gita becomes more and more inappropriate and difficult for the masses, =
a simpler message that they can understand and that can guide their spiritu=
al lives is needed. I think the coming of various masters who taught differ=
ent philosophies is for that reason.<br>

The title of the mail was "=
Fearlessness Comes In The Supreme State Of Non-duality". However, the =
question is: Does non-duality bring fearlessness or vice versa?<br>
<br>
A =
realization of non-dual Self may suddenly happen oneday for some rare perso=
ns. For most, it happens as a result of sadhana done over many years/lives.=
 Thus, qualities like dispassion, fearlessness (which are associated with t=
he supreme state) need to be cultivated actively. As they become more and m=
ore perfected, one gets closer and closer to Self-realization.<br>


<br>
S=
uppose one sees a beautiful/ugly object (or a desirable/undesirable object)=
. When one feels attraction/aversion, one should remind oneself "all i=
s god (Self). There is no need for feeling attraction/aversion towards anyt=
hing." When one feels fear, one should remind oneself "all is god=
 (Self). There is no need for be afraid of *anything*". As one practic=
es this, one's dispassion and fearlessness increase. Incidents of delus=
ion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, one overcomes.<br>


<br=
>
But the tricky part is that one needs to perform the actions one is meant=
 to perform and work out the kaarmik debts, before one realizes Self. It is=
 very difficult to perform actions without feeling even small amounts of at=
tachment, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.<br>


<br>
A simple form=
ula is: Give all you can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you get) i=
n return. In the beginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you feel s=
hould be with regard to what are giving to others and not with regard to wh=
at you are expecting from others.<br>

It is all easy to write and read the=
ory. The problem comes when one is tested in real life. For example, I chok=
ed when eating something once when I was alone and could not breathe. I bec=
ame anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the thought came to me "wh=
at are you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in a little suffering =
for a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results in death, what is t=
he big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who is born is sure of de=
atth). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not do? Well, there may b=
e, but someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimha do it? World will =
run perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed die now, why don'=
t I meditate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing on my life and g=
etting anxious?" I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes with Gayatr=
i mantra. My anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.<br>


<br>
As=
 one detects and actively suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, su=
ch thoughts will become less and less frequent and eventually be suppressed=
 by the mind even in the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those seeds=
 themselves will be wiped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how cond=
itioning of the mind is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process for=
 most of us, but one loses nothing by starting and trying to make progress.=
 Sadhanas like homam and japam aid one in this.<br>


<br>
Please note that=
 even Ramana maharshi and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for m=
any years, before they could reach the supreme state. No matter who you are=
, some sadhana is needed.<br>

While on the topic of Adwaita, I want to mak=
e one more point. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Reality is indee=
d non-dual, *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy can make one *=
trivialize* duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on the other extr=
eme. Let me explain.<br>


<br>
Reading that the ultimate reality behind al=
l that we see is the non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the dual=
ity that we normally experience. If duality is "mithya" (an illus=
ion), how does it matter and how do our actions within it matter? It is all=
, after all, an illusion.<br>


<br>
Of course, a true student of vedanta w=
ill know that the layer of illusion is quite important and cannot be ignore=
d simply because it is an "illusion". If one's consciousness =
is veiled by the layer of illusion, actions within that layer of illusion a=
re required for removing it. It will not magically disappear. After all, yo=
ga vaasishtham emphasizes "actions" in the dual world for realizi=
ng non-dual Self. Action and knowledge as the two wings with which the bird=
 of individualized consciousness rises from the ground of duality to reach =
the sky of true Self.<br>


<br>
On the other extreme,<br>
<br>
* =C2=A0 =
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*<br>
<br>
Enough for now.=
 I have not gone anywhere and still reading the list regularly. But I did n=
ot have motivation to reply to any recent mails. Basically, if I have no us=
eful or meaningful comment/reply, I keep quiet.<br>
<br>
Intellectual excha=
nges are interesting, but the thing that matters at the end of the day is w=
hether we are doing sincere sadhana or not and whether we are progressing o=
r not. It seems to me like several people are sincerely doing homam/japam a=
nd sincerely trying to make progress. Several more people are about to do t=
he same. THAT is what really matters. What we think or say about the world,=
 duality and non-duality is irrelevant really. What matters is whether our =
attitude is changing for the better.<br>

<br>
Let me give one more quick analo=
gy before I stop for now.<br>
<br>
Suppose one is sleeping and seeing an el=
aborate dream. Suppose one is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pa=
in when something bad happens in the dream and laughing in elation when som=
ething good happens in the dream. One can tell that it is bad.<br>


<br>
S=
uppose another person has read *in the dream* that what one is experiencing=
 is called a "dream" and will end soon and what happens in the dr=
eam is irrelevant. Suppose one intellectually understands all that and yet =
weeps in pain when something bad happens in the dream and laughs in elation=
 when something good happens in the dream. Is that any better? Of course no=
t.<br>


<br>
On the other hand, if one is slowly getting control over the =
mind and not weeping as often and not laughing as often, one is perhaps mak=
ing progress.<br>
<br>
* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =
=C2=A0*<br>
<br>
Do whatever your conscience tells you to do. But expect no=
thing in return and accept whatever comes to you as a result. As your accep=
tance increases, the clarity with which your conscience shows you the path =
you should take (with regard to your actions) will become better and better=
. If your actions were bad in the past (due to unclear guidelines from cons=
cience or not following your conscience) and you are receiving bad fruits, =
you can still overcome it by learning to accept what comes. As your accepta=
nce is perfected, your conscience and will power will become pure and your =
actions will become pure. As actions become pure, newer fruits will be pure=
. Eventually, you start making progress.<br>
