 Swami Sambuddananada of Sri Ramakrishna Mission said:

"I want to hear fro=
m Bhagavan Ramana's own lips, His own experience of Self
Realization. Such =
beings are walking Upanishads."

Bhagavan said: "You say you think, I have =
attained Self Realization. I must
know what you mean by Self Realization.Wh=
at idea do you have in your mind
about it?"

The Swami was not pleased with=
 this counter-question. He added after some
time: "I mean the Atma merging =
in the Paramatman."

Bhagavan Ramana said: "We do not know about the Parama=
tman or the Universal
Soul, etc.,We know we exist.Nobody doubts he exists, =
though he may doubt the
existence of God. So, if one finds out about the tr=
uth or source of
oneself,that is all what is required."

The Swami thereupo=
n said: "Bhagavan says 'Know Thyself'.

Bhagavan Ramana said:

"Even that i=
s not correct. For if we talk of knowing the Self,there must be
two Selves,=
 one a knowing Self and the other which is known,and the process
of knowing=
. The state we call Realization is simply being oneself,not
knowing anythin=
g,not becoming anything.If one has realized, he is that which
which alone i=
s and which alone has always been.He cannot describe that.Of
course,we loos=
ely talk of Self Realization,for want of better term.How to
"realize" or ma=
ke Real that which alone is Real? What we are all doing
is,realized or rega=
rd as real that which is not real.

This habit of ours has to be given up.A=
ll Sadhana under all systems of
thought
is meant only for this end.When we =
give up regarding the unreal as real,
then the reality alone will remain an=
d we will be that."
