Why Creation?

"What is the purpose of life? Why did God put us here?" Thes=
e
questions keep
coming up, again and again. Perhaps, you want to find God =
and hang him!
Fundamentally, what you are asking is: why creation?
When it =
comes to creation, you never ask why, because you are just a
tiny speck in
=
this creation. As a human being, in terms of family, your social
structures=
, your
financial securities, education, qualifications and positions that y=
ou
have taken in
the society, I know you slowly started assuming that you a=
re the center
of the
universe=97but you are just a tiny speck in the existe=
nce! Tomorrow,
if you
disappear, nobody will miss you.
So, this tiny speck =
asking the question, `Why creation,' does
not make sense
because the questi=
on doesn't come from the right context. This
question comes up
because the =
experience of life has not become blissful. The struggles,
the pain of
exis=
ting, are there.
You might have created so many comforts, so much security,=
 but still the
inherent
struggle and pain, the day-to-day tensions are ther=
e. You have to drag
your feet
and do many things, isn't it? You fill yourse=
lf with enthusiasm; you
find new reasons
for yourself to do this and that. =
But somewhere inside there is
something which
constantly struggles in every=
 human being, unless he attains to certain
inner grace.
Some people have be=
come aware of it; most people are yet to even become
aware
of it. They just=
 keep themselves busy, never to face the inner struggle.
The reason why peo=
ple are keeping themselves so busy, keeping themselves
so
entangled with li=
fe is not because they have fallen in love with life.
It is just to avoid
t=
he inner struggle. Many of them, if they don't get married, if they
don't p=
roduce
children, if they don't start businesses and don't get into all
the =
mess that they are
getting into on a day-to-day basis, they would be lost w=
ithin
themselves.
Just to keep a certain semblance of sanity, they keep all=
 this activity
going. If they
just sit quietly for two days in one place, t=
hey will become aware of
the inner
struggle that is there in every being tr=
apped in this limited body. Once
they become
aware, they start looking. Tha=
t is when we say somebody is on the
spiritual path,
because he has become a=
ware of the inner struggle.
The Yoga Sutras are a tremendous document about=
 life, but they start in
a strange
way. The first sutra is half a sentence.=
 Patanjali starts the yoga sutra
like this: And
now: yoga. This simply mean=
s that you have seen everything in your
life=97either by
yourself, or throu=
gh somebody else's life. You saw money, you saw
power, you saw
pleasure, yo=
u saw wealth=97everything. But still there is an inner
struggle. Once you
h=
ave seen this? And now: yoga.
If you have not seen it, if you still believe=
 that, "if I get a few
more bucks everything
will be okay; if I build a new=
 house everything will be okay"=97if
you are still in that
childish state t=
hen it's not time for yoga yet.
So the question comes up because there is a=
n inner struggle. Maybe you
are not
hundred percent aware of the struggle, =
but here and there it touches
you. So now,
the more intelligent question fo=
r you would be: How do I get beyond this
struggling
state? If you ask how, =
I have a way. If you ask why, then I have to tell
you a story.
If you want,=
 I can tell you a story: one day, God had nothing to do and
he was
playing =
marbles. And one marble fell this way and it became planet
Earth. Another
o=
ne shot up and it became the Sun?. I can go on like this. Now you
won't bel=
ieve
this ridiculous story. But if I make the story more elaborate, and if
=
the story were
told a thousand years ago, you would believe it. You have a =
problem
about this,
isn't it? You don't believe anything that happens today=
, but you
will believe it after a
thousand years. It doesn't matter what it=
 is.
But whether you believe it or not, stories don't liberate you. So
when=
 it comes to
existence, don't waste your life asking the question, `why?'
B=
ecause if you sit here
for the rest of your life and go on thinking `why,' =
or consult
every other man on this
planet, all you will get is more and mor=
e fairy tales. You will not get
a solution.
Different cultures will tell di=
fferent stories; different religions will
tell different stories;
every ind=
ividual can create his own story. Stories will not liberate
you. But if you=
 ask
`how,' then we open up the path, we give you the method.
Don't ask why=
.
