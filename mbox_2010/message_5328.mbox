Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Shakti (Re: Success w=
ith Mantras)

   
Namaskar,
The aim of my mails is only to free the minds o=
f the reader from biases, caused 
by dominating propaganda of Vedantists - =
that is to see the Physical body as 
something to be ignored for spiritual =
pursuit.  Consequently, Vedantists 
themselves never found out the truth ab=
out the Physical body consciousness as an 
expression of divine consciousne=
ss. The Bhagavad Gita, is a text, not from a 
Vedic Rishi, but a Vedantist =
Vishnu Avatara.
There is a need to bring the Vedas to the mass consciousnes=
s, to uplift the 
Physical consciousness from where it is now.

Rishis woul=
dn't put the method for divinizing the Physical body in plaintext, to 
disa=
llow its misuse. It is for the persevering soul to find it out for himself =

or through the upliftment of mass consciousness through Vedas.

Why Vedic =
Rishis wouldn't do it themselves, or if they did it, nobody would 
know, bu=
t they didn't live in Kaliyuga when the Physical body consciousness is 
lar=
gely in focus, and therefore the need to divinize it as well. Truth, howeve=
r, 
is not limited to the Yuga when it is perceived, and is equally applica=
ble to 
all Yugas and Veda is that Truth.

> Because if one is immortal in =
the physical body, one must survive in it till 
>the end of creation.
OTOH,=
 a soul liberated in Physical body, is no longer bound by the rules of 
cre=
ation as applicable to mortal beings, who have to die despite all the jnana=
 
they attain.

regards,
Aryama
