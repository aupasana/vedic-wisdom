Namaste Girish,



You are right. 'Paathaantara' means versions. If you ar=
e reading Chandi
Paath from 'Gita press' then you can recite the words whic=
h are written
in the main chapters and not the one in 'Foot notes'. some wo=
rds are
diferent in different authentic books.



However, please note that=
 the words given as versions at the bottom are
also valid one and can be us=
ed as original ones. It all depends upon how
your prior familiarity. For ex=
ample - In Maharashtra, people pronounce
"Sarva Mangala MAANGALYE...." and =
not Mangalye. If you see in CP by Gita
press, they have given "Mangalye" in=
 orginal text where as "Maangalye"
is given as Paathaantara.



Another exa=
mple - Narasimha recites "Mamatvaakrushta Maanasah..." where
as i recite "M=
amatvaakrushta Chetanah" - 'Maanasah' is Given as
Paathantara in Gita Press=
 book.



Hope it's clear.



Best Regards,



Utpal
