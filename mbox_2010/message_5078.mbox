Namaste,

Can someone kindly=C2=A0explain what kind of samadhi does the fol=
lowing spiritual 
experience denote, (quoted from Vimalanada's statement in=
 the Aghora book)?

"All these swamis talk about samadhi as the highest goa=
l, but I think they are 
fools. What is the use of these spurting samadhis,=
 anyway? Fine you go off into 
a trance, but when you drop back down to ear=
th, you are just as you were before. 
That sort of samadhi is always sepera=
te from the normal waking 'you'. I think it 
is much better to retain consc=
iousness on this plane even while you shift your 
main focus to other reali=
ties. Here I am playing chess with you, but as I play I 
can go to America =
to check how your parents are doing, or I can visit Patala 
(the underworld=
), or the planet Venus, or my Guru Maharaj, or whatever I please, 
and stil=
l sit here acting as if I know nothing. 

=C2=A0
To be truly aware you have=
 to know what is happening far away today, what had 
happened here long ago=
, and what is going to happen anywhere in the cosmos 
during=C2=A0 the comi=
ng decades. But all the while you continue to function 
effectively in this=
 time, space and causality. Awareness on all levels at all 
times - THAT so=
rt of enlightenment has some use." - (Vimalananda) Aghora III The 
law of K=
arma."
=C2=A0
-Regards

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

You are not incorrect, b=
ut not fully correct. Moreover, it is tough to capture 
some of these ideas=
 in words, as words convey slightly different meaning to 
different people,=
 based on their life experiences and predispositions.

Yes, there is no for=
mula that ensures self-realization in a certain amount of 
time and it come=
s to one through the grace of God. However, grace of God does 
not come to =
just about anyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to receive it. 
One beco=
mes ready to receive it, through the effort put in this life and all 
previ=
ous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. So effort and sadhana 
=
are not useless. The effort we are talking about here is not effort to acqu=
ire 
something, but effort to give up something.

Though it is not incorrec=
t, the view that things are given only by God's grace 
can, when misunderst=
ood, promote inaction. God's grace does not come to a lazy 
person doing no=
thing and waiting for God's grace. God's grace does not work 
arbitrarily. =
God's grace comes to one who has perfect surrender to God. Perfect 
surrend=
er does not come automatically. Though effort and sadhana do not 
guarantee=
 perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, they do bring it 
eventuall=
y.

* * *

> whatever one does it is based on past karmas only

Fruits of p=
ast karmas decide one's current situation and constrain one's current 
karm=
as (actions). But they do not completely decide one's current karmas. One's=
 
current karma is in one's hands (within the constraints).

Of course, one=
 can ask: Does one have a free will that acts or does an 
all-pervading sha=
kti act through one? I am quoting a small portion from 
vedic-wisdom messag=
e 5009 
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:

A=
ll pervading shakti works through all of us and expresses through all of ou=
r 
desires, actions and knowledge. But then, some universal rules of action=
 and 
reaction govern how this works. Under the push of one's own previous =
karmas, one 
is placed in situations that are conducive to certain desires,=
 actions and 
awareness. The current karmas in those situations may further=
 modify the 
momentum of the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though =
one's current 
desires, actions and awareness are actually the work of the =
all pervading 
shakti, they are also one's work in a way. It depends on how=
 we look at it and 
how we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ga=
nges water in a small 
cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges=
 water in a cup in freezing 
weather are all Ganges water, they are differe=
nt too. One is more, one is less, 
one is warm and one is icy. Similarly, t=
he work of all pervading shakti is
different when expressed through differe=
nt vessels (people) in different 
situations.

As long as one actually feel=
s internally (despite what one may say or pretend 
externally) that one's d=
esires, actions and knowledge are one's own, one is 
performing karmas and =
is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only when the
realization that=
 it is all the work of the all pervading shakti becomes full and 
completel=
y internalized, does one become free from the cycle of actions and 
reactio=
ns. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one to give appropriate 
=
reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.

* * *

In astrological =
terms, horoscope is the sum total of previous karmas, whose 
fruits one wil=
l have to face. They show the circumstances faced by one. They do 
not and =
cannot determine what actions one engages in, though certain actions are 
m=
ore likely in certain circumstances.

Destiny is the sum total of the react=
ions to the actions committed by one's free 
will. Today's actions of free =
will become destiny tomorrow (i.e. on a future 
date or in a future life).

>> Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: what does PURITY Mean<BR>> <BR>> Na=
maste,<BR>> <BR>> I will give my 2 cents of free-wheeling comments in=
 this area.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Rules may have exceptio=
ns, but they are meant for general guidance.<BR>> <BR>> Ramakrishna P=
aramahamsa and his disciples such as Swami Adbhutananda, Swami
 Vivekananda=
 etc ate fish and yet achieved samadhi of various types. However, we cannot=
 compare ourselves with special beings and we should follow rules and auste=
rities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may score a century with a terrible=
 backache, but we should not walk out to bat with a backache and should try=
 to be healthy. After all, we may not be able to score runs well even when =
in perfect health!<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> By the way, it m=
ust be realized that external rules are only meant as a *catalyst* in enabl=
ing internal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - meditation, japam, h=
omam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal transformation. If the in=
ternal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet to work.<BR>> <BR=
>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> If a room has a window outside of which there =
is heavy wind that is constantly blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweep=
ing the room with a broom does not eliminate dirt. First
 close the window =
or stop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaama is not enough to purify the nadis=
 and give mental purity, if mind (room) is attached to the objects perceive=
d by senses (window).<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> If one reads =
scriptures and teachings of saints, contemplates on them, constantly analyz=
es inner motives behind various actions by oneself and tries to change one'=
s own thinking slowly, this process of contemplation and introspection will=
 augment one's external sadhana (such as meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, =
service etc) and purifies one faster.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kund=
alini and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to either =
block Kundalini from rising or from reaching the highest it can.<BR>> <B=
R>> Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of one's own self-awareness=
. Though one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one
 is "aware" of a limited o=
bject in the field of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as "self". That is=
 why Kundalini shakti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti)=
. This self-awareness is normally "sleeping", i.e. one assumes that one is =
so and so person and so and so body without questioning "who am I". That is=
 why Kundalini is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or ph=
ysical realm). As Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras (other lokas=
 or realms of awareness), one's understanding of who one is gets refined. W=
hen Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Self.<BR>> <BR>>=
; If one thinks "I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so and so p=
oint in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this body", it =
will focus and limit one's self-awareness to the *physical body* and hence =
one's Kundalini will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, o=
ne needs to completely forget about the
 physical body and stop thinking in=
 terms of it.<BR>> <BR>> By the way, *very few* people actually exper=
ience Kundalini in higher chakras, though many talk about it. Kundalini is =
in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even a=
dvanced and awakened ones. When praana vaayu flows in some higher chakras, =
that too can result in a powerful experience. Some may mistaken it for Kund=
alini.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> If you want a good score in =
the examination, study well. Stop thinking too much about (and anticipating=
) the examination and focus on the subject instead. Study, study, study. Si=
milarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chakras, forget about the bod=
y even. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read scriptures and teaching=
s of great saints. Instead of looking externally and judging others, observ=
e your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is driving them and conscious=
ly try to eliminate wrong motives
 that stem from false ego, adharma and ar=
ishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), i.e. put to=
 use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, Kunda=
lini will rise automatically.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasi=
