 Reality in Forty Verses: Supplement

Invocation

That which is the Support=
, the Soul, the Source, the Purpose and the Power
of all this world, the Re=
ality behind all this Appearance, That indeed
exists. Let That, the Truth, =
abide in our Heart. (Yoga Vasishta, 8, v.12)

The Text

1. In the company o=
f sages, attachment vanishes; and with attachment,
illusion. Freed from ill=
usion, one attains stability, and thence liberation
while yet alive. Seek t=
herefore the company of sages. (from Bhajagovindam,
the =E2=80=9CMohamudaga=
ram Hymn,=E2=80=9D by Shankaracharya)

2. Not by listening to preachers, no=
r by study of books,not by meritorious
deeds nor by any other means can one=
 attain that Supreme State, which is
attainable only through association wi=
th the sages and the clear quest of
the Self.(a verse from the Yoga Vasisht=
a, 5 - 12 - v.17)

3. When one has learned to love the company of sages,whe=
refore all these
rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool southern breeze=
 is blowing, what
need is there for a fan? (a verse from the Yoga Vasishta)=


4. Fever is overcome by the cool light of the moon;want, by the good
wish=
-yielding tree; and sin by the Holy Ganges. Those three =E2=80=94 fever and=
 want
and sin =E2=80=94 all flee at
the august sight of the peerless sage. =
(Subhashita Ratna Bhandargara, chapt.
3, v. 6)

5. Holy rivers, which are o=
nly water, and idols, which are made of stone and
clay, are not as mighty a=
s the sages.For while they make one pure in course
of countless days, the s=
age=E2=80=99s eyes by a mere glance purify at once. (from
Srimad Bhagavatam=
, chapt. 48, v. 31, tenth canto)

6. Disciple: Who is God?
Master: He who k=
nows the mind.
D: My Self, the Spirit, knows my mind.
M: Therefore you are =
God; and also the sruti declares
that there is only one God, the Knower.

7=
. M: By what light do you see?
D: The sun by day, the lamp by night.
M: By =
what light do you see these lights?
D: The eye.
M: By what light do you see=
 the eye?
D: The mind.
M: By what light do you know the mind?
D: My Self.
M=
: You then are the Light of Lights.
D: Yes, That I am.
(from Ekasloki, by S=
hankaracharya)

8. In the centre of the Heart-Cave there shines alone the o=
ne Brahman as the
=E2=80=98I, I=E2=80=99, the Atman. Reach the Heart by div=
ing deep in quest of the Self, or
by controlling the mind with the breath, =
and stay established in the Atman.

9. In the lotus of the Heart is pure an=
d changeless Consciousness in the
form of the Self. When the ego is removed=
, this Consciousness of Self
bestows liberation
of soul. (Devikalottaram, v=
. 46)

10. The body is like an earthen pot, inert. Because it has no consci=
ousness
of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, and because daily in bodiless sleep we touc=
h our real nature, the
body is not =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Then who is this =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99? Where is this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99? In the Heart-cave
o=
f those that question thus,there shineth forth as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, Hims=
elf, the Lord
Siva of Arunachala.

11. Who is born? It is only he who asks =
=E2=80=98Whence am I born?=E2=80=99 that is truly
born in Brahman, the Prim=
e Source. He indeed is born eternally; He is the
Lord of saints; He is the =
ever-new. (On celebrating Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s jayanti))

12. Cast off th=
e notion, =E2=80=98This vile flesh am I,=E2=80=99 and seek the ceaseless
bl=
iss of Self. To seek the Self while cherishing this perishing flesh is
like=
 trying to cross a stream by clinging to a crocodile.

13. The way of chari=
ty, penance, sacrifice, dharma, yoga and bhakti; and the
Goal of Heaven, Re=
ality, Peace, Truth,Grace, Silence, Stability, Deathless
Death, Knowledge,
=
Renunciation, Liberation, Bliss =E2=80=94 all this is only ceasing to think=
 that the
body is the Self.

14. What is action, or devotion, or union, or =
knowledge? It is to inquire,
=E2=80=98Whose is this action, or indifference=
, or separateness, or ignorance?=E2=80=99
Inquiring thus, the ego vanishes.=
To abide as the Self, wherein these eight
have never been, this is True exi=
stence.

15. Not realizing that they themselves are moved by an energy not =
their own,
some fools are busy seeking miraculous powers. Their antics are =
like the
boasting of a cripple who says to his friends: =E2=80=98If you rai=
se me to my feet,
these enemies are nothing before me.=E2=80=99

16. Since =
the stilling of the mind is true liberation and miraculous powers
are unatt=
ainable without an act of the mind,how can they whose mind is set
on such p=
owers enter the bliss of liberation which is the ending of all
activity of =
the mind?

17. While God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego=
 assumes its
burden, grimacing like an image on a tower, seeming to support=
 it. If the
traveller in a carriage,which can carry any weight, does not la=
y his luggage
down but carries it painfully on his head, whose is the fault=
?

18. Between the two paps, below the chest, above the stomach, there are =
six
organs of various colours. Of these,one, looking like a lily bud, is th=
e
Heart, at two digits=E2=80=99 distance to the right of the centre. (from =
Ashtanga
Hridayam,Malayalam)

19. Its mouth is closed. Within its cavity is=
 seated a heavy darkness,
filled with all desires; all the great nerves are=
 centred there; the home it
is of breath, mind, light of knowledge. (from A=
shtanga Hridayam, Malayalam)
