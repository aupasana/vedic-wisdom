Namaste Girish,
 
I am glad you started Chandi homam. Keep doing it as regularly as you can. It can only purify your consciousness further and further as you do it more and more.
 
As far as "experiences" are concerned, different people will have different experiences. Some people with more intuitive and imaginative minds may have visions. Some people with more logical and rational minds may experience a clarity of mind. But, overall, anyone doing homam on a regular basis will start to love fire, identify with fire, experience some kind of calmness, bliss and vitality when with fire. The specific experiences and visions are not worth bothering much about.
 
One person driving a hillside road may see beautiful scenery on the way. He may be charmed by it, keep watching, get stuck there and not reach the top of the hill. Another person driving the road on the other side of the hill may not see any scenery, but keep driving and reach the top of the hill and enjoy a perfect view of everything from there.
 
Similarly, someone having visions and experiences may become either egoistic or attached and get stuck. Someone having no experiences whatsoever may keep doing sadhana and oneday become self-realized.
 
Like a mother serves each child what is good for him/her, Devi can give experiences to some people in order to reinforce their faith. But pay little attention to such experiences and keep doing sadhana. THAT is the key.
 
Hari's words are wise. It is a good idea to keep one's experiences to oneself. Of course, as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said on another occasion, one having climbed a wall and seen a beautiful heavenly place on the other hand, may want to come back and tell others about it. If everyone who climbs the wall jumps on the other side and settles down there, how will other people know about it? So some people need to do that job (of coming back into the village and telling people). But realize that one who does that job stands the chance of getting stuck and never going back there. Secondly, one should consider talking about one's experiences to others only after making some progress. Third, one should ensure that none of one's experiences cause pride in some way or the other.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
