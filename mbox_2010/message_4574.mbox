 When I returned to my ashram in July 1940, the Second World War had alread=
y
broken out, and darkness had fallen on the hearts and minds of men. Bombs=

had dropped on Warsaw like rain. Poland and Czechoslovakia had been subdue=
d.
Many millions of innocent men, women, and children, had been driven to
c=
oncentration camps for a dread purpose. The Maginot Line had cracked and
cr=
umbled, and Paris had fallen to the mighty army of the invader.

I had expe=
cted to see some marks of this widespread devastation on the life
of Ramana=
shram, but on arrival I found none whatever, except, to my
surprise, a doub=
led rate of flow of devotees.

The only other physical change I observed wa=
s in the Master=E2=80=99s body, which
started showing signs of age, which h=
ad compelled the management to curtail
the attendance hours at night. At mi=
dday the doors of the hall were closed
for two hours for his siesta =E2=80=
=93 the first time in the history of the Ashram.
At first Bhagavan demurred=
 but soon he grew resigned to the situation,
seeing that it had some justif=
ication.

The stream of visitors continued to increase, so that soon afterw=
ards
sitting accommodation and easy access to the Master on personal matter=
s
became difficult.


In fact under the new rules, letters and articles wri=
tten by devotees were
made first to pass the censorship of the office befor=
e they could be shown
to him, which was not without reasons. One or two dev=
otees, taking advantage
of the Master=E2=80=99s compassionate nature, took =
to write to him letters running
to several pages in very small hand on pett=
y, often imaginary,difficulties
in their spiritual practice, on which he st=
rained his eyes for one or two
hours. He was too scrupulous to let a single=
 word go unread, which
encouraged them to write still longer letters and da=
ily too, imagining their
epistles to be of great interest to Bhagavan till =
the management found it
imperative to clamp down a ban on all correspondenc=
e to be shown or written
to him.

A year or two later a colony of devotees,=
 with families for the most parts,
sprang up round the Ashram. As Bhagavan=
=E2=80=99s body grew weaker, his power to
influence and attract increased,s=
o that the tide of settlers and visitors
continued steadily to rise and inc=
luded world-famed philosophers, scholars,
politicians,ministers, provincial=
 governors, generals, foreign
diplomats,members of foreign missions. They a=
ll came, whether in war or
peace, in rain or shine. The tide swelled and sw=
elled and reached its zenith
in 1950, the last year of his earthly life. Ti=
ll the last the Master
continued to instruct. In the whole history of the A=
shram there has never
been a bar to the seeking of spiritual guidance orall=
y from him, except in
the very last year when he was seriously laid up and =
the visitors of their
own accord desisted from troubling him.
