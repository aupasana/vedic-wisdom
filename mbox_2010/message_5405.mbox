Namaste

I fe=
lt like sharing one incident from the life of Swami Vivekananda ,it might b=
e particularly useful in light of the ongoing discussion about Ravana, Ego'=
s ,great souls and metaphysical stories.I often am in awe of the amount of =
scholarly knowledge that various members share on this forum,kindly excuse =
and forgive me if this post offends any of the member's feelings. 

This pa=
rticular incident from the Swami's life can be read in the Prabuddha Bharat=
a and also in the complete works of Swami Vivekananda.

Once a young group =
of students approached the swami to solicit his opinions on the Gita. This =
is what the Swami had to say

"
Be strong, my young friends; that is my adv=
ice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven through football than through the =
study of the Gita.

These are bold words; but I have to say them, for I lov=
e you. I know where the shoe pinches. I have gained a little experience. Yo=
u will understand the Gita better with your biceps, your muscles, a little =
stronger.You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna with your muscl=
es a little stronger.

This is the great fact: Strength is life, weakness i=
s death. Strength is felicity, life eternal, immortal; weakness is constant=
 strain and misery: Weakness is death.
To succeed, you must have tremendous=
 perseverance, tremendous will. `I will drink the ocean, says the preservin=
g soul, `at my will mountains will crumble up.' Have that sort of energy, t=
hat sort of will, work hard, and you reach the goal."

Ravana ,Lord Rama , =
Krishna , Jaya ,Vijaya...Rama Krishna Paramahamsa, Vimalananda.

How can on=
e judge them when they are not on the same level as these great souls. To e=
ven understand the Gita the Swami advocated a strong mind in a strong body =
to understand the mighty strength of Lord Krishna.

Does this not mean we a=
re better off doing our Sadhana instead of trying to figure out the mysteri=
es of the Metaphysical stories.My intention is not to say stories are irrel=
evant, my intention is only to say when one's energies are limited why not =
use them towards sadhana each second. 

At the end of the day if one is not=
 steeped in that level of consciousness he or she might not experience the =
metaphysical story within himself and might not grasp the inner meaning and=
 then the story no longer is true for them..

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore =
