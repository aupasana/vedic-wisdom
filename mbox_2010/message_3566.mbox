Dear Shashi,

That squiggly character is called avagraha. It is just a mark=
er to show that
the second component (amR^itam) of the sandhi starts with "=
a". It is
probably useful for people who want to read two separate words in=
stead of
one post-sandhi word. When you say meSbhayam (Itranslator version:=

me.amR^itaM) as one word you will not pronounce avagraha.

You can search =
internet on avagraha to find more information.
