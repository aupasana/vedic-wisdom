 Puja was performed regularly each day at Alagammal=E2=80=99s tomb (samadhi=
), ending
at midday. As it was too hot to return to Skandashram a small hut=
 was built
which was used for cooking and the return journey to the Ashram =
was delayed
until the evening. Eventually Chinnaswami decided to stay there=
 permanently
and lived in the hut along with Dandapaniswami.Due to the fact=
 that some of
the food now had to be brought here, there was at times not e=
nough to eat in
Skandashram. This led to differences of opinion,which Sri R=
amana settled
with his usual diplomacy.

Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s followers soo=
n noticed that he visited his mother=E2=80=99s samadhi
each day. They there=
fore started to wait for him there. One day he was
invited to a lavish meal=
 by a devotee. A large number of townspeople also
turned up and the meal tu=
rned into a feast which continued into the evening.
As nightfall had set in=
, Ramana was unable to return to Skandashram, so he
remained at the foot of=
 the hill overnight. The following day the same thing
happened again. In ad=
dition, Ganapati Muni had joined them and gave an
enthralling lecture which=
 lasted late into the night. Over the days that
followed Sri Ramana was alw=
ays detained for some reason until it was too
late to return to Skandashram=
.

Finally Kunju Swami and Gopal Rao were asked to look after Skandashram. =
For
a week they waited for Ramana=E2=80=99s return in vain.As they did not =
like to stay
up there without their master they came back down and from tha=
t time on the
Ashram was left empty. A short time later the deserted Ashram=
 was broken
into.Amongst other things the thieves removed a clock and a woo=
den plank
which Ramana had used. When he heard about it, he said,=E2=80=9CI=
t is good. Nobody
need go there to look after the place anymore.=E2=80=9D

=
This marked the beginning of Ramanashram. Sri Ramana once expressed it thus=
,
=E2=80=9CThe same shakti (power) that had brought me from Madurai to Tiru=
vannamalai
brought me down here from the hill.=E2=80=9D

In the early years=
 Ramanashram consisted of just a few huts. The so-called
Old Hall, in which=
 Sri Ramana lived day and night until 1949, was built in
1928. It was here =
that the many meetings with visitors and devotees took
place. The Old Hall,=
 which measures 40 feet by 15, is not very spacious and
contains only Raman=
a=E2=80=99s sofa and some bookcases.

The impression which is sometimes giv=
en, that the Ashram came into being
around the Maharshi without his partici=
pation, is therefore absolutely
wrong, as Annamalai testified, =E2=80=9CIt =
was Bhagavan, and Bhagavan alone, who
decided when buildings should be buil=
t, where they should be built, on what
scale they should be constructed,wha=
t materials should be used, and who
should be in charge of the construction=
.=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana not only took great interest in the various building=
 works, gave
advice and instructions and each evening asked for a progress =
report from
Annamalai Swami, he also liked to participate in the work himse=
lf. He
evidently felt more comfortable on the building site outside, than o=
n his
couch. He would have liked to have participated more fully in this ph=
ysical
work, if only his devotees had allowed him. But they thought it
inap=
propriate for him to do strenuous physical labour. In addition, he also
had=
 to care for the increasing numbers of visitors, who often came from afar
f=
or the sole purpose of having his darshan. Once when he was visiting the
bu=
ilding site, his attendant Madhava Swami announced the arrival of new
visit=
ors, Sri Ramana replied jokingly that a new warrant had been issued for
his=
 arrest and it was now time for him to return to jail.

One of the most imp=
ortant and lengthy building projects was the erection of
the new temple ove=
r the mother=E2=80=99s samadhi. The project was started on 1st
September 19=
39, exactly 43 years after Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s arrival at
Tiruvannamalai. =
Again he showed great interest in the construction work.
Exceptionally it w=
as not he who did the drawings but a master temple
builder, who brought wit=
h him several stonemasons experienced in temple
construction.

The temple b=
uilding placed an enormous strain on the Ashram finances.
Chinnaswami obtai=
ned the best teak wood from Burma and wanted to use only
the highest qualit=
y material. At times there was not enough money to pay the
workers, but the=
n, unexpectedly,donations would be received.

Feroza Taleyarkhan, a member =
of an aristocratic Parsi family,reports how she
raised considerable funds f=
or the mother=E2=80=99s temple and the New Hall on behalf
of Chinnaswami. R=
amana, however,was insistent that the collections should
not be done in his=
 name.

Feroza Taleyarkhan also played an important role in the renovation =
of the
Patala Lingam and in the purchase of Ramana=E2=80=99s birth house in=
 Tiruchuli
(Sundaram Mandiram) and the house in Madurai (Ramana Mandiram) t=
hrough
Ramanashram.

The construction of the temple took nearly 10 years. I=
t was called
Mathrubhuteswara (God in the form of the mother) and was cerem=
onially opened
in March 1949. The official ceremony (kumbhabhishekam) laste=
d for four days.
On the last evening but one before the feast, the Sri Chak=
ra Meru was
installed in the inner shrine.

Major Chadwick reports how Rama=
na himself supervised the installation,=E2=80=9CIt
was an extremely hot nig=
ht and with three charcoal retorts for melting the
cement adding to the hea=
t, it must have been intolerable inside the airless
cave of the inner shrin=
e, but for about an hour and a half Bhagavan sat
there telling the workmen =
what to do. On the last night of the function he
went in procession,opening=
 the doors of the New Hall and temple and passing
straight up into the Inne=
r Shrine, where he stood for some five minutes with
both hands laid on the =
Sri Chakra in blessing.=E2=80=9D
