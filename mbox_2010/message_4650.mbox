 D: This seems to contradict the statements that the Self is beyond the
min=
d, that the mind cannot know Brahman, that it is beyond thought and
speech =
(avangmanasagochara).

M: That is why they say that the mind is two fold: t=
here is the higher pure
mind as well as the lower impure mind. The impure m=
ind cannot know it but
the pure mind knows. It does not mean that the pure =
mind measures the
immeasurable Self, the Brahman.

It means that the Self m=
akes itself felt in the pure mind so that even when
you are in the midst of=
 thoughts you feel the Presence, you realise the
truth that you are one wit=
h the deeper Self and that the thought- waves are
there only on the surface=
.
