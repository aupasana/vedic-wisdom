Dear Satya Prakashji, 

Wonderful reply and the link. So essentially I am i=
nterpreting the verse in the following manner after all this discussion. 

=
1. Better to do Chandi Path and Homa (or any other sadhana) than not doing =
at all.

2. If one is attracted to Chandi Path and/or Homa, instead of wait=
ing for initiation and not doing anything, it is better to get started and =
practise the same until you get initiation on Someday in some life, which i=
s bound to happen due to boundless affection of Ma anyway. 

3. After getti=
ng started and practising for any length of time, one should not get carrie=
d away by the feeling of doer-ship and keep doing with a feeling of surrend=
er, which I think is the hardest part. Even doing Ganapati homam regularly,=
 sometimes gives me a superiority feeling and holier-than-thou attitude, wh=
en I quickly remember of Shri PVR Garu, to come back to my senses. 

BTW, I=
 came across a book on Bhagavadgita by Shri Vidyaprakashanandagiri in Telug=
u. The book is called "geeta makarandamu". In this wonderful book he not on=
ly gave meanings and interpretations of Geeta but he even gave specific way=
s practising several deekshas with several slokas of Geeta and specific yan=
trams. Being a peethadhipati and excellent pravachana kartha, this great ma=
n did not include any cautionary statements about initiation or Upadesha on=
 these practises. So, I am thinking of practising the same when the appropr=
iate time comes, assuming that initiation is not needed. If any seniors in =
this forum have gone through this book or have more knowledge on the same, =
I will be happy if they share their knowledge/opinions on the same. 

Regar=
ds, 

Nagraj

r proclaims (9.30), "Even if the most sinful person worships me with unwave=
ring devotion, he must be considered as righteous for he has made the right=
 resolve". So are we to understand that the sinful person straightaway atta=
ins the same state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The Lord Himself un=
ambigiously clarifies this in the very next verse wherein He says that such=
 a person "BECOMES" righteous and attains everlasting peace. Here the EFFEC=
T of the RIGHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are assured that they w=
ill never perish.

asses of devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna's affirmation, here too =
those who worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras, procedures =
etc, by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the knowledge o=
f the same and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminder that one n=
eed not stay away from worshipping Her because they have no knowledge or on=
ly limited knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has to perform th=
e worship to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly after surre=
ndering to Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen naturally be it th=
e required knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclusion through=
 this verse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her irrespective =
of our current level of knowledge.
