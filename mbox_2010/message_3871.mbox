Apologies for reposting the below mail for want of response...

Namaskarams=
 Narasimhaji, Manishji and Others,
I have been reading the mail exchanges o=
n Aghora and Bramacharya with avid interest and here are a few cents of tho=
ughts and also a request for correcting my line of thinking in case I am go=
ing down the wrong path. I have been doing the Ganapathi Homam for the past=
 half a year or so and I should say that I am not maintaining the Brahmacha=
rya as "defined" in the mail exchanges and some books. I feel that the prob=
lem with Sex with most of us is that we tend to identify it with something =
wrong or something which is "impure" and hence forbidden. I have been perfo=
rming some experiments in my daily life and I have found that it is definti=
tely possible to avoid the feelings of Lust, Greed and other feelings even =
while having sex. Although I am not perfect in this but I feel with lot of =
practice it should be possible to achieve a state of mind even during sex w=
here you are focussed on God and not wavered by the feelings that accompani=
es mundane sex. In this case even something as materialistic as Sex will be=
 transformed into a intense spiritual sadhana. If you start thinking of Sex=
 not as sometihng Impure and start doing it as Karma itself with out any ot=
her accompanying thoughts and do the "Act" itself as an offering to God the=
n I feel that Brahmacharya as defined conventionally is not needed. I would=
 say that we are very much observing Brahmacharya. Now coming to Ojas I dou=
bt that Ojas can be so physical as Semen. If the act of Sex is itself perfo=
med as an offering to God and without any thoughts other than that of God t=
hen where is the question of loosing any spiritual energy . In fact you are=
 adding to your spiritual growth. 
I have observed a change in myself after=
 doing this practically over the past couple of months. I have found that g=
radually over a period of time even though its possible to completely absta=
in from physical sex, it is also possible to avoid getting swayed by it and=
 also not crave for it.
 

Continuing further , how would one justify "Nigh=
tfalls" which is a natural phenomenon wherein the body automatically purges=
 excess semen collected over a period of time when one is asleep without th=
e persons control.In other words it is an involuntary action just like brea=
thing.

 
Can this also be intrepreted as break in Brahmacharya? I would be=
 keen to know the experiences of those persons who have abstained from phys=
ical sex for an extended period of time and what they think of "Nightfalls"=
 .
 
************ ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* *******=
** ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********
 
I=
 think that every action that we do should be done with the thought of an o=
ffering to god. For example even while having food , we can think each bite=
 as an offering to Ganapathi in fire (actually there is a fire in our stoma=
ch which burns the food) , Our entire body can be visuilased like a living =
moving Homa kundam where we continuously offer ahuti of differnet materials=
. If we conciously make this effort over a period of time we would think le=
ss about the process of eating food itself , the accompanying pleasure of t=
aste etc and concentrate more on mental homam which we are performing. Ever=
y thought process can be considered as an ahuti inside the mental fire in o=
ur soul.Like this every action that we do in our daily life can be thought =
as a homam itself and thereby achieve the state of mind where there is no d=
istinction between the so called "Pure" and "Impure" , "Good" and "Bad" and=
 so on.
 
Please let us know your thoughts on this. If possible try to get =
Manishji's opinion on this as well.
 
Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
