I am normally doing vishnu homam and tarpan vidhi both in my bedroom. In pi=
tru tarpan manual it is written that during shraddha paksha ( this fortnigh=
t) there is no harm in doing tarpan vidhi in house also..is this ok?
>

It is ok. However, it is better to do pitri tarpana in another place. Peopl=
e's minds are quite vulnerable when they are asleep, to various influences.=
 When you do a pitri tarpana or otherwise contemplate on the ancestors who =
are blocked from higher realms of being, you may be leaving some thoughts r=
elated to them and their weaknesses in that place. That is normally harmles=
s, but a very sensitive person sleeping there may be somewhat disturbed by =
it.
