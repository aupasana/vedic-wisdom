Namaste Hari,

Sorry to interject! I also share the same reasoning as you m=
entioned. Exactly same!
I too have heard that `Growing beard' and long hair=
s stores some amount of Spiritual energy generated from the spiritual pract=
ices. I do not know if it is accurate or not but I'll tell you about my per=
sonal experience of Growing Beard.

Narasimha suggested me to grow beard mo=
re than a year back. I could not gather the courage for almost one year to =
do so (In that sense I can be blamed as the one who does not or could not o=
bey Guru's instructions to the fullest). The reasons were obvious-
Attachme=
nt to the `Physical as well as psychological personality' as perceived the =
society and Fear and shame.
 What people will think? How they will react? H=
ow colleagues will take it in profession, etc... My beard is in patches. It=
 does not grow full so it does not look that nice when I do not shave for s=
ay 3/4 days and moreover there are Gray hairs as well now. So all in all, i=
 could not think of growing beard and once I tried for few days, colleagues=
 (Ladies) in office as well as at home discouraged it.

Now I guess i've ov=
ercome (partially) that `Fear, shame and Attachment syndrome' and am growin=
g beard since last couple of months. People look at me with wonder/question=
s and some ask reasons as well but everything is settled. Fear is gone. So =
I can vouch safe that in cases like me, growing beard really helps in overc=
oming that attachment and fear part. One is not bother about ones look and =
reaction of people around. One is only bother about ones spiritual progress=
 to the maximum possible extent.

Again, a RED signal in growing beard as w=
ell. One may look good in beard and that might trap one again and deadly sp=
rout of attachment can come again with changed object which is now `beard'.=
 I remember Swami Sivananda's cautioning advice in the same regards which w=
as posted sometime back by Krishnendu, if I am correct.

Best Regards,

Utp=
al
