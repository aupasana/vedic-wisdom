Namate

Very intereting, may be there may be some prevoius connection or at=
tachment with the actor and that is why he may be coming. I am sure the act=
or is handsome and good looking and can portray god in movies :-), what is =
wrong with it? God is everywhere in all forms!

We are all playing in a mov=
ie too.

We experiance everything based on our state of mind and accumulate=
d sanskars. If one keeps doing the same thing for a long time, when those i=
mpressions in mind go away, than appearance of that
actor may go away too.
=

It is always good to stick to one form and dig only in one place,
however =
due to each one's previous situation or accumulations of experiance and beh=
avoir one does dig in many places. There is nothing wrong digging in many p=
laces.

Also we live in a time where many have weak patience, weak minds th=
at get influenced easily, it too lead many to dig in many places.

Eventual=
ly after clearing up one may attach to one form and dig only in one place.
=

Sadhana doing attaching to a form is more easier than doing formless, I ha=
ve read this in many books but pardon my lack of actual experiance in eithe=
r of them.

One must enjoy doing sadhana that one or she likes, enjoys and =
feels comfortable at a given point of time. As time changes sadhana also
ch=
anges.

Best Regards
Mitesh
