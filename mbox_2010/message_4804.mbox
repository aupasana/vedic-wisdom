              The Power of Emptiness


	The "void" o=
r " psychological emptiness" is a strange 
							phenomenon,
	It appears s=
pontaneously, in the pause between two 
							  thoughts,
	As the old thou=
ght ends its course and disappears, 
	Its end is the gate, natural silence =
ensues. 

	Insist in being with it, as much as you can, 
	The mind is compl=
etely silent, we are attentive =96 a clear 
							consciousness,
	All mean=
ings, boundaries disappear =96 us and the Infinite  
		  				 are "One";
	P=
ractically, we have a new mind =96 always fresh.

 	 
           Being in t=
he pause =96 I become infinite!
	It separates two worlds. I leave the limit=
ed world
	And enter Boundlessness, through total melting;	
	The whole being=
 is calm =96 a constant sparkle.

	There is no time, no space =96 just ever=
lasting Eternity;
	I move in direct contact with life, in a permanent prese=
nt.
 	I am Pure Energy, without motivations, 
	The simplicity of existence =
integrates us completely.

	We really encounter Life only through this "now=
",
	Free from the old, we are able to embrace the new.
	All this beauty van=
ishes, when another thought appears, 
	It comes from the knowing mind =96 a=
n old recording.
	
	Let it play its game, do not oppose any resistance, 
	E=
ncounter it as it is, without any purpose, 
	It will certainly disappear, a=
nd "emptiness" ensues again, 
	Another opportunity to encounter it practica=
lly. 

	We find the real meaning of Life through this "void",
	It is a boun=
dary line between the two worlds:
	On the one side the limited, where the "=
ego" is the 
							master. 
	On the other, the Infinite, where Love is the=
 master.
	
	Emptiness also separates Light from the darkness, 
	The permane=
nt chaos through struggle, contradictions and 
						      conflicts,
	From=
 the harmonious being, equilibrium and joy;
	The whole egocentrism perishes=
, by encountering the 
							  void. 
        
	Peace, divine order become=
s our nature 
	It changes our way of being, without effort or will,
	Only t=
hrough this psychological void, we become honest 
						   and humane, 
	Th=
e Purity of the Energy =96 makes titans out of pigmies .


	Let this "psych=
ological emptiness" be your guide, 
	In everything you encounter on your sp=
iritual path.
	If it is not the starting point, we easily get deceived, 
	O=
nly through emptiness =96 we become Love!
