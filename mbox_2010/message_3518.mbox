Thank you Krishnenduji, 
=C2=A0
Can you please=C2=A0provide the URL of Mani=
shji's site?
=C2=A0
I have a few questions on this, which probably Narasimh=
aji will be able to answer. Others are welcome too.
=C2=A0
First, in my und=
erstanding if you include Vyahritis (Aum Bhuh(r) Bhu va Ssu wah) it is no l=
onger 24 lettered mantra. Because the mantra=C2=A0of 24 letters=C2=A0(sylla=
bles) is starting with=C2=A0"Tat".
=C2=A0
Secondly,=C2=A0as I understand, t=
he three Sandhyas are Brahma gayatri (morning), Achyuta Gayatri (Noon) and =
Shiva Gayatri (Evening) times. The mid-night (Kali Gayatri) is not for=C2=
=A0any Sadhanas in Satwik=C2=A0traditions. But I don't know why Manishji sa=
ys the mid-night Gayatri must be practised! 
=C2=A0
Thirdly, the=C2=A0dhyan=
a Sloka describes Gayatri Mata as having Five faces,=C2=A0(not four).=C2=A0=

=C2=A0
1. Mukta (Pearl Color)
2. Vidruma (Coral Color=C2=A0or red)
3. Hema=
 (Golden Color or Yellow)
4. Neela (Blue/Black)
5. Dhavala (White)
=C2=A0
a=
nd the dhyana sloka describes the mother as having 10 hands and specifies d=
ifferent things that those hands are adorned by. 
=C2=A0
Finally, what is G=
ayatri Chandas? In geeta, Lord Krishna says he is Gayatri Chandas. In my un=
derstanding, a specfic chandas is a meter in which the mantra/sloka/padyam =
(in telugu) is composed. But if we look at different mantras in gayatri Cha=
ndas, each has a different meter. For intance, Savitur Gayatri Mantra has 2=
4=C2=A0syllables, Ganapati Moola Mantra has 28=C2=A0syllables, Brihaspati G=
ayatri (Vrishabham Charshaneenam....) has 21 letters. This is=C2=A0causing =
confusion to me.
=C2=A0

The foll=
owing is extracted from his site.He gives a detailed analysis of the savitu=
r gayatri mantra.



The Gayatri mantra is the oldest ,the root and the mos=
t powerful of Sanskrit mantras. In my experience chanting the Gayatri mantr=
a and firmly establishing it in the Hridaya can lead to knowledge of the At=
man.(Soul)

Only one who is a knower of the Gayatri is a Brahman,the rest a=
re simply dependant one their credentials at birth and intelligence .Whilst=
 they like themselves to be called as brahmanas they are actually in a wors=
e position than anybody else in society.Why should I say this with authorit=
y?Because I know this truth having experienced it.

Yes ,as long as they ar=
e willing to follow the caveats of Yama,niyama, which include nonviolence (=
ie no meat),purity of the body and mind (Shaucha) and pronounce the mantra =
properly with the swaras.For manasika japa there is no restriction on the s=
waras but better results are got if the mantra swaras embedd themselves in =
the mind.

The Gayatri should be recited at either the Khanda Sandhya(Early=
 morning -an hour before and an hour after sunrise) or /and the Shuddha San=
dhya(an hour before and an hour after sunset) or the Turiya Sandhya(an hour=
 before and after midnight). The minimum number is 10 or 28 times but to ha=
ve anubhava try this .Starting at an auspicious time ,use a rudraksha mala(=
5 mukhi will do,it must be small beads ideally),a woollen white or red blan=
ket to sit upon(Darbhasan is ideal),and facing east in the morning start ja=
pa of Gayatri.Finish a mala at least and chant in a way that only you can h=
ear yourself.Increase this to 2 or 3 malas at both sandhyas.

The word "Gay=
atri" itself explains the meaning of this mantra. It has its origin in the =
Sanskrit phrase Gayantam Triyate iti, and refers to that mantra which rescu=
es the chanter from all adverse situations that may lead to spiritual death=
. 

Goddess Gayatri is also called "Veda-Mata" or the Mother of the Vedas =
=E2=80=94 Rig, Yajur, Saam and Atharva =E2=80=94 because it is the very bas=
is of the Vedas. It is the basis, the reality behind the experienced and th=
e cognized universe. 

The Gayatri mantra is composed of a metre consisting=
 of 24 syllables =E2=80=94 generally arranged in a triplet of eight syllabl=
es each. Therefore, this particular meter (tripadhi) is also known as the G=
ayatri Meter or "Gayatri Chhanda." 

The Mantra

Aum
Bhuh Bhuvah Svah(give =
a fraction of a second halt here)
Tat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of =
a second halt here)
Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second ha=
lt here)
Dhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat

~ The Rig Veda (10:16:3)

Tat, says Wood=
roffe, refers to the first cause of all substance, as fire in the circle of=
 the sun and is supreme Brahman. Savituh is the source of all living beings=
. Varenyam is the excellent one who receives adoration. Bharga destroys sin=
, Devasya means it is full of light, while Dhimahi refers to knowledge bein=
g golden and always within the sun. Dhiyo means Buddhi, Yo stands for energ=
y (tejas). The mantra is divided into three sections of eight letters and f=
our sections of six letters. A dhyana (meditation) in the same chapter desc=
ribes Gayatri as having four faces, which are white, yellow, red and black.=
 

Yet the tantrik tradition has different views of the Gayatri. For exampl=
e, in the Matrikabhedatantra, there is a couplet which says a person who kn=
ows the Brahman (the absolute), is a brahmin. 

In the tantrik tradition, e=
ach aspect of devata has her or his own form of the Gayatri and it is often=
 pronounced at the four junctions of the day, including midnight. 

The tan=
tra based Gayatri is known as the Ajapa japa.

Sooo is the sound created wh=
ilst inhalation and Hummm whilst exhalation.This method of chanting the man=
tra whilst the root of the uvula is pressed upon by the tip of the tongue o=
r whilst concentration is made upon either the breath,the Hridaya,the Ajna =
chakra or the Sahasrara brings about dissolution of the sensation of the St=
hula Sharira(physical body) and a tremendous perception that one is the Atm=
an.It destroys the attachments and rids one of the Shad Ripus(the six enemi=
es of man).It gives a clear idea of what ones previous births are ,etc.But =
one should be forewarned.The practise of mere physical mudras without the l=
earning of Atman tattwa will only give Siddhis and bind one to the material=
 world by increasing karmas.

This Ajapa is recited by every living being u=
nconsciously 21,600 times a day as she or he breathes. Half are the breaths=
 which go through the channel of the Sun and half are breaths which go thro=
ugh the channel of the Moon.ie.The Pingala and Ida nadis. It consists of th=
e letters Ha and Sa.

Fools like to say that these nadis exist within the p=
hysical structures in the body but they are simply gassing about.The truth =
is that these channels and the Kundalini Shakti exist in the Sookshma shari=
ra .These have an association with the Stula sharira and can when concentra=
ted upon result in the flow of Prana through the nadis .

Recitation of the=
 Gayatri brings about spiritual change from within.It invokes the Supreme e=
nergy Gayatri mata which the Christians call as the Holy spirit and brings =
the glory of the Atman forth.
