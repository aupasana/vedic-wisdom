Dear Sri PVRji, 
=C2=A0
Amazing reply once again! I was in fact regretting =
for being forceful in my last message, much against the decorum of this for=
um, but I just could not tolerate the attitude of this guy where he started=
 insulting the greatest of our masters, the jagadguru Adi Sankara and hence=
 was my reaction. But I will try to increase my tolerance! Your replies/pos=
ts are always very educative! Thanks again. 
=C2=A0

Please cut down on this belligerance. If you keep pollut=
ing the list with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the list. We w=
elcome all views, but one can disagree with great scholars and masters with=
out belittling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.

Aa=
di Shankara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his wo=
rks, you will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in his com=
mentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in=
 Vedic scriptures, breadth of commentaries of Vedic literature and the ling=
uistic richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all schola=
rs of Kali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about the importa=
nce of devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific s=
cholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.

* * *

Sanskrit is a ver=
y useful language. So much great literature that shows various paths to rea=
ching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly=
 resonate with the energy centers in one's subtle consciousness. So, if one=
 wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, =
it is a great idea.

At the same time, Shankara's advice of chanting the na=
me of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the =
final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surren=
der to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end. L=
earning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplining the mind=
 with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these ar=
e for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one's =
rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such =
as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals et=
c. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people =
do not forget it and get bogged down.

If one wanting to climb a mountain k=
eeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may ev=
entually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at the =
base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may f=
orget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate m=
asters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.

* * *

I am reminded of =
a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekananda.

Swami Vivekananda said=
 at a San Francisco class: "I am the disciple of a man who could not write =
his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often have I wishe=
d I could take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!"

Student said, "=
But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best."

Swami Vivekananda said, =
"That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am."

Vivekananda w=
as named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimination) aris=
ing from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (discrimination)=
 was to arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limitations of hi=
s regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).

* * *

> That Adi shank=
ara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,

ak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachings in a

manner.

Maturity of a teacher is not measured by the following. And great =
teachers do not care about being "celebrated".

In any case, it is not true=
 that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Veda=
nta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shanka=
ra's commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for many m=
any generations.

Apart from his scholarly works, the mutts established by =
him have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant percentage of =
Hindus in the last couple of millennia.

Any teachings in written/spoken wo=
rds can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great great teach=
ers also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings =
of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to influence the =
thinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara's wor=
ds - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retained their mean=
ing and power for more than a couple of millennia. The longevity of his wor=
ks is amazing.

* * *

It is ok to have strong opinions. As people's unders=
tanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend=
 others with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras=
 of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, =
is not good karma. I request members to be considerate, tolerant and respec=
tful to others.

Best regards,
Narasimha
