Subject: WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF ONE YOJANA?

Learned members of the group and dear friends,

I wish to know what is the =
length of one Yojana? I heard that great ancient indian astronomers like Ar=
yabhatta and Varahamihira have taken one Yojana to be of 4 miles length. Ho=
wever, in the recent past people have preferred 8 miles as equivalent of on=
e Yojana. Why is it so?

I will be very happy if learned members can enligh=
ten me on this.

Thanks,
Rajmohan
