 In the state where the ego, the I-am-the body delusion, has ceased both
yo=
ga and bhoga (enjoyment), without becoming two merge together as one. (62)
=

Only those who are dead to desires for (the pleasures of) the vast delusiv=
e
panorama of the world will have their life transformed into Siva. There w=
ill
be no bliss by any means other than the dawn of the pure and fresh
expe=
rience of Self. (859)

The tranquil clarity devoid of mental turmoil is the=
 samadhi which is
essential for Liberation. (Therefore) try earnestly to ex=
perience the
peaceful consciousness, the clarity of heart, by destroying th=
e deceptive
turmoil (of mind). (919)

Sankalpa (thought) creates the world.=
 The peace attained on the destruction
of sankalpas is the (permanent) dest=
ruction of the world. (29)

If you ask, =E2=80=9CWhat is the benefit of sac=
rificing the innumerable sensual
pleasures and retaining mere Consciousness=
?=E2=80=9D. (we reply that) the fruit of
Jnana is the eternal and unbroken =
experience of the Bliss of Self. (77)

If the jiva, who is ever deluded and=
 is always suffering from a feeling of
deficiency, wants to get rid of all =
his miseries and to be happy, he need
only know the Supreme One, his Lord, =
to be his own Self. (367)

As consciousness is the real nature of Siva, onl=
y enquiry into consciousness
is the true worship of Siva. (204)

Why do you=
 still retain the attachment to the mental concepts of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =
and
=E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 when, you have already offered up all those thin=
gs to your Guru?
(317)

The many different religious are appropriate to the=
 maturity of each
individual, and all of them are acceptable to reality. (3=
42)

To whatever extent this world is real to that same extent are other wo=
rlds
real. Only this much can be said about heaven and hell without giving =
rise
to arguments. (178)

Those whose egos have died have reached the state=
 of immortality. Those
ignorant ones with inflated egos are truly dead. (22=
7)

You have to accept your own existence even in the state of unconscious =
sleep
where the appearances involving the triputis cease to exist. If you d=
o not
accept the fact of your existence (in sleep), how did that knowledge =
come to
you? (356)

Other than consciousness, the pure clarity in which exc=
ellence flourishes,
there is no God who is worthy of being worshipped. (417=
)

The true meaning of namaskaram (obeisance) is the ego bowing its head an=
d
getting destroyed at the feet of Guru. (207)

Banish even the thought =E2=
=80=98I am a fir instrument for God=E2=80=99 and remain still
(summa iru). =
(471)

Mere book knowledge about self-enquiry, even though learnt from clea=
r
scriptures, will be a picture-gourd drawn on a sheet of paper, which cann=
ot
be used for cooking. The superme jnana will arise only out of true enqui=
ry
in the form of attention towards the reality that exists in the heart. (=
531)

So long as you have not renounced the notion =E2=80=98I am the doer=
=E2=80=99 keep in your
mind the correct perspective that your responsibilit=
ies are yours alone and
not that of God. (570)

When compared to the Self, =
which shines as both the dwelling place and the
dweller within it, the spac=
e of the physical universe is poor indeed. (426)

For performing the suprem=
e act of Self-enquiry there is no other auspicious
day than today. (518)

H=
owever good an action may be, it performing it spoils and destroys your
equ=
animity of mind, what is the benefit of it? (574)

Without the shining ligh=
t of grace, what can the insignificant jives do to
escape from then net of =
delusion and gain clarity? (634)

Abidance in Swarupa (one=E2=80=99s own na=
ture) means ceasing to exist as a slave to
God; it is remaining without eve=
n the thought =E2=80=98I am a slave=E2=80=99 rising; it is
egoless silence,=
 utterly still, having no mental movements. The unlimited
consciousness tha=
t shines in the state is the (true) consciousness (472)

The seer and the o=
bject seen are like the rope and the snake.Just as the
knowledge of the rop=
e which is the substratum will not arise unless the
false acknowledge of th=
e illusory serpent foes, so that realization of the
self, which is the subs=
tratum will not be gained unless the belief that the
world is real is remov=
ed.

A humble attitude of mind will give you redemption, transporting you t=
o the
world of the immortals. Without humility you will drown in the pitch =
of
hell. (494)

Protect yourself from the mental agitation that stems from =
being caught up
in the net of praise and frame, which only betrays you. (62=
4)

The power of maya (that which doesn=E2=80=99t exist) is a false, shadow=
-like power,
which is not inherent in the nature of the Self. (597)

Self-r=
ealisation which appears very difficult will be attained very easily
throug=
h the power of grace. (512)

To whatever extent (that) mind-consciousness d=
ives within, to that same
extent will the bliss of the self spring forth an=
d reveal itself. (451)

Because it appears and disappears just as dreams do=
, the waking state that
appears to be solid and full of differences is also=
 imaginary. (555)

Ignorance is an erroneous superimposition. The infinite,=
 blissful
consciousness alone is the one existing reality. (547)

In the gl=
orious state wherein the mind has died, even deep sleep will become
God-con=
sciousness. (457)

Those who rejoice, having established in Sivam, will not=
 pay even the
slightest attention to these (siddhis) that only cause sorrow=
. (221)

In the straight path of Swarupa Vichara (enquiry into one=E2=80=99=
s own nature) no
fear or confusion arises because of the non-dual nature of=
 then Self. (393)

Evil desire, a pit that can never be filled, is what plu=
nges you life into
poverty that cannot be overcome. (371)

Directing the mi=
nd towards siddhis (supernatural powers) is a stumbling
block that inhibits=
 progress towards the supreme state of liberation. (222)

O Mind, it is not=
 wise on your part to come out. It is best to go within.
Hide yourself deep=
 within the heart and escape from the tricks of maya,
which tries to ruin y=
ou by drawing you outwards. (187)

Humility and self-restraint are the mark=
s of those transformed and radiant
beings who embody the quality of virtue.=
 Blemishless Jnanis alone are truly
virtuous; others are base-natured. Ther=
efore, to be saved, we should
approach only those virtuous ones who ever ab=
ide in Truth. (332)

Though one has shaken off all vices, renounced all rel=
atives, and observed
all the austerities prescribed by the scriptures, can =
one reach eternal
bliss unless one meets the jnana Guru? (321)

(O Mind), d=
o not waste your life in roaming outside, pursuing wonders and
wallowing in=
 enjoyments. To know the self through grace and to abide in this
way firmly=
 in the Heart is alone worthwhile. (188)

He whose mind has been destroyed,=
 having drowned in the non-dual whole
(advaita-purna), will never be pertur=
bed in this unreal life of duality,
(because) in that supreme state of Grac=
e, (the state of) Self, which is pure
consciousness (unmixed with any adjun=
cts such as =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99), nothing such as
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (t=
he ego or subject) and =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 (the world or object) exists =
except that
(Self, the pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99). (1117)

=
It is only due to the delusion which is caused by not learning the Truth of=

Self that jives are suffering. Therefore, always take to the practice of
J=
nana =E2=80=93 the inward enquiry =E2=80=9CWho am I that is suffering?=E2=
=80=9D (405)

When the delusion which has veiled Self, the Light of Consico=
usness of
unlimited Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda), is destroyed by the clear enqu=
iry =E2=80=9CWho am
I?=E2=80=9D, one=E2=80=99s own nature will shine forth =
gloriously as the Atmakasha (i.e.
Space of self). (402)

The eternal, unbro=
ken, natural state of abiding in the Self is jnana. To
abide in the Self yo=
u must love the Self. Since God is verity the Self, love
of the Self is lov=
e of God and that is bhakti. Jnana and Bhakti are thus one
and the same. (M=
aharshi=E2=80=99s Gospel)

Man, the deluded ego-mind, cannot be freed from =
confusion and fear (of birth
and death), unless he subdues himself by takin=
g refuge under the protection
of Grace; for (by any other means), the force=
 of past karmas (i.e., vasanas)
is unconquerable. (300)

The complete givin=
g up of all (the other three purusharthas) beginning with
dharma, is the gl=
orious state of peace, which is the nature of liberation
(the fourth purush=
artha, the only true purushartha). (Therefore) completely
giving up (all) t=
hought of the others (the three false purusharthas), cling
only to Silence,=
 the knowledge of the Supreme Self, which is Siva. (Guru
Vachaka Kovai 1204=
)

Know that the path of jnana and the path of bhakti are inter-related. Fo=
llow
these inseparable two paths without differentiating one from the other=
.
(731)

Sever the delusive and sorrow-laden ego by the keen knowledge gain=
ed through
enquiry, (because) the true happiness of peace (santi) cannot pr=
evail except
in a heart where this knot (granthi) has been uprooted. (844)
=

That form of the Liberated One =E2=80=93 who is (in truth) intangible like=
 the sky =E2=80=93
which appears to men, is really nothing but the reflecti=
on of the form of
him that sees (that form); it is not real. (130)

The lea=
vings of the Guru (ucchistam) are just the words uttered by Him, on
the str=
ength of His own Experience. The eating of the leavings is just
remaining f=
ixed in Unity with Him, in silence. (136)

The thought =E2=80=98I am this b=
ody of flesh and blood=E2=80=99 is the one thread on which
are strung the v=
arious other thoughts. Therefore, if we turn inwards
enquiring =E2=80=98Whe=
re is this I?=E2=80=99 all thoughts will come to and end and
Self-Knowledge=
 will then spontaneously shine forth.
