Namaste VemparlaRamkishore ji,
=C2=A0
I think gemstones may work, IF, the p=
erfect recommendation is found. The problem is not with Jyotish as a subjec=
t. The problem is with Jyotishis. Their knowledge is imperfect. Based on su=
ch imperfect knowledge when people recommend gemstones etc, they may or may=
 not work out.
=C2=A0
But if we look at it from another point of view, ever=
y affliction - mental/phsyical/spiritual -=C2=A0is finally a karmic reactio=
n. And when one does sadhana, one is basically trying hard to finsh off his=
 storehouse of karmas. Finally God realization is about finsh off the karma=
s which block progress. Instead of putting faith on imperfect jyotishis, on=
e is much better off putting his/her faith on a deity whose sadhana he/she =
is doing and the deity will guide the person correctly in what needs to be =
done. So in that sense, when one plunges into serious sadhana, the person d=
oes not feel like consulting jyotishis or checking out charts. The perspect=
ive about life changes. I once made a collection of charts of people who we=
re good, genuine sadhakas, with some amount of spiritual progress. Some wer=
e famous, some not famous. When I showed these charts to different jyotishi=
s asking them about what is the most defining characteristics of this indiv=
idual, they came up
 with all sorts of weird answers which were anything bu=
t true. Once a=C2=A0jyotishi knows that the chart belongs to a genuinely sp=
iritual person,=C2=A0he can smoothly back engineer many combinations and pr=
ove his point. But if no clue is provided, he mostlty fails, specially when=
 juding spiritual charts. This could well be because when a sadhaka does sa=
dhana, he burns off karmas, thus a completely=C2=A0new frequency of analysi=
s is needed. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
In my view, the ability to predict the future h=
as nothing to do with knowledge of Jyotish scriptures/shastras. It comes fr=
om a different place. One may have mugged up all the classics and every sta=
tement therein, yet, whether his predictions will come true or not is not g=
auranteed. It is purely based on the shakti acquired through some sort of s=
adhana in some lifetime. It is like a bank balance. But these days, jyotish=
is are mere jyotishis. They hardly do any serious sadhana. Which means all =
they do is cash in on previous karmic balance they had acquired and use it =
for predictions. The day this balance gets over, in this life or=C2=A0the n=
ext,=C2=A0all knowledge of scriptures won't help the=C2=A0jyotishi one bit =
in getting an accurate=C2=A0prediction. 
=C2=A0
A yantra may work if suffic=
ient energy is infused into it. To infuse that energy, again you need someo=
ne who has the energy to infuse it. Or one can keep worshipping the yantra =
till it acquires sufficient energy. 
=C2=A0
So, considering all these, I fe=
el it is far=C2=A0better to keep focusing on ones own sadhana with greater =
intensity, rather than spending time analysing horoscopes to find out short=
-cut remedies. 
=C2=A0
Just some random thoughts.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Even though the question was not addressed to me and am no where having=
 the knowledge level of Narasimha Ji or other learned members, Let me attem=
pt an answer.

K .N Rao ji has proved very conclusively that the gemstone t=
herapy has no scriptural basis in any of the jyotisha classics.BPHS does no=
t have a mention of the gem stones at all . The only text bandied about as =
proof by the gemstone followers is some verses from Garuda purana ( If I re=
member correctly ) .

Narasimha Ji in his class lectures ( Boston group ) h=
as often said Gemstone therapy is rajasic in nature and is far inferior to =
sattwic methods like mantra.Also the question of if a gemstone works for on=
e area ..what will it do for the other. A stone good for career might be ba=
d for one's child.One then has to get a perfect stone with perfect cut...On=
e has to energize the stone again with mantra, do the required pujas and th=
en wear it.

Even after this is this not like forcibly trying to escape one=
's fate by means of wealth.Also if gem therapy worked many of the multimill=
ionaries who had troubled lifes could have prevented many a thing by wearin=
g the biggest best stones.

I also beleive Kala sarp yoga is also a nonsens=
e formulated by some selfish astrolgers in recent times to make a quick buc=
k.K N rao ji has written many articles on the above false yoga as well. 

L=
