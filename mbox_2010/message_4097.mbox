Hi.
=C2=A0
"Why is he interfering in all these instead of keeping quiet?=
=E2=80=99"
=C2=A0
Many a times even i think why all these spiritual men lik=
e Kanchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi has to talk about the ongoing Political cri=
sis and land into controversies. It is good to remain quite and do whatever=
 job one has to perform.
=C2=A0
But the trick is how to identify what job i=
'm sent for to this world????
=C2=A0
Cheers
KK

2-2-46 Morning

A visitor told Bh=
agavan that he was working for Harijan uplift, that he and his co-workers i=
n the cause had darshan of Mahatma Gandhi and got his blessings, that Mahat=
ma Gandhi told them that if they could bring about marriages between Harija=
n girls and higher caste gentlemen, such marriages would have his blessings=
; and that he (visitor) would like to have Bhagavan=E2=80=99s views in the =
matter.=C2=A0

Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CIf Mahatma Gandhi has said so, we wi=
ll all hear what he has said. What more is there for us to do? He is a dist=
inguished man and is working in that field.What have we to do with that?=E2=
=80=9D=C2=A0

Turning to us, Bhagavan added,=E2=80=9CIf I open my mouth, so=
mething will appear in the papers that so-and-so has also said such-and-suc=
h a thing. The next day there will be people to criticise it. Our business =
is to keep quiet. If we enter into all these, people will naturally ask, an=
d justifiably, =E2=80=98Why is he interfering in all these instead of keepi=
ng quiet?=E2=80=99=C2=A0

Similarly if Mahatma Gandhi keeps quiet leaving a=
side all his activities,they will ask, =E2=80=98Why is he keeping quiet ins=
tead of engaging in all these activities?=E2=80=99 He must do what he has c=
ome for. We must do what we have come for.=E2=80=9D
