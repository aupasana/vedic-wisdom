Dear Utapal          - Namaste




Namaste Satish Ji,

First of all i mus=
t say
that I was happy & impressed to see your message and the honesty with=
 which
you went about writing such detailed critique.

1)=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0
Narasimha
Garu says that "Accumulated Shakti" is the primary p=
re-requisite to
bring about the specific result of any specific ritual. you=
 are of the opinion
that It is not so and he is a mere Technician who is ex=
pert of performing
ritual as prescribed and result is entirely because of t=
he invoked deity.Both
the views are correct to me only the subtle understan=
ding is needed. I am of
the opinion that if the priest does not posses at l=
east a little spiritual
power, He can not invoke deity's presence however e=
xpert and perfectionist he
is in performing a ritual. Yes, i agree with you=
 that "Results" are
given because Deity is pleased by the ritual and offeri=
ngs BUT can a divine
deity will even be present if invoked by a person who =
is not capable?. Pleasing
of deity is even far away.

=C2=A0

Thanks for yo=
ur complements
but I request you to read my past mail carefully again as yo=
u will get real
point in understanding aacharyavaran and shreyodan rituals.=
 Please go through
my latest post to rajarshi and narsimha where you will g=
et clarification of
most things. Truth will always have one face only. We c=
an=E2=80=99t say both sides of
coin are same. Should we accept A+B=3DC and =
A+B=3DD?=C2=A0 Understand the meaning of =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=
=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=
=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 where you will get the an=
swer for invoking
presence of devata. Mantra is not merely a syllable arran=
gements but
Nadasharira of devata. Here purity, Godly qualities of priests,=
 his mental
state, his spiritual status etc. are not of importance but adde=
d values for
invoking devata. The invoking of devata is solely due to chant=
ing of mantra in
same manner as instructed by shriti and smrities. 

=C2=A0=


It is well known that
Brahamana's of yore were following very stringent, =
disciplined, Unselfish and
God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote =
good amount of time in their
personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majorit=
y of them. every Yuga has every
yuga present as you correctly said). I thin=
k, because of that highly evolved
life style and off course equipped with e=
xpertise of performing various
rituals, they were fit to become mediators b=
etween Yajamana and Devata. A real
brahmana would therefore capable of invo=
king Devine preence to the best of his
ability and get the results for the =
Yajamana. So here i am sure you'll see
point of "caliber" factor for person=
 performing the ritual for
"Materialistic Desires" of 3rd party (i.e. Yajam=
ana).

=C2=A0

Though I learnt very few
vedic rituals from a learned priest=
 I am like you all as still I couldn=E2=80=99t
grasp/understand them in tot=
ality.=C2=A0 To
think of caliber you again discussing same topic with same =
points which I think
were/are explained earlier. Still I repeat partially w=
hat I wrote to rajarshi
again; - If we say priest must have shakti how can =
we count his nature of
shakti in terms of quality, quantity, depth and need=
? Should we consider shakti
to beget baby, remove diseases, give immense we=
alth is same?, how to
differentiate priest with and without shakthi, most i=
mp who will differentiate
this, what are the parameters to define this, wha=
t are the tools to understand
all these subtle points, etc will be the comp=
lex issues before yajamana/us when
he/we think of doing any remedy. Do we h=
ave any universal system for this? If
you think over these issues you will =
come to know the truth. If a priest
perform a puja every third day he must =
have at least tons of shakti to give
results. Only person who is in unmani/=
trans avashta can have such a huge shakti
and I think such person will not =
use his power to wash sins of so many people
unless asked by his superiors =
to do this. 

2) You have
mis-understood "Bagging bawl" "Beggars" etc... Wi=
th the
term beggars, He basically means most of us who are "Helpless &
hope=
lessly Trapped" "Aspirants" who cry to mother for the
release. It is not to=
 be meant as a degrading term for the "Imperishable
Self". "Tamupeihi Mahaa=
raja Sharanam Tvam Parameshwari" "Aaaraadhitaa
Saivanrunaam bhog swargaapav=
argadaa" Request you to understand Narasimha a
little deeper. Please do not=
 take words literally. And in reality, to be blunt,
most of us are "Beggars=
". We pray (beg) for good life, good Job, good
Money, good House, best of t=
his and best of that and best of all that. we
seldomly say to god "without"=
 folded hands that God tussi great Ho.
Mujhe kuch nahi chahiye....tujhe kuc=
h chahiye to bol...chal tujhe main mera
pyaar deta hu tu bhi kyaa yaad kare=
ga ki kis rais se paalaa pada tha"

=C2=A0

Swami
Vivekananda every time cr=
iticized the words sins and sinner in some Christian
prayers. He at that ti=
me always spoke of amrutasya putra. When your approach is
not correct how y=
ou will have good interaction and desired results? When we
stand in front o=
f god should we get bog down by our dharana [=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=
=A4=A3=E0=A4=BE]? See krupa and daya i.e.
blessings and mercy are two diffe=
rent things. When we call GOD we want HIM with
his krupa and when one begs =
he only wants alms with no need of donor=E2=80=99s
existence. I understand =
Narsimha as per my intellect though I am not of great
IQ but our scriptures=
 consider four purusharthas manily dharma, artha, kama, moksha. So where th=
e question of beggars as I
already wrote these are Jiva rights. =C2=A0If
we=
 are beggars Lord krushna might have instructed arjuna to beg kingdom to
de=
vatas, duryoghana instead of fighting for it. Our prayers for all worldly
p=
leasures is not a part of begging but inbuilt instincts of mahamaya as this=

whole world is her own glory and that is why in gita krishana say =E0=A4=
=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=83 =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=
=B8=E0=A5=81 =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8C=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=82.=C2=A0 GOD is
sh=
adagunnesharya =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=A1=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=
=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF. We always see all deities=

with lot of ornaments which explain the real theme of vedic dharma =E0=A4=
=B8=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BF =E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=
=81=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=
=A4=E0=A5=81. =C2=A0

Yes Narasimha is in
Hurry. He has a finite life and t=
here is a lot to start just like Vivekananda
was in a hurry! But rest assur=
ed that hurry is also due to wish of Chandi and
Narasimha, in my opinion, h=
as become one of the best instruments of
Jagadamba!!!

=C2=A0

Yes, I fully=
 understand
and whole heartedly appreciate Narsimha=E2=80=99s guidelines fo=
r doing sadhana on own
but that does not mean to propagate wrong ideas or t=
o interpret scriptures in
this way. And why I am saying this is clear from =
my comments regarding generic
mantra and focus of mind.

Dear Utpal, either=
 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =
=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=87
=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A0=
=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=83 or =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=
=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=
=A4=E0=A5=87
=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=
=A7=E0=A4=83=E0=A5=A4 To be
frank all this brain exercise is having very li=
ttle spiritual value and doing
sadhana for self realization is the key and =
that is the sole aim of all shruti,
smriti. But I posted an objection only =
to request all members to have real
understanding of true nature of above m=
entioned imp points as for me
materialistic world is a part and parcel of o=
ur existence; so materialistic
desires also.

=C2=A0

were/are explained earlier. Still I repe=
at partially what I wrote to rajarshi
again; - If we say priest must have s=
hakti how can we count his nature of
shakti in terms of quality, quantity, =
depth and need? Should we consider shakti
to beget baby, remove diseases, g=
ive immense wealth is same?, how to
differentiate priest with and without s=
hakthi, most imp who will differentiate
this, what are the parameters to de=
fine this, what are the tools to understand
all these subtle points, etc wi=
ll be the complex issues before yajamana/us when
he/we think of doing any r=
emedy. Do we have any universal system for this? If
you think over these is=
sues you will come to know the truth. If a priest
perform a puja every thir=
d day he must have at least tons of shakti to give
results. Only person who=
 is in unmani/trans avashta can have such a huge shakti
and I think such pe=
rson will not use his power to wash sins of so many people
unless asked by =
his superiors to do this. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
