Homo Ensophicus



OMG ! I don't know why I did it but for curiosity I pum=
ped Homo
Ensophicus into the Google search engine and it took me to places =
you
don't want to go :- )  About seven or eight search pages of it. And
inc=
luding some of the murkiest groups on the internet :- ) Oh dear it is
funny=
 innit. Try it and see what you come up with.  You will have to
shut your e=
yes and ears to some of it; well, the naughty bits anyway :-
)))



When I =
coined this term for the next level of Homo Incarnate, back
whenever it was=
, it was plainly the best and most fitting name to give
it =96 Homo Ensophi=
cus =96 Man that walks this earth in the
knowledge of what they are and whe=
re they came from (at root) and why we
are here.  This is not something whi=
ch is worked out rationally, it is
something which we find in the Ground of=
 our Being =96 that Perennial
Understanding/Wisdom. Thus, Homo =96 Man; Ens=
ophicus =96 In Wisdom.
It is Latent in everybody, but is has to come into c=
onscious awareness.
Preferably in early maturity; as a young adult.



How =
does this process of integration happen?  What does one have to do?
They al=
l ask that question.



All I can say on that for sure is by way of a Radio=
 analogy. Is your
radio a finely tuned piece of equipment?  Does it pick up=
 weak and
distant signals and modulate them and amplify them adequately to =
get a
good clear audio signal?  We are much like that in analogy, and in
ef=
fect. What is it that the real mystics have going for them?   Hyper
Sensiti=
vity.  The more sensitive you are then the more you can pick up.



Some ar=
e born hyper sensitive. I was and I have known others who were.
But can som=
ebody make themselves more and more sensitive?  That is the
question isn't =
it. My answer to it is yes they can, if they allow it
to happen to them. Bu=
t hyper sensitivity can also hurt. Oh, indeed it
can and it does at times. =
But running from it instead of facing it head
on and living with it and dig=
esting is exactly what DEPOTENTATION of
experience is all about =96 See Dr =
Susanne V Brown's paper on
this.  So, we have to POTENTIATE all our experie=
nces (good or bad)
digest them and let them synthesise in both our consciou=
s and
subconscious. It takes time. Experience is all we ever have and
exper=
ience is not for nothing; it is the food by which we learn and
grow. We mus=
t not hide from it or shut it out. And when you have to
laugh then laugh, a=
nd when you have to cry then cry. Get it done.  Homo
Erectus came and went.=
 Homo Sapiens came and is on the way out. Homo
Ensophicus is here now in sm=
all numbers as yet, but she/he is coming. It
will not come with a bang, it =
will just creep up on people, and society
will change. Evolution =3D REVOLU=
TION !



Anyway, they are going to have to call the New Model of Man by so=
me
name. Let it be Homo Ensophicus. And let us endeavour to live up to it. =

Man is worth it, and all this stuff is invested in us anyway. And we owe
i=
t to what we are. Not a debt to be paid, but a responsibility to be
lived u=
p to. Get to it. NOW !



Use this name Homo Ensophicus. Get it known. They=
 will get used to it in
time to come.
