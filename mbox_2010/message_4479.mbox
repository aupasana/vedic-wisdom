 Two Parsi ladies arrived from Ahmedabad and spoke with Bhagavan.

L.: Bhag=
avan, we have been spiritually inclined from childhood. We have read
severa=
l books on philosophy and are attracted by Vedanta. So we read the
Upanisha=
ds, Yoga Vasishta, Bhagavad Gita, etc. We try to meditate, but there
is no =
progress in our meditation. We do not understand how to realise. Can
you ki=
ndly help us towards realisation?

B.: How do you meditate?

L.: I begin by=
 asking myself `Who am I?' and eliminate the body as not `I',
the breath as=
 not `I', the mind as not `I', but then I am unable to proceed
further.

B.=
: Well, that is all right so far as the mind goes. Your process is only
men=
tal. Actually all the scriptures mention this process only in order to
guid=
e the seeker to the Truth. The Truth cannot be directly indicated; that
is =
why this mental process is used. You see, he who eliminates all the
`not-I'=
 cannot eliminate the `I'. In order to be able to say `I am not this'
or `I=
 am That', there must be the `I' to say it. This `I' is only the ego,
or th=
e `I'-thought. After the rising up of this `I'-thought, all other
thoughts =
arise. The `I'-thought is therefore the root thought. If the root
is pulled=
 out, all the rest is uprooted at the same time. Therefore seek the
root `I=
'; question yourself: `Who am I?'; find out the source of the `I'.
Then all=
 these problems will vanish and the pure Self alone will remain.

L.: But h=
ow am I to do it?

B.: The `I' is always there, whether in deep sleep, in d=
ream or in the
waking state. The one who sleeps is the same as the one who =
is now speaking.
There is always the feeling of `I'. If it were not so you =
would have to deny
your existence. But you do not. You say: `I am'. Find ou=
t who is.

L.: I still do not understand. You say the `I' is now the false =
`I'. How am
I to eliminate this wrong `I'?

B.: You need not eliminate any =
false `I'. How can `I' eliminate itself? All
that you need do is to find ou=
t its origin and stay there. Your effort can
extend only so far. Then the B=
eyond will take care of itself. You are
helpless there. No effort can reach=
 It.

L.: If `I' am always -- here and now -- why do I not feel so?

B.: Wh=
o says that you do not? Does the real `I' or the false `I'? Ask
yourself an=
d you will find that it is the false `I'. The false `I' is the
obstruction =
which has to be removed in order that the true `I' may cease to
be hidden. =
The feeling `I have not realised' is the obstruction to
realisation. In fac=
t, it is already realised. There is nothing more to be
realised. If there w=
ere, realisation would be something new which did not
yet exist, but was to=
 come about in the future; but whatever is born will
also die. If realisati=
on is not eternal, it is not worth having. Therefore,
what we seek is not s=
omething that must begin to exist but only that which
is eternal but is vei=
led from us by obstructions. All that we need do is to
remove the obstructi=
on. What is eternal is not recognised as such, owing to
ignorance. Ignoranc=
e is the obstruction. Get rid of it and all will be well.
This ignorance is=
 identical with the `I'-thought. Find its source and it
will vanish.

The `=
I'-thought is like a spirit which, although not palpable, rises up
simultan=
eously with the body, flourishes with it and disappears with it. The
body-c=
onsciousness is the wrong `I'. Give it up. You can do so by seeking
the sou=
rce of `I'. The body does not say: `I am'. It is you who say `I am
the body=
.' Find out who this `I' is. Seek its source and it will vanish.
