Namaste

I thought of sharing this recent article. One of the largest solar=
 storms in recent times has started occuring starting from the sunday of la=
st week and this solar storm is directly aimed at earth unlike the previous=
 ones.

I have read previously articles from Vedic astrology gurus on the 1=
1 yr period of solar cycles and effect on earth. I personally feel maybe th=
is is also in line with the changes taking place and descent of some good s=
ouls onto earth in the coming decade. Solar storms affect human beings a lo=
t since they can generate huge geomagnetic fields.

Article is below.

Spectacular Northern Lights Show Signals Sun Is Waking =
Up

Skywatchers at high latitudes could be in for a spectacular tre=
at of northern lights, the aurora borealis, Tuesday and Wednesday: After a =
relatively quiet stretch, it appears the sun is ramping up its activity.

T=
he sun's surface erupted early Sunday, blasting - tons of plasma (ionized a=
toms) into space. These atoms are headed toward Earth and could create a st=
unning light show in the process.

"This eruption is directed right at us a=
nd is expected to get here early in the day on Aug. 4th," said Leon Golub o=
f the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. "It's the first major Ea=
rth-directed eruption in quite some time."

The solar eruption, called a co=
ronal mass ejection, was spotted by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory , whi=
ch captures high-definition views of the sun at a variety of wavelengths. S=
DO was launched in February and peers deep into the layers of the sun, inve=
stigating the mysteries of its inner workings. 


We got a beautiful view o=
f this eruption," Golub said. "And there might be more beautiful views to c=
ome if it triggers aurorae."

Views of aurorae are usually associated with =
Canada and Alaska, but even skywatchers in the northern U.S. mainland are b=
eing told they can look toward the north Tuesday and Wednesday evenings for=
 rippling "curtains" of green and red light.

rom space]

When a coronal mass ejection reaches Earth, solar particles str=
eam down our planet's magnetic field lines toward the poles. In the process=
, the particles collide with atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's at=
mosphere, which then glow, creating an effect similar to miniature neon sig=
ns.

The interaction of the solar particles with our planet's magnetic fiel=
d has the potential to create geomagnetic storms, or disturbances in Earth'=
s magnetosphere. And while aurorae are normally visible only at high latitu=
des, they can light up the sky even at lower latitudes during a geomagnetic=
 storm.

The sun's activity usually ebbs and flows on a fairly predictable =
cycle. Typically, a cycle lasts about 11 years, taking roughly 5.5 years to=
 move from a solar minimum, a period of time when there are few sunspots, t=
o peak at the solar maximum, during which sunspot activity is amplified.

T=
he last solar maximum occurred in 2001. The latest minimum was particularly=
 weak and long- lasting. The most recent solar eruption is one of the first=
 signs that the sun is waking up and heading toward another maximum.
