Hello biswa,
Here are some tips which may help.
1. +1/-1 hours from sunrise=
/sunset are good time to do the homam as per Narasimha. It is good if you s=
tick to same time for doing homam everyday.
2. You can purchase ready made =
havan samagri from Arya samaj mandir. It costs 40 Rs/Kg. here in nagpur and=
 it is of very good quality. 1Kg of this samagri can be used for some time.=

3. I use wood sticks for homam which costs Rs 10/Kg. I generally find the =
fire getting weak during the time of tarpana/bali during homam. For that yo=
u may put some coconut pieces to keep the fire burning. You can use coconut=
 pieces to keep the fire burning for more time.
4. My general=C2=A0experien=
ce=C2=A0is that Brahmacharya is an important activity in any sadhana especi=
ally in case of Ganapati ji and Hanuman ji.
Hope this helps.
Thanks,

4. Is there any practical methods to keep the fire more times in the hom=

5. Is there any cost=
