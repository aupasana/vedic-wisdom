Namaste,

   There is a total lunar eclipse on 21DEC2010, a good time for =
Tarpanam,
Homam and Meditation.

   Timings of Greatest eclipse (middle of =
totality) :-

          13:46 IST, 08:16 GMT, 03:16 EST (Early morning of 2=
1Dec in US).
Start and end are 2.45 hours before and after the Greatest poi=
nt (i.e
the eclipse will start at around at 11.00AM IST and will end at 4.3=
0PM
IST, similar is the case with other's).

   BTW, this eclipse is a rare=
 astronomical coincidence of Lunar Eclipse
and winter solstice (and that sh=
ould make this more auspicious if i am
not mistaken), the last this happene=
d was around 500years back.

   Details: http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH=

Thanks,
