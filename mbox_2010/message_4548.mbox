Dear Esteemed and Learned Members,

Please help provide details on how to perform the ANGA NYASA &  KARA NYASA  for invocation as part of the Durga homa.

Narasimha-ji has mentioned in the homa manual that if we don't know it,  then we can just leave it out, but I really wish to learn and use this.

I would really appreciate any information or links to information on this.

Many thanks!

Warmest Regards,
Thirugnanam
