 The following conversation took place on January 2, 1942 when some visitor=
s
from North India, well versed in Hindu Sastras, visited Sri Ramanasramam.=


Visitor: If the ultimate Reality is one and absolute, why does the world
=
appear as an object, seen as different from the subject who sees it? Who is=

it that sees the object as distinct from himself, the subject?

Maharshi: =
Who is it that is putting this question?

V.: One who seeks the Truth.

M.:=
 Who is he?

V.: He who desires to know the Truth.

M.: Instead of having a=
 mere desire to know the truth, if he has the
anubhava (experience) such qu=
estions as these would not arise.

V.: True, after Realization they cannot =
arise. But until he has the
experience, he has not only the desire for it, =
but also some doubts
regarding the nature of the ultimate Reality. Hence ar=
ises the question, why
the world should appear as an object different from =
the subject who sees it.
I do admit that the question has significance only=
 until the desire for
Realization is fulfilled. But till then, the question=
 remains, and it has to
be answered.

M.: That there is no answer to your q=
uestion is the only answer, because the
question does not really arise. In =
order to know the truth, you who seek to
know it should exist as such, i.e.=
, as yourself, the primal being. It is
therefore yourself that you should k=
now in the first instance. It is of you
that knowledge or ignorance is pred=
icated.You said you do not know the Truth
and desire to know it. Instead of=
 engaging your mind with such thoughts as
"I know," "I am ignorant," etc., =
you should direct it towards the enquiry as
to what the 'I' itself is. Thro=
ugh such enquiry you will find, as a matter
of experience and not merely as=
 something to think and argue about, that
what remains alone and absolute i=
s the Self. So that your question, viz.,
why the world should appear as an =
object seen by a subject, cannot and does
not at all arise. A question that=
 does not arise cannot have an answer.

V.: How then should I know the 'I'?=


M.: By investigation into this question itself, and thereby will you get =
the
experience or Atmanubhuti. The ardent desire to know the Truth has a
be=
neficial purpose to serve until one has such experience.

V.: Mental activi=
ty during meditation does not seem to converge at a point,
as it should, on=
 the object of meditation and it does not stay there but
gets diverted into=
 numerous thought channels. Why is it so? How can the mind
be made to overc=
ome this tendency towards diffused thinking and attain its
Primal State of =
freedom from thought?

M.: It is the mind's attachment to objects, constitu=
ting the non-self that
makes the mind wander about during meditation. There=
fore, the mind should be
withdrawn from the non-self, and an effort should =
be made to fix it in
Self-enquiry. All extraneous thought is effectively el=
iminated when you
attune the entire mind to the one question: "Who is it th=
at is making the
enquiry?"

V.: In spite of having come to the definite con=
clusion as a result of one's
investigation that 'I' has no essential relati=
on with the non-self, i.e.,
with the body, senses and the objects perceived=
 by the senses, the mind
persists in going after these very same things whi=
ch constitute the
non-self. What is it due to and how can it be remedied?

=
M.: It is due to lack of abhyasa and vairagya. When Self-enquiry has become=

steady through practice, and the spirit of renunciation firm through
convi=
ction, your mind will be free from the tendency of thinking about the
non-s=
elf.

V.: How can I gain steadiness in practice?

M.: Only through more pra=
ctice.
