Allow me to share a few thoughts. It might be my half baked theory and for=
give me for any mistakes beforehand.<br>
<br>
Doctors and Scientists agree =
after a decade of research that the body has a bio magnetic field associate=
d with it.The Brain MRI is based on this principle. We also have very tiny =
cell potentials across all the cells in the human body. <br>


<br>
The blo=
od flows from the heart to various organs and the direction is usually top =
to bottom. From Faraday's law of electromagnetism which we studied in h=
igh school.If you place your thumb in the direction of the flow of current =
the fingers when wrapped will point the direction of the magnetic field. Th=
e pranic current is in the same direction as blood flow.<br>


<br>
That is=
 why the Shirshasana which reverses the blood flow is highly praised in yog=
a. Anywaz with the direction of flow of blood we get a North pole orientati=
on for the head and south pole orientation for the feet.<br>
<br>
Like pole=
s repel and hence if you place your head in the Northern direction you migh=
t experience more dreams due to the opposing poles and hence disturbed slee=
p.<br>
<br>
The ancients beleived in spiritualizaiton of sleep since a aver=
age human being spends a lot of time in sleep. Hence could have advised the=
 southern direction to avoid this.<br>
<br>
Many scientists now are agreein=
g that Quantum theory applies to Biology as well. Recently there was an art=
icle in MIT technology review on Quantum entanglement keeping DNA strands t=
ogether. Erwin Schrodinger the father of modern quantum physics was hugely =
influenced by Vedanta and gave us the Wave equation as a result of that ins=
piration.<br>


<br>
Science is still an imperfect tool to measure somethin=
g as subtle as consciousness but might be getting close...<br>

om thoughts.<br>
