ALTHOUGH Thayumanavar lived less than 300 years ago and remains the most
po=
pular Tamil poet-saint, there is no authentic record of his date of birth
o=
r death. What is known to have transpired between these two events can be
s=
ummed up briefly:

At an early age he began working in the service of a kin=
g. When the king
died he left this work because of the amorous advances of =
the king's widow.
He then travelled in search of a Guru. At Tiruchilapalli =
he met Mouna Guru
Arulananda Sivachari. He asked to be taken as a disciple,=
 but the saint
answered 'chumma iru', meaning 'be still' or 'be quiet' or '=
just be' (a
phrase which Ramana Maharshi also used on a number of occasions=
). However,
the saint said that when the time was ripe he would initiate hi=
m.

Thayumanavar then returned home and married. Soon after his wife delive=
red
their first child, a boy, she died. That again prompted Thayumanavar to=

leave home in answer to his spiritual calling. He once more approached
Aru=
lananda Sivachari and, true to his word, the guru fulfilled his promise
and=
 initiated Thayumanavar into sannyas.

Thayumanavar followed the discipline=
 of silence (mouna), which he describes
as: "that state which spontaneously=
 manifests after the annihilation of the
ego." He says: "It is a state beyo=
nd light and darkness, but it is called
light, since language is inadequate=
 to express it. The ego disappears and
'I' spontaneously manifests in full =
glory." The Maharshi particularly
singled out this verse of his for admirat=
ion.

Thayumanavar was equally great as a saint and a poet. Often he would =
retire
to the forest or public gardens and remained for days absorbed in th=
e bliss
of the Self. Legend has it that he was sitting thus, immobile in sa=
madhi in
a public garden in Ramnad when the gardeners, not noticing him, pi=
led a heap
of dry leaves and twigs about him and set fire to it, and thus h=
is body was
consumed and he merged in the Supreme.

Thayumanavar's key teac=
hing is to discipline the mind, control desires and
meditate peacefully. He=
 went on to say that "it is easy to control an
elephant, catch hold of the =
tiger's tail, grab the snake and dance, dictate
the angels, transmigrate in=
to another body, walk on water or sit on the sea;
but it is more difficult =
to control the mind and remain quiet".

Ramana Maharshi was often heard quo=
ting from his exquisite verses. The
following are ten verses especially sel=
ected by the Maharshi:

1 & 2. The individual ego known as "I" having manif=
ested and troubled
everyone, the universal Maya, the diversifying agency, s=
pontaneously follows
in its wake. Who can possibly describe the vast ocean =
of misery consequent
upon it? It appears as the flesh, the body, the senses=
, interior and
exterior, as the all pervading ether, air, fire, water and e=
arth, as
mountain, forest, huge visions like hills physical and subtle, as
=
forgetfulness and memory, and so on, rising up wave after wave and beating
=
against man, bringing pleasure and pain, which are the result of his past
a=
ctions, and also their remedies known as creeds, religions, God-Seeker, and=

the testimonies and sanctions found in various sciences, and explained by
=
logic. All these are more numerous than even the fine grains of sand on the=

seashore.

3. Unaccountable troubles crop up spontaneously, sheaf upon she=
af. How to
root them out wholesale, even as burning up a hill of camphor wi=
thout
residue in a vast blaze of fire? In order to achieve this miracle, an=
d to
enlighten me, Grace took shape. In every respect, like my self, eating=
 and
sleeping, suffering and enjoying, bearing a name and born somewhere, i=
t
appeared as the Silent Guru, like a deer used to decoy another of its
spe=
cies.

4. And claimed my body, possessions and life itself and consistently=
 with
the process of elimination, signified "you are not the five senses no=
r the
five elements, nor the limbs, nor the mind, nor their attributes, nor=
 all
these collectively, nor the body nor knowledge nor ignorance. You are =
pure
consciousness, unassociated like a crystal, but reflecting the backgro=
und to
lookers-on; whereas we (guru) are only the inherent nature revealing=
 the
truth on finding you ripe for it."

5. "If eager to reach Consciousnes=
s-Bliss-Eternity innermost in all, which
is also the inner abode of refresh=
ing Grace, listen to the course I
indicate. May you reach the Pure Heart an=
d abide there forever! May dense
ignorance vanish for you! May you attain t=
o Bliss-Consciousness! May bondage
cease for you!" Communicating thus,

6. =
"And dispensing the true knowledge of the Natural and Unique Silence
which =
destroys all bondage and where there is no meditation nor the ego, no
space=
, no time, no direction, no association, no elimination, no
differentiation=
, no expression, no phenomena of night and day, no end, no
beginning, no mi=
ddle, no interior or exterior, nor an aggregate of all
these."

7. (The Gur=
u indicated further) that, though all these are eliminated, "It"
is not voi=
d, but is Natural, Eternal Be-ing inexpressible by words, not
manifesting a=
s ego, but is the Reality engulfing all, having swallowed all
ignorance lik=
e day covering night, and absorbing unhindered all knowledge,
metamorphosin=
g the person into Itself, It shines in Silence, Self-effulgent;

8. With it=
s emergence, It prevents any other from appearing; and all else is
put out =
suddenly like burning camphor blown away without residual flicker or
glow; =
and in its place It shines beyond the senses, and apart from the
knower, kn=
own and knowledge; and yet It is there, though who can speak of it
and to w=
hom? For if It arises, the individual is metamorphosed; It will
assert Itse=
lf (Literally: It Speaks Itself),

9. (And further on), if it is said to be=
 "It," the question arises "which,"
though such doubt about the non-dual On=
e is illogical; so transcending it
also, King Janaka or Suka and others rem=
ained like the bee intoxicated with
honey in that state. (The same Guru's) =
blessing helped me to reach it. Grace
is needed in order to reach the Nirvi=
kalpa Samadhi and attain absolute
Bliss. I will not rest nor attend to my w=
ants until I attain it.

10. On the "I" idea of the individual ego vanishin=
g, there springs up within
me a current of "I-I" endless indeed. This confe=
rs bliss engulfing all my
knowledge, unique and transcendental, ending in S=
ilence! How then can
Silence be expressed?
