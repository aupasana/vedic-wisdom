Dear Girish,

Congratulations on your first Chandi Homam. May SHE bless you=
 in your
sadhana.

Swami Ramakrishna used to often advise that sadhana shou=
ld be done in
private. He meant that the sadhana should be kept away from t=
he glare of
other persons and after the person has attained a certain stage=
 of
realization, he can then talk about his sadhana to other people.

For e=
very one experience of Narasimha, there are probably 10 or 20 such
episodes=
 he has not narrated in public forums. For one Manikarnika ghat
experience =
of Manish, there are probably 10 such experiences we have not
heard about h=
im.

So bottomline is dont worry or get carried away by your experiences. A=
s
Narasimha emphasizes often, faith, sincerity are the keys to achieving
pr=
ogress. Keep your head level and continue in your sadhana. Ultimately GOD
w=
ill come and talk with you....thats strictly between you and HIM/HER.

best=
 regards
Hari

the fire in the homa kundam gave me goose pimples all over and I was thinki=
