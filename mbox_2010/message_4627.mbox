 The following is an excerpt from questions and answers exchanged between
B=
hagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and Sri D. C. Desai at Sri Ramanasramam,
Tiruva=
nnamalai, South India, on August 8, 1944, at 9 a.m. and published in
the Oc=
tober 1969 issue of the Mountain Path.

D: I am often baffled and depressed=
 during or outside my meditation by
thinking that there are millions of sou=
ls who are either quite ignorant or
quite innocent, and are suffering intol=
erable pains and tortures in this
world, e.g., (a) starvation of the poor b=
y famine, poverty or unemployment;
(b) pain and suffering through diseases =
of ignorant people caused by
ignorance of laws of hygiene, diet or poverty;=
 (c) bombing of innocent women
and children; (d) suffering through floods, =
earthquakes, etc., of innocent
and poor persons; (e) killing of animals for=
 food; (f) insects and lower
animals being eaten up by higher animals in na=
ture, and so on. I try to
convince myself that all this must be due to thei=
r bad karma in past lives,
but doubts still arise as to how and by whom the=
ir freewill was so directed
as to force them to commit such actions. If it =
was due to desire, why or how
did they come to get it, or such tendencies o=
riginally? If it is due to
avidya, dehadhyas (body idea), etc., how can the=
y be held responsible for
the same?

M: First find out whether the ego exis=
ts, who is depressed by these
thoughts. Find out how you got the idea of th=
e body, solve this problem of
your ego, and then see if anything remains to=
 be solved.

D: Is it helpful in the enquiry to sit in siddhasana, keeping =
the spine
erect, sitting on deerskin, kushasana, etc. during the meditation=
, or are
they not quite necessary? Will they expedite the progress?

M: The=
 real asana is being established in the Self-Reality or the Source.
Sit in =
your Self. Where can the Self go and sit? Everything sits in the
Self. Find=
 out the source of I and sit there. Do not have the idea that the
Self cann=
ot be realized without the help of asanas, etc. They are not at all
necessa=
ry. The chief thing is to enquire and reach the source of the ego. These
de=
tails such as posture, etc., may distract the mind towards them or to the
b=
ody. D: Which books are most helpful in swadhyaya (self-study) during spare=

time (for quick training of the mind for the enquiry)?

M: You may read wh=
ichever book you like. Self (Atma) is the real book. You
can look into it w=
henever you like. Nobody can take it away. It is always at
hand, to be read=
. Hold on to your Self in your spare time also, and then you
can read any b=
ook.

D: If doubts, fears and worries harass me during meditation, how can =
they be
most effectively removed?

M: Ask yourself "To whom do these doubts=
, fears and worries occur?" and they
will vanish. Cease to pay attention to=
 them. Pay attention to the Self
within. Fears, etc., can only arise when t=
here are two, or when anybody else
exists apart from, or separate from, or =
outside of you. If you turn the mind
inward towards the Self, fears, etc., =
will disappear.

If you try to remove a doubt or fear, another doubt or fea=
r will arise.
There will be no end to it. The best method to annihilate the=
m is to ask "To
whom do they occur?" and they will disappear. Destroying a =
tree by plucking
its leaves one by one is impossible. Other leaves will gro=
w by the time you
pluck a few. Remove the root of the tree - the ego - and =
the whole tree with
its leaves and branches will be destroyed. Prevention i=
s better than cure.

D: Should I look for the source within the body?

M: T=
he ego arises within the body. Hence, in the first instance you may look
wi=
thin the body for its source. When you reach the source there will be no
in=
side or outside, because the source or the Self is all-pervading. After
rea=
lization everything will be inside the Self.

D: Is the source on the right=
 side of the middle line of the chest?

M: The Heart is defined as the plac=
e from which the I-thought arises.Heart
means the Centre (of consciousness)=
. It cannot be identified with any part
of the physical body.

D: What can =
I do to increase the receptivity of the mind to your spiritual
vibrations w=
hile sitting in the hall, and to increase the frequency and
duration of the=
 efforts at enquiry in the hall, or to ease such efforts?

M: Keep the mind=
 quiet. That is enough. Sitting in this hall will help you.
The purpose of =
efforts is to get rid of all efforts. The force will be
clearly felt when t=
he stillness is achieved. Spiritual vibrations exist
everywhere. They will =
manifest when the mind is stilled.

D: Will it be helpful if I gaze from ti=
me to time on your eyes or face
during the effort at meditation, or should =
I keep the eyes closed? If
closed, should I concentrate them on the ajna-ch=
akra, or deep down in the
heart? When practicing the enquiry at one's own p=
lace should the eyes be
closed or fixed on some object of devotion?

M: Loo=
k at your Self or Atma rather than anywhere else. The eyes may be kept
open=
 or closed. It is immaterial. There is only one I, whether you spell it
'I'=
 or 'eye'. There is no point in opening or closing the eyes. Attention
must=
 be focused on the inner 'I'. You are not an 'I' that can be opened or
clos=
ed. You may open or close the eyes according to your liking or
inclination.=
 It is immaterial, and not important. You will cease to think of
the world =
when you think of the Self. If you are in a room and close your
eyes and do=
 not look out, it is immaterial whether you close the windows or
keep them =
open. The body is the room; the eyes are the windows.

Looking at ajna chak=
ra, etc., is not necessary in this method. It may be
helpful in keeping the=
 mind from going out towards external objects.
Concentrate on the Self with=
out which there are no chakras. They do not
exist without you. You are all =
of them. All centres (chakras) are in the
Heart. The Heart is not the anaha=
ta chakra. The latter is in the spinal
cord. Heart is I.
