t *automatically* (i.e. using logical inference) mean that they *sense* the=
 contents of the chitta (i.e. the memory "aspect" of antahakarana). Or are =
you asserting that this is true? This is new information to me. It seemed t=
o me, from virtually all the sources that I have examined, that the manas i=
s the seat of "samkalpa/vikalpa" where I understand vikalpa to mean "to con=
ceive"/"form a conception of" (a memory/material object). Jnanendriyas woul=
d be one set of inputs to the manas (leading to the conception of ideas of =
pancha mahabuta reality i.e. "matter" in the western sense of the word), an=
d of course the other set of inputs would be memory or chitta (or at least =
a part of it). If what you imply is true (that all ideation necessarily goe=
s through jnanendriyas), then jnanendriyas would be awake in dream sleep. A=
re they? Also, then people would worship some symbolism of jnanendriyas in =
order to get deeper knowledge of their chitta. Is this correct too? In any =
case, how exactly is this relevant to the discussion at hand. Please elabor=
ate.

 If one self-identifies with the ENTIRE "dual consciousness", then one is a=

 consciousness.


Sundeep> Narasimhaji, you are playing word games with me.=
 The reason I coined "proto-matter" was specifically to bring clearly into =
view the logical quandary that exists in the notion of I - a concept that h=
as validity/basis ONLY in the "world" of dual consciousness. You seek to sw=
eep that VERY distinction back under the carpet, and no wonder you lose sig=
ht of the question I ask. Ok, so I'll let it go. Then we're back to square =
one: Who/what is this "one" that is absorbed in non-dual consciousness? Qua=
ntify it exactly, please.

 self-identification is symbolized by one's Kundalini shakti. When Kundalin=

ne's self-identification is refined further and further. 

Sundeep> Narasim=
haji, quantify this "one" please? What are the boundaries of this "self ide=
ntification". When you say self identification, you implicitly, unbeknownst=
 to yourself, are creating a distinction between an inner I and an outer I.=
 When the inner I assumes that the outer I is part of itself, you call it s=
elf identification. When it doesnt, you call it self knowledge. I want to k=
now what this inner I is in vedic terms. Is it simply Ahamkara? Is Ahamkara=
 a single indivisible entity - either there or not there? Is it conscious o=
f itself - list, in vedic terminology, the quantities/materials/things it i=
s conscious of, and how those quantities change as kundalini rises? Is it (=
Ahamkara) the one that enters into NVKS, or does it progressively decay as =
it becomes more conscious of itself (in which it case it is not an indivisi=
ble entity)? If you agree with the preceding statement, then Ahamkara, AND =
CONSEQUENTLY THE SUBJECT/EXPERIENCER/OBSERVER, terminate upon reaching NVKS=
, thereby not leaving a "one" who can come out of the NVKS.

 others, current time, past and future etc. One identifies with 

Sundeep> =
In order for the correct logical exposition of your ideas, you must define =
in terms of vedic terminology, who this "one" is that is identified with th=
e entire dual consciousness. You imply some hazy form of expanded individua=
lity - which needs to be brought out of the haze of implied understanding. =
Name and quantify (in vedic terms) the contents of that individuality.
