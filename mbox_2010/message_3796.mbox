Namaste,
=C2=A0
I have a few basic queries. 
=C2=A0
What is the line betwee=
n control and gratification? Everything, it is said, is a Rna. If there is =
a Rna, can it be avoided? My=C2=A0limited=C2=A0understanding of Karma says =
in this law there is no mercy, but only action/reaction. Either you pay the=
 rna or you burn the rna through sadhana. 
=C2=A0
So, if an individual is i=
ndulging in any kind of sense pleasure (sex for example) is he/she merely f=
ullfilling his/her Rna, or in the process is he/she creating new Rnas? If h=
e/she has to=C2=A0 fullfillingf the Rna, how can control ever work? Every d=
ebt has to be paid. And how does one know the fine line between paying debt=
 and creating a new one?
=C2=A0
If by exercising ones will power, an indivi=
dual is able to avoid paying a rna, what happens then? Will the Mother forc=
e the soul to reincarnate only to pay off that debt? And in that case what =
happens to the debts that soul has/had with other souls during past lives?
=
=C2=A0
Karma is too complex!

Dear Narasimha and others,
=C2=A0
Just further to o=
ur conversation on this topic last night,
If one looks into the mind, one f=
inds that sex is associated with naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a=
 woman or man of the opposite sex in a different way. This comes from milli=
ons of janmas and samskaras. 
=C2=A0
My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used=
 to say=C2=A0in a slightly different context that he believes in Sampradaha=
 or incineration.
I applied it to this as well and it works quite well.=C2=
=A0
Two things=C2=A0are going to be=C2=A0useful, 
1. Continue your mantra d=
uring the act and it will act as a continuation of your sadhana.
2. If your=
 partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure i=
nitially. As time goes on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks of sex =
is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as=C2=A0may =
be the case)=C2=A0body is like a landscape picture just like any other pict=
ure made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not b=
e disturbed by it, you can certainly=C2=A0feel that the picture=C2=A0is ver=
y beautiful=C2=A0but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta=
 Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...
Once this stage is reached then the mind =
ceases to think of sex all the while.
Yes you may still encounter it, but t=
hat is another story.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
It is perfectly fine to combine =
the sadhanas of different aspects of the Mother, including Lalita and Chand=
i.
=C2=A0
Sri Vidya consists of symbolic practices that eventually enable o=
ne to understand various layers of Maayaa surrounding true Self. The idea i=
s that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and apprecia=
tes it.
=C2=A0
Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the div=
ine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various wea=
knesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regu=
lar basis will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these wea=
knesses.
=C2=A0
There is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying t=
o fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maay=
aa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maay=
aa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. On=
e aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes S=
elf at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all t=

Aghora series books by Svo=
boda are good, but Aghora is not everyone's cup of tea. It is normal to hav=

=C2=A0
Ghora means terrible. Aghora means "not terrible".=
 One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does=
 not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent =
manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what i=
s permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.
=C2=
=A0
When someone dies, north Indians chant "Raama naam satya hai" while car=
rying the dead body to the funeral. It means "only the name of Lord Rama is=
 true and everything else is an illusion". The idea is to remind oneself th=
at life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. =
But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth =
only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thin=
g we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can't we tell ours=
elves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporar=
y illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary ill=
usions"? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, =
can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beauti=

we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusio=
ns. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"?"=

=C2=A0
A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama naam satya hai" always. His mind=
 rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on=
 them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking=
 about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what =
is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.

=C2=A0
Ved=
anta says "all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion". An aghora =
pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions a=
nd the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he =
can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=
=C2=A0But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiv=
ing Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manif=
estation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating=
 feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dwelling=
 on the impermenant manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it. A succ=
essful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the=
 fact that he is eating "feces" with certain properties and will not feel a=
ny kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Se=
lf.
=C2=A0
Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chant=
s vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean "I am Self and I am=
 consuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and no=
t be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on th=
e impermanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brin=
jal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on the p=
ermanent (Self).
=C2=A0
Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselv=
es the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and im=
pulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure =
results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentiv=
e in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a=
 Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty l=
addus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in =
Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even n=
ot-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the ot=
her hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of fe=
ces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a ver=
y bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.
=C2=A0=

However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone me=
rely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.=

=C2=A0
Take another simple example. Suppose someone=
 is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness=
 for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts =
in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's sadha=
na.
=C2=A0
A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind =
away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such th=
oughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if o=
ne keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination =
in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome th=
e fascination some minds may have for sex?
=C2=A0
An aghora will take it to=
 an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from =
the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (o=
ne pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such di=
stinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner=
 sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this m=
ay titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made=
 impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/=
years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he =
is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The associati=
on in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked p=
ictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evo=
ke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly =
rise in the head may not lead to denser and
 denser thoughts relating to se=
x and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to medita=
tion. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimat=
ely, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may =
be broken down. Overall, the person's fascination and weakness for sex may =
be gone largely.
=C2=A0
Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior exper=
iences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break =
down some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermi=
ne those structures.
=C2=A0
However, is this a fool-proof method? Not reall=
y. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice me=
rely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=
 thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not se=
rious/sincere/ ready to start with.

 is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high=

tical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by set=

Namaste=

Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi ho=
mam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are s=
ome people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandip=
ath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi hom=
am everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.

Integr=
ating various sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution=
. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize th=
e time spent on them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As =
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place ra=
ther than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.

One pos=
sibility is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti wi=
th various mantras one is attached to.

I am not that knowledgeable about S=
ri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a=
 symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purp=
ose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.

Lalita mean=
s gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teac=
hes you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern an=
d strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both =
are valid paths.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,

I am very much in awe aft=
er I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes=
 about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accompl=
ish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do =
sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 ti=
mes(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana =
etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I=
 sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1=
.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasan=
a different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya a=
nd how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahat=
mayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am=
 a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswa=
mi Dikshitar recently.

<DIV>What is the line be=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>So, if an individual is indulging in any kind of sense pleasure (sex for e=

<DIV>Dear Narasimha =
and others,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Just further to our conversation o=
n this topic last night,</DIV>
<DIV>If one looks into the mind, one finds t=
hat sex is associated with naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman=
 or man of the opposite sex in a different way. This comes from millions of=
 janmas and samskaras. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>My spiritual father "V=
imalananda" used to say in a slightly different context that he believ=
es in Sampradaha or incineration.</DIV>
<DIV>I applied it to this as well a=
nd it works quite well. </DIV>
<DIV>Two things are going to be&nb=
sp;useful, </DIV>
<DIV>1. Continue your mantra during the act and it will a=
ct as a continuation of your sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV>2. If your partner is will=
ing, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure initially. As tim=
e goes on, the thing in your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated a=
nd slowly you find that a naked female(or male as may be the case)&nbs=
p;body is like a landscape picture just like any other picture made by Her =
of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by i=
t, you can certainly feel that the picture is very beautiful =
;but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu,=
 tyaikiya.... ...</DIV>
<DIV>Once this stage is reached then the mind cease=
s to think of sex all the while.</DIV>
<DIV>Yes you may still encounter it,=
 but that is another story.</DIV>

c verses when eating food, which essentially mean "I am Self and I am consu=
ming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be f=
ully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impe=
rmanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinjal cu=
rry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on the permane=
nt (Self).</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telli=
ng themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every tho=
ught and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation whe=
re failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as =
an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person w=
ho chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and e=
ats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb t=

 (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal=
? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the =
taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure resul=
ts in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quic=
kly.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>Take another=
 simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and =
homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling on=
 sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causin=
g guilt and blocking one's sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A regular =
person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thou=
ghts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, su=
ch thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for=
 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not =
return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some mi=
nds may have for sex?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>An aghora will take it t=
o an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from=
 the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (=
one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such d=
istinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partne=
r sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this =
may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being mad=
e impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months=
/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he=
 is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The associat=
ion in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked =
pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but ev=
oke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly=
 rise in the head may not lead to
 denser and denser thoughts relating to s=
ex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to medit=
ation. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intima=
tely, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may=
 be broken down. Overall, the person's fascination and weakness for sex may=
 be gone largely.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Mind has a lot of conditioni=
ng based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora so=
metimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certain=
 practices that undermine those structures.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ho=
wever, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that th=
e person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex=
 everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everyt=
ime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start =
with.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>* =

<DIV> </DIV>Bottomline is that an aghora takes p=
roblems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, w=
hereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slo=
wly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.</D=

<DIV> </DIV>Like Mani=
sh said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is =
merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought pr=
ocess, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not s=
uitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people m=
ay feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill suc=
h an understanding brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perve=
rsion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversi=
on. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Agh=
ora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking by m=
aking failure very unpleasant.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>BTW, the follow=
ing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains the =
basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of aghora.</DIV=

<DIV>Dear Narasimhagaru,</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for your reply. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT f=
ace=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I understand that Chandi and Lalita ar=
e two different forms of the Universal Mother. But what I am trying to=
 understand is that how to worship both forms simultaneously. For =
;instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Di=
vine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), wh=
o was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis =
;mention great details about all the nine avaranas and different =
forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana. In the Dh=
yana Krithi of those, in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambik=
e, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'. That line tells me that even thr=
ough Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form. </DIV>
<DIV><F=
ONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>So my question was in that perspe=
ctive. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Se=
lf is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. </DI=
V>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I have started reading =
Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I sta=
rt to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I reall=
y cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mo=
ther will help me achieve my target. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by D=
r. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perh=
aps I need to read more! </DIV>

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Sanskrit is almo=
st like a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should=
 hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do n=
ot know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great diff=
iculty in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it =
takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.<BR><BR>Integrating various=
 sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general,=
 it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent =
on them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna P=
aramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig=
 one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.<BR><BR>One possibilit=
y is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with vari=
ous mantras one is attached to.<BR><BR>I am not that knowledgeable about Sr=
i Vidya. However, from the
 little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a=
 symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purp=
ose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.<BR><BR>Lalit=
a means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother wh=
o teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is st=
ern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).=
 Both are valid paths.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ --=

shekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to ab=

al times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate t=
hese along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Coul=
d you please explain what is sri Vidya
 and how it is to be learnt? I am ve=
