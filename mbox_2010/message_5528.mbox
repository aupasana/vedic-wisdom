Most people put divine avataras on a pedestal so that they need not
attempt=
 to emulate them. Your logic on the other hand, seems to want
to bring them=
 down simply to condemn them, under the pretense of being
even-handed. Unfo=
rtunately, your logic stinks of under-handedness.

Let us take him as an or=
dinary puruSha. Anyone who has read even a
portion of his works will see a =
highly logical intellect. He is
extremely consistent and thorough in his wr=
itings. Here, I find that
his writings don't fit the "old grammarian story"=
, and yet, the
writing itself (moha-mudgara-stotram) is quite consistent. T=
he most
logical conclusions are that either (a) he is not the author, and /=
 or
(b) we've forgotten the context. There are many possibilities, but
base=
d on his other writings, these are the most plausible.

lities - it is a likely that what people took 12 years in Shankara's times =

So, you will be able to provide example=
s of people whose skill can
rival a traditional 12-year-Pandita within 3 mo=
nths? I truly wish you
the best of luck.

> my constitutional rights will b=
e upheld in any court of law

Adi shankara provided his teachings, and care=
fully pointed out the
adhikArii. You, who are not an adhikArii, fail to rea=
d his warning
label, overlook it when it is shown to you, and then somehow =
equate
his non-teaching to you as an infringement of your rights. Strange,
=
indeed.

> It is more than obvious that pANiNi had no influence on Adi Shan=
kara

A lot of things that are obvious to you, are laughable to me. And, I
=
do have some minuscule amount of skill with both the samskrit language
and =
Paninian grammar.

This is likely to be my last post in this thread.
