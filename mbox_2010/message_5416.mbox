Namaskar,
    Since I rarely open this mailbox, my reply is very very delay=
ed. Firstly, I would ask Mr. Lalit to post on the vedic-wisdom group, becau=
se posting to the mailbox is not beneficial for anyone.
    Could you pleas=
e inform us more on the path of Guru-gorakhnath ? Does he have a living lin=
eage ?
Regards,
Aryama

Guru Gorakhnath's life and phi=

 he wishes to become a guru, should take care in saying in tune of declarat=
ion - "Actually, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical i=
mmortality, will sound silly".
 
A Siddha knows whats siddhi and for him th=
ere is no extreme, whereas an A-ssidha living in limitations knows well abo=
ut extremes, this is his personal perception nothing else thus it's advised=
 that must do sadhana before plaing a guru.

oring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedantin of today, we can see that=
 vedanta in fact does not say physical body is to be ignored. It asks us *r=
ealize* that we are not the physical body and we are something else residin=
g in a shell called the physical body. What we truly are, can neither be cr=
eated nor be destroyed, though physical body may perish. But, if someone cu=
rrently thinks that one is a physical body, one cannot simply ignore the ph=
ysical body. One has to *use* the physical body to eventually realize that =
one is not the physical body. A mere intellectual statement of it is not ta=
ntamount to its realization.

a Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action (karma) and know=

nored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to perform the *right action=

Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bha=

kshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga=
 Swami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swam=

ards to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the =
