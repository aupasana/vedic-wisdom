 "It may be asked, 'How has Satchidananda become so hard?' This earth does
=
indeed feel very hard to the touch.The answer is that blood and semen are
t=
hin liquids, and yet out of them comes such a big creature as man.
Everythi=
ng is possible for God.

First of all reach the indivisible Satchidananda, =
and then, coming down,look
at the universe. You will then find that everyth=
ing is Its manifestation. It
is God alone who has become everything. The wo=
rld by no means exists apart
from Him.

"All elements finally merge in akas=
a. Again, at the time of creation, akasa
evolves into mahat and mahat into =
ahamkara.In this way the whole
world-system is evolved.It is the process of=
 involution and evolution. A
devotee of God accepts everything.He accepts t=
he universe and its created
beings as well as the indivisible Satchidananda=
.
