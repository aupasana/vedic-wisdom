Namaste Anna

Interesting question although asked to Narasihma, it made me =
think too and somethings that came to my mind.

Good karmas and bad karmas =
are always present, I believe
Mother is always neutral, she lets the laws o=
f karma
take care of it. She does intervane on many occassions in accordanc=
e with the laws of karma or intervanes when prayed sincerely.

Best Regards=

Mitesh
