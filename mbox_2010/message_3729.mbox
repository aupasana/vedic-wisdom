Dear Biswajit, namaste

These are the words of a person who has attained a very high state of
realization. In the context of your questions, please reflect well on the
following lines and they will answer all your doubts.

"People should do sadhana. Don't waste time when you are on earth. Never
give the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can.
If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit
down and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana or the other for
as much time as you can. Don't worry about the results, but keep doing
sadhana to the best of your ability."

best regards
Hari
