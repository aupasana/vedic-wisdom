 17. To those who do not know the Self and to those who do, the body is the=

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. But to those who do not know the Self the =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99 is bounded by the body;
while to those who within the body know t=
he Self the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 shines boundless.
Such is the difference be=
tween them.

18. To those who do not know and to those who do, the world is=
 real. But to
those who do not know, Reality is bounded by the world; while=
 to those who
know, Reality shines formless as the ground of the world. Suc=
h is the
difference between them.

19. The debate, =E2=80=98Does free will =
prevail or fate?=E2=80=99 is only for those who do
not know the root of bot=
h. Those who have known the Self, the common source
of freewill and of fate=
,have passed beyond them both and will not return to
them.

20. To see God =
and not the Self that sees is only to see a projection of the
mind. It is s=
aid that God is seen by him alone who sees the Self; but one
who has lost t=
he ego and seen the Self is none other than God.

21. When scriptures speak=
 of =E2=80=98seeing the Self=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98seeing God=E2=80=99, wha=
t is the
truth they mean? How to see the Self? As the Self is one without a=
 second,
it is impossible to see it.How to see God? To see Him is to be con=
sumed by
Him.

22. Without turning inwards and merging in the Lord =E2=80=
=94it is His light that
shines within the mind and lends it all its light =
=E2=80=94 how can we know the
Light of lights with the borrowed light of th=
e mind?

23. The body says not it is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. And no one says, =
=E2=80=9CIn sleep there is no
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D When =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99 arises all (other) things arise. Whence this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =
arises,
search with a keen mind.

24. The body which is matter says not =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99. Eternal Awareness rises not nor
sets. Betwixt the two, bo=
und by the body, rises the thought of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. This is
the knot=
 of matter and Awareness. This is bondage, jiva, subtle body, ego.
This is =
samsara, this is the mind.

25. Holding a form it rises; holding a form it =
stays; holding and feeding on
a form it thrives. Leaving one form, it takes=
 hold of another. When sought,
it takes to flight. Such is the ego-ghost wi=
th no form of its own.

26. When the ego rises all things rise with it. Whe=
n the ego is not, there
is nothing else. Since the ego thus is everything, =
to question =E2=80=98What is this
thing?=E2=80=99 is the extinction of all =
things.

27. =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 we are, when =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has no=
t arisen. Without searching whence the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99
arises, how to a=
ttain the self-extinction where no =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 arises? Without
atta=
ining self-extinction, how to stay in one=E2=80=99s true state where the Se=
lf is
=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99?

28. Controlling speech and breath, and divin=
g deep within oneself =E2=80=94 like one
who, to find a thing that has fall=
en into water, dives deep down =E2=80=94 one must
seek out the source whenc=
e the aspiring ego springs.

29. Cease all talk of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =
search with inward diving mind whence the
thought of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 sp=
rings up. This is the way of wisdom. To think, instead, =E2=80=98I
am not t=
his, but That I am,=E2=80=99 is helpful in the search, but it is not the
se=
arch itself.

30. When the mind turns inward seeking =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=
=80=99 and merges in the Heart,
then the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 hangs down his=
 head in shame and the One =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 appears as Itself.
Though it=
 appears as =E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99, it is not the ego. It is Reality, Perfec=
tion,
the Substance of the Self.

31. For him who is the Bliss of Self aris=
ing from extinction of the ego,
what is there to do? He knows nothing other=
 than this Self. How to conceive
the nature of his state?

32. When the Ved=
as have declared, =E2=80=98Thou art That=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94not to seek and =
find the
nature of the Self and abide in It, but to think =E2=80=98I am Tha=
t, not This=E2=80=99 is
want of strength. Because,That abides for ever as t=
he Self.

33. To say =E2=80=98I do not know myself=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98I h=
ave known myself=E2=80=99 is cause for
laughter. What? Are there two selves=
,one to be known by the other? There is
but One, the Truth of the experienc=
e of all.

34. The natural and true Reality forever resides in the Heart of=
 all. Not to
realize It there and stay in It but to quarrel =E2=80=98It is=
=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is not=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It has
form=E2=80=99, =E2=
=80=98It has not form=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is one=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is=
 two=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99, this is
the mischief of may=
a.

35. To discern and abide in the ever-present Reality is true attainment=
. All
other attainments are like powers enjoyed in a dream. When the sleepe=
r
wakes, are they real? Those who stay in the state of Truth, having cast o=
ff
the unreal =E2=80=94will they ever be deluded?

36. If we think we are t=
he body, then to tell ourselves,=E2=80=98No, I am That=E2=80=99, is
helpful=
 to abide as That. Yet =E2=80=94 since ever we abide as That =E2=80=94 why =
should we
always think, =E2=80=98I am That?=E2=80=99 Does one ever think, =
=E2=80=98I am a man=E2=80=99?

37. =E2=80=98During the search, duality; on =
attainment, unity=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94This doctrine too is
false. When eagerl=
y he sought himself and later when he found himself, the
tenth man in the s=
tory was the tenth man and none else (ten men crossed a
stream and wanted t=
o make sure they were all safe. In counting, each one
left himself out and =
found only nine. A passer-by gave each a blow and made
them count the ten b=
lows).

38. If we are the doers of deeds, we should reap the fruits they yi=
eld. But
when we question, =E2=80=98Who am I, the doer of this deed?=E2=80=
=99 and realize the Self,
the sense of agency is lost and the three karmas =
slip away. Eternal is this
Liberation.

39. Thoughts of bondage and of free=
dom last only as long as one feels, =E2=80=98I am
bound=E2=80=99. When one =
inquires of oneself,=E2=80=98Who am I, the bound one?=E2=80=99 the Self,
Et=
ernal, ever free,
remains. The thought of bondage goes; and with it goes th=
e thought of
freedom too.

40. If asked, =E2=80=98Which of these three is f=
inal liberation: With form, without
form, or with-and-without-form?=E2=80=
=99 I say,Liberation is the extinction of the
ego which enquires =E2=80=98W=
ith form, without form, or with-and-without-form?=E2=80=99
