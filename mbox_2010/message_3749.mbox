My humble two cents is that homa performed as suggested in this group, done=
 with the specific purpose of material attainment is fraught with danger. A=
s has been said before ad nauseum, to achieve specific material desires one=
 needs to be perfect in pronounciation and intonation, materials offered ne=
ed to be pristine and all the rituals need to be followed precisely. And of=
 course as Narasimha has emphasized the sadhak needs to be satwik and have =
some accumulated spiritual energy.

My suggestion is do it with the feeling=
 of pleasing Lord Mahaganapthi. Do it for his pleasure. Do it for Him to be=
stow His grace on you. Do it with an attitude of thankfulness for what you =
have. Do it with the feeling of gratefulness for what you already posses fo=
r things can always be worse. And then sit back and watch as Lord Mahaganap=
thi showers his grace and blessings. If you cultivate the above attitude co=
nsciously it will permeate your subconsciousness and your homam will be tha=
t much more better. As one of the stalwart of our group Rajarshi has aptly =
said keeping working persistently on your devotion to Mahaganapthi.

God do=
es not need our prayers, homas or japam. And He cannot be bribed either. Bu=
t if performed with humility and loving devotion He might accept it.

Not p=
ontificating at all but I have been performing homas regularly for the last=
 several months and can attest to the powerful effects on one's attitude, p=
ersonality and overall thinking.

Regards,
Alok.
