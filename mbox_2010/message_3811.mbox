Here's a snippet from one of Narasimha's old posts. I have put in bold
what I think is most relevant to the present quandary:

My understanding of this is that, if a liberated person performs an
action, then the phala/rna associated with that action belongs to the
universe/Nature (since they identify with nothing less) and not to them
individually. Thus the rna owed by the second (unliberated) person is
owed not to the first individual, but to the universe/Nature. The
universe/Nature will find a way for them to have to repay it. But the
first person will not have to be there at the time. Thus they are free
of any karma associated with the exchange.

If both persons were not liberated, then presumably the rna would be
specifically between the two of them, and they would have to meet again.

Just my two cents - feel free to ignore :)

Best wishes,

Samir
