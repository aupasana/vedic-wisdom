There are some inaccuracies in the below description of Sri Aurobindo Ashra=
m by Shri. Balram Reddy. Moreover, his understanding of Sri Aurobindo's wor=
k seems to be very superficial and mistaken. It is surprising to see that a=
fter being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo's teachings with physica=
l immortality.

It is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobi=
ndo and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy se=
ems to confuse his imaginations for facts.

There were several instances wh=
en Mother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying=
 they are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yo=
ga. I know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Mahari=
shi sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path =
of Integral Yoga. 

It is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have sa=
id something specific to Balaram Reddy to help him come out of his guilt co=
nsciousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his=
 Guru. We need to take Balaram Reddy's recollections and opinions (especial=
ly his assumptions and interpolations) with a big pinch of salt.
