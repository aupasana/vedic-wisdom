 Talk 201.

The Parsi ladies asked for an illustration to explain why the S=
elf,though
ever-present and most intimate, is not being realised.

Maharshi=
 cited the stories of

(1) Svakanthabharanam katha - the story of the neckl=
ace, on the neck itself,
not being detected;

(2) Dasama - of the ten fools=
 who counted only nine, each of them omitting
to count himself;

(3) the li=
on=E2=80=99s cub, brought up in a herd of goats;

(4) Karna not knowing his=
 real parentage and

(5) the king=E2=80=99s son brought up in a low-class f=
amily.

They further asked for Maharshi=E2=80=99s opinion of Sri Aurobindo=
=E2=80=99s Yoga,and his
claim to have probed beyond the experiences of the =
Vedic rishis and the
Mother=E2=80=99s opinion of the fitness of her discipl=
es to begin with the
realisation of the Upanishadic rishis.

M.: Aurobindo =
advises complete surrender. Let us do that first and await
results, and dis=
cuss further, if need be afterwards and not now.
