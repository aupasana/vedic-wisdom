 45. A wise man should not give up the body out of aversion to it. Know tha=
t
when once the prarabdha karma (result of accumulated actions) which was
r=
esponsible for the creation of the body ceases, the bodily burden will
auto=
matically fall off.

46. The Consciousness which shines as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99 in the Heartlotus is pure
(flawless) and perfectly steady (without a tr=
ace of movement). By destroying
the ego, which rises (from that Consciousne=
ss), that Consciousness itself
bestows the supreme joy of liberation. Be su=
re about it.

47. With great devotion meditating constantly that =E2=80=98I=
 am that Siva the form
of the one Consciousness that is always unsullied by=
 any adjunct,=E2=80=99 dispel
all your attachments.

48. Giving up all noti=
ons about country, caste, blemishless community,
asrama (status as a bachel=
or, family man, ascetic or one who has renounced
the world) and associated =
matters, hold on to and practise always meditation
upon the Self, your own =
natural state.

49. I alone am. No one belongs to me; nor do I belong to an=
yone else. I can
see no one who can call me his; neither can I see anyone w=
ho is mine. I am
all alone.

50. Know that the person who experiences the f=
irm conviction, =E2=80=98I am the
Supreme Brahman, I am the Master and Lord=
 of the Universe!=E2=80=99 is the real
mukta (one who has attained liberati=
on), and that the one following
conflicting paths is in bondage.

51. The d=
ay one is able to see oneself with his inner eye as not the body,
all his d=
esires vanish, and he experiences perfect peace.


52. He who is described =
in the scriptures as the unborn and Lord, I am He,
the Atman (Self), who is=
 forever without form or qualities. There is
absolutely no doubt about it.
=

53. I am pure Awareness, immaculate, perfectly liberated;and forever prese=
nt
everywhere. I am indeterminable. No one can grasp me or leave me. I am f=
ree
from sorrow. I am always brahmamayam (of the nature of Brahman).

54. I=
 am the Self which is Consciousness, absolute completeness, deathless
and s=
elf-established, and which is other than this insentient body, limited
betw=
een the top of the head and the sole of the foot, and which, beginning
with=
 the antahkaranas (the inner instruments such as mind and intellect) is
bou=
nded by the covering of the skin.

55. Thinking, =E2=80=98I am the Lord of =
all creations, moving or stationary, I
remain as father, mother and father=
=E2=80=99s father for the universe=E2=80=99, aspirants
for mukti contemplat=
e with concentration and ardour only upon Me, who am
that great turiya stat=
e (the substratum of the waking, dream and sleep
states).

56. I am the one=
 who is worshipped through sacrifices and penances by all
celestial beings =
beginning with Brahma (the Creator), the heavenly damsels
who are themselve=
s sought after, humans, yakshas, gandharvas, nagas and
other groups of supe=
rhuman beings, and also by many others. Know that
everyone worships only Me=
.

57. By many kinds of rare austerities and charities,everyone worships on=
ly
Me. Know that this vast creation, moving and stationary, and all objects=
,
are nothing but Me,
the Infinite One.

58. I am not the gross body, nor a=
m I the subtle body. I am also not the
causal body. I am the kinsman of the=
 universe. I am the One who is of the
nature of transcendental knowledge. I=
 am moreover the eternal One, the Lord,
the taintless One,the One who is de=
void of the states (of waking, dream and
sleep), the One who is devoid of t=
he universe.

59. The beginningless Consciousness is unborn, whole and, res=
iding forever
in its natural home of the Heart-cave, is without form, world=
 or impurity.
It is beyond comparison and completely unattached. It cannot =
be comprehended
by the mind nor can it be seen or felt by the senses.

60. =
Repeatedly see thus: =E2=80=98I am He, the eternal, omnipresent Reality whi=
ch is
Brahman=E2=80=99. Meditating thus for a long time,whoever abides impe=
rturbably will
become the Supreme Brahman, thereby attaining immortality.

=
61. Having thus explained the nature of knowledge to enable everyone to
att=
ain liberation, which is always available, I shall now proceed to
describe =
the conduct to be adopted by seekers. Noble Lady, listen to them
calmly.

6=
2. O Queen among women! Know that bathing in holy waters, repeating holy
na=
mes or words (mantras), performing daily homa (sacred offering in
specially=
 prepared fire),worship, other oblations in lustrous fire, or any
other mea=
ns (sadhana) to be followed after great study, are never required
for him (=
the earnest aspirant seeking liberation).

63. Niyamas (strict rules of con=
duct such as what to eat,when to eat, how to
eat, what to wear, where to si=
t and so on),worship of deities in sacred
places, nama archanas (worship of=
 deities by reciting sacred names), pitru
karmas (oblations,etc., carried o=
ut for the sake of forefathers to help them
reach a high state), pilgrimage=
 to holy places which have come forth on
earth, and observance of great vow=
s, are all not for him (the earnest
aspirant), if considered deeply.


64. =
He does not reap the fruit of actions, good or bad. Important dates and
spe=
cial observances zealously followed by the world are not for him. Give up
a=
ll actions and all kinds of worldly codes of conduct.

65. Renounce complet=
ely all religious edicts and disciplines. Since all
kinds of action result =
in bondage, give up all action plans, mental
conflicts, and attachment to o=
ne=E2=80=99s caste duties.

66. Even if the aspirant acquires many kinds of=
 supernatural powers and
magical powers such as visualising what is buried =
underneath the earth, and
can demonstrate
them before the world, he should =
give up mental attachment to them.

67. All these (powers) are only bondage=
s to the individual soul. Further
they drag one to follow a low path. The s=
upreme joy of liberation does not
lie in any of them, but only in the Infin=
ite Consciousness.

68. One must engage unfailingly in yoga (the practice o=
f Self-abidance) in
all conditions, without allowing any special event to a=
ffect one adversely.
If, due to doubts, delusion arises in the form of attr=
action to worship in
holy places and temples (on account of past practices =
and vasanas), reject
it immediately.

69. Listen to me, Lady! Know that onl=
y the wise man who never does anything
which leads to the destruction of an=
y form of life, such as insects, worms,
birds or plants, is a person who is=
 seeking true knowledge.

70. He (the true aspirant) should not pull out te=
nder roots (of fragrant
plants, which is often done for worship); he should=
 not even pluck the
leaves; he should not harm any living thing out of ange=
r; he should not
heartlessly pluck even flowers.


71-72. He should worship=
 Lord Siva using only flowers that have fallen
naturally. He should not ind=
ulge in vile practices such as marana (causing
destruction through the use =
of certain mantras) uchadana (driving one out
with the force of mantras), v=
idveshana (causing mutual hatred between
friends), the well known sthambana=
 (freezing one=E2=80=99s capabilities), causing
fever, putting into action =
evil spirits,causing agitation, wrongly taking
control of others, attractin=
g and infatuating others, and so on. Abandon the
worship of stones, wooden =
objects and similar articles.

73. Having relinquished the great mudras whi=
ch are adopted in order to fix
the mind on the devatas (deities) residing i=
n holy places and temples, and
the associated
sacrifices, get rid of the va=
sanas also which may have accumulated on
account of such practices in the p=
ast, and cling only to the Self, the
all-pervading real Consciousness.

74.=
 Maintain a neutral attitude towards all things; do not get infatuated
with=
 anything; maintain equanimity whether in happiness or suffering; be the
sa=
me to friends and enemies; treat alike a broken piece of mud pot and a
piec=
e of gold.

75. Know that a flawless yogi is one who does not ever allow hi=
mself to be
swayed by desire for the pleasures of the senses, who frees him=
self at heart
from mamakara (treating things as =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99), wh=
o has a steadfast mind, who is
free from desires and fear, and who always r=
evels in the Self.

76. Being unaffected by either praise or slander, treat=
ing alike all
creatures, he should always unfailingly maintain an equality =
of vision (sama
drishti), considering all living beings in the world as him=
self.

77. Avoid unnecessary arguments and worldly associations. Do not cre=
ate
misunderstanding among others.Do not join religious bodies well versed =
in
many scriptures (sastras). Give up both words of abuse and words of prai=
se.

78. Gradually and completely get rid of jealousy, slander,pomp, passio=
n,
consequent hatred, desire, anger, fear and sorrow.

79. If a man is free=
 from all the pairs of opposites and always lives in
Solitude (established =
in himself alone), he gains perfect wisdom even while
in the present body a=
nd shines forth with great effulgence.

80. Liberation is attained only by =
knowledge (jnana). By other powers
(siddhis) such a fruit is unattainable. =
However, aspirants become enchanted
with blemishful worldly
enjoyments and =
thaumaturgic powers (siddhis) and go after them with desire.

81. Know that=
 the pure flawless person will experience that blemishless Lord
(the Suprem=
e Brahman) and positively attain liberation whether attended by
the superna=
tural powers or not.

82. The body is a form constituted of the five elemen=
ts (earth, water, fire,
air and ether). The one all-pervading Siva is also =
nicely seated there.
Hence the entire universe,right from the indivisible a=
ll-pervading Sivam
(the highest and most abstract tattva or principle) to t=
his world, is the
form of Shankara.

83-84. My dearest, earnest seekers who=
 see the enlightened one and worship
him with all the three instruments (mi=
nd, speech and body) in unison,
offering him with
heart-melting love, sweet=
-smelling sandal paste, fruits,flowers, incense,
good water to bathe, cloth=
es and food, will thus attain liberation. Know
that those who worship that =
jnani reap the fruit of his righteous deeds and
those who slander him reap =
the result of his sins.

85. I have revealed the truth about knowledge and =
the conduct pertaining
thereto, as you have asked. This entire path is inde=
ed Kalottara Jnana (the
knowledge to be revealed at the final stage of matu=
rity). Tell me, O Lady,
if you want to ask anything more.
