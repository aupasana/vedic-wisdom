Dear Rajarshida,

I want to express my view in this context...Its may or ma=
y not be correct but its only my opinion...all external rituals/mantra/fast=
ing etc. etc. are fine tunings to adjust, to prepare our mind to believe an=
d eventually release the power we have...All powers resides within ourselve=
s...mind should realize first having those powers...

Dr. Mani Bhowmik's bo=
ok "CODE NAME GOD" is very very useful for some kind of spiritual understan=
dings...Bengali version of the book "BIGYANE ISHWARER SONKET" bu Ananda Pub=
lications are already available on the market. 

bhalo thakben
