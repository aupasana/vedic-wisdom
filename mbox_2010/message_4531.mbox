What is a god or a goddess?  Know Thy Self.  Don't try detachment
from mon=
ey in a world which uses money for the exchange of labour, your
children ha=
ve to eat and have clothes to ware. You need enough to get by
on here. The =
idea of detachment with things is silly, they need to be
danced with and lo=
ved. Life is good. Books might help if you need them
but you don't get expe=
rience from books, you get it from life and
living it. Study your self and =
study life. Same thing. You do not HAVE
life, you are it.

I am practising detachment from money. During this process I have
fr=

immediate=

is like offen=

desire. So how t=

connected to that =
Goddess and have seen her visions almost all my life
and don't wish to hurt=
 her in anyway. I am also sorry if my question
sounds silly but whatever I =
am today is only because of your teachings.
I don't have much spiritual kno=
wledge and neither do I get time to read
books. I rely completely on your t=
eachings and any words of wisdom
coming from you would be of great help. Ki=
