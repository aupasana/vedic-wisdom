Namaste Bhupendra ji,

It seems I was made to write these messages for you =
:)

Sir, I am also equally dumb and I may not be able to help you in unders=
tanding. But whatever little, right or wrong, I have understood I will be h=
appy to discuss it with you. I hope I will also get to learn in the process=
. You can email me if you are comfortable.

About learning 'in between the =
line' content I have felt that method to decode the content is also written=
 in Aghora itself. Although it take time to understand the method but it is=
 neither difficult nor impossible.

Just a couple of minutes before reading=
 your query I opened Tarapeeth bhairav to continue my reading. Usually I re=
ad in afternoon when work load is very less. But today I was inclined to re=
ad as soon as I reached hospital. I read only few lines and then was inclin=
ed to turn on the internet. below are the few lines I read (translated to E=
nglish keeping the basic words in hindi)

"Vamakhepa, Telanga swami and Ram=
akrishna Paramhansa were Brahma, Mahesha and vishnu of this yuga, respectiv=
ely. These saints may have left their body but they are still present here.=
 Their karma, bhakti, gyan and loveable suksham sharir is still present in =
sacred land of India. and their presence is felt in name, pictures, idols a=
nd songs. But for feeling them one need Shudha Bhakti, Nishkapat saralta, V=
ishwaas and chit ki ekagrata"

I hope these lines will help you in your que=
st.
With the grace of Maa Tara.

Regards
