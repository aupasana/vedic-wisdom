I would like to thank you for all your k=
ind and effective advices. I would like to know that usually I do Navratri =
puja in the evening so can I do the Homam in the evening ?
=A0
One more thi=
ng I am a lady so can I do Chandi Homam? I just Love ma Durga as I love my =
own mother for which I feel she can not harm me until unless I do something=
 very wrong in my conciousness. I am married and till now no child.
=A0
Ple=
ase let me know till now I have not done any homam on my own but want to do=
 from my heart. I have a bit more interest in Religious follows and want to=
 learn but here people are so much commercial that I do not think any body =
( atleast the pandit ji I know) will tech me, and they may say something fo=
r which my husband will get scared and will not allow me anymore. So now wh=
en God has given me the chance to get help from=A0a guru like you I=A0do no=
t want to miss the chance.

As far as I am concerned I=A0am deciple of S=
ri Sri RamKrishan Param Hansa and got Diksha from Ramkrishna Math on 07-01-=
2003 ( I remember the date as because just after my diksha my life changed =
like a Magic)

e a lot of hope that I will get genuine advice from you=A0
