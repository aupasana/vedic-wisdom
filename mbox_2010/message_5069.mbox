Namaste Aditi and all the members,

Vedic-Wisdom, in my opinion, silently a=
nd effectively doing very important work of removing a lot of mis-conceptio=
ns regarding Sanatan Dharma. Many members/non members who have gone through=
 the wealth of messages of this group would have surely benefited and found=
 light. their confidence would have been surely cemented in philosophies an=
d practices of Hinduism/veda Dharma/Sanatan Dharma.i am sure such work is d=
one by many other Groups and organisations as well.
vomits of Kripals and W=
endys have no chance whatsoever. Only Kali knows what she will do with the =
author of "Kali's child" who described Thakur as Homosexual pervert.


i ac=
tually wonder as to which is a lot who can get carried away by writings suc=
h as "Kali's child"?

What could be the effective way to counter evil deisg=
ns of people like Kripals? Why and how such people get big platforms for th=
eir rubbish? one thing for sure is that their work must not get entry in to=
 University/schools. 
Aditiji - I thank you and your team of editors and ot=
hers for the effort. Would you please write me personally so that i can get=
 the book asap in Dubai.

Warm Regards and wish you a very Happy Navaratris=
!

Utpal
