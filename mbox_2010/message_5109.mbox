Namaste everybody,

I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few tim=
es. Frankly, i found it routine because i found that i know all these alrea=
dy as he has so many times mentioned these things  and then it suddenly occ=
oured to me that he has given answer to a very very crucial query which kee=
p on haunting many people and confuse people a lot. I am obviously talking =
about "Initiation" and he has really given an answer to this greatly confus=
ing phenomina. I am reproducing this again below. for me i am completely sa=
tisfied with simple but very effective defination. i would draw attention o=
f members to following paragraph again:

[
(3) If you want to do Chandipath=
 or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of "I ha=
ve several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because =
of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and =
not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want=
 to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress". You ar=
e then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiat=
ion!
]

So Its a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sense! I know he'=
ll not like my post but what can I do? I like him as i like Thakur and Sach=
in Tendulkar :)

Best Regards,

Utpal

ave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruit=

ne good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gentl=
y and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the pe=
rson is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of ro=
tten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits =
will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. T=
he deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give yo=
u a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Gana=
pathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but =
the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kal=
i or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.=

>  
> At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity's creations, bu=
t fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would've had to eat each=
 of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!
>  
> Nevertheless, =
one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoi=
ding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If ini=
tiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a =
practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiatio=
n. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of you=
r own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you ar=
e weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.
>  
> (5) Some people who never l=
it a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam=
 now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first t=
ime just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati e=
veryday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienc=
ed some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana=
 of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.

that spiritual progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted t=

some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the=
 past. Previous life's sadhana itself is one's adhikara.
