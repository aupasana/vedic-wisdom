Namaskar to you
As per policies laid down here=C2=A0and by the order of Shr=
i Narasimha whom I respect very much I shall not argue on what you have pos=
ted below specially point no.2,perhaps you don't know that shakthas see Amb=
aal in every women with no age bar.It is tough for me to see comments on Sh=
ri Adi Shankaracharya without full stop from you.For me it is sin to read s=
uch things and I cannot continue reading them.
With this comment I am withd=
rawing my membership from group,Thanks and wishing very best to everyone he=

namaste,

1. A web site that has probably the better translati=
on of Shankara's significant works is - These references are from my person=
al e-library colleced over the past 10 years and occupies more than 80 GB! =
Sone of the websites may have given up ghost but you can always "search eng=
ine" for items of interest.

Bhagavad Gita with Sankara Bhashya 
Translated=
 by Swami Gambhirananda 

Presented here is the Bhagavad Gita with the comm=
entary of Sri Adi Sankaracharya translated by Swami Gambhirananda. This is =
one of the most important and revered works of Sri Sankaracharya along with=
 his commentaries on Brahma-Sutras and Upanishads. Together called as "Pras=
tana Traya" bhashya, these commentaries by Sankaracharya forms the central =
basis for the Advaita philosophy that he propounded

www.bharatadesam.com\s=
piritual\bhagavad_gita\bhagavad_gita_sankara_bhashya.htm

2. I am uploading=
 searchable saundarya lAhiri, and viveka chuDamani trascribed and translate=
d by somebody or the other overseas and NOT in INDIA - This is xample of my=
 collection of entire works of Shankara. I do wish those that choose to was=
te their time and talk non sense on Shamkara wake up from their drugged sta=
te and learn Sanskrit and Grammar - and read Shankara - else put up a golde=
n image of Peter Schreine that entered and translated the Saundarya Lahiri.=
And try to browbeat elderly people - And try to tell them they cannot tell =
their 70 year old wife - that she is the most beautiful thing on earth and =
the greatest thing that happended in their lives when on so called death be=
d. And to forget the veda mantra and vows taken for 7 lives.
