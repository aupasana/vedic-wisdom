 On 10th May 1946, Krishna Jivrajani said to Bhagavan:

During Sadhana I fe=
el that something is going up. Is that right or should it
go down?

Bhagava=
n: Never mind, whether something goes up or down.Does it exist
without you?=
 Never forget that. Whatever experience may come, remember who
has the expe=
rience and thus cling to "I" or the Self.

Jivarajani: Suppose there is som=
e disturbance during meditation,such as
mosquito bites, should one persist =
in meditation and try to bar the bites
and ignore the interruption or drive=
 the mosquitoes away and then continue
the meditation?

Bhagavan:You must d=
o as you find most convenient. You will not attain mukti
simply because you=
 refrain from driving the mosquitoes away. Nor being
denied mukti simply be=
cause you drive them away. The thing is to attain is
one pointedness and th=
en attain mano nasa. Whether you do this by putting up
with the mosquito bi=
tes or driving the mosquitoes away is left to you.If you
are completely abs=
orbed in your meditation, you will not know that the
mosquitoes are biting =
you.Till you attain that stage why should you not
drive away them away?

(R=
ecall Bhagavan Ramana staying inside the Patalalingam shrine for many days
=
and when He was lifted and brought out, the devotees found His thighs oozin=
g
blood with insect and scorpion bites and there was puss formation too!)
