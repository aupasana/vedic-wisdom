Yes=
 Sir, if this is the reason then its understandable. Infact, There are seve=
ral people close to me have started reciting Chandi in regional lagnuages a=
s suggested by me. hence practically, its the same as you suggested. Howeve=
r i feel that at some point its better to be able to recite Sanskrit verses=
.
***
You have already written a very detailed account wherein i got some i=
nformations which i never knew.

Only one opinion i wish to know from you i=
s about "Satsanga". you have given the prime importance to that over everyt=
hing else.
Narasimha Garu has few times repeated that "Pavaka" is a yogi an=
d living god. when one does Homam everyday, He/she actually gets a very eff=
ective Satsanga with a Yogi called Agni-The Pavaka.
In that sense, Homam is=
 also a ritual which automatically provides you with much required Satsanga=
 as well. Whats your opinion on this.

Please take your time!

Best Regards=
,

Utpal

 has raised an important question regarding the necessity of initiation. I =
will address it after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked =
in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firs=
tly is the question a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the qu=
estion is whether initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life =
or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necess=
ity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, th=
e answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.
> > 
> > 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as the =
tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multi=
ple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the p=
an-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current cont=
ext of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are relev=
ant to the discussion.

e great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES p=
articular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstrac=
t truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant m=
ethods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.
> > For those who are p=
redominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external=
 guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and =
experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the =
methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita bein=
g essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik=
 practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important =
practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a mar=
ginal role for external practices.
> > 
> > Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (=
self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-a=
ttachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana'=
 (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina =
schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to niri=
shwaravada.
> > 
> > Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional =
acceptance of Iswara's will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the =
contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhaga=
vad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the main=
stay of Karma marga of the Gita.
> > 
> > Finally I will address the Tantri=
c path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation=
 and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the pr=
acticalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through=
 the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab =
experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be=
 remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at vari=
ous levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is =
to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path=
 invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, ano=
ther the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya=
 and so on.
> > 
> > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with the fire o=
f Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs hig=
hly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great empha=
sis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualificati=
on. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision=
? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other l=
ab experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apar=
t from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However =
the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the S=
akti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sak=
ti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain fr=
om further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless d=
etails here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.
> > 
>=
 > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it w=
ithin the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river with=
in the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhan=
as comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are=
 full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikul=
a and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya=
 sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vaj=
rayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are fa=
miliar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of S=
ri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sak=
ta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.
> > 
> > Kali kula *predominantly* =
invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predomina=
ntly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritu=
al journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a=
 particular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineag=
es. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particu=
lar spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compar=
ed to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk a=
rises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively down=
ward till the individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can vis=
ualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity.=
 It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the =
circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short ci=
rcuit. Imagine many beautiful
 bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted =
tree of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in sil=
ent practice all the way up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Lig=
ht (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.
> > 
> > As alr=
eady stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consc=
iousness through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnan=
a, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved i=
nto highly comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously =
hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic=
 approach. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like th=
e Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Man=
trasastra. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following t=
he Tantramarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those=
 who explore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevan=
t which I have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are alread=
y inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for im=
mensely powerful reflections through its central message
 of Oneness. The c=
rest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Dev=
i Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one wit=
hout a second, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there be=
sides me?" (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads a=
nd reflect on the central truth of Advaita.
> >

he non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is becaus=
e understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when =
one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follow. The=
 main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic t=
ext too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chand=
i is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially th=
e four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Ve=
da Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice =
of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method =
will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fa=
ct even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on an=
d DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu te=
mple.
> > 
> > Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part =
of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are =
those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mant=
ra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its o=
wn principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path =
of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even t=
he Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise =
Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidi=
k practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these appro=
aches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living an=

ginally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to=
 Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it=
 Sri
 Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.

> >

Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and S=
ATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular=
 self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the =
texts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. A=
s for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyay=
a is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not p=
ossible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid=
 progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted stat=
e by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sa=
dhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath =
made a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsan=
gha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.

o Utpal ji's question.<BR>> > <BR>> > Utpal ji has raised an im=
portant
 question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it =
after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to unde=
rstand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the quest=
ion a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whethe=
r initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my*=
 answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being ini=
tiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=
=82=E2=80=93YES.<BR>> > <BR>> > 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as t=
he tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and mu=
ltiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In th=
e pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current c=
ontext of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are re=
levant to the discussion.<BR>> > <BR>> > a. Gnana marga
 (Advai=
tic/Vedantic)<BR>> > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)<BR>> > c.=
 Mantra marga (Tantric)<BR>> > d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)<BR>>=
; > e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)<BR>>=
 > <BR>> > Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of t=
he great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES =
particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstra=
ct truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant =
methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.<BR>> > For those=
 who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even th=
e external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the w=
isdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita empha=
sises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Ad=
vaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it
 has retained=
 the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an=
 important practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way=
 with a marginal role for external practices.<BR>> > <BR>> > Yo=
ga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vair=
agya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally=
 emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara=
) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first =
two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.<BR>> > <BR>> > Bhakti =
marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will =
through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Kar=
ma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in action=
s without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the G=
ita.<BR>> > <BR>> > Finally I will address
 the Tantric path of=
 mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=
eby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=
ation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=
oyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=
t and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=
ed that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=
s, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=
e-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=
employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =
fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=
n.<BR>> > <BR>> > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with t=
he fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra em=
ploys highly powerful techniques that bring
 results more quickly it lays g=
reat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=
ualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=
upervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=
ny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=
edure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=
. However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awake=
ning the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kun=
dalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will =
refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other =
needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampa=
ra.<BR>> > <BR>> > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, o=
ne has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sad=
hana is one major river within the
 Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas =
cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually=
 three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dash=
aMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs=
 to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the =
picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to =
Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw atten=
tion to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advait=
ic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.<BR>>=
; > <BR>> > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma =
is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least =
at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mant=
ra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchroni=
stic frequencies for each of
 these three lineages. Initiation is the full-=
fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of th=
at path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with=
 SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-=
branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sa=
dhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern m=
etaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric =
advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the c=
onduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautif=
ul bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where th=
ere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =
till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabd=
a). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.<BR>> > <BR>> > As already state=
d Sakta sadhana seeks
 to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness =
through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana=
, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highl=
y comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the =
many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach=
. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanish=
ads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra=
. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantra=
marga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who expl=
ore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I=
 have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already incline=
d to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely p=
owerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel=
, the crowning
 glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself=
 proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a se=
cond, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?=
" (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflec=
t on the central truth of Advaita.<BR>> > <BR>> > The reason I =
advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language =
is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible o=
nly when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully fo=
llow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic an=
d Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri =
Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, espe=
cially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras =
or the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the =
practice
 of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Ved=
ic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic pract=
ice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully b=
ased on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with th=
e Hindu temple.<BR>> > <BR>> > Just as some practitioners do th=
e Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with th=
e Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do=
 the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that n=
eeds initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if o=
ne adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abh=
yasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devout=
ly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not incline=
d to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit fr=
om
 any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to be=
ar in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as wel=
l as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent o=
riginally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of init=
iation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<BR>> > <BR=
>> > In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the m=
erthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarap=
ranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all=
 effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc.,=
 some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioner=
s. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spirit=
ual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involv=
es Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer
 to t=
he question has to be contextualised.<BR>> > <BR>> > Finally on=
e last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA a=
re the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-stud=
y of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. Thi=
s is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATS=
ANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the a=
lternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. I=
t is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress =
in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtu=
e of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and s=
ants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a qua=
ntum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ram=
akrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.<BR>>
 > <BR>&=
gt; > For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I=
 will just quote Swami Sivananda:<BR>> > QUOTE // "There is a complai=
nt by householders nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame=
 excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there=
 is a sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable =
law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your=
 threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion an=
d unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste y=
our time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopel=
ess slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I ca=
nnot get good Satsanga.'... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then =
come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will pu=
t you in the right path, guide you and elevate you to
 sublime heights. The=
se "oversouls" or high souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of a=
spirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a char=
ge, "There are no good Mahatmas." Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, "Th=

; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Cond=

 though not comparable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadh=

the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a bank account in a son'=
s name with a starting balance of one million dollars. Similarly, a guru wi=
th some achievement in a mantra can transfer
 some of it to a disciple. How=
ever, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account =
with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one's own hard work. Sim=
ilarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and=
 build one's own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not=
 as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go=
 ahead and do it.<BR>> > > ><BR>> > > > (2b) Mantra=
s and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material=
 results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual pro=
gress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the c=
ase of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One=
 can get in trouble otherwise.<BR>> > > ><BR>> > > >=
; However, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i=
) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized
 the whole system, for a reason, as K=
ali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing sur=
render, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making spir=
itual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* mate=
rial results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature=
 will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. B=
ut, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).<BR>> >=
 > ><BR>> > > > (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any m=
antra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of "I have severa=
l material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this r=
itual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not neces=
sarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to incre=
ase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress". You are then SA=
FE. Initiation is not required.
 That attitude itself is an initiation!<BR>=
> > > ><BR>> > > > (4) Gentle deities give good res=
ults slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast,=
 but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine t=
hat a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them =
in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the pe=
rson is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on t=
he floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast a=
nd there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good f=
ruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, pha=
la of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits an=
d throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some=
 spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more t=
ime to get out the good
 fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce =
deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, =
but the good fruit comes out faster.<BR>> > > ><BR>> > &g=

gt;<BR>> > > > Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spi=
llage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi=
 and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can=
 be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above=
, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you =
have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is try=
ing to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler d=
eities.<BR>>
