e of Vedic philosophy is seen especially in the epistemological approach of=
 Sanatana Dharma, with epistemology forming, arguably, the very foundation =
of any systematic philosophical construct. The Vedic theory of how knowledg=
e of Transcendence is arrived at is sophisticated, complex, psychologically=
 oriented, as well as elegant in design. More, it is unparalleled in its lo=
gical rigor. It is based upon an ultimate rejection of both empiricism and =
intellectualism as epistemic mechanisms capable of knowing God, in favor of=
 the unio mystica reality of a non-mediated perception of the Absolute that=
 can only be attained via enstatic oneness with that Absolute..."
