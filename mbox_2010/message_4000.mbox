Dear Narasimhagaru and others, 

1. Are there any invocatory Mantras (like =
prana pratishtapana mantra and the beejakasharas that we do for Ganapathi a=
nd specific other Devata forms in those specific homas) for Gayatri Devi? O=
r can we take it from the Sandhyavandanam procedure, like Gayatri Avahana, =
karanyasa and anganyasa, dhyana sloka etc. and complete the process? ) If t=
he there is a specific procedure, would it possible for you to upload a man=
ual for the same? 

2. Similary for Lord Subrahmanya swamy, I would like to=
 know if there is a specific homam that we could do! 

Thank you, 

Nagraj
