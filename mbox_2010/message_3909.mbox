Dear friends,

A known person who is troubled from worldly people, in his d=
isgust, randomly opened Aghora-III and his eyes fell on following page wher=
e in Vimalananda says:

"Its true Robby," said Vimalananda in conclusion, "=
it is true that when Krishna wants to bless someone He takes away that pers=
on's money, fame, pleasure and other worldly joys. Eventually, when that ma=
n has lost everything and everyone he knows has deserted him, he has no alt=
ernative but to remember Krishna and get lost in His bewitching eyes."

The=
 person immediately infomed about this and i thought of putting it on the l=
ist.

Jay Shri Krishna


Utpal
