c-wisdom] Sex scandals by spiritual gurus

=C2=A0 


Sri narasimha Garu,

F=
or the last few days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (famou=
s and infamous) spiritual Guru's like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc =
etc are being exposed to the masses. 

Is there any relationship with these=
 incidents with the establishment of the Dharma as you keep saying in the u=
pcoming years? If so i guess there will be many such weeds that would come =
out to be plucked..

Just a thought...

Cheers
KK
