Namaskar,
    One thing is clear that Ravana is not my kin, thus, it could =
only be your imagination that I have any sympathies for him or Rama. I am a=
mongst the general populace of the world - to me, only the greatness part o=
f the two characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallacies, but =
I don't eulogize either of them neither demean them.

    I am not a philos=
opher. What I have tried to state so far, w.r.t "Success with Mantra" topic=
, is that No matter how hard one tries, Ravanas' or Ramas' achievements in =
the field of "duality" cannot be erased by any amount of "Highest shakti" w=
ith or without Ego.

   Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-an=
anda as the basis of all planes of existence including Physical plane of ex=
istence. Argument of Impermanence by Advaitins has not so far been able to =
erase the world of duality from existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the =
basis of sense-mind, Chit is the basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat i=
s the basis of existence of Physical plane, so lets not argue that there is=
 another reality which is better and happier than this one, and that this w=
orld is a myth. If physical sense-experience is fleeting, it is because one=
 has not progressed enough to realize why the truth of being is expressed i=
n such a way at this plane of existence ? 
Bottomline is Sense-experience i=
s not different from Ananda, and Physical body not different from Chit.

> =

 does the "highest shakti" do ? Compete with lower shakti ? 
    This quest=
ion was asked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges, by sa=
ying that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego consciousness,=
 presuming that they act upon each other.

    Truth of the matter is that =
Soul is not in competition with ego consciousness ever, because God is neve=
r in competition with his creation !! If a liberated soul wants to take par=
t in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, h=
owever high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the wheel of the chariot =
and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other people may differ with=
 me on this.

> I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and 
   OT=
OH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the last time. It=
 is understandable that my view wouldn't be consistent in every mind-set, b=
ecause at times, it is not possible to write every little detail for the sa=
ke of consistency.

> But the happiness one gets when one achieves somethin=
g in the field > of duality is not permanent.
>  
> The highest shakti give=
s the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, 
> which is permanent.

    Auro=
bindo Ghosh has clearly stated:

"...If the immortal and infinite spirit ha=
s veiled itself in Matter and is emerging, the development of a liberated S=
upramental being who shall impose in Mind, Life and Matter a higher law tha=
n that of limitation and Division, is the inevitable conclusion from the na=
ture of the cosmic existence. There is no reason why such a being should no=
t liberate and make Divine the physical existence as well as the Mind and L=
ife...."

   So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with =
highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because it=
s basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about all the achievement=
s made by all those we can know of, irrespective of their being recognized =
as good or bad by a limited set of people, for a limited duration of time.
=
   
    These are just a few of my views based on what I have read so far, =
because I don't see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me greater tru=
th than where I am now.

Regards,
Aryama

y. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was reminded of it. Karna, in=
 the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because of the curse of his Gur=
u. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to remember the series of actions to=
 be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of the doer. Thus, Hanuma=
an had perfect memory by birth, and not by the association with Rama. Ravan=
a didn't have perfect memory, else he would have attempted to kill Vibhisha=
