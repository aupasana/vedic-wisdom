Letter 114

This afternoon, a young man from Tiruchirapalli=
 wrote a letter and handed it
over to Bhagavan. The gist of that letter is,=
 that countless people in the
country are suffering for want of food, that =
there is any amount of
commotion,that we are unable to see their troubles, =
that Bhagavan must give
out some plan to alleviate their suffering and that=
 elders like him should
not remain unconcerned like this.

Bhagavan read it=
 and looking at him critically said, =E2=80=9CIs that what you want?
You sa=
y that you are suffering at the sight of their troubles. Does that
mean tha=
t you yourself are all right unlike them and are happy?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9C=
No, I am also suffering in one way or other,=E2=80=9D said that young man.
=

=E2=80=9CAh! that is the trouble. You do not know what is your own happine=
ss, and
yet you are worried about others. Is it possible to make all people=
 similar?
If all get into the palanquin, who is to carry it? If all are kin=
gs, what is
the point in saying that any one is a king?

Some people will b=
e known as wealthy only if others are poor. A Jnani can be
recognised only =
when there are ignorant people. Darkness will be known only
when there is l=
ight.Happiness will be known only if there is suffering. Food
will be taste=
ful only if there is hunger.

Hence, help can be rendered only to the exten=
t possible, but if it is
desired to make all people equally happy, that is =
never possible.

A number of leaders of the country are working. Some of th=
em say the work
that has been contemplated has not been finished properly a=
nd so they will
lecture. What for? People become leaders one after another =
and work goes
on. There must be one shakti directing them all. If we throw =
the burden on
that shakti with the confidence that it can do what is requir=
ed and be free
from worry, things will somehow go on.

Some preach against =
the killing of animals. If people do not listen to
them,they say they will =
fast unto death, =E2=80=98We will commit suicide or we will
give up life=E2=
=80=99. If one says he will commit suicide, if others do not give up
killin=
g animals, is not suicide itself a killing of a living being? They
think su=
icide is merely leaving the body. Is not the body a part of the
self? Atma =
is always there, at all times and all places. Instead of looking
at the Sel=
f which is real and permanent, if one looks upon the body, etc. as
one=E2=
=80=99s own Self, it is suicide. What other murder could there be than that=
?

He who is able to see his own Self by knowledge and wisdom will not be m=
oved
by whatever conflicts may come about. He will look upon the sorrows an=
d
happiness of the world as mere acting on a stage. In his view the whole
w=
orld is a stage.

On that stage the same man once puts on the dress of a ki=
ng, another time of
a minister, next a servant, washerman,barber, and many =
other dresses, and
acts appropriately on each occasion, but as he is consci=
ous of his real Self
and knows
that he is not any one of those whose parts =
he is acting, he does not worry
about the various vicissitudes of life he d=
epicts on each occasion. In the
same manner, the world is a stage of Ishwar=
a. In that stage you are an
actor. You may help to the extent of your abili=
ty, but you cannot make all
people equal.It has not been possible in the pa=
st for anybody to do so and
it will not be possible in future either.=E2=80=
=9D

The young man said, =E2=80=9CBecause of all this, there is no peace in=
 this world. I
am unhappy about that.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CLook, you have come=
 again to the point where you
began,=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan replied. =E2=80=9CI=
nstead of feeling concerned about there being no peace
in the world, it is =
better to enquire and find out how you will get peace in
this world. If you=
 give up that objective,what is the use of worrying
yourself about the lack=
 of peace in the world? If one=E2=80=99s mind has peace, the
whole world wi=
ll appear peaceful. Tell me, have you that peace?=E2=80=9D asked
Bhagavan.
=

That person said, =E2=80=9CNo.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CAh! that is the thing. Y=
ou do not have peace. You do not know how to secure
that peace. If instead =
of trying to gain that peace, you attempt to secure
peace for the world, it=
 is like one who has no food, asking for food himself
which, if given, he s=
ays he will use to feed any number of other people.
Something like the lame=
 man who said, =E2=80=98If only someone holds me up can=E2=80=99t I
beat up=
 the thieves!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D
