Dear Friends,

Last week while sieving our District Library I found a book =
"Tarapeeth Bhairav". I was inclined to borrow it so I did. When I read it I=
 felt that I am reading just another version of Aghora Volumes. Things writ=
ten in Aghora are also mentioned in it (Obviously not the story line but th=
e facts related to saadhna). While reading I was suddenly inclined to share=
 about this in this group so I am writing here. This book will be helpful f=
or people who believe that Lot of things are written in between the lines i=
n Aghora and are unable to understand that 'in between the line' content ma=
y find it helpful. This book may not add anything much if you have already =
understood that 'in between the line' content but it will be helpful if you=
 are trying to do so.  Some details about the book are as under.

This Book=
 is about Yogi Vamacharan who lived about the same time as RamaKrishna Para=
mansa lived. Book also mentioned that vamacharan met Telanga Swami and also=
 describe meeting with Telanga swami. A Granth was written by Shri Sushil K=
umar Vanshopadyay dedicated to Vamacharan which was published in 1954. This=
 was translated in Hindi by Shri Chhavinath Mishra in 2001

Name: Tarapeeth=
 Bhairav
Publisher: Vaamdev Sangh, Shri Ramendranath Basu, 8, Pramanik Ghaa=
t Road, Kaashipur, Kolkata. 700036.

With the grace of Maa Tara

Regards
