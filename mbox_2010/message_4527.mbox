 The following is from the Amazon.com comments about the book 'The Dark Nig=
ht of the Soul'.

However, Self Realization is a marvelous experience. Have=
 you read or had any experiences with Kundalini awakening? In that, there i=
s an energy surge which clears out what a friend of mine calls the 'moldy o=
ldies', like the sludge which builds up in engines, which must be cleaned o=
ut for the car to operate optimally. Through proper Sadhana, one can prepar=
e. When mine occurred, it was like a great surge of energy going through my=
 Chakra and Nadi system with a wonderful cleansing effect and I was experie=
ncing Hatha Yoga postures, even though I had never practiced it before. A l=
ittle scary, but fun at the same time. All from God.

As a Carmelite monk, the
16th-century Spanish mystic St. John of the C=
ross was well trained in
the systematic theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. In =
Dark Night of the Soul,
St. John's sharply organized mind gives clean shape=
 to his mystical
belief in a loving Being somewhere outside the realm of fe=
eling,
thought, or imagination, who can only be known through love. Dark Ni=
ght of the Soul
describes the process of purgation, first of senses, and th=
en of
spirit, that precedes the soul's loving Union with God. To quote from=

this book would detract from the coiled power of its tightly focused
pictu=
re of the soul's progress; suffice it to say that there has never
been a be=
tter book for discouraged Christians. When you cannot
understand what or wh=
y you believe, but you find yourself unable to
abandon faith, look to St. J=
ohn for help. 
   
  

      Product Description
  
  If
a man wants to kno=
w for certain the road he is on he has to keep his
eyes closed and walk in =
darkness. "The dark night of the soul" has come
to typify that condition of=
 spiritual dryness, depression, and seeming
abandonment by God that many Ch=
ristians experience at some stage in
their lives. Here St. John, a 16th-cen=
tury Spanish mystic and poet,
describes the spiritual road that leads to un=
ion with God. On this road
the soul must enter the Dark Night to be strippe=
d of its imperfections,
including the famous "seven deadly sins"=E2=80=94a =
process that often takes a
number of years.
