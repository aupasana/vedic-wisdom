Namaste Narasimha,

Can=C2=A0a state of samadhi be experienced at any one o=
f the chakras? Like we say 
when Kundalini is in Shahashra chakra, one=C2=
=A0experiences self. This must be 
Nirvkalpa Samadhi right? Similarly, at t=
he other 6 chakras, can one experience 
some form of=C2=A0samadhi?

By anal=
yzing the spiritual experiences of a person can it be figured out which 
ch=
akra is his kundalini situated in? Like, as you said most yogis have their =

kundalini either in Mooladhara or Swadhisthana.=C2=A0 Is there a specific =
set of 
experiences, by which one can be sure that this is the case?

-Rega=
rds
=C2=A0 Rajarshi


=C2=A0

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: what does PURITY Mean

=C2=
=A0 
Namaste,

I will give my 2 cents of free-wheeling comments in this are=
a.

* * *

Rules may have exceptions, but they are meant for general guidan=
ce.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his disciples such as Swami Adbhutananda, =
Swami 
Vivekananda etc ate fish and yet achieved samadhi of various types. =
However, we 
cannot compare ourselves with special beings and we should fol=
low rules and 
austerities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may score a cen=
tury with a terrible 
backache, but we should not walk out to bat with a ba=
ckache and should try to be 
healthy. After all, we may not be able to scor=
e runs well even when in perfect 
health!

* * *

By the way, it must be re=
alized that external rules are only meant as a 
*catalyst* in enabling inte=
rnal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - 
meditation, japam, homam, b=
hajan, service to others etc - is internal 
transformation. If the internal=
 attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet 
to work.

* * *

If a roo=
m has a window outside of which there is heavy wind that is constantly 
blo=
wing a lot of dirt into the room, sweeping the room with a broom does not 
=
eliminate dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly, praanaa=
yaama 
is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental purity, if mind (r=
oom) is 
attached to the objects perceived by senses (window).

* * *

If o=
ne reads scriptures and teachings of saints, contemplates on them, 
constan=
tly analyzes inner motives behind various actions by oneself and tries to 
=
change one's own thinking slowly, this process of contemplation and 
intros=
pection will augment one's external sadhana (such as meditation, japam, 
ho=
mam, bhajan, service etc) and purifies one faster.

* * *

By the way, it i=
s useless to think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini 
and raising =
Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to either block 
Kundalini f=
rom rising or from reaching the highest it can.

Kundalini shakti is essent=
ially a symbol of one's own self-awareness. Though one 
is the infinite Sel=
f (Purusha), one is "aware" of a limited object in the field 
of duality (S=
hakti) springing in Self as "self". That is why Kundalini shakti is 
worshi=
pped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This self-awareness is 
norma=
lly "sleeping", i.e. one assumes that one is so and so person and so and so=
 
body without questioning "who am I". That is why Kundalini is portrayed a=
s 
sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or physical realm). As Kundalini =
awakens 
and rises to other chakras (other lokas or realms of awareness), o=
ne's 
understanding of who one is gets refined. When Kundalini reaches saha=
srara, one 
is aware of true Self.

If one thinks "I am this body. There is=
 a Kundalini shakti at so and so point in 
this body. It should now rise to=
 so and so point in this body", it will focus 
and limit one's self-awarene=
ss to the *physical body* and hence one's Kundalini 
will remain in moolaad=
haara! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs to 
completely forget about t=
he physical body and stop thinking in terms of it.

By the way, *very few* =
people actually experience Kundalini in higher chakras, 
though many talk a=
bout it. Kundalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost 
Swadhishthana chakr=
a in most yogis, even advanced and awakened ones. When praana 
vaayu flows =
in some higher chakras, that too can result in a powerful 
experience. Some=
 may mistaken it for Kundalini.

* * *

If you want a good score in the exa=
mination, study well. Stop thinking too much 
about (and anticipating) the =
examination and focus on the subject instead. 
Study, study, study. Similar=
ly, forget about kundalini, forget about chakras, 
forget about the body ev=
en. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read 
scriptures and teachings o=
f great saints. Instead of looking externally and 
judging others, observe =
your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is driving 
them and consciousl=
y try to eliminate wrong motives that stem from false ego, 
adharma and ari=
shadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), 
i.e. put to=
 use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, 
Kund=
alini will rise automatically.

Best regards,
Narasimha
