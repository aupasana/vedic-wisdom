At the instance of Sri Muruganar, Shantammal came to the Ashram from Ramnad=

in 1927. She worked in the kitchen and her devotion to Sri Bhagavan was
to=
tal. Since she served all with love, everyone at the Ashram loved her, and
=
wherever she stayed people surrounded her to listen to her expositions
desc=
ribing her life with Sri Bhagavan.

A villager had a dream in which he was =
told to offer his next calf to
Ramanasramam. He brought his cow and the cal=
f to Bhagavan. The jungle around
the Ashram was thick at that time and ther=
e were cheetahs. The Ashram people
were perplexed and refused the offer, bu=
t the villager was taking his dream
seriously and would not take the calf a=
way. The mother cow had to remain
with the calf to feed her. Finally, the c=
ow and the calf were entrusted to a
devotee in the town. The calf became th=
e famous cow Lakshmi. She grew up and
had three calves within a few years. =
She would come daily to the Ashram to
have her meals, graze on the Ashram l=
and, enter the Hall and sit contentedly
near Bhagavan. In the evening, she =
would go back to the town as other women
did.

Once Lakshmi came into the H=
all. She was pregnant at that time. It was after
lunch time when Bhagavan w=
as reading the newspapers. Lakshmi came near and
started licking the papers=
. Bhagavan looked up and said: "Wait a little,
Lakshmi." But Lakshmi went o=
n licking. Bhagavan laid his paper aside, put
his hands behind Lakshmi's ho=
rns and his head against hers. Like this they
stayed for quite a long time.=
 I stood nearby looking at the wonderful scene.
After some ten minutes or s=
o, Bhagavan turned to me and said: "Do you know
what Lakshmi is doing? She =
is in Samadhi."

I looked at her and tears were flowing in streams down her=
 broad cheeks. Her
breathing had stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagava=
n. After some time
Bhagavan changed his position and asked: "Lakshmi, how d=
o you feel now?"
Lakshmi moved backward, as if reluctant to turn her tail t=
owards Bhagavan,
walked round the Hall and went out.

On the fourth day Lak=
shmi gave birth to a calf. The man with whom Lakshmi
used to stay brought h=
er with her progeny and left them in the Ashram for
good. Lakshmi, with her=
 three calves, came into the Hall and lay down by the
sofa. Bhagavan saw he=
r and said: "All these days Lakshmi had to go in the
evening to the town an=
d she was always leaving in tears. Today she is
delighted for she need not =
go away anymore. She knows that her home is here
now. We have to look after=
 her. Look at her. With what self-assurance she
has stretched herself out!"=


In those days, before Bhagavan took his meals he would go around and see =
if
all the animals, like dogs and birds, had been properly fed. Then he wou=
ld
go and see if the cattle were looked after well. Even iddlies had to be
=
given to the cows and calves. Sometimes the Ashram iddlies were all eaten u=
p
by the cows and we had to send to the town for more, lest Bhagavan should=

reproach us for stingy cooking. Then he would see that the beggars at the
=
Ashram gate were also fed. If there was no bean soup (rassam) ready for the=

beggars, to go with their rice, he would order sambar to be distributed.

=
During the Kartikai festival beggars from all over South India would collec=
t
at Tiruvannamalai in vast crowds and they would flock to the Ashram for a=
n
assured meal. Once they became so unruly that the attendants refused to
s=
erve them. The matter was discussed among the workers and it was decided to=

abandon the distribution of food to beggars.

That night I had the followi=
ng dream: Bhagavan's Hall was full of devotees.
On the sofa appeared a smal=
l creature which gradually grew until it became a
huge, bright-red horse. T=
he horse went round the Hall, sniffing at each
devotee in turn. I was afrai=
d he would come near me, but the horse went to
Bhagavan, licked him all ove=
r the body and disappeared. Bhagavan called me
near and asked me not to be =
afraid. A divine perfume emanated from him. He
said: "Don't think it is an =
ordinary horse. As soon as the flags are hoisted
at Arunachaleshwara Temple=
 for the Kartikai festival, gods come down to
partake in the celebrations. =
They join the crowd and some mix with the
beggars at the Ashram gate. So ne=
ver stop feeding sadhus and beggars at
festivals." I told the dream to Chin=
naswami Swami, and that day he ordered
seven measures of rice to be cooked =
for the beggars.

Two women came from Kumbakonam to meet Bhagavan. One of t=
hem was a guru and
the other her disciple. They were leaving by train the s=
ame evening. In the
afternoon the disciple brought her guru into the Hall a=
nd made an elaborate
seat for her in front of Bhagavan. Every now and then =
the disciple would go
up to Bhagavan's sofa and whisper. "In everything, sh=
e is just like you,
Swami...she is in the same state as yourself.... Please=
 let us have your
blessings.... Will you teach us briefly the path of salva=
tion? What is
attachment? How to be free from Maya?" She was going on like =
this for quite
a long time. Bhagavan never replied. Evening was nearing. Th=
e disciple felt
hurt. "Swami, please instruct us...Swami, proceed with init=
iation quickly,
it is getting late.... Be quick, Swami. You know we have to=
 catch the train.
Hurry!" The poor lady was getting desperate. "At least te=
ll us something.
They all speak of ignorance, what is ignorance?" Bhagavan =
turned to
Muruganar and, in his mercy, said: "Ask her to inquire within. Wh=
o is
ignorant?" Muruganar told them: "Now you go, your initiation is over."=
 And
they went away.

Bhagavan talked about it later: "Everything must be d=
one in a hurry.
Everybody has some train to catch. They visit Swami in a ru=
sh and want to
carry away a parcel of liberation. They read something here =
and there and
think they are quite learned." (Whenever there was a chance t=
o snub our ego,
Bhagavan would never miss it). He continued: "Before the pe=
ople come here,
everyone has the most sincere desire to work for his own li=
beration, but
when they settle down, the ego goes to their heads and they f=
orget why they
came. They imagine they are doing me great service by feedin=
g me and think
altogether too much of themselves. The feeling of self-impor=
tance that they
have when they serve their guru destroys their hope of enli=
ghtenment. Only
humility can destroy the ego. The ego keeps you far away fr=
om God. The door
to God is open, but the lintel is very low. To enter one h=
as to bend.

In the kitchen, there were no proper jars for foodstuffs and e=
verything was
kept in tins and pots which would leak and spill and make the=
 floor in the
kitchen mucky and slippery. Once I scrubbed the kitchen floor=
 very carefully
and Bhagavan congratulated me on the neatness in the kitche=
n. I sighed:
"What is the use, Swami. People will come and spill the oil an=
d scatter the
flour and it will return to how it was before. We must have p=
roper jars and
containers." Ten days later they called me to the Hall. Atte=
ndants were
opening wooden boxes and there were six beautiful jars. "You wa=
nted jars,
now you have jars. Take them to the kitchen," said Bhagavan. On =
inquiry it
was found that some station master had booked them to the Ashram=
 for no
ostensible reason.

One day there was talk in the Hall about one of=
 Bhagavan's old devotees who
had come under Sri Sai Baba's influence. Bhaga=
van said: "Once a man has
surrendered his life here, he belongs here. Where=
ver he may go, he shall
return. For him this is the door to liberation."

T=
he next day Bhagavan refused to drink coffee. I gave up coffee too, as a
pe=
nance, and a hard penance it was! A month passed like this. One day I
burst=
 out in tears before Bhagavan: "Swami, I did offend you, but there must
be =
an end to punishment. Please have your coffee.''

"No, do not think I gave =
up coffee to punish you. Why should I punish
anybody? I gave up coffee beca=
use it does not agree with me. Ask the doctor,
he will tell you. He advised=
 me to avoid coffee." Then, turning to the
audience, Bhagavan added: "It wa=
s the same on the hill. I did not take
coffee, nobody would touch it and al=
l would curse the swami for depriving
them of coffee."

A few days later Ja=
nakiamma brought a huge pot of coffee and put it before
Bhagavan. "What am =
I to do now? Coffee has come by itself; nobody asked
Janaki to bring it. No=
w, if I do not drink it, nobody will touch it and
Janaki will be sorry." He=
 did taste some of Janaki's coffee and started
taking it again soon after t=
hat.
