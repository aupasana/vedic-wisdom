 IN a forest there lived a holy man who had many disciples. One day he
taug=
ht them to see God in all beings and knowing this, to bow low before
them a=
ll.

A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for the sacrificial fire.=

Suddenly he heard an outcry,"Get out of the way! A mad elephant is coming!=
"

All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels. He reasoned th=
at
the elephant was also God in another form.

Then why should he run away =
from it? He stood still, bowed before the
animal, and began to sing its pra=
ises. The mahut of the elephant was
shouting: "Run away! Runaway!"

But the=
 disciple didn't move. The .animal seized him with its trunk, cast
him to o=
ne side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay
unconsciou=
s on the ground.

Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother di=
sciples came to him
and carried him, to the hermitage.

With the help of so=
me medicine he soon regained consciousness.

Someone asked him, "You knew t=
he elephant was coming=97why didn't you leave
the place?" "But," he said, "=
Our teacher has told us that God Himself has
taken all these forms, of anim=
als as well as men. Therefore, thinking it was
only the elephant God that w=
as coming, I didn't run away."

At this the teacher said: "Yes, my child,it=
 is true that the elephant God
was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to=
 stay there. Since all are
manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the =
mahut's words? You should
have heeded the words of the mahut God."

God dwe=
lls in all beings. But you may be intimate only with good people; you
must =
keep away from the evil-minded. God is even in the tiger; but you
cannot em=
brace the tiger on that account!

You may say, "Why run away from a tiger, =
which is also a manifestation of
God?"

The answer to that is: Those who te=
ll you to run away arc also
manifestations of God=97and why shouldn't you l=
isten to them?

God undoubtedly dwells in the hearts of all=97holy and unho=
ly, righteous and
unrighteous; but a man should not have dealings with the =
unholy, the wicked,
the impure. He must not be intimate with them. With som=
e of them he may
exchange words,
but with others one shouldn't go even that=
 far.

One should keep aloof from such people.
