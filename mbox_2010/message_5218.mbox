Aryamaji
Think of two factors first of all,Bhakti and Sadhna and you may pe=
rhaps get your reply,there are conditions in Sadhna where Bhakti is conditi=
onless.

Namaskar,
How did =
Ravana got success with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with los=
s of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?
Where is the liberation without shakti, =
even the slaves were humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their m=

There is a saying in sanskrit, "Ks=
hama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishr=
ahit vineet saral ho". Meaning, the shakti-heen (powerless) person needn't =

Regar=
ds,

hank you for taking the step that is badly needed. I am a strong believer t=
hat prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate answers to things not in our c=
ontrol. Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literal=
ly hundreds would benefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is wh=

for 20+ years, and continue to use it for
 guidance for the future, but do =
not expect predictions would come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! fact=
orial permutations and combinations to deal with, virtually making it impos=
sible to predict correctly. But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, an=
d for those who have focused more on the good lord to seek the knowledge (w=
ith total discipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditionally), this a=
rt becomes a science as they acquire "vak-suddhi"; AND they are able to gui=
