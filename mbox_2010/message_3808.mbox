Namaste Dinesh, Aditi and Hemanth,

Dinesh Bhai, I am happy that you are no=
t Mr. FL :).

It is mentioned in the second approach that Mr. FL can keep f=
ollowing up. It means that He can still resort to one or all the methods of=
 Vasuli. The method(s) may be influenced by his personal nature and prefere=
nces etc... Alternatively, He can just leave it to The Mother to do whateve=
r is needed and what is right. As My Guru said recently to me -"We are talk=
ing about the One who manipulates 14 Universes in split second and delude e=
ven Maharshis".

Please note that the above approach is not a defeatist or =
Fatalistic. The Important thing here is the mental approach. How Mr. FL fee=
ls in his Mind about the whole episode. The attitude is of the prime import=
ance. If He can really think the way mentioned above and engage in 'Vasuli'=
 or becomes Passive by leaving everything to The Mother, i think he would h=
ave followed his *dharma* properly.

By the way, Aditi bahen - When Krishna=
 guides directly, what to talk then? Arjuna did everything as suggested by =
Krishna and Dharma is like Karma, very difficult to understand.

***
If I w=
ere Mr. Fool, i would follow up for sometime, some more time but would neve=
r engage in the extreme methods of Vasuli or would not allow my friends to =
do that even if I am hard pressed for money. I would have taken second appr=
oach - Leave it to Mother- although I am not a meek by nature and probably =
a person with lot of Rajas and Tamas and a staunch follower of Sardar Valla=
bhbhai Patel.

At the same time, i agree with all the different approaches =
due to Paatra/Desh/Kaal provided mental approach is of that which is just m=
entioned above. I think then only one can *logically* remain untouched by a=
ctions. 


Best Regards,

Utpal

Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the implementation of=
 knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which =
needed to be paid back and practically starts training the mind with that k=
nowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachment. =
Although he shows to his family and friends that he is extremely concerned =
and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina =
from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of =

 When someone dies, north Indians chant "Raama naam satya hai" while carryi=

"what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to u=

=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* att=

hora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates h=
