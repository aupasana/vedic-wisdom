Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,

I have just started liste=
ning to your (Narasimhaji's) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to rev=
iew my own chart. 

However in numerous instances in the past, I've heard t=
hrough friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse im=
pact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immatu=
re comment, but I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this befo=
re I proceed on this journey.

I would appreciate getting a honest response=
 so I can put this issue to rest once and for all. 

Regards,
Raj

PS: I am=
 drawn to astology more from an academic perspective of how it influences o=
ur life and how ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get =
the little understanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate o=
ur next generation so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / =
retain respect for astrology and our culture.
