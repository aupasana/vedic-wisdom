 An anonymous author, a scientist, sent the following article to Sri
Ramana=
sramam on April 14, 1946. It was written in Tamil and only recently
retriev=
ed from the Ashram's archives and published in the 1996 Tamil
souvenir comm=
emorating the 100th anniversary of Sri Bhagavan's Advent at
Arunachala. Pra=
kash Adiseshan of Ann Arbor, Michigan has translated it to
English, condens=
ed it and sent it to us for publication.

A youngster was pursuing study in=
 the scientific discipline in college.

He would attend lectures in science=
 given by eminent scientists such as Sir
C. V. Raman. He was convinced that=
 a career in scientific research would
provide fulfilment in his life. On t=
he eve of graduation with a Bachelor of
Science degree, he wanted to visit =
a few places before returning to his
hometown. He happened to think of Tiru=
vannamalai, a town where his father
used to frequently visit Sri Ramanasram=
am. Having never seen a Sage in
person, an urge to visit the Sage's Ashram =
arose in him. After arriving in
Tiruvannamalai and entering the Ashram, he =
obtained the Maharshi's darshan.
This Sage he saw did not appear like the o=
ne he had seen in the movies. The
Sage was wearing koupinam and appeared to=
 be an ordinary person. The
youngster bowed down before the Sage and sat in=
 the hall in front of him.
Maharshi was seated and remained silent. There w=
ere many people present in
the hall, but the hall was quiet.

Some time pas=
sed in this manner. After a while, the youngster was unable to
continue sit=
ting in a quiet manner. He did not know what to speak to the
Maharshi. Fort=
unately, there were a few books near Maharshi. He picked up
one of them and=
 began to read. It was an English translation of Ulladu
Narpadu with explan=
ations.

In that book, concepts such as "Being is One," "The world is unrea=
l," were
enunciated. But the youngster could not understand them. At that t=
ime, his
knowledge was confined to science. He could not help feeling confu=
sed in the
following line of thoughts: "Why should God create me? Where was=
 I? Where
will I be? Why should I remain here? Is all that I see false? I d=
o know the
presence of objects using my five senses. Don't I see the Mahars=
hi sitting
in front of me?" He could not read the book anymore. He fell int=
o a
contemplative mood. Just at that time, the Maharshi addressed the young=
ster
thus: "What is the doubt?" The youngster raised his head and said, "Th=
ere is
a human figure on the sofa. There is one on the floor. Upon looking =
with my
eyes, I perceive these two very clearly. But you say that in Realit=
y there
is only One. How can that be true?" Maharshi smiled and kept quiet =
for a
little while.

After the passing of a few minutes, he replied to the =
youngster's question
and said, "You must be used to performing experiments =
in your laboratory.
Let us say that you are examining an object. The amount=
 of detail you see
depends on the quality of the instrument you use to exam=
ine the object; the
more detail your instrument shows, the more you know ab=
out the object. Even
in the presence of such a fine instrument, if your eye=
sight is poor you will
know very little about the object. If your eyesight =
is good and if the brain
is not normal, the object's true nature is not kno=
wn to you. Similarly, if
your brain is fine but if your mind does not pay a=
ttention to what you are
observing, the less you will know about the object=
.

In summary, the amount you know about an object is dependent on an entit=
y
called mind. What is mind? It is thoughts. All the thoughts spring up fro=
m a
single thought. This single thought forms the source of all the other
t=
houghts comprising the mind. This thought is the I-am-this-body thought.
Wi=
thout such a thought, the other thoughts that identify various external
obj=
ects and cause the body to be identified separately from the external
objec=
ts cannot occur. In deep sleep, devoid of I-am-the-body thought, this
alien=
ation of external objects does not happen; further, there are no other
thou=
ghts in that state. Upon waking up, the first thought to occur is the
I-am-=
this-body thought. There are two components in this thought. One
component =
is body and the other component is I. The body is of transient
nature; it i=
s subject to change and it depends on external factors for its
existence, s=
uch as food. But the nature of 'I' is opposite from that of the
body. What =
exists in truth should be existing always. The body does not
exist all the =
time, so that is not the truth. The 'I' exists in all states
including waki=
ng, dream sleep and deep sleep. Hence 'I' is the truth; body
is untrue.

Bo=
th of these combined cannot exist as one entity that is true. How will
nigh=
t and day, light and darkness coexist? When there is light, there is no
dar=
kness; when there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, there is no
en=
tity that has as its basis the coexistence of 'I' and body. So the
I-am-the=
-body thought has no basis in truth. If we examine the world with
this untr=
ue thought as the basis, how could we learn the Truth?".

At that moment, h=
e felt that the foundation of his knowledge being shaken up
and his convict=
ion in scientific pursuit providing the ultimate fulfilment
suddenly disapp=
eared. Further, the Maharshi said that one can realize the
truth about the =
world after knowing the Truth about oneself. He spoke about
Self-Enquiry as=
 the means to knowing Oneself.

The upadesa the youngster received changed =
his mental attitude and,
subsequently, his daily activities. The youngster =
pursued life in the same
environment he had before. But he looked for life'=
s fulfilment in the
spiritual path, blessed by the Maharshi. He took up gra=
duate studies and
further undertook a career in teaching. However, he had n=
o desire to achieve
fame anymore. He felt that the Grace of Maharshi allowe=
d him to lead a
harmonious life.

The Light that shines as Maharshi is the =
source of all and in all beings and
is Iswara Himself. Let us pray in our h=
earts to the Maharshi and live
joyously.
