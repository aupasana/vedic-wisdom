Hello Kris,
You are an American in India and I'm an Indian in America :)
It=
s definitely your Purva Punya that brought you to India and let you study S=
anatan Dharma philosophy. 

The rope-snake , movie characters speaking to e=
ach other, dream-wake examples don't make sense to me. To me rope is real a=
nd it was mind's mistake to realize it as a snake. Of course if there were =
no snakes ever the mind would have never seen it would have never thought t=
he rope as a snake. Snake and rope are real. Its as simple as that. 

When =
watching a movie I know that actors are mouthing dialogues written by someb=
ody else. I don't become the movie or become a character in the movie befor=
e, during or after the movie.

If doing is a figment of our minds , who is =
doing what ? Is a real mind doing real things ? Is an unreal mind doing rea=
l things ?Is an unreal mind doing unreal things ? Oh wait, is mind real or =
unreal ?Take your pick.

When Lord Krishna gave Arjuna divya Drishti ,Arjun=
a never saw an unreal world.He continued to do his Karma without having dou=
bts of real vs unreal.I don't see anywhere in BG where Krishna says univers=
e is a creation of mind. 

If you keep denouncing the world as unreal I'm a=
fraid it may lead to a state of Tamas.If you say everything you see is Maya=
 then is Maya real or unreal ?

 To me putting the teachings of Bhagavad Ge=
eta into practice itself is a long journey and may take many life times. If=
 you guys already realized that world is unreal by Advaita logic or otherwi=
se tand you are indeed Brahman, more power to you.

Anyways I would like to=
 close my posts on this topic. I have no vendetta against Advaita or Advait=
ins. Advaita just does not make sense to me and no where in Geeta I find Ad=
vaita. 


Vedic wisdom is not just Advaita. There are many schools of thoug=
ht that have challenged and continue to challenge Advaita. 

I hope my post=
s help people who are beginning their spiritual journey use their rationale=
 to conclude as to what is real and what is not.




Jai

PS: My wife's lag=
na is Mithuna as well. She rarely has any interest in intellectual discussi=
ons. Dividing the population in to 12 kinds of people is a bit too simplist=
ic.There are various factors to look in a Kundali while trying to find out =
one's spiritual inclination.
