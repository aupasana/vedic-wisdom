Dear Sir,
In Chandi homam,13 different types of offerings are made to Agni =
in a prescribed sequence at the end of each Chapter.I believe that there is=
 a great significance in that order as the products of combustion react wit=
h each other and produce secondary emissions that were found to be benefici=
al to the humans and the environmnt. Can the learned members enlighten me o=
n the significance of each offering and the references in our scriptures fo=
r further study?
