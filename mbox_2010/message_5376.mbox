Namaskar,

ysical immortality is the highest ideal.

    I said that the highest ideal=
 of Aurobindo is to divinize the Physical body. It is not my highest ideal,=
 but achievable through the Vedic method. 
   Rajarshi, Savitur Gayatri Man=
tra from RigVeda is a useful hint about the Vedic method, and how to use it=
.

> The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self and, if=
 needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do whatever comes spon=
taneously.
    Alright.

Aryama

n of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body is t=
o be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body and we=
 are something else residing in a shell called the physical body. What we t=
ruly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physical body may=
 perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physical body, one =
cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the physical body =
to eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere intellectua=
l statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.
