 This is a very short poem with five stanzas written by Shankaracharya whic=

glorifies the life of a Sannyasi. A Sadhu renounces every thing before
en=
tering in to Sannyas, and wears only a kaupina aka kaupeena (loin cloth).
T=

This is a Perfect Stotram to Sri Ram=
ana Maharshi.

Vedantha Vakhyeshu Sada ramantho,
Bhikshannamathrena trishti=
mantha,
Vishokamantha karane charantha,
Kaupeenavantha Khalu bhaghyavantha =
-1

Who is reveling in the thoughts of Vedantic declarations,
Whom does a m=
eager portion of begged-food satisfy,
Who is walking around without a trace=
 of sorrow
The man with just the loincloth is indeed the lucky one. -1

Panidhvayam bhokthuma manthrayantha,

Kaupeenavantha Khalu bhaghyavantha -2

Who rest=
s (sleeps) at the roots of a tree,
Taking only two hands-full of food
Who i=
s disregarding wealth as a torn piece of cloth
The man with just the loincl=
oth is indeed the lucky one. -2

Swananda bhava pari thushti mantha,
Sushan=
tha sarvendriya vruthi mantha,
Aharnisam brahma sukhe ramantha,
Kaupeenavan=
tha Khalu bhaghyavantha - 3

Always contented in the joy of ones own self
W=
ho is peaceful by curbing desires his senses
Who is immersed day and night =
in the bliss of Brahman
The man with just the loincloth is indeed the lucky=
 one. -3

Swathmana athmanyavalokayantha,

Naantha na Madhyam na bahi smarantha,
Kaupeenavantha Khalu bhaghyavantha - =

Always witnessing the changes of his own body,
Who is seeing himself as =
the Self, the changeless,
And who never bothers to think about the end, mid=
dle and outside (of the
world),
The man with just the loincloth is indeed t=
he lucky one. -4

Brahmaksharam pavanamucharantho,
Brahmahamasmeethi vibhav=

The man with just the loincloth is indeed the lucky o=
