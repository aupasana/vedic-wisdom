Namaste all,

In the translation of Srimad Bhagavatam by A. C. Bhaktivedant=
a Swami Prabhupada, there is a reference to "hamsa" in book 9, chapter 14, =
verse 48 [link given below].
However, I do not find this word to be in the =
Sanskrit.

If anyone knows about this, could you please answer my question:=
 where did Srila Prabhupada get this name for the one varnna mentioned?

Thank you very much.

Yours faithfully, Paawan.
