Dear Sir, 

There is a tradition that the Gayatri mantram is shapth (cursed) by 4 of the foremost Rishis of India, for reasons best known to themselves. And a shapoddhara stotra is also prescribed to enable the chanter relieve the curse and realize the benefits of chanting. 

Whether you believe in the Shaapa or not, it has helped me, whenever I mentally prayed to the Rishis Brahma, Vasishta, Vishwamitra and Sukracharya before I started chanting the Gayatri.

Best wishes
Hari

In one of the books Vimalananda gives out why the real Gayathri is hidden. The actually Gayathri generate immense heat which our body can not bear. Hence, one should recite it only when one is in water. Also, it makes the person realize self immediately.

I do not really agree God punish people. It all depends on the attitude. If you are doing business with God (I will do this Sadhana, and hence you give me this result, and you break the sadhana), God may punish.

How ever, if you do sadhana only for self realisation and seek God, God, I am doing sadhana I can, please help me do better and realise you, God will not punish no matter what. Yes, as Narasimha pointed out, in some cases, God may take away certain things to make your spiritual journey faster, but, that is not really a punishment.

Narasimha, once told me, what you think is good for you or your family may not be really good. Only Ma knows what is good for you. So, don't specify what you want. Let the Mother decide what to give.

After all, all of us as parents try to give best to our kids. Don't we? Also, if the child misbehaves, we do not hesitate to punish them. God is no different.

Best regards,
Vijay
