Namaste Atul Ji,

Thank you for taking the time in responding with detail. =
I now understand. I do 
not think that you probably expected a short reply =
like this, byt your 
explanation was very clear.

Regards,
Bhupendra

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras)

=C2=A0 
Namaste,=


Respected Bhupendra Ji, I am sorry for replying late. I was not able to 
=
understand what points you are making so it took time to understand what yo=
u are 
saying. 


sir, below are some words which constitute my thinking. w=
ith deep regards i want 
to share them here with a hope that they may answe=
r your questions. Please 
forgive me for my mistakes.

1) Regarding behavio=
ur and thinking of Vimlananda and other Rishis, i honestly 
admit that I do=
 not understand properly why they do what they do. This is 
because I am no=
t able enough to reach that level of intelligence. But when it 
comes to Vi=
malananda, when I try to understand why they are doing so, I always 
refer =
to his saying that he wanted to die with a clean karma account. Here clean =

means 'empty'. 


Second, he usually said that it is best to exist at two =
levels of conciousness 
at the same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like =
when he is playing chess with 
Robert at the same time he is wandering at h=
igher level of conciousness, without 
anyone realising that what he is thin=
king.

So, i assume that whatever he did was because of above two principle=
s which he 
was always aware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or m=
essing with Sadhu 
at his cave or any other incidence. 


At the end, he ga=
ve his life for saving son of one of his disciples without even 
letting th=
em know. 

I may never be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he di=
d. 

What I think of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some=
 
rinanubandha left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came =
to pay 
them and to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has agai=
n taken birth 
in this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.

=
I believe Manish Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nit=
ya 
siddha soul. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help =
others 
evolve.

Raman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch be=
fore going on a walk. 
once his disciple became late for bringing the Paan.=
 Ramana Maharishi waited for 
about 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt a=
rrived he went on his walk. but 
after that he never ate Paan. This can be =
interpreted as his ego or his 
realisation that he was attached to Paan so =
he quit a thing which he was 
attached to.

2) Second thing you pointed out=
 about "pre-requisite" of sadhna. what i think is 
that Pre-requisite of sa=
dhna is just "want to do sadhna"

While Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite to=
 reach god (or to attain Moksha or any 
other objective)

Controlling anger=
, greed etc; to remove conditioning of mind and to empty our 
'Karma-fruit =
account balance'. These all three constitute sadhna. Process which 
constit=
ute doing all the above things is sadhna. 

Controlling anger etc are not p=
re-requisite of saadhna, but controlling them 
itself is saadhna.

When we =
achieve them, we attain the moksha or what ever objectives we have. If 
we =
haven't achieved them yet, it means our Sadhna is incomplete. 


Now whethe=
r Vimlananda or Rishis were angry because of their incomplete sadhna 
or be=
cause of Divine will, I can not judge. Even if they were incomplete, Still =

they were lot lot better than me and I need to respect them and learn from=
 them.

Udhav ji had Brahmgyana. He was one of few persons who, in their li=
ving 
conciousness realised that Shri Krishna is God Himself. But still he =
had some 
ego left in him. So Shri Krishna taught him lessons in his own wa=
y. And even 
after Lord Krishna left his Body, Udhav had to do Tapasya for =
many many years to 
achieve ultimate stage.

3) Third thing was about saadh=
na and Sidhis.

There are numerous paths for reaching God or we should say =
that there are many 
paths for doing Sadhnas. Many in Hinduism itself, In s=
ikhism, in Islam, Budhism 
etc etc all are paths for doing Saadhna. These a=
ll paths are different. But 
still they take us to same objective.

These a=
ll paths have two things in common.

a) Mind Training
b) Surrender to God.
=

In most of the Paths one is more prominent other is less prominent. Like i=
n 
bhakti Yoga, Surrender to god is given utmost important but Mind Trainin=
g is to 
some extent only. While in Rajyoga or Hath Yoga Mind training is g=
iven more 
important and Surrender is to some extent.
In Karma yoga, Mind i=
s trained in a different way using different methods and in 
Gyan yoga Mind=
 is trained in different way using different methods.

Tantra is a saadhna =
method where both Mind training and Surrender are given 
equal importance a=
nd both these are done in a very aggressive and fast manner. 
So it works v=
ery fast. 


Mind Training part of Saadhna, produces lot of energy in us. m=
any names are 
given to this energy. This energy is what gives Siddhis. 

S=
o on quest to find God, these Sidhis are just by-products or I term them as=
 
"side effects" for my own reference. They are not our aim when we are try=
ing to 
reach God. We do not need sidhis but still they are produced. When =
Vivekananda 
was offered sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as hi=
s guru 
acknowledged that these sidhis will not help him in achieving god. =
Although at 
later stage Vivekananda achieved lot of Sidhis by himself.

Wh=
at I want to point here is that For achieving Sidhis, 2nd aspect of surrend=
er 
is not needed. One can achieve Sidhis by following some methods but the=
y will 
not help him reach God. They just add to his Karma-Fruit account an=
d take aways 
from God.

In the book "Concentration - By Mouni sadhu", Auth=
or explains simple techniques 
to achieve some simple sidhis step by step. =
He also adds that one need not to 
believe in God to attain these sidhis. B=
ut if he use these sidhis in Quest for 
God these can be helpful. 


So a p=
erson who had controlled his mind and trained his mind to achieve some 
pow=
ers does not mean that he has controlled his anger etc and has a love for 
=
God.

But for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he was a person =
who had 
control on most of his instincts including anger. Although his lev=
el of 
intelligence and concious was so much different from us that we may =
not be able 
to understand why he did so.

I am sorry for stretching this m=
ail too long. I hope some of your points were 
addressed in this mail.

ple=
ase pardon for my mistakes

Kind Regards
Atul

<P>Namaste,<BR><BR>Respected Bhupendra Ji, I am sor=
ry for replying late. I was not able to understand what points you are maki=
ng so it took time to understand what you are saying. <BR><BR>sir, below ar=
e some words which constitute my thinking. with deep regards i want to shar=
e them here with a hope that they may answer your questions. Please forgive=
 me for my mistakes.<BR><BR>1) Regarding behaviour and thinking of Vimlanan=
da and other Rishis, i honestly admit that I do not understand properly why=
 they do what they do. This is because I am not able enough to reach that l=
evel of intelligence. But when it comes to Vimalananda, when I try to under=
stand why they are doing so, I always refer to his saying that he wanted to=
 die with a clean karma account. Here clean means 'empty'. <BR><BR>Second, =
he usually said that it is best to exist at two levels of conciousness at t=
he same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like when he is playing chess wit=
h Robert at the
 same time he is wandering at higher level of conciousness,=
 without anyone realising that what he is thinking.<BR><BR>So, i assume tha=
t whatever he did was because of above two principles which he was always a=
ware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or messing with Sadhu at his=
 cave or any other incidence. <BR><BR>At the end, he gave his life for savi=
ng son of one of his disciples without even letting them know. <BR>I may ne=
ver be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he did. <BR><BR>What I t=
hink of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some rinanubandha=
 left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came to pay them an=
d to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has again taken birth i=
n this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.<BR><BR>I believe =
Manish Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nitya siddha =
soul. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help others
 evo=
lve.<BR><BR>Raman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch before =
going on a walk. once his disciple became late for bringing the Paan. Raman=
a Maharishi waited for about 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt arrived =
he went on his walk. but after that he never ate Paan. This can be interpre=
ted as his ego or his realisation that he was attached to Paan so he quit a=
 thing which he was attached to.<BR><BR>2) Second thing you pointed out abo=
ut "pre-requisite" of sadhna. what i think is that Pre-requisite of sadhna =
is just "want to do sadhna"<BR><BR>While Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite t=
o reach god (or to attain Moksha or any other objective)<BR><BR>Controlling=
 anger, greed etc; to remove conditioning of mind and to empty our 'Karma-f=
ruit account balance'. These all three constitute sadhna. Process which con=
stitute doing all the above things is sadhna. <BR>Controlling anger etc are=
 not pre-requisite of saadhna, but controlling them itself is
 saadhna.<BR>=
<BR>When we achieve them, we attain the moksha or what ever objectives we h=
ave. If we haven't achieved them yet, it means our Sadhna is incomplete. <B=
R><BR>Now whether Vimlananda or Rishis were angry because of their incomple=
te sadhna or because of Divine will, I can not judge. Even if they were inc=
omplete, Still they were lot lot better than me and I need to respect them =
and learn from them.<BR><BR>Udhav ji had Brahmgyana. He was one of few pers=
ons who, in their living conciousness realised that Shri Krishna is God Him=
self. But still he had some ego left in him. So Shri Krishna taught him les=
sons in his own way. And even after Lord Krishna left his Body, Udhav had t=
o do Tapasya for many many years to achieve ultimate stage.<BR><BR>3) Third=
 thing was about saadhna and Sidhis.<BR><BR>There are numerous paths for re=
aching God or we should say that there are many paths for doing Sadhnas. Ma=
ny in Hinduism itself, In sikhism, in Islam, Budhism
 etc etc all are paths=
 for doing Saadhna. These all paths are different. But still they take us t=
o same objective.<BR><BR>These all paths have two things in common.<BR><BR>=
a) Mind Training<BR>b) Surrender to God.<BR><BR>In most of the Paths one is=
 more prominent other is less prominent. Like in bhakti Yoga, Surrender to =
god is given utmost important but Mind Training is to some extent only. Whi=
le in Rajyoga or Hath Yoga Mind training is given more important and Surren=
der is to some extent.<BR>In Karma yoga, Mind is trained in a different way=
 using different methods and in Gyan yoga Mind is trained in different way =
using different methods.<BR><BR>Tantra is a saadhna method where both Mind =
training and Surrender are given equal importance and both these are done i=
n a very aggressive and fast manner. So it works very fast. <BR><BR>Mind Tr=
aining part of Saadhna, produces lot of energy in us. many names are given =
to this energy. This energy is what gives
 Siddhis. <BR>So on quest to find=
 God, these Sidhis are just by-products or I term them as "side effects" fo=
r my own reference. They are not our aim when we are trying to reach God. W=
e do not need sidhis but still they are produced. When Vivekananda was offe=
red sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as his guru acknowledged t=
hat these sidhis will not help him in achieving god. Although at later stag=
e Vivekananda achieved lot of Sidhis by himself.<BR><BR>What I want to poin=
t here is that For achieving Sidhis, 2nd aspect of surrender is not needed.=
 One can achieve Sidhis by following some methods but they will not help hi=
m reach God. They just add to his Karma-Fruit account and take aways from G=
od.<BR><BR>In the book "Concentration - By Mouni sadhu", Author explains si=
mple techniques to achieve some simple sidhis step by step. He also adds th=
at one need not to believe in God to attain these sidhis. But if he use the=
se sidhis in Quest for God these
 can be helpful. <BR><BR>So a person who h=
ad controlled his mind and trained his mind to achieve some powers does not=
 mean that he has controlled his anger etc and has a love for God.<BR><BR>B=
ut for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he was a person who had=
 control on most of his instincts including anger. Although his level of in=
telligence and concious was so much different from us that we may not be ab=
le to understand why he did so.<BR><BR>I am sorry for stretching this mail =
too long. I hope some of your points were addressed in this mail.<BR><BR>pl=
ease pardon for my mistakes<BR><BR>Kind Regards<BR>Atul<BR><BR>--- In <A hr=

why Duryodhana
 invited this rishi to his palace and provided him with all =
