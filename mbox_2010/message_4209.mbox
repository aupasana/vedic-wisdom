Namaste,
=C2=A0
I can tell you how I look at it. 
=C2=A0
1) Chandika is not=
 just devi, but the sum total of all energies in all universes. As such she=
 is formless in Her essence. She is the Shaktih of Brahman and undifferenti=
ated from Brahman itself. When She asks Lord Shiva to go to as an emissary,=
 it is the One universal power - the essence behind all essences - who is s=
ending a self-realized cosmic deity (Shiva) as a "doot". It is as if Brahma=
n itself=C2=A0is sending Shiva as a "doot". All deities are finally extenti=
on and creation out of the great undifferentiated.
=C2=A0
2) In the 10th ch=
apter we see that Chandi shows Shumbha how all the matrikaas are nothing bu=
t Her extension. Similarly in the 7th chapter we see, how Kali emerges out =
of Her eyebrows.=C2=A0 Once Kali destroys Chanda and Munda, she brings over=
 the slains head to Chandika who then names Kali as Chamunda.
=C2=A0
In ess=
ence, Chandi is everything, all the forms are Her. But again, each form has=
 slight difference in the way it manifests and functions. There is no confl=
ict here. 
=C2=A0
At home your children may call you father, at your office=
 your boss may call you by your name,=C2=A0your parents may call you son. B=
ut is the actual person changing? No. But, your attributes based on your fu=
nctionality is changing. The role of a father/son/husband/employee require =
different jobs to be performed. Similarly each is an aspect of the same ess=
ence which is Chandika. Therefore we have different roopas of Her. 
=C2=A0
=
I hope I could put across my view point coherently.

-Regards

Namaste

1) In the 8th chapter of the Chandi Pa=
th, the Shivduti form of the Devi
is explained. At a very simple level pure=
 sattwa form of manifested
consciousness (Devi) asks the unmanifest / absol=
ute consciousness
(Shiva) to go to self identification represented by ego a=
nd attachment
(Shumbha and Nishumbha) as an envoy with a proposal for them =
to withdraw
to avoid conflict or if they insist then come to battle and fac=
e defeat.
What is the esoteric significant of this form of the Devi and why=
 is she
doing so?

2) In the 7th chapter both Devi and Kali are mentioned i=
n fighting
Chanda and Munda and while the duo are slain by the Devi (Ambika=
), their
heads are picked up by Kali and brought over to Devi and hencefort=
h Kali
is said to be called by the name of Chamunda. Is a distinction to be=

made between Devi and Kali here? If so, then why is Kali named as
Chamunda=
 when she picks up the slain heads of Chanda and Munda only
whereas they ar=
e actually slain by the Devi.
