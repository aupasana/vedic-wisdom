Dear Vishal
You can keep a picture of Manish Panditji in your worship altar=
 and put it in front when you are doing homam.As he by divine will the intr=
oducer of this homam wave we can treat him as our Guru in this project.More=
over as far as I remember Manishji said that he comes to know whenever anyb=
ody thinks about him(beyond the constraints of space and time).So your effo=
rt as i think will not be completely unaware of Manishji.
Dedicate all good=
 and evil not only of the homam but your life to Manishji.
Practice for 6 m=
onths then come to a conclusion and write about it here.
You can find a pic=
ture of Manishji in the files section.You can digitally print that picture =
and frame it.
