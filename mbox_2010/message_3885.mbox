Namaste Rajarshi,

Narasimha aptly worte:

>No matter how much one has read=
, no matter how much one has >understood, no matter how much sadhana one ha=
s done, no matter how >many good karmas one has done, no matter what spirit=
ual experiences >one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditatio=
n or most >of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can =
>still fall. 

I learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha's message. W=
hat will be our condition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.

***
You=
 have passionately raised some questions in defense and i find nothing wron=
g in it but One thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrass=
ment such episodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be a=
nything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a =
great many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preac=
hes the same and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge an=
d talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is =
a gross.
I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extr=
emely truthful in his 'Satyana Prayogo' about his own weakness and his stru=
ggles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of s=
uch a stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.

There is a big differenc=
e between fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sr=
i Ravishankar didn't fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big emb=
arrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Maste=
r, in front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is=
 a bigger blow to faiths of general public.

I am not specific on Satyanand=
a here because i do not know if it is really true.

If the footage is right=
, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to st=
eer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so t=
hat corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.

> Furthe=
r, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so >twisted and 

Yo=
u have spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then s=
ay even 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a ver=
y elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/p=
ains of sexual desires.

Finally, i would say that its high time for Big na=
mes and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of  Vi=
malananda or Mahatma Gandhi's bold approach to the subject of physical and =
mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya.)=


It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram's famous line
"Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaa=
chi Vandaavi Paule"

Best Regards,

Utpal

 it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya's web. He is a fan=
tastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing dispo=
sition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simple=
 and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been e=
xposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Who=
 is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?

 are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?

 The most important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that att=
itude of a dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this gro=
up who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may st=
art noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be=
 swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the =
mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversi=
ty. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's m=
ind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.
