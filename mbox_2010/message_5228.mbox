Namaste,
=C2=A0
My emails are usually ignored as=
 pointless blabber but if I could add some words here. Cessation of Ahamkar=
a and purity seems to be only required in the initial stages when you are s=
till struggling to acquire a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success.=
 Once you have achieved some level of success, discipline that may have bee=
n required in the initial stages is no longer necessary.
=C2=A0
I have read=
 a few of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website f=
or free downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a stead=
y mind, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual a=
ctivity as would be=C2=A0in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you=
 mind, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, =
he did a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana t=
hat people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....onc=
e he had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Rava=
na alone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across=
 Rishi's who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be =
ever ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of t=
hem seemed to have big egos.
=C2=A0
I do not know if you have read the Agho=
ra books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 but if you read that, even when Vimalananda =
talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being challenged on an=
y matter and this is time and again=C2=A0seen in his books.
=C2=A0
Ofcourse=
 above all, you need to keep your ego in control before the Lord even thoug=
h you may be reckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I do not =
know him personally but only through message exchanges over groups like thi=
s. He seems to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana's and has practiced quite=
 a lot of them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him, when =
he does sadhana for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he does th=
is for himself. And he was once=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help h=
im out with the situation. I really do not know much about the various sadh=
anas for achieving specific needs. So I suggested that instead of of asking=
 for suggestions of different sadhana from everybody, why does he not just =
tell the lord in his prayer one day that the effects of his bad karmas are =
getting too much to bear and if the Lord could provide him the success he i=
s looking for in his life. He retorted and shot back at me that
 he did not=
 spend time and energy in learning these various tantric sadhanas just to b=
eg before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I reminded him that a=
ll this while, he was not having any problems begging for help and suggesti=
on from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg from god when=
 really god is the one and only who can really do anything the problems he =
is facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude that this person di=

Namaskar,
How did Ravana got success =
with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and p=

Where is the liberation without shakti, even the slaves wer=

There is a saying in sanskrit, "Kshama shobhti us bhu=

<DIV>My emails are usually ignored as pointless blabber but if =
I could add some words here. Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be o=
nly required in the initial stages when you are still struggling to acquire=
 a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. Once you have achieved so=
me level of success, discipline that may have been required in the initial =
stages is no longer necessary.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I have read a f=
ew of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for f=
ree downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady mi=
nd, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual activ=
ity as would be in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you min=
d, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he d=
id a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that =
people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once he=
 had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana a=
lone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across Ris=
hi's who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they seem to be ever=
 ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of them =
seemed to have big egos.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I do not know if you =
have read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,  but if you read that, even=
 when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like bein=
g challenged on any matter and this is time and again seen in his book=
s.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ofcourse above all, you need to keep your e=
go in control before the Lord even though you may be reckless to other huma=
ns. There is someone I know....I do not know him personally but only throug=
h message exchanges over groups like this. He seems to have knowledge of a =
lot of sadhana's and has practiced quite a lot of them. Success seems to il=
lude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana for others, it succ=
eeds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And he was once&nbs=
p;asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I really=
 do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific needs. =
So I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of different sadha=
na from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his prayer one day=
 that the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear and if the=
 Lord could provide him the success he is looking for in his life. He retor=
ted and shot back at
 me that he did not spend time and energy in learning =
these various tantric sadhanas just to beg before god, he only knows how to=
 demand from god.! I reminded him that all this while, he was not having an=
y problems begging for help and suggestion from other group members and yet=
, he is not willing to beg from god when really god is the one and only who=
 can really do anything the problems he is facing. I do not think even Rava=
na had that attitude that this person did, when he would sit down for =
his sadhana.</DIV>
