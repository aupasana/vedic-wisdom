Totally second that, the bhakti part ! 

I myself am in to Iskcon and have =
some problem on the demi-god status, etc; I myself got into arguments and i=
t is taken as mayAvAda philosophy. But sure thing is, bhakti for Sri Sri Ra=
dhaKrsna is seen and experienced the best at Iskcon. I would still go there=
 to experience the bhakti. If one of you attend the kirtans in Brindavan te=
mple, you can see what I meant. Sometimes I feel it is a planned idea by Sr=
ilaPrabhupad as he needs to transform the west where the idea of "Father" a=
s God with son "Jesus" coming in has to be re-instated. It is easy to let t=
hem concentrate on one than the entire God family (or so to say) of Vedic d=
harma. You never know how saints work.

If it is being mis-interpreted by s=
ome of the followers, it may cause some heartburn (like what I had). But so=
me of the best devotees (JananivAsa prabhu of mAyapur, etc.) never mis-trea=
t Lord Shiva / Goddess Durga, etc.

regards
rAma

Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle des=
cribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brah=
mana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas=
. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brah=
