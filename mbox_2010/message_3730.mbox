In the early years at Ramanashram the food was quite simple, it was only in=

later years that there were large numbers of visitors, so it did not take
=
long to cook the meals. In Ramana=E2=80=99s words, =E2=80=9CA big vessel us=
ed to be put on
the fire. Whatever vegetables were received till noon used =
to be cut and put
into it, boiled and sambar made. There was no ladle even =
to stir and mix
them. We used to take a piece of firewood, chisel it and us=
e it for stirring
those vegetables in the vessel. That preparation was the =
only side dish.
When we mixed it with rice and ate, it used to be very tast=
y. The labour
also was comparatively less.=E2=80=9D

As the Ashram grew and=
 the number of visitors increased, the cooking also
became more complicated=
 and time-consuming. Up until the late 1920s
Chinnaswami acted as the main =
cook, with the assistance of Dandapani Swami
and others. When he became the=
 Ashram manager, he was replaced in the
kitchen by a number of Brahmin wido=
ws - Santammal, Lokammal, Subbalakshmi
Ammal,Sampurnamma and others. Only m=
embers of the Brahmin caste were allowed
to do the cooking.

Work with Sri =
Ramana had both its difficult moments and its pleasant
moments. Although he=
 was full of kindness he was also a strict
disciplinarian and would not tol=
erate the slightest negligence.Everything
had to be done perfectly and with=
 full awareness. He demanded that his
instructions be followed to the lette=
r.

One evening a disciple who was a solicitor, insisted on helping with th=
e
work. He was asked to move a vessel containing sambar.As he moved it some=

drops spilled over the sides. At once Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CYou are fit =
only for
arguing before the Court. This work is not for you.=E2=80=9D

Kunj=
u Swami narrates, =E2=80=9CSri Bhagavan used to go into the kitchen by 4 a.=
m.
and start cutting vegetables; one or two of us would also join and help.=

Sometimes the amount of vegetables used to startle us. Bhagavan managed to=

cut much more and more quickly than the rest of us. At such times we would=

look up at the clock in our impatience to finish the job and try and have
=
another nap. Bhagavan would sense our impatience and say: =E2=80=98Why do y=
ou look
at the clock?=E2=80=99 We tried to bluff Bhagavan saying: =E2=80=98=
If only we could complete
the work before 5, we could meditate for an hour.=
=E2=80=99 Bhagavan would mildly
retort: =E2=80=98The allotted work has to b=
e completed in time. Other thoughts are
obstacles, not the amount of work. =
Doing the allotted work in time is itself
meditation. Go ahead and do the j=
ob with full attention.=E2=80=9D

An unwritten rule demanded that the kitch=
en helpers had to continue working
until the last meal had been served and =
cleared away.Chinnaswami did not
allow any of them to stay in the Hall to m=
editate or to listen to the talks
when they were supposed to be working. Su=
ndaram reports, =E2=80=9CWhen we would
sneak in and hide ourselves behind p=
eople=E2=80=99s backs, Bhagavan would look at us
significantly,as if saying=
, =E2=80=98Better go to your work. Don=E2=80=99t ask for
trouble.=E2=80=99=
=E2=80=9D

When the cook Subbalakshmi Ammal wanted to meditate more and com=
plained that
the kitchen work would take up all of her time, Ramana answere=
d, =E2=80=9CIf you
identify yourself with the body,you are bound to dualiti=
es. Work would
appear difficult. Even if we free ourselves from work will t=
he mind cease to
wander? It does not let us even sleep in peace. It keeps w=
andering as in
dreams.=E2=80=9D


For each vegetable Ramana knew a special =
kind of preparation.Nothing was
thrown away. If he cut spinach, he separate=
d the leaves, the stalks and the
roots. With the leaves he made the curry,t=
he stalks were bound together,
cooked and put into the sambar and the roots=
 were washed carefully, squeezed
and their juice put into the rasam. Any or=
ange peel or apple peel was put
into the chutney. The leftovers from the pr=
evious day were warmed up and
served at the following breakfast, along with=
 the iddlies. If there was any
soup or vegetables left, they were put into =
the sambar. This was against the
caste rules of the Brahmins, according to =
which leftovers may not be used
the following day. But Ramana insisted that=
 the avoidance of waste was more
important than anything else.

Sampurnamma=
 recounted another story along the same lines,=E2=80=9COnce a feast was
bei=
ng prepared for his birthday. Devotees sent food in large quantities:
some =
sent rice, some sugar, some fruits.Someone sent a huge load of brinjals
and=
 we ate brinjals day after day. The stalks alone made a big heap which
was =
lying in a corner.Bhagavan asked us to cook them as a curry! I was
stunned,=
 for even cattle would refuse to eat such useless stalks. Bhagavan
insisted=
 that the stalks were edible, and we put them in a pot to boil along
with d=
ry peas. After six hours of boiling they were as hard as
ever. We were at a=
 loss what to do, yet we did not dare to disturb Bhagavan.
But he always kn=
ew when he was needed in the kitchen and he would leave the
Hall even in th=
e middle of a discussion. A casual visitor would think that
his mind was al=
l on cooking. =E2=80=98How is the curry getting on?=E2=80=99 he asked. =E2=
=80=98Is it
a curry we are cooking?
We are boiling steel nails!=E2=80=99 I =
exclaimed, laughing. He stirred the stalks
with the ladle and went away wit=
hout saying anything.Soon after we found
them quite tender. The dish was si=
mply delicious and everybody was asking
for a second helping. Bhagavan
chal=
lenged the diners to guess what vegetable they were eating.Everybody
praise=
d the curry and the cook, except Bhagavan. He swallowed the little he
was s=
erved in one mouth-full like a medicine and refused a second helping. I
was=
 very disappointed, for I had taken so much trouble to cook his stalks
and =
he would not even taste them properly.

The next day he was telling somebod=
y, Sampurnamma was distressed that I did
not eat her wonderful curry. Can s=
he not see that everyone who eats is
myself? And what does it matter who ea=
ts the food? It is the cooking that
matters, not the cook or the eater. A t=
hing done well, with love and
devotion, is its own reward. What happens to =
it later matters little, for it
is out of our hands.

On another occasion h=
e said, =E2=80=9CWhat is taste? It is what our tongue tells us.
We think th=
at taste is in the food itself, but it is not so. The food itself
is neithe=
r tasty nor not tasty; it is the tongue that makes it so. To me no
taste is=
 pleasant or unpleasant, it is just as it is.=E2=80=9D Although Sri Ramana
=
was an excellent cook, took great care in the preparation of the meals and
=
did not tolerate any carelessness on the part of the cooks, the pleasure of=

eating seemed to mean nothing to him.

At the end of the 1930s he stopped =
cooking, as the stream of visitors was
growing ever larger and building pro=
jects increasingly demanded his
attention. But even so he still remained in=
 constant contact with the
kitchen.
