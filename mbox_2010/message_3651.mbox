Namaste,

Actually, whether an experience is real or hallucination is secon=
dary. What kind of progress one is making is primary.

How well has your li=
mited personality been replaced? How proud do you feel when you achieve som=
ething or someone praises you and how angry or sad you feel when you fail o=
r someone abuses you? How happy do you feel when something good happens to =
you or your family physically and how sad do you feel when something bad ha=
ppens to you or your family? When you are attracted to something, how badly=
 do you want to have it? When you are repelled by something, how badly do y=
ou want to avoid it?

THAT determines how much progress you have made. Not =
how many millions of times you repeated a mantra or how many thousands of h=
omas you did or how many scriptures you read or how many temples you visite=
d or how many mystical visions you saw or how many mystical sounds you hear=
d.

If you had a vision and yet there is no progress, the vision is probabl=
y a hallucination. Even if it is real, it is as good as a hallucination. If=
 you say "I have a cow in my house", I will say "show me milk from it." If =
you say there is no milk, I will say it is probably a big toy cow and not a=
 real cow. Even if it is a real cow, it is as good as a toy cow that gives =
no milk.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If you see message 3481 (http://groups.yahoo.co=
m/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481), you will see a couple of examples where=
 one person experienced something and another person demonstrated awareness=
 of that experience. Such third party verification can suggest that an expe=
rience is perhaps not a hallucination of one mind.

However, the thing with=
 third party verification is that extra-sensory things may not be perceived=
 uniformly. In Rajarshi's example, one person perceived an elephant and ano=
ther a great force, at a Mahaganapathi homam.

I mentioned a couple of exam=
ples earlier. In one case, a person was meditating with Gayatri mantra whil=
e thinking of Mahalakshmi and, after attaining a good level of focus, he pe=
rceived the Mother as all-pervading light that filled his entire consciousn=
ess. He was in a blissful state. A priest with some psychic abilities stand=
ing a few feet away and doing a Rudraabhishekam had a vision of 18-handed M=
ahalakshmi standing in the place of this person.

In another example I ment=
ioned before, one person finishing a Chandi homam was calling the Mother ba=
ck into his heart from the fire. His eyes were closed and he was visualizin=
g the Mother as light that was entering him and he felt nice. A person sitt=
ing behind him and meditating was startled by a vision that flashed of a da=
rk goddess who was jumping at him with a pile of kumkum. When he opened eye=
s, he found the person performing homam pointing hands at himself.

One may=
 perceive the same entity as energy or force or light or sound or a specifi=
c human-like form. Thus, it is difficult to find third party verification o=
f a mystical experience, except in rare cases.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

The focus=
 on experiences is counter-productive. One yearning for an experience may b=
e doing so for sub-conscious satisfaction of ego.

Moreover, anticipation o=
f an experience or some other tangible result hampers one's focus during me=
ditation or homam or other sadhanas. The goal of sadhana is to overcome ego=
 ("I-ness") and create a vacuum in the mind that can be filled by the deity=
. If one is not distracted by thoughts and keeps the mind focused on mantra=
 to the best of one's ability, a time will come someday when the remaining =
few thoughts wither away like plants not getting enough water. When all tho=
ughts cease, a vacuum is created in the mind which can be filled by the man=
tra or its deity. THAT is the goal of sadhana. A mind filled with anticipat=
ion of a result and pride cannot create such a vacuum. The anticipation of =
a result is like a big tree that will not wither away and instead give rise=
 to many plants continually.

If you believe you had a visi=
on of a deity or a higher being, make sure it does not increase your pride =
or sense of entitlement ("I deserve this. So I got it").

wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. =
I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my da=

hat I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, =

ially

the level of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi=
 Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element =
to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and=
 jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my re=
quest) - and he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minut=

a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on e=

minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning that this =
should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining spiritual=
 progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be different. I ha=

ce is real or hallucination is secondary. What kind of progress one is maki=
ng is primary.<br><br>How well has your limited personality been replaced? =
How proud do you feel when you achieve something or someone praises you and=
 how angry or sad you feel when you fail or someone abuses you? How happy d=
o you feel when something good happens to you or your family physically and=
 how sad do you feel when something bad happens to you or your family? When=
 you are attracted to something, how badly do you want to have it? When you=
 are repelled by something, how badly do you want to avoid it?<br><br>THAT =
determines how much progress you have made. Not how many millions of times =
you repeated a mantra or how many thousands of homas you did or how many sc=
riptures you read or how many temples you visited or how many mystical visi=
ons
 you saw or how many mystical sounds you heard.<br><br>If you had a vis=
ion and yet there is no progress, the vision is probably a hallucination. E=
ven if it is real, it is as good as a hallucination. If you say "I have a c=
ow in my house", I will say "show me milk from it." If you say there is no =
milk, I will say it is probably a big toy cow and not a real cow. Even if i=
t is a real cow, it is as good as a toy cow that gives no milk.<br><br>*&nb=
sp;       *     &nbs=
p;  *<br><br>If you see message 3481 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=
dic-wisdom/message/3481), you will see a couple of examples where one perso=
n experienced something and another person demonstrated awareness of that e=
xperience. Such third party verification can suggest that an experience is =
perhaps not a hallucination of one mind.<br><br>However, the thing with thi=
rd party verification is that extra-sensory things may not be perceived
 un=
iformly. In Rajarshi's example, one person perceived an elephant and anothe=
r a great force, at a Mahaganapathi homam.<br><br>I mentioned a couple of e=
xamples earlier. In one case, a person was meditating with Gayatri mantra w=
hile thinking of Mahalakshmi and, after attaining a good level of focus, he=
 perceived the Mother as all-pervading light that filled his entire conscio=
usness. He was in a blissful state. A priest with some psychic abilities st=
anding a few feet away and doing a Rudraabhishekam had a vision of 18-hande=
d Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person.<br><br>In another examp=
le I mentioned before, one person finishing a Chandi homam was calling the =
Mother back into his heart from the fire. His eyes were closed and he was v=
isualizing the Mother as light that was entering him and he felt nice. A pe=
rson sitting behind him and meditating was startled by a vision that flashe=
d of a dark goddess who was jumping at him with a pile of kumkum.
 When he =
opened eyes, he found the person performing homam pointing hands at himself=
.<br><br>One may perceive the same entity as energy or force or light or so=
und or a specific human-like form. Thus, it is difficult to find third part=
y verification of a mystical experience, except in rare cases.<br><br>*&nbs=
p;       *      =
;  *<br><br>The focus on experiences is counter-productive. One yearni=
ng for an experience may be doing so for sub-conscious satisfaction of ego.=
<br><br>Moreover, anticipation of an experience or some other tangible resu=
lt hampers one's focus during meditation or homam or other sadhanas. The go=
al of sadhana is to overcome ego ("I-ness") and create a vacuum in the mind=
 that can be filled by the deity. If one is not distracted by thoughts and =
keeps the mind focused on mantra to the best of one's ability, a time will =
come someday when the remaining few thoughts wither away
 like plants not g=
etting enough water. When all thoughts cease, a vacuum is created in the mi=
nd which can be filled by the mantra or its deity. THAT is the goal of sadh=
ana. A mind filled with anticipation of a result and pride cannot create su=
ch a vacuum. The anticipation of a result is like a big tree that will not =
wither away and instead give rise to many plants continually.<br><br>* =

> On the 28th of Jan, my father passed a=
way peacefully (after struggling with renal failure and other complications=
) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father's body to the sma=
shaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilli=
ant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his ex=
perience of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji)=
, and I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaa=
n bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs =
a homam on my dad's funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as p=
er the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a si=
milar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding=
 to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the =
smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over=
 my body...especially<br>
>  in/around the abdominal region. As taught i=
n Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as equanimously as I could, and tol=
d myself that 'even this would change'. Soon after, a thought came to my mi=
nd, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I should perform a =
mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to ha=
ve a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some =
black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not=
 even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try and ret=
urned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought =
some ghee. <br>

> It was my first time at =
a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead b=
ody at such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but =
soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset t=
ime), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the fr=
iends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasan=
a. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I =
would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' ha=
ppens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid desc=
ription in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I =
think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):=
). <br>

> I closed my eyes - thanked Mothe=
r Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked t=
heir support and blessings in my very first attempt in doing such a ritual.=
 Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on breath, and I saw m=
y breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my breath for few minut=
es and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning that this shoul=
d be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining spiritual prog=
ress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be different. I had a d=
eep desire that my father accumulates some 'punya' so that his journey in t=
he non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee' . I inspected further and felt that =
there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such a unc=
onventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered mys=
elf and said "this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane=
 desires. Everytime I have
 done<br>
>  homam in the past, I have asked =
you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it wo=
n't be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if I =
continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you to=
 purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desir=
e that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I a=
m sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities and =
my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours if h=
e is doing something wrong". <br>

> After =
this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =
though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=
LY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=
 mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =
not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=
alise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=
 fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=
 to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=
eet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=
ind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skelet=
al jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=
e form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=
ted mentally the thoughts about the desire and
 surrendering of<br>
>  m=
y ignorance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by ex=
planing the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared to=

eem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this=

 it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the=
 fire particles (which looked like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as =
a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platfor=
