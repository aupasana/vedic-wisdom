Whethere Kaaba is a Hindu temple or not it does not matter. If whoever that=
 wrote this article think that it's a Hindu temple he/she should go to Kaab=
a and perform Abhishekam .We have abundance of temples in India which are i=
n bad shape and needs attention by the Indian government. Even if it is a H=
indu temple its of no signficance because its in a Islamic country which ha=
s its own set of beliefs that are diametrically opposite to the Sanatan Dha=
rma. While studying history is helpful, we should stop living in past glory=
.
