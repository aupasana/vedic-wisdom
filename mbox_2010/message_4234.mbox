 D. Disciple
M. Ramana Maharshi

30th January, 1935

Talk 20.

D.: In Europ=
e it is not understood by the people that a man in solitude can
be helpful.=
 They imagine that men working in the world can alone be useful.
When will =
this confusion cease? Will the European mind continue wading in
the morass =
or will it realise the truth?

M.: Never mind Europe or America.Where are t=
hey except in your mind? Realise
your Self and then all is realised.If you =
dream and see several men, and
then wake up and recall your dream, do you t=
ry to ascertain if the persons
of your dream creation are also awake?

D.: =
Some say that Sri Sankaracharya was only intellectual and not realised.
Is =
it so?

M.: Why worry about Sankaracharya? Realise your own Self. Others ca=
n take
care of themselves.

D.: But common people in Europe and America wou=
ld not appreciate such an
attitude and would desire a display of powers and=
 instructions by lectures,
etc.

M.: Lectures may entertain individuals for=
 a few hours without improving
them. Silence on the other hand is permanent=
 and benefits the whole of
humanity.

D.: But silence is not understood.

M=
.: It does not matter. By silence, eloquence is meant. Oral lectures are
no=
t so eloquent as silence. Silence is unceasing eloquence.The Primal
Master,=
 Dakshinamurti, is the ideal. He taught his rishi disciples by
silence.

D.=
: But then there were disciples for Him.It was all right.Now it is
differen=
t. They must be sought after and helped.

M.: That is a sign of ignorance.T=
he power which created you has created the
world. If it can take care of yo=
u, it can similarly take care of the world
also.

D.: Is yoga advised for a=
 spiritual aspirant?
M.: Yoga helps control of mind.
