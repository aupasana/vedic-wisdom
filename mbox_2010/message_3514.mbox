 It was near the end of May in 1938 when I returned to Ramanasramam from
No=
rth India. When my bus was approaching the ashram on the Chengam Road I
ask=
ed the driver to stop and let me off near Palakothu, just west of the
ashra=
m. S. S. Cohen occupied a small cottage there and during my previous
stay i=
n Tiruvannamalai he often requested me to come and live with him in
Palakot=
hu. I decided to take him up on the offer. Leaving my luggage in his
room, =
I walked over to the ashram, entered the Old Hall, prostrated before
the Ma=
harshi and sat down until 11:00 a.m., which was the dinner time. I
then ret=
urned to Cohen's cottage to eat. I didn't realize at the time that
devotees=
 just arriving after a long absence were usually requested to take
their fi=
rst meal with Bhagavan, even though, as in my case, they may be
living outs=
ide the ashram. When Bhagavan came to Palakothu on his walk after
lunch, hi=
s attendant stopped and told me that Bhagavan, not seeing me in the
dining =
hall, had inquired as to my whereabouts. The attendant stayed and
talked to=
 us as Bhagavan continued on alone. I was very touched by the
Maharshi's so=
licitude. I met him as he was returning from his walk and told
him about my=
 North Indian trip. I began narrating my visit to Krishnaprem
and told Bhag=
avan how keen he was to hear all about him and Ramanasramam. It
was then th=
e month of May, the hottest time of the year.

I explained to Bhagavan how =
delightfully pleasant and cool the climate of
Almora was, especially compar=
ed to the present weather in
Tiruvannamalai. Bhagavan
said, "The real cooln=
ess is within. If we have that coolness it will be cool
wherever we go. Sim=
ilarly, if you want to protect your feet from the rough
ground, you don't t=
ry to cover the earth with a piece of leather. You simply
put leather shoes=
 on your own feet and the job is done."

In this same year, 1939, I occupie=
d another hut near Cohen's in Palakothu.
This hut consisted of two small ro=
oms, about six feet by eight feet each. I
stayed in one of these and Swami =
Prajnanananda, a westerner, was using the
other. One night before I returne=
d from the ashram, someone broke the lock
on the door and made off with my =
suitcase and some other things. The next
day I searched in the nearby woods=
 and found the suitcase, which contained
mostly books. The books were scatt=
ered around near the suitcase. I collected
them and returned to my room. A =
short time later there was another robbery.
Someone pounded a hole in the m=
ud wall near the window frame. At this exact
place I kept some money in a j=
ar. Somebody must have seen me taking money
from there and got the idea of =
stealing it. The next day when Bhagavan came
to Palakothu on his walk I tol=
d him about the theft. He looked over the
scene and explained to others how=
 some of these local people keep an eye
open for such opportunities, and ho=
w they must have seen me take money from
that jar and decided to pound a ho=
le in the wall to get at it. He then told
me that I should not keep anythin=
g in this place that would be desired by
others. I therefore shifted my bel=
ongings to town and gradually moved back
there myself.

Bhagavan's brother =
had to endure considerable criticism while managing the
ashram. Even so, th=
ere is little doubt that Bhagavan used him as his
instrument. When Niranjan=
ananda Swami felt an inner prompting from Bhagavan,
he confidently acted on=
 it. The following may be an example of one such
occasion.

It is widely kn=
own that Paul Brunton's book, A Search in Secret India, did
much to make kn=
own to the world that the Maharshi, a unique sage of this
century, was livi=
ng inTiruvannamalai. Brunton was a professional writer and
in those days wh=
erever he would go he would often be seen taking notes on
bits of paper. Wh=
ile in the Old Hall listening to questions put to Bhagavan
and his replies,=
 he would be eagerly taking notes. After the success of A
Search in Secret =
India, he began writing many other books in which he would
sometimes adopt =
the Maharshi's teachings without giving due acknowledgment.
When the ashram=
 authorities realized this they decided to stop him from
taking notes in th=
e hall.

One day in 1939, Brunton was sitting next to me taking notes as us=
ual when
Niranjanananda Swami boldly walked into the hall, stood next to Bh=
agavan and
told Munagala Venkataramiah to tell Brunton in English that he i=
s no longer
permitted to take notes while sitting before Bhagavan. Brunton =
was told
accordingly. Brunton looked at Venkataramiah and said, 'Is this al=
so
Bhagavan's view ?' Venkataramiah did not reply to this question and Bhag=
avan
who was quietly sitting there didn't say a word either. A few tense mo=
ments
passed. Then Brunton stood up and left the hall. That was the last ti=
me he
took notes in the hall, and that was also when Brunton began distanci=
ng
himself from the ashram.

It was very unusual to see the Sarvadhikari ap=
pear so bold and authoritative
before the Maharshi. He must have felt that =
this exploitation should stop
and was confident that Bhagavan was behind hi=
m.
