 Sri Niranjananda Swami, the Sarvadhikari of Sri Ramanasramam, desired that=

the first major biography of Sri Bhagavan should be written in Tamil. But =
at
the time, B. V. Narasimha Swami was gathering information and facts in o=
rder
to write a good biography of Sri Bhagavan in English. However, even be=
fore
this English book was published, a Malayalam scholar came one day to h=
ave
darshan of Sri Bhagavan. As soon as he saw Sri Bhagavan he was inspired=
 to
write his biography, since he had the habit of writing the life story i=
n
Malayalam of any great soul he happen to meet. So immediately after arriv=
ing
he began to gather information from some local people, asking them, 'Wh=
o is
this Ramana Maharshi?' 'Where was he born?' and so on.

Not being fami=
liar with Bhagavan or the understanding that the
Self-realization of a Jnan=
i is itself his real greatness, some people
naturally imagined that Bhagava=
n should possess all sorts of supernatural
powers (siddhis) and they theref=
ore spread rumors which attributed such
powers to him, thinking that they w=
ere thereby glorifying him. Though
Bhagavan Ramana taught that all siddhis =
are as trivial as straw and are to
be regarded as treacherous friends by th=
e spiritual aspirant, even he was
not spared from the rumors created by suc=
h people. Unfortunately, it was
only from this type of people that the Mala=
yalam scholar quickly gathered
biographical information on Bhagavan. Then, =
within a day, he edited all his
notes and completed writing the biography.
=

Now, according to his biography Bhagavan was a householder, a lawyer from
=
Madurai who had three children. It was also reported that Sri Ramana
exhibi=
ted a number of siddhis in various places. In this way, many fantastic
but =
untrue incidents were contained in that biography. When he had finished
wri=
ting it, the Malayalam scholar brought the biography to Sri Bhagavan.

Amon=
g those living with Sri Bhagavan at that time, no one knew Malayalam
except=
 Kunju Swami, and he happened to be absent on that day. Therefore,
Bhagavan=
, who was himself well versed in Malayalam poetry and literature,
read the =
whole biography from beginning to end, stopping only here and there
to corr=
ect some spelling mistakes, and then returned it to the author
without alte=
ring even a single statement or idea. Thinking that the
biography he had wr=
itten was correct in every respect, having been seen and
corrected by Sri B=
hagavan himself, the author was very happy.

Soon the news spread among the=
 devotees in the Asramam that the life of Sri
Bhagavan had been written in =
Malayalam. However, since no one knew that
language, they did not know what=
 was written in it. The next day Kunju Swami
returned to the Asramam and th=
e devotees all eagerly told him, "This new
devotee has written Bhagavan's b=
iography in Malayalam. Bhagavan has also
gone through it and approved it af=
ter making all the necessary corrections."

With great surprise and joy, Ku=
nju Swami received the biography from the
Malayalam scholar and began to re=
ad through it. But when he saw the many
untrue reports written in it, he wa=
s unable to bear it. He went to the
author and tactfully said to him, "Many=
 statements in this biography are
totally incorrect! I am afraid that you h=
ave not gathered your information
from the proper sources."

But with great=
 confidence the author replied, "There is not even a single
mistake in it. =
See, Bhagavan himself has corrected it with his own pen
wherever it was nec=
essary. So I am confident that this alone is his correct
life history."

Wi=
thout saying anything further, Kunju Swami brought the biography to Sri
Bha=
gavan and complained, "O Bhagavan! Your own handwriting is found here in
ma=
ny places, so you must have seen this. But how can this all be true?"

"Are=
 all these other things true (pointing to the world), and is this alone
fal=
se?" replied Sri Bhagavan with a peaceful smile.

Though this sounds humoro=
us, we should notice the profound teaching that
lies hidden in it. From his=
 reply it is clear that the ever-attained
experience of Sri Bhagavan, who t=
eaches that the world is a mere false
appearance, is that even the ego, the=
 individual who sees the world, is
itself false. Those who do not know the =
Self cannot but feel slighted and
angry if some historical facts in their l=
ife, which would have otherwise
given them fame and glory, were omitted or =
written about in a distorted
manner.

In this world, which is full of so-ca=
lled great ones who strenuously seek
praise and publicity for self glorific=
ation, how exalted is the greatness of
Bhagavan Ramana who was completely i=
ndifferent to any amount of disparaging
words written about him! In Bhagava=
n's view, even the biography we now have,
which records his life as we saw =
it with our own eyes, is as true as this
Malayalam biography. That is to sa=
y, in Bhagavan's view, even his birth, his
attainment of Self-realization, =
his renunciation and his life as Jagat-Guru
are just as real or unreal as t=
his Malayalam biography!
