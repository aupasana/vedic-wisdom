=C2=A0
This specific sadhana is basi=

=C2=A0
Those who are expert in Aghor sadhanas, can =

 not require a fire. Like a Shav Sadhana etc. These can be done - so I have=

I also llike to a=

=C2=A0
The whole of Kashi is indeed energized. I had asked =
Manish this question. He said that scientifically speaking, Varanasi exists=
 between two rivers, Varuna and Asi. These flow in clockwise and anti-clock=

pervade this whole city. However, a bigger query is whether this=C2=A0is an=

the city in this way so that energies exist.

Dear shri narasimh=
aji and shri Rajarishis nandiji,
After going thro the experiences of Shri M=
anish at Kasi, I am wonderstruck.
I also like to add to the query raised by=
 SHri Acharayalu.
Only in Hindu religion(most of the castes) they cremate t=
he body whereas
in other religions they are buried after doing the last rel=
igious rites. Does
their soul wander? Can a similair sadhana is possible on=
 a body which is

I also llike to add from one of =

has said that the entire Kasi=
 is filled up with shiva linga ie wherever u dig
the ground after some dept=
h u find Shiva lingam and that is the reason
the whole of Kasi is energised=
 and also in spite of caracass floating in
Ganges at Kasi yet the water is =
never polluted because of presence
of shiva lingam.
=C2=A0
regards,

Dear Rajarshi,

=C2=A0 Namaste. What an inspiring recitation of the expe=
riences. After reading the third day's experience about the "MOKUL", I wond=
er, is there religion among SPIRITS also.....I mean there are spirits of al=
l religions floating around....I was, in my limited knowledge, thinking tha=
t the religion is only to the body...Please shed some light on this...

=C2=
=A0 Narasimhaji, can you please enlighten on this...

=C2=A0 Thanks a lot f=
or sharing these experiences. .
