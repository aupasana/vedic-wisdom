Namaste,
 
The word dik means "direction" and dikpaala literally means "ruler of direction". Is this a physical direction or symbolic of something else is the question.
 
The clue lies in the teachings of maharShi paraashara in "bR^ihat paaraashara horaa shaastram", a jyotiSha classic. When teaching different varga chakra (divisional charts), he lists the deities lording the divisions. When covering a divisional chart known as dashaaMsha, which shows the work done by one, maharShi paraashara maps the ten equal parts of each raashi to the ten dikpaala (indra, agni, yama, nirR^iti etc).
 
Obviously, dikpaalas control more than the physical directions (east, southeast, south etc). The fact that they were mentioned with dashaaMsha suggests that they control the directions we take in life by taking up different kinds of work!
 
For example, indra shows administration, governance, management, supervision etc; agni shows work involving transformation and creation, such as legilation, engineering, technology etc; yama shows enforcement of rules, such as police, soliders etc. I have also seen SQA (software quality assurance) engineers with strong influence of yama in dashaaMsha. Similarly, nirR^iti shows work that breaks convention and barriers, such as cutting edge technology and research and also illegal activities. And so on.
 
Various dikpaalas shows various kinds of directions we can take in life with the karma we engage in the society (for fulfilling our dharma towards society).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

As their name suggests, they are the lords of the 10 cardinal directions.  However, a direction is not a permanent fixture and as such is based on the position of the observer with respect to the apparent motion of the sun. If, some day, people were to perform some ritual in outerspace, the concept of directions will break down and dikpalas will have no significance. In the light of this, what is the spiritual meaning of dikpalas? Where exactly do they stand in the hierarchy of deities and cosmic beings?
