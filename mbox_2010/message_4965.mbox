Hi,
I agree that Prakash Kaushik's rendition is simply awesome. I have down=
loaded the entire chandi path chapters 1-13 from astrojyoti.com. Did not kn=
ow who sang them but was wondering who rendered it so well. After seeing yo=
ur post, I was 'google'ing on prakash kaushik and found a link on raaga.com=
 I heard a sample to verify and yeah, what I have downloaded is indeed Prak=
ash Kaushik's. We are very fortunate that we have such nice renditions and =
Sri PVRji's invaluable guidance. This Navaratri will be a very satisfying e=
xperience for me, personally.
Nagraj
