Namaste,
 
Though this may be true in general, specific examples can be found for Krishna devotees who did not have to forgo material comforta or devotees of the divine Mother who were tested by taking away everything.
 
It depends on the karmas and conditioning.
 
But, one thing is certain. Whether it is Krishna or Chandi, they may test by pushing the person to an extreme, but they never push beyond the breaking limit.
 
When the mind identifies with something, that thing may be negatively affected by god to let one realize that that thing is transient and does not matter. As one realizes it a little, it may be more negatively affected. Finally, one may be pushed to an extreme.
 
However, god is kind (even an ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God may push one short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and then god may push further.
 
To use the analogy from the other mail of today, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with 6th grade questions. Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th grade to the 6th grade will now be tested with 6th grade questions. As one advances from one grade to another, one is tested more and more.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
