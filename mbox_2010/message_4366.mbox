Namaste,
 
The size of the fire matters. Doing homam with a small fire usin=
g 3-4 small dry coconut pieces is also definitely good and useful, but doin=
g homam with a bigger fire has a stronger effect on one's consciousness. Wi=
th either practice, of course, the key to success are regularity and persis=
tence.
 
If someone has an apartment in a western country without any firep=
lace or balcony and doing homam with dry coconut pieces next to a window in=
 a room is also not possible due to strict fire rules, I want to suggest an=
 option that enables a mini-homam. Such people can do a "deepa homam" (homa=
m in a lamp). Pour some melted ghee in a small mud/copper/silver/bronze/bra=
ss/golden pot (or lamp stand). Put in a wick in it. Treating it as a homa k=
undam, do homam normally. When it is time to install fire, light the wick. =
With each swaahaa, pour a drop of melted ghee in the pot. Do everything els=
e as in the procedure.
 
As I said, homam with a big fire is better, but so=
mething is definitely better than nothing. Do deepa homam with a lamp and t=
hen meditate after poornaahuti. BTW, poornaahuti can be a spoonful of melte=
d ghee.
 
One point I forgot to make earlier:
 
If someone is buying a new =
house and looking for guidance, one more small factor. If homam is done in =
the northeast or east or southeast corners of the house, it is better. One =
can look for a house that has a fireplace or balcony in those sides. Of cou=
rse, those who already have a house and doing homam elsewhere need not worr=
y. The key is to do it. Guidelines in shastras are for enhancing the experi=
ence a little and not for blocking it out of fear of breaking guidelines.

Best regards,
Narasimha
