Namaste Rajarshji,

Thank you for your reply.  I understand your point abo=
ut the Devi taking
various forms in the Chandi Paath where initially the De=
vi manifests
from the assimilation of the energies of the Devas (which are =
really her
energies to begin with just that they are divided into various g=
ods and
demi gods and the whole manifested universe and its constituents) a=
nd
then she displays multiple manifestations of herself through different
f=
orms and attributes to fight various demons and then in the 10th
chapter sh=
e again assimilates all her attributes and forms into herself
again and so =
completes the cycle.


The chandi paath is split into three parts where in =
the last part the
Devi is manifesting as Maha Saraswati or the pure sattwa =
form of
manifested consciousness and she is up against Shumbha and Nishumbh=
a who
as per some commentators are nothing but our Ego or the sense of I
(S=
humbha) and Attachment or the sense of mine (Nishumba).  So the
question is=
 why would the Devi send Shiva as an envoy to Shumbha and
Nishumba at the e=
nd of the Chandi Paath?  No envoys were sent to Madhu
Kaitabh or the Mahish=
asura or all the other lot of demons througout the
Chandi Paath.  But in th=
e end only when Ego and the sense of Attachment
remains and all the other d=
emons (impurities) are destroyed then perhaps
the pure Sattwic Manifested f=
orm of Devi is trying to lead Ego and
Attachment from self identification t=
o identification with Shiva or the
absolute consciousness but that is diffi=
cult for Ego and Attachment to
acomplish and they must be slain as they wil=
l simply not just back down
and go to the netherworlds.

Maybe I am trying =
to read too much into the text and looking for some
specific explanation wh=
en rather the explanation is rather simple as you
point out.

Regards

Sume=
et

ika is not just devi, but the sum total of all energies in all
