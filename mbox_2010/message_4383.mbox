Hello! Everybody,
=C2=A0
If i can=C2=A0share something=C2=A0on the concept=
 of=C2=A0 UPAVAASA.
=C2=A0
Vrata- means Course of Conduct
=C2=A0
Sankalapam=
 - means Vow
=C2=A0
Upavaasa means- Being nearer/sitting nearer/residing ne=
arer and literally=C2=A0it doesn't mean empty bowl.
=C2=A0
For a theist upa=
vaasa would mean residing near God,being nearer to god and for a non-theist=
 it would probably mean being nearer to your inner self, residing near your=
 inner self.
=C2=A0
Not to eat during a Upavaasa is a secondary act, which =
is supposed to come out as a necessary result of really spending time in re=
siding near God/inner self and failing to find time to eat or failing to fe=
el the need for food because of the pleasure/happiness/enjoyment one is der=
iving on account of his/her proximity to God/Inner self, just like the=C2=
=A0two lovers involved in true love for each other=C2=A0 fail to feel the n=
eed for food, water etc till the time=C2=A0they are together=C2=A0.
=C2=A0
=
There would be another explanation to Upavaasa meaning fasting. Our true na=
ture is not contained in the physical body. Physical body is only the mediu=
m or to say in the words of Bhagavat Geeta it's only a cloth/dress which so=
ul wears to fulfil the divine plan and keeps on changing till attainment of=
 the divine plan/completion of it's self realisation. We are supposed to ca=
rry our physical body, till we identify ourselves with our ego with our phy=
sical body and the bondage between the body and soul falls apart on realisa=
tion of the true identity/nature of soul. So to attain liberation/moksha it=
's essential to realise the true nature of the self, to realie that physica=
l body is separate from the soul. 
=C2=A0
So upavaasa is a conscious design=
 to train oneself to realise the difference between one's physical body and=
 one's soul. when we do upavaasa we are to observe/see how even though the =
physical body starves still there's an entity which remains unaffected by t=
he starvation. We are to observe/see that it's the physical body which feel=
s starved and the consciousness/soul is still separarte from the physical b=
ody which is starving. There are so many practices which are designed to ac=
hieve this realisation of separation of physical body and soul. All tapasch=
aryas( austere measures/practices like sleeping on=C2=A0 a nail-bed) are de=
signed for this alone.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0Having understood the real purpose of U=
pavaasa, now while fasting/doing upavaasa if all your attention is centered=
 around food only and waiting for the period of upavaasa to be over so that=
 you can eat something, then that kind of Upavaasa has no meaning as you ar=
e not residing near your Inner Self/God but you are residing near food.So i=
t would aptly be then called "Phala-Vaasa" / "Bhojana-Vaasa" or "any-Vaasa"=
 but not "UpaVaasa".=C2=A0But if even while eating if=C2=A0you can realise/=
 u can see/ U can observe=C2=A0that it's the body which is receiving the fo=
od and not the soul, it's the body which is relishing the food and not the =
soul,=C2=A0 and can accept any kind of food( so long as it meets the=C2=A0r=
equirement of body)=C2=A0without any complain of food tasting good/bad, you=
 are doing upavaasa in true sense of the meaning
=C2=A0
So Upavaasa and fas=
ting are two different things.

Hi =
All,


I have been observing a fast on Ekadashi for quite some time now. My=
 mind has come up with following queries regarding Vratam with Ekadashi Vra=
tam in particular. Can someone please answer the following: -


- I conside=
r "Vratam" as "Sankalpam" (Means a Vow) and not mainly "Upwaas" (Which mean=
s bowls empty). And I observe Ekadashi Vratam as Falaahar Vratam i.e. Vow t=
o sustain myself on Fruits mainly. At the same time, I observe it as a Upwa=
as in the sense that I eat only two times a day, thereby, keeping my bowls =
empty for most of the time. Is this the right way of doing Ekadashi Vratam?=



- Also, there is an ambiguity about Udaya Tithi. For Example, Ekadashi i=
n India starts this noon and remains till tomorrow noon or so. But, since E=
kadashi will be the Tithi per tomorrow's sunrise, Tomorrow is recommended f=
or Vratam by Panchangas. I am not sure if this sampling (or synchronisation=
) by sunrise (clock) of the tithi (data) comes from ancient texts or some r=
ecent modifications have brought this concept. This becomes specifically am=
biguous when Ekadashi happens to begin just after one sunrise (hold violati=
on) and ends few minutes after the next sunrise. Per Udaya Tithi, Ekadashi =
will be the next day, although all the conjuct (in degrees from 120 or 240 =
to 132 or 252 so) has lost its impact by that time.
Can someone please clar=
ify?


- For me, Ekadashi is the day when Sun and Moon are in trines i.e. O=
ur mind has close trinal conjunct with our soul. That is how this is an aus=
picious day. Now, based on Udaya tithi, Ekadashi is celebrated on the day w=
hen at sunrise, Sun is in Lagna and Moon is in any of the trines. Thus, on =
the sunrise, it is auspicious with Sun, Moon and Lagna all being in auspici=
ous positions. But, does that make that whole day auspicious enough for Vra=
tam?


- =C2=A0Any specific Homams that can be done on Ekadashi to boost yo=
ur spiritual progress?


-=C2=A0Any specific Mantras?


I have more questio=
ns which I will try ask as and when my understanding of these things get be=
tter.


Best Regards,
Sriram
