Few more thoughts on the ongoing subject=85

There is hardly any utility to=
 bring science in this issue to prove points on either side.

1) For e.g., =
Vitamin B12 is not easily available from the plant source which is actually=
 plenty in Eggs. On the other side the Vegetarians can get that from Yoghur=
t, Cheese and such foods. And such many points can be discussed from both t=
he sides.

2) Few of the Arguments of Vegetarians and vegans is that of "Fo=
rmation of Teeth", "Formation of Intestines" etc=85 They say that Human tee=
th formation and digestive systems are not suitable for diet from the sourc=
e of Animals.  They site the examples of a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buf=
falo and compare that with Humans. Which I found not proved when I see peop=
le around me.  Majority of the population today and earlier are meat eaters=
 and there does not seem any noticeable physical difference which suggest a=
ny difficulties for them. It is also noticed that because of High protein c=
ontents, they are well built. Same way Physical strength, stamina, recovery=
 from Illness and such were never issues with generations of people in Indi=
a and else where who never used meat and sea food in their diet.

So scienc=
e will not be able to give definitive answer for some one to decide between=
 2 strict options, unless science proves without a doubt, that a certain di=
sease or a Physical ailment or a mental abnormality is only because of *eat=
ing meat* or *NOT eating meat* and that should also clearly visible in prac=
tical cases which affect large section of masses. Till that time, so called=
 science, will mainly be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetari=
anism and Non-vegetarianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardia=
c patients, Blood pressure problems and such many commonly seen diseases ar=
e found in all sections of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetaria=
ns. Both sections are living their lives for Generations and generations.

=

Regarding Holistic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=85

1)	One of My ver=
y close doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in Pediatrics) and =
a strict vegetarian who also obviously contains a vast knowledge of medical=
 science gave me a certain interesting fact. During his studies, their batc=
h was once taken to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of=
 the biggest Slaughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals a=
re slaughtered to meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and=
 60% is exported mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch=
 could not stand the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Alm=
ost everybody including himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaugh=
terhouse and left the place with heavy hearts.

2)	There are meat eaters wh=
o are well advanced in spiritual path and there are vegetarians who are utt=
erly selfish and deep down in materialism hence I refrain to talk on that l=
ine. Only I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and such terms =
should not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something which=
 is unethical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while better a=
lternate sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tickle =
the palate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mars, b=
e it Kaliyuga or Satyuga.


3)	Solution is not to look if a Famous Saint or=
 Philosopher or any body, famous or otherwise, approves meat eating or disp=
roves it or suggests middle approach, it does not make any difference. If V=
imalananda emphatically suggest not to eat meat or otherwise (Vimalananda w=
as very clear for meat eating though), does not make any difference. Law of=
 Karma might be infinitely complex and might need deepest of understanding =
but that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next birth is there or no=
t? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive should be our o=
wn Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart. Why depen=
d upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat or should=
 not.  Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not know if I k=
ill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I will be k=
illed by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Hardly anybo=
dy knows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure that the me=
at I am eating has been of an animal that has been butchered mercilessly. T=
hat much is known without a doubt and that should make me think. If *avoida=
ble*, I must not eat that. It is that simple. Do not need further approval =
of anybody and no amount of arguments from Science or culture or religions =
or whatever should stand for me. Do I need to even look at those? NO.

Best=
 Regards,

Utpal

estionable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will hi=

  halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that fo=

l sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg=
 sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also supp=
ort this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice t=
he diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as B=
V is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.
> >

I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried ve=
getarian food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape =
from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digest=
ing food, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that a=
