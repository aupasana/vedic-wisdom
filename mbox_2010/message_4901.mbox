The only place I have seen something similar is in the Hathayoga pradeepika=
 which does say some such thing about how a yogi should be( should give up =
fire worship etc).However sanyasis can do homas( since nearly all parampara=
s do japa and purascharana). They are not allowed to be purohits since that=
 requires a consort(AFAIK).

I probably would not fall into the category 'L=
earned' but base my answer on what I have seen. I hope this helps.
