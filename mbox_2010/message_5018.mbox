Thanks for your prompt response Mr.Balaji.

I presume you meant anytime B=
ETWEEN 10am - 2pm (4 hours)

For the normal working/salaried class, this ta=
kes the PREFERRED time-range out of one's reach during the working week :(
=

In that case, what would be the second best time-range.. or
Are there any =
time-ranges that are specifically PROHIBITED?

Requesting the learned membe=
r(s) to enlighten.

Regards,
Mahesh
