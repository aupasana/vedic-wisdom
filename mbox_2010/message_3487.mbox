 The disciple asked: "Bhagavan, one may believe that God is with form, but
surely He is not in the earthen images that are worshipped?" Sri Ramakrishna
replied: "My dear sir, why do you say earthen images? The image of the
Divine Being is made of the spirit."

The disciple could not understand the meaning of this, but answered: "Yet
should it not be one's duty to make clear to those who worship images that
God is not the same as the images and that at the time of worship they
should think of God Himself and not of the image made of clay?"

The Bhagavan said: "The Lord of the universe teaches mankind. He who has
made the sun and moon, men and brutes; He who has created things for them to
live upon, parents to tend and rear them; He who has done so many things
will surely do something to bring them to the light. [p. 63]

The Lord dwells in the temple of the human body. He knows our innermost
thoughts. If there is anything wrong in image worship, does He not know that
all worship is meant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing that
it is for Him. Why should you worry yourself about things which are beyond
your reach? Try to realize God and love Him. This is your first duty. "You
speak of images made of clay.

Well, there often comes a necessity for worshipping such images and symbols.
In Vedanta it is said, the absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss pervades
the universe and manifests itself through all forms. What harm is done by
worshipping the Absolute through images and symbols? We see little girls
with their dolls.

How long do they play with them? So long as they are not married. After
marriage they put away those dolls. Similarly, one needs images and symbols
so long as God is not realized in His true form. It is God Himself who has
provided these various forms of worship. [p. 64]

The Master of the universe has done all this to suit different men in
different stages of spiritual growth and knowledge. The mother so arranges
the food for her children that each one gets what is best for him. Suppose a
mother has five children with one fish to cook for all. She will make
different dishes of it that she may give to each just what suits him,-- the
rich pulao for one, soup for another, fried fish for a third, fish with sour
tamarind for a fourth and so on, exactly according to the power of digestion
of each.
