It is always a questionable point. because again sections supporting vegeta=
rian diet will highlight the results which support veg food and vice versa.=
 There are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we w=
ill find that for different sources different sources are better. For examp=
le calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is bes=
t, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ay=
urveda also support this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non ve=
g will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food al=
one. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji=
.
> >

 let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy i=
s used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is a sciet=
ific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed to intestin=
es. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing=
 in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want t=
