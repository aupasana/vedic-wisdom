Respected Narasimha Ji,

I am thinking of starting a homam for Lord Krishna=
 at regular basis. I am highly thankful for the Manual and Audio lesson pro=
vided on your site. 

Please tell me that when we are reciting mantras, sho=
uld we recite them loudly or should we recite them mentally.

I understand =
that mental recitation or chanting is best when we are doing a japam. What =
is the best method for homam

With Regards
Atul
