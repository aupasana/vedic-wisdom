 When T.K. Sundaresa Iyer was a boy of twelve he first visited the Maharshi=

on the Hill in 1908. That first meeting bonded him to Bhagavan for the
rem=
ainder of his life and, consequently, he was a witness to many marvelous
ev=
ents in his Guru's presence. Here is one such incident on a holy Sivaratri
=
night in Sri Ramanasramam, as recorded in his book, At the Feet of
Bhagavan=
.

It was Sivaratri Day. The evening worship at the Mother's shrine was ove=
r.
The devotees had their dinner with Sri Bhagavan, who was now on his seat=
;
the devotees at His feet sitting around him. At 8:00 p.m. one of the sadh=
us
stood up, did pranam (offered obeisance), and with folded hands prayed:
=
"Today is the Sivaratri Day; we should be highly blessed by Sri Bhagavan
ex=
pounding to us the meaning of the Hymn to Dakshinamurthy (stotra)."

Says B=
hagavan: "Yes, sit down." The sadhu sat, and all eagerly looked at Sri
Bhag=
avan; Sri Bhagavan looked at them. Sri Bhagavan sat in his usual pose,
no, =
poise. No words, no movement, and all was stillness! He sat still, and
all =
sat still, waiting. The clock went on striking, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, =
one, two and three. Sri Bhagavan sat and they sat. Stillness,
calmness, mot=
ionless-not conscious of the body, of space or time. Thus eight
hours passe=
d in Peace, in Silence, in Being, as It is. Thus was the Divine
Reality tau=
ght through the speech of Silence by Bhagavan Sri
Ramana-Dakshinamurthy.

A=
t the stroke of 4:00 a.m. Sri Bhagavan quietly said: "And now have you
know=
n the essence of the Dakshinamurthy Hymn?" All the devotees stood and
made =
pranam to the holy form of the Guru in the ecstasy of their Being.

Ramana =
Maharshi: "Language is only a medium for communicating one's thoughts
to an=
other. It is called in only after thoughts arise; other thoughts arise
afte=
r the 'I'-thought rises; the 'I'-thought is the root of all
conversation. W=
hen one remains without thinking one understands another by
means of the un=
iversal language of silence."
