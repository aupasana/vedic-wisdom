Dear Every One,

re: You're The One

         I had a vision that I'm now p=
resenting to The People, you may
find it fits. It's about the elephant that=
's always been in the living
room, he wants to come and play again. Looking=
 for presention
opportunities I found you, I intend that we become good fri=
ends. Just a
brief background, I studied health and law until I figured the=
m out, the
truth is always the shortest distance between here and there. Bu=
t the
smoke and mirrors surrounding the truth is very complicated to tangle=

reason. I put together a four part presentation of how our country is
bein=
g destroyed and what needs to be done, it's on youtube under 'The
Wolves ar=
e in the Chicken Coop'. I presented it to Alex Jones to see if
he would key=
 his viewers to it, as he had publicly said he would do if
he saw a good id=
ea and it would mean hundreds of thousands of hits. If
he had I could have =
made it work, but he would not even discuss it.
         Without help I fou=
nd that even though I was getting the highest
star rating, less then twenty=
 present were even looking at part two. So
I realized it's hard to get peop=
le out of their cubicle bubble, until
their bubble bursts which is too late=
. I was wrestling with how to give
the wake up call that people could consi=
der in the comfort of their
cubicle. Going through the three DVD set of 'Wh=
at The Bleep' and arguing
with David Icke in my mind, while reading his 'In=
finite Love is the Only
Truth' book. He nailed so many things, but his idea=
 that the matrix was
projected by somebody somewhere else to keep us in an =
illusion was the
exteriorization that cleared my path.
         I saw the p=
aradigm shift, all the answers were before me. I
formed The Experiment in i=
ts entirety. I spent April 12-17, designing
the overview and presentation o=
f 'The Experiment to Maximize the
Observer's Effect' by presenting it, whic=
h is seven pages titled 'You're
The One', to about five hundred great scien=
tific minds at Stuart
Hameroff's 'Toward a Science of Consciousness'. Spons=
ored by the
University of Arizona in Tuscon. I'm proud and dismayed at the =
dead
silence that left most with mouths gaping. About a half dozen of them
=
voiced appreciation and encouragement, not one negative comment but most
av=
oided any. Nobody's dening the elephant is in the living room, but
nobody w=
ill talk about him. If you could comment I'd really appreciate
it.
        =
 I am proud to be the One with the opportunity to present the
next step in =
science, which is The Experiment. This is an experiment to
find why observa=
tion changes results by maximizing the effect. It is the
demanded and natur=
al next step of Quantum physics, based on specific
principles and scientifi=
c experimentation.
          The first innovation is to add the observer to=
 The Experiment.
Because we have never dealt with this before we refuse to =
come to terms
with this mandatory addition. We first 'tried' to eliminate a=
nd when we
found that impossible, to stay separate we 'try' to minimize ins=
tead of
maximizing our effect. Now that we know we can not be separate, thi=
s is
the step we must take but have not until now.
          The second is =
if consciousness changes results, do results
change according to belief as =
they certainly did in the double slot
dilemma that finalized the mess we ar=
e in, which herein we are finally
dealing with. Everywhere there are indica=
tors of this, in fact there are
no answers outside of this perspective, so =
why not?
          The third is the possibility that Quantum physics is how=
 all
physics actually works and only needs actualizing to be effective, if
=
belief is the focus of consciousness and the creator of all things. As
all =
preliminary investigations demonstrate this is true, The Experiment
will be=
 proved correct and will cause a paradigm shift in the
perspective of the o=
bserver(mass-consciousness).
          This change of perspective comes fro=
m the observer considering
life through the inter-connected big three Quant=
um laws. We are all the
same One, there is no thing outside of us, and we a=
re all and infinite
possibilities. Which is the interiorization of the exte=
rior view. This
effort is the natural genesis of science, the intentions ar=
e clear, what
this is going to find is we are all responsible for the belie=
fs that
create reality.
         The following is the academic overview, th=
e quotation portion
within is offered to The People with slight modificatio=
ns. If One of The
People wants to know after reading the quotation portion,=
 they are
offered 'You're The One' to have and read at their leisure. They =
are now
One of the first hundred monkeys, as all that is needed is wanting =
to
know.



Overview and Presentation of The Experiment


Question: As cons=
ciousness changes results, can results change to
anything wanted if we have=
 a consensus by the observer? If every One is
choosing what we all want, wi=
ll it manifest? This question is based on
the Quantum fact, we now know we =
are all the same One outside the field.
Therefore we must all want exactly =
the same things at our core.

Assumption: To work the observer must realize=
 infinite possibilities,
meaning anything is possible with belief. Anything=
 less is belief in
finite possibilities and its creation. You must realize =
there is no
thing outside of you to believe in infinite possibilities, and =
to
accomplish that you must realize you are the One. Idolatry is the
limita=
tion in our perspective and everyone is involved, this realized
the observe=
r takes the power back making the infinite the only
possibility. 'You're Th=
e One' does exactly that, gives the Quantum
perspective.
       Deities are=
 anyone believed to be superior and anywhere you place
your power believing=
 it is then outside of you. Examples: alcohol,
pharmaceutical drugs, govern=
ment, science..... Consciousness did not
come from nothing, but it is where=
 no thing is, also. Desire for the
'Big Bang' to occur had to exist, and is=
 an act of consciousness.
Therefore everything thereafter is within the One=
 consciousness. Thereby
is the reason for Time, Space, Energy, Mass, and Gr=
avity. Consciousness
is creating all things, therefore its reflection is al=
l that can be
found within them. You can not find what to believe in creati=
on, when
belief is the creator. You can find what your believing, but a cha=
nge of
belief is a change of creation.
       As you are consciousness your=
 reflections are for fun not to find
yourself in, nor limit yourself to. I =
know it's hard to let go of all
the mental gymnastics, we've devoted so muc=
h time 'trying' to find who
we are in our smallest reflection. Then we make=
 it smaller and harder to
find, making it even less likely, and start again=
. But when people
realize what we all want is possible, they get excited an=
d want to help.
       When realization that the limits being used are by c=
hoice, people
let go and begin to have inspiration unfold before them. Insp=
iration and
limitation are flip sides of every idea we have, looked at as w=
hat we
want or doubt we can. We find out everything by realizing, we do not=

have to look anywhere else to find anything. That we look elsewhere to
fin=
d ourselves, is the reason for not know.

Intention: Add unconditional love=
 and what we want to scientific
experimentation.



       This is going to=
 geometrically explode exponentially.

Presentation: The interface between =
science and The People is
disgusting, academic science people think they kn=
ow to much, and
Citizens don't think they can know any of it. Just like spi=
rituality and
science, who both think they don't or even can't know it all.=
 They must
be combined. So it is presented by asking for The Peoples help.
=
       "Did you know science has now found things that have turned
everythi=
ng upside down? They now have to deal with consciousness and
don't quite kn=
ow how to do that, so that is making this a very, very
exciting time. Would=
 you like to hear how it got turned upside down,
just take a couple minutes=
? Maybe you could give them a hand." If they
say no, make small talk and sa=
y good day. If yes they're in, because all
that is necessary is wanting to =
know. From here I find many get to the
punch line before I do, because we a=
ll feel it coming in our heart.
       "Well they found the Quantum and now=
 they think there is a physics
that works on atomic and sub-atomic particle=
s, and another that work on
you and me. What we intend to prove is, that we=
've just discovered the
real One, and just have not realized that's how it =
really works, yet.
But that is what is so exciting, and why there is so muc=
h going on.
Everyone is examining the puzzle pieces, and the one that made =
the mess
is 'the famous Quantum physics double slot experiment' that proved=
 that
observation changes the results."

                                  =
           The double slot dilemma.

       "A screen to block photons was =
placed between a photon gun and a
second screen that would register photon =
hits. With a slot cut in the
first screen, just as if they were wet painted=
 tennis balls the photons
made a line of hits on the back screen, where the=
y passed through the
slot. With two slots in the first screen what do you s=
uppose registered
on the back screen?
       "A wave pattern appeared inste=
ad of a particle pattern. Instead of
two lines, imagine if water hit the fi=
rst screen. Expanding half circle
waves of water come through the slots. Th=
e leading surface of the wave
registered on the second screen, but where th=
e waves intersect they
cancel each other out. So after some head scratching=
, they shot one
photon at a time so there could be no interference between =
photons but
the wave pattern did not go away. So a type of high speed camer=
a was
synced with the photon gun, and placed to see what the photons were
d=
oing as they hit the slotted screen. What do you think happened? The
wave p=
attern went away and they got the two impact lines of a particle
pattern! W=
hy? That's the Question you could help us with.

"They don't know what it m=
eans, but they do know beyond the shadow of a
doubt, that the observation c=
hanges the results. In fact we now know the
observers effect on the observa=
tion can never be removed. Making it
necessary to rethink every experiment =
ever done. What do you think it
means? We are running a world wide experime=
nt to find out. We think if
consciousness changes results, results may chan=
ge according to belief,
as they did in this case.
       "We've designed th=
e experiment to see if consciousness can change
the results to what we all =
want, by maximizing the observers effect.
This is global because we are all=
 the observer. We have prepared seven
pages intended to eliminate the reaso=
ns we think we're not in control,
so we can all focus and believe we can ha=
ve what we want. This may be
easier then it seems as the Quantum demonstrat=
es that we are all the
same inter-connected One. So not superficially, but =
at our core we all
want the same things.
       "We also believe that when =
we get to a certain number, once
reached every One will get it. Have you ev=
er heard about the hundredth
monkey experiment?"

                         =
                      The Hundredth Monkey

       "In Japan there was a bu=
mper crop of sweet potatoes one year, more
then could be used. So the exces=
s was given to scientists. They decided
to introduce them to an island of m=
onkeys to see how this new food
source impacted them. They did an air drop =
on the beach. Sand was
embedded making them hard to eat. One day an adolesc=
ent female washed
hers off in a stream, making them easier to eat. The hier=
archy would not
allow the adults to notice her innovation, but some of her =
playmates
did. And soon their mothers did. Soon after they made a drop and =
watched
to see what percentage washed them, and suddenly they all did! This=

indicated a mass consciousness, but they did not know the number
compared =
to the total it took, for everyone to get it. So they went to
another islan=
d, counted the monkey and made the first drop. What do you
think happened? =
They all washed their potatoes!"

       Hand them 'You're The One'. "Here =
is the awakening, you are now
one of the first hundred monkeys. We find tha=
t the first day you look at
all the possibilities, the second day you look =
at all the reasons it
can't be, and the third you put together the combinat=
ion that works for
you. Then read it again and more will open up.
       "W=
e ask that instead of asking yourself is this possible, because
by all indi=
cations everything is. We ask you to ask yourself, is this
what I want too.=
 If it is, help us get to the hundredth monkey. Give it
to those you care a=
bout, and discuss it. If you see any place people are
giving up their power=
 that is not covered, or a clearer way to say what
we all want, hit the e-m=
ail and we'll add it.
       "By the time we get to the hundredth this will=
 be the most self
empowering document ever written, because every One is wr=
iting it. You
see we feel that all the problems there are, are just our mak=
ing choices
we don't want. And if we're right, we are going to wake up happ=
y and all
headed in the right direction, One day soon!"

                Th=
e Experiment and all materials herein are for the use
of all until the end =
of two-twelve. No rights are reserved, as this is

ple to The People.


  You're The One

Here are the tools for the completed=
 GRAND PLAN. This says what all the
pieces are hinting.
The meaning of actu=
alizing Quantum physics, the pure potential of you.
OK, lets dethrone every=
thing except you
THE GNOSTIC GOSPEL
            The potential of consciousn=
ess is unlimited, consciousness
only has the limits upon it, that it choose=
s to experience. This is a
new, ancient spiritual paradigm, through Quantum=
 physics. This answers
the four great questions. The Quantum leap.    Prefa=
ce: Limitation sees
the separation between things, the One that strings eve=
rything together,
allows us to see through the real illusion. The observer =
is
consciousness, and the observation becomes what the consciousness truly
=
believes. This gives the obvious additional conclusion to the double
slot e=
xperiment. The observation changed the results to, what we
believed was the=
 only possibility. How do we disregard, that results
change to what's belie=
ved. Our exploration should be, could there be
x's all over the screen, if =
that is the absolute only possibility of
the observer's knowing? Obviously =
this is a possibility. That we can
not remove the observer's impact on the =
observation, indicates this
can be true. Not believing does eliminate possi=
bilities. The observer
could not be separated if we are all the creator. Tr=
uly made in the
image of God.             Most see the mechanical as dispro=
ving the
spiritual and never the twain shall meet. Thereby this is where, m=
ost of
the tension is. We've looked for, creating more of, what we
don't kn=
ow long enough, lets look at what we can. Instead of trying
to minimize the=
 observer's effect we need maximizing. We will move
backward and forward in=
 time just as easily, once we believe, we've
proven it mathematically true.=
 But cream is not going to fly out of
coffee, as often as it goes in, becau=
se that is never going to be our
intention. The Quantum leap is, we have, t=
o have asked every question,
to vibrate the frequencies of the answers, col=
lapsing them thereby into
what we know, and presto you have existence. It t=
akes no time for
anything we want, to happen. The time we decide things wil=
l take, is the
literal creation of time. This picture is clearer when you r=
ealize your
infinite.              We are consciousness-es that are not the=
 field,
we are the projectors of the field, your kitty is the field. Kitty =
only
understands love or variables thereof. We create the entire field from=

unconditional love. That's why when we give what it is, it
synchronizes. O=
ur consciousness-es generate holograms (realities), and
holograms generate =
heat, that is what and why when we approach absolute
zero the Bose/Einstein=
 effect occurs. Where there is no field, is the
One, we all are. And we can=
 never get to absolute zero, because there
must be something left to see th=
e effect. We are each creating
realities, at the speed of the oscillations,=
 through each of our
separate entire reality's quarks. That's why we're
pro=
cessing 400 billion plus bits of information per second, this is
stuff we'r=
e doing not stuff we're going to do. Consciousness
moves through these imag=
es in both direction, creating the sensations of
time.               Enligh=
tenment is the understanding of what it is to
know. When you stay in the jo=
y of knowing, thereby increasing the rate
of images through your quarks to =
144,000 revolutions per second,
you'll leave all that you don't want behind=
. The big bang is the
One screaming more, as there was no thing to scream a=
bout, before the
bang. I don't believe anything `has to' grow from anything=
,
obviously we want them to, but the One we all are has always existed.
Who=
 we are can not be found within the field, this entire reality is
only a sm=
all portion of who you really are. Involved will replace
evolved. At our co=
re we all want and are the same everything, as we are
the same One. This is=
 one of your possibilities, so how does it feel?
Next is my philosophical c=
ompletion of the unified field. Unifying
spirituality, the Quantum physics =
and everything. I call it the Gnostic
gospel, in One page, titled `new Gnos=
tic movement'. Your
understanding is vast, any input would be much apprecia=
ted. And now for
your enjoyment.   NEW GNOSTIC MOVEMENT
               Quan=
tum physics is the Gnostic movement. With Quantum
physics we are approachin=
g the truth about, what it is to know, and
Gnostic means to know. This reli=
gion, the realization of knowing caused
time to start over again. And ended=
 about 325 A.D., when constantine
ended it by the sword and reinstated idol=
atry. From then on, until
Quantum physics, idolatry is the only religion on=
 planet earth. Idolatry
is the placing of someone or something on a pedesta=
l with powers, you
think, you cannot achieve. That is why horus, mithra, ch=
rishna,
solinvictus, jesus christ, and many others have the same powers and=

achievements, and are their subjects masters. To believe that things are
n=
ot your choice, is to represent choices you don't want, which is
the purpos=
e of idolatry. The test showing that your belief is idolatry,
is you do not=
 truly believe you are made in the image of God. If what
God is, you do not=
 see as who you are, you have a deity between you and
who you truly are. Re=
alization that you are is going to bring everything
back, we are in the gre=
at time of change. You do not learn to know, you
realize you always have. T=
here is no One nowhere, greater nor less than
you.               We are all=
 the same One, and within that One there is
an unlimited amount of everythi=
ng for everyone. Einstein proved the
existence of the Quantum, then spent a=
 lot of the rest of his life
'trying' to disprove it, because it meant the =
rest of his work and
science, really don't matter. Point being, there is no=
 hierarchy in
heaven and heaven is fast approaching for those in the Gnosti=
c. Time and
space that has infinite energy, and appears to be infinite in a=
ll
directions outside of us, is actually the smallest speck at the very
cen=
ter of who each of us are. The projection of mass created therefrom
by the =
'Bang' is not finite, as the bang is not a one time event. It is
an on goin=
g creation that will never stop adding creation in all
directions. The univ=
erse only appears flat because we are seeing it like
we used to see the pla=
net. The big five of the unified field are
projections of consciousness, an=
 infinitely faceted gem.                
The One that we are, is the self a=
ware Quantum field of infinite
possibilities, from this we project a hologr=
aphic image of as many of
the possibilities as we choose. To know, absolute=
ly everything is your
choice, is to be Gnostic. If you believe in One Omni =
Present God, there
is only two things that everyone everywhere all agree up=
on, God is the
creator of everything and infinite. Now if you believe the t=
hird thing,
you are made in the image of God, the first two things are the =
only
things that we all agree, are the image your made in. This is not only=

the only religion that is not idolatry, it's the only religion with
no dow=
n side, if you believe you can know, you will.               
Realities, wh=
en and wherever, are your projection of the portion of the
One, that you ch=
oose to experience. You are not a human being you are
the entire reality, y=
ou have just chosen to represent yourself as one,
creating time to interact=
 with other facets (creators). But awake,
asleep, un-conscience, or dead yo=
u are still the consciousness of the
entire reality you choose. If you and =
I agree that any object exists,
that means there are two of them. There is =
an infinite number of us
consciousness-es, and all of our realities togethe=
r reflect back to the
One that we all are, all the ways that can be. We are=
 like ball bearings
on the bridge, within each and every One of us is the r=
eflection of the
entire bridge.               All realities are holographic=
 images of
portions of the One, which means the only limit is when we choos=
e to
represent limitation. But limitation is the cause and effect of doubt,=

and is the only thing that is not the One. It is the attempt to exclude
a =
portion of the One from existence, which is the only power that we do
not t=
ruly have. As such doubt is the only thing that cannot be a part of
who we =
truly are. But it is the only thing between you and anything you
want.     =
          In any reality, look at as many options as is
necessary to see th=
e One that makes you feel good, that's the One
that you are. This joy is th=
e Omni Presents of God permeating all
portions of the One. The feeling of j=
oy in your heart is the Word of
God, showing you which part of the matrix i=
s you, so you can always find
your way home. When you represent only this, =
you have Ascended!
This is the way and the light! And that's all there is t=
o it, it
matters not if you become Gnostic now or later, when you stop bein=
g a
master of limitation this is where you'll be. And so it is
inevitable t=
hat you will return to the powerful creator that you are,
you have forever.=
 But a lot of us are going in the blink of an eye, in
two twelve. We did no=
t evolve from an ameba, we came from the other
direction and are only going=
 back, to who we are. We'll still be
creating the matrix, we are just going=
 to completely stop creating what
we don't want with it. Can you feel the k=
ingdom come? It's not a
place, it's the movement that gets better forever. =
If anyone asks
what's a Gnostic, you could just say their a bunch of know-i=
t-alls.
Here are some definitions I feel are miss used:                Fait=
h; is
not giving power to something somewhere else, it is the feeling you h=
ave
after seeing what you want, that you must believe in to receive it.
Bel=
ief; seeing is not believing, when you believe in something you will
see it=
. So the only question you truly have is, what must I believe to
be seeing =
what I'm seeing? If it's not what you want, find what
is, and do whatever i=
t takes to believe.                So now that
we're back to Faith, have fu=
n  Like it's the most important
thing in your life, because it is. One does=
 not have to find Faith every
One has it, Faith is what you truly believe a=
nd actually creates
everything. A mustard seed size Faith can move mountain=
s, and you cannot
be part of something your not creating the vibration of. =
               
You do not raise a question, a question raises its answer. =
Without a
question you have no answers to experience, and every question ra=
ises
it's answer, every time.                All realities are fractal so
e=
veryone of them always goes back to One bottom leg. Example: all the
forces=
 everywhere every when, that want what we don't want for us,
have only one =
tool, to get us to doubt we can have what we want. We
leave the kingdom whe=
n we don't do what feels good in our heart.
Every reality everywhere is a h=
olographic image, although the vast
majority of them, off earth, represent =
only the Quantum field of
infinite possibilities that is unconditional love=
. Some realities seem
more real then others, when they are what everybody t=
ruly wants, but it
is never the less a hologram. A holographic projection i=
s only an image,
but what it is the projection of, is not. And just as you =
can cut
holographic film into a thousand pieces and fire up the entire imag=
e
from any piece, you can cut a person into a thousand pieces and fire up
t=
he entire image from any piece.                 Because to interact
with an=
other individual is to deal with another entire world, it's
never a reality=
 and always realities. Making it more complicated, this
is why it seems we =
can't just create another reality, like when
we're asleep. To change the `r=
ealities' you must all want
and believe the shared agreements your changing=
, will change. This we
can do globally, but we must make a lot of considera=
tions. Truth is,
with tunnel vision, any One anytime can completely know, b=
elieve, and
rise to ascension. But some of us are wanting a mass Exodus, se=
parating
from those that refuse to leave limitations, we are not going to
c=
o-create anymore. It  is only nothing, that is too simple or too good
to be=
 true.                Experiments that find what we are not, are
illusions.=
 Analyzation stunts results, dwarfs genius, as it is the idea
that the obse=
rver is separate, which we now know is not possible. It is
the attempt to r=
emove the unconditional love, lets see what is if we
don't want anything. W=
e need not another experiment, we need to turn
around and absorb, the Ones =
already done. Everything off the shelf,
realize, realization and applicatio=
n take no time. Thinking it will is
the makings of time, that we don't want=
.                 The grand
illusion is the lie, that the images we are cre=
ating, are not ours. We
are creating the spoon, to bend it is to `try' to c=
onvince our
self that we're the creator, by changing our creation to one wi=
thout
purpose, there is a spoon. Be Gnostic, stop worrying about and doing
=
what you don't want. Pointing out a problem without representing the
answer=
, is to vibrate more of it into your reality. Seeing fault in an
other, is =
your opportunity to give your representation of that other,
the answer.    =
             First One must look at the idea that you are
The One, to reali=
ze the possibility you are the observer and your
observation is created by =
your beliefs, and you are infinite
possibilities. The two primary options a=
re, you can realize this is not
true, or you can realize that it is one of =
the infinite possibilities
that you are. With doubt all the things that sho=
w it is not, appear
before you. With the idea everything is true, choose th=
e Ones you want,
you ask how does this idea feel? That feeling is the `coll=
apse'
into existence, you're creation no matter which option you choose.
If=
 the mechanical disproves the spiritual and never the twain shall
meet, out=
side of you exists and you just stumbled in from an ameba, than
if I place =
a piece of chalk on your arm dust is the only possibility.
But if you are t=
he Quantum field of infinite possibilities and I take
control of your belie=
f through hypnotism and tell you this chalk is a
red hot cigar, which is th=
e possibility that is really going to happen?
And the truth is, you had bet=
ter get some aloe vera.                True
or not, whether you come from t=
he smallest thing in creation or
you're the Quantum field of infinite possi=
bilities, all of which is
unconditional love and projects all creations, wh=
ich has the better
effect in your life. The very idea this is a possibility=
, gives you
glimpses of how all things fit together, which is why we now ha=
ve the
string theory. Obviously if you don't realize your grandeur, your
ea=
sy to take advantage of, by someone who does. I can talk you into a
chalk b=
urn. Within this time of limitation exploration, all don't
have the best in=
terest at heart.                Lets clarify definitions
to demonstrate thi=
s is a new paradigm, shown by the completeness of new
perspectives. The ide=
a of having a question, in the old paradigm, means
I have an answer I can't=
 find. In the new paradigm, a question is
the selection of what we want to =
experience, from the infinite
possibilities that we are, as there is no thi=
ng outside of us. The idea
that it could be possible, to not know an answer=
, is the limitation that
stops any answer from experience. When the experie=
nce of the answer is
why we ask any question. Why would we ever think that =
all of these
possibilities that we are, are perhaps hopelessly outside of u=
s?
The answer coming to me by that question is, wait a minute, the
possibil=
ities here are infinite too. Oh O.K., the One I get a good
feeling about is=
. Now I know I'm infinite, and realize I did not
know that for a while. I m=
ust have grown bored with knowing everything
was my doing, and presto. I ha=
ve the experience of emotions coming at me
from around the corner, like wow=
 that got me when I wasn't lookin,
what excitement. Now, I'm bored with all=
 the ways I can hide from
me, the Quantum field of unconditional love, and =
presto it's back to
the knowing creator we really are.                The i=
dea of infinite
possibilities is known, but we don't know. Because we're co=
ming
from limitation, complete realization that there are always infinite
p=
ossibilities would be to never create another limitation upon
ourselves. Th=
e belief that we have to search for who we are, is the
creation of the vibr=
ation and reality of not knowing. We will experience
bewilderment until we =
change our mind. To stay in this limitation,
realize every One of us are ad=
ding limitation, to every idea we have
every moment of every day. This new =
paradigm has always been in effect,
the old one is just realities of not kn=
owing. We always have infinite
possibilities at our finger tips. It's our c=
hoice to use the Ones we
want, or doubt we can.                 You can not=
 know all there is to
know when you don't need to know it, but if you liste=
n to your heart
you will know what you need to know when you need to know i=
t. Without
difficulty, in fact doing only what's best shows you how full of=

what we didn't want, life was. You know who's found there truth,
in the fi=
rst moments of interaction, those that don't know are
projecting what they =
don't want. The world through `media'
is doubt by uncontrollable fear. For =
which they are not accountable,
because network news is legally classified =
as entertainment.
In the old paradigm, you might say these are great concep=
ts, but even if
correct, that will take along time to be `the norm'. The ne=
w One
shows, this is the actual creation of time, that will go on until we
=
change our mind. And all the time it takes until we decide to know, we
can =
not know that we are choosing to make time we do not want. You know
now, an=
d the moment we see what for us is true, everything necessary for
that new =
belief, appears in our path. Happens every time.
I've seen the paradigm shi=
ft, lived the realization, am wishing you
will all come to. This is a gift =
for us all, understanding without
effort. I know somewhere in the back of y=
our mind, the possibility that
we've come full circle, has gone off. You se=
e we do things without
asking our heart how it feels, as the rule. This is =
all limitation is.
That is why out on the limb of science, it looks like th=
ings take a long
time. But when we started the idea of limitation, we start=
ed down the
rabbit hole. When you realize the hole is all you, your closet =
empties.
You've made the turn around, and all the way out and beyond, is
kn=
owing and feels good.                Imagine if I'm right and you
are the Q=
uantum field of infinite possibilities, that any choice is
your's by belief=
. All that you think is so far out of human
possibility, is one of the poss=
ibilities your's by belief. It is
consciousness-es belief that collapses in=
finity into that particular
vibration.                You see when you beli=
eve by always asking your
heart what to do, things you never thought would,=
 just clear up. But you
do have to witness how brutal we are. Ignorance of =
how `the placebo
effect' works, would have saved me the horror of watching =
doctors,
destroy the perfect working belief systems of the 40 % that believ=
ed and
thereby got well, by telling them their ability was fake. Proper car=
e
would severally damage pharmaceutical profits, what's going to
happen whe=
n we get every One to believe in themselves.                
All I've said =
and all the ideas Quantum physics has found, line up
like the flight of an =
arrow that stuck directly in this paradigm. And
you can make it not true, w=
hat ever you believe is true, that's the
meaning of infinite possibilities.=
 But this is not the use of Free Will,
it is the choice of doubt creating l=
imitation, eliminating
opportunities. Free will is choices from the infinit=
e possibilities that
you are, not the idea you don't have choices. This mak=
es Quantum
physics practical and pliable.                                  =
  
Because this is what it is, opposition is a demonstration of a belief in=

limitation, which now you see and thereby is the opportunity to let go.
Th=
at's why the greatest minds along with your's, are now seeing
what we need =
to look at, through the now completed circle of
understanding. Do what ever=
 it takes, to believe and do what gives your
heart joy with integrity, it w=
ill transform your where to where you want
to be. Because I think servitude=
 has a two twelve end date too, and they
just want us not to believe, in an=
ything. Oh by the way when you say,
off handedly, well you know `they' say =
this or `they'
say that, this is who `they'(the public opinion) are.
What s=
hows the direction we came from, is when you hear ideas for the
first time,=
 maybe like this, you do not stand in awe of a new concept.
You reflect it =
off of who you are inside, and if it matches you accept
it. All the new par=
adigm asks of you is to realize you grandeur and do
only what feels good in=
 your heart. Never has this been difficult when
realized, because it is wha=
t we all want. The hardest part to get is,
all the struggle, fighting, hard=
ship, etc., etc., etc., is to keep
limitations that we do not want!!! This =
is a struggle to stay inferior.
There is an infinite number of ways to not =
see limitations are like big
rocks, they are hard to hang on to and drop aw=
ay when you just let go.
Once all becomes the joy of knowledge within you, =
you see those around
you that are vibrating about things that they do not w=
ant. It is a
delicate idea to let them know, that they can vibrate things t=
hey like
into being. Within our infinite possibilities there are answers th=
at
feel good, for any turmoil. If met head on, you must use the greatest
ca=
re in allowing them to see, the limitations being released, are not
who any=
 of us truly are. Because their first response, is to believe
these limitat=
ions are who they are, and take it as an attack on them. I
know you'll find=
 the best way.                This is not the time
to solo ascend, this is =
a bigger event then those other times. If you do
stay and help with this ma=
ss Exodus, you must take responsibility for
this entire experience and can =
not just step away. As your ancient eyes
are opening, you may find yourself=
 sobbing about all you've allowed
to take place. That's enough of that, let=
s get on with the conscious
choice of continuous preference we're now chang=
ing this mess into.
Key here is you must move from self, to what's best for=
 all, all the
time. When you rise from taking responsibility for just the k=
arma of a
body, to that of (your images of) this entire reality, representi=
ng only
answers, your firing on all cylinders.                       The
si=
mplicity that realities are fractal means, they stand on one bottom
leg, th=
e idea that builds the entire fractal. There are not two sides of
every fra=
ctal, there is only one undebatable bottom idea. If your in
polarized confl=
ict your not at the bottom. When you get to the bottom
leg there is only on=

good, or one we don't want.=
 Without a change in the bottom leg, we
will go where it is headed no matte=

A couple undebatable bottom legs, for exampl=

responsibility for:                  The bottom =
leg of allopathic
medicine is, war to kill the smallest destructive things =
within us. Or,
kill microbes, which one you only morph them and two the `ki=

is not specific. Obviously this is not a creation we want, so we must b=

convinced that it is necessary evil. This is a really hard sell if you
kn=

threat. If =
you know your infinite, I mean do you know any near death
survivors that di=

seriously. But if you =
don't change the bottom leg you will go get

                Here is one we want, that we're being steered away
f=
rom. We are moving to statute ordinances, from the law of Rights. As we
mus=
t surrender our Constitution, for the u.n. charter to exist which is
the ce=
ntralization of all governing power. So the public opinion we are
told is, =
we can not know our Constitutional framers intent. The intent
and outcome o=
f this idea is to change what the framers said. The bottom
leg can not be d=
enied. The framers intent is demonstrated by what our
Constitution gave us,=
 that did not exist before it was enacted, which we
do not have today. Secu=
red Rights. An accurate exhibit of what's
been lost is on youtube under, `T=
he Wolves are in the Chicken
Coop', four parts. Hard truth here is, the Con=
stitution of and for
the united States of America is the only thing in the =
way. Those who
have it and are now let it go, are letting the entire planet=
 down. If we
don't look at the bottom line, we have no idea what we really =
want.
                The latest unraveling in the public eye is, our ruler=
s
got caught taking over the world by carbon tax. So they get scientists
ca=
ught up in a raging debate over is there a real problem. The bottom
leg of =
this fractal from my perspective is:                First we must
take into=
 account the terms and conditions surrounding it, which a good
scientist mu=
st take into consideration. Which are, a very few control
and receive the p=
rofits from the use of fossil fuels. The problem's
solution cuts directly i=
nto those profits. So it is possible we are
being lead away from the soluti=
on, by having a different problem, that
increases profits with the bonus of=
 justifying world domination. Any
part of that not true for you?           =
          If carbon dioxide is
the problem, we should immediately have ever=
ybody in the world grow
plants, everywhere. Imagine over 6 billion plant gr=
owers, with every One
having the power to help. Now that would create chang=
e. Governments
should give planters and dirt to all, but get your own seeds=
 because
theirs are genetically altered, well maybe you better get your own=
 dirt.
The real problem we have is: Ozone Depletion, talking about ozone th=
e
allotropic O3 oxygen molecule, nothing more nothing less. As you know to
=
the environment, it is an available active oxygen for cleansing, like
bleac=
h does for your laundry. It is unstable and breaks off easily
leaving behin=
d, our environments stable form, super-oxide or O2. Without
Ozone we are st=
arting to fry like an egg.                The real
problem's cause: Carbon =
Monoxide, and the simple bottom line is,
unstable forms, carbon monoxide(CO=
) and ozone(O3) in contact stabilize
forming the stable forms, carbon dioxi=
de(CO2) and super-oxide(O2). This
simple scientific truth, is chemistry tha=
t every One can understand.
Unstable CO and O3 recombine forming stable CO2=
 and O2 equaling Ozone
Depletion. Wait the truth is simpler yet, CO destroy=
s O3 and it does not
matter where carbon monoxide steals the necessary oxyg=
en for
stabilization, the chain reaction ends with ozone depletion.
I know =
this is too obvious why we are wasting time avoiding the problem,
that all =
know we have. Our rulers tell us to, and that does not feel
very good. Plan=
ters would be nice.
                We can not fix what we are not changing=
 the bottom leg
of. And as you can see they are not hard to find nor can yo=
u debate
them. Allopathic medicine is to kill microbes, our Constitution se=
cured
Rights, and carbon monoxide destroys ozone. Your just allowing bottom=

legs to be looked at helps tremendously.                 So another hard
t=
ruth is, our leaders are leading us to insurmountable problems,
justifying =
complete control. Again, it's difficult just to look at
these bottom lines,=
 let alone publicly stand for the answers. I'm in
your face because I belie=
ve times up, all our choices are back, but
those that don't get off the fen=
ce now, may live with all that they
don't want. See how important standing =
for what we really want, is.
When you give everything, you'll get everythin=
g, but not until. The
secret of Faith must be used for what's best for all,=
 and every Ones
Faith will be tested.                If you didn't know abo=
ut the
terms and conditions of Quantum physics such as, the famous double s=
lot
experiment, the Bose/Einstein effect, the amazing amount of information=

we are procession, the oscillation of quarks, super position, etc.,
it's b=
etter to find out from the inside out like this. It will
confirm that you n=
ow know.                 You have changed. You do not
have baggage connecti=
ng you to problems, some other where some other
when. There is only now and=
 now you choose what you want. Now you know
more than any allopathic doctor=
 about your health, more than our leaders
want us to know about the Constit=
ution, and more than Quantum physicists
know about the Quantum. In fact you=
 could hold instructional classes
showing Quantum physicists how to believe=
 what their finding. You
understand para-phenomena, spirituality, philosoph=
y, science, and
medicine. You understand the unified field, that there is n=
o thing out
side of you, you see how every thing is the One, what free will=
 is, you
know why the observer can not be separated, etc. etc. etc... You'r=

a doggone genius, and the beauty of the truth  is, unlike limitations
you=
 do not need to keep affirming these tools. You can get a good nights
sleep=
 and they well still be here, in fine working order, in the
morning.       =
         Doubt is a notion, that can only exist after
seeing one of infinit=
e possibilities that is wanted, that creates the
limitation of not having. =
This is the opposite of Faith and the creation
of what you don't want. To d=
oubt you can have what you want, has
never ever once felt good. This is why=
 if you only do what feels good in
your heart with integrity, the limitatio=
ns you don't prefer anymore
are not manifest. And by definition, thereby as=
 doubt is eliminated
existence must fill with what you want, at equal  rate=
s. To stand for
only what we all want, as you can see, I do not believe app=
ears an easy
thing, in a world in doubt. But it is a must, and remember, we=
 only need
to get to the hundredth monkey.                 Now at the begin=
ning of
meaningful things to say, where there are no more meaningful questi=
ons
without answers, I've talked enough. Though as you can see I go on
fore=
ver. Now's your turn. Please let me know if this helps, or any
reason this =
is too simple and good to be you. If you find a meaningful
question without=

Until you forget that you don't                  =
   know.  Exodus
          There you have it, an experiment to see that we =
can all
together put the world right. By definition this is to find if we c=
an
all believe in what we all want, fortunately what we all want is what we=

can all believe in. Why not, every One every step of the way is going to
b=
enefit. This is the cheapest per magnitude and greatest experiment ever
don=
e. Once validated, it will end scientific experiments where we 'try'
to ana=
lize as outsiders.
          As you've now read 'You're The One' the three =
Quantum laws are
within your conscious and the wake up is near. I can speak=
 more directly
now that you have, so I would like to say a little more. I'm=
 running The
Experiment because I truly understand these laws are literally=
 the way
it all works. This truth is a feeling you have. To require outside=
 proof
of this, is only to want something telling you it's OK to have that
=
feeling inside. But it is also saying that you do not.
          I know it'=
s all by choice, therefore we're making a lot of bad
choices as anyone with=
 their eyes open can see a train wreck just up
ahead. Understanding through=
 the new perspective of the Quantum is
making the right choices. Some that =
have left religion, are the most
religious. Some who think their religious,=
 are. Who ever you are you
must deal with the main issue, what is right and=
 wrong? I believe when
we found the Quantum we found God, and is why for me=
 this is the science
of religion. Everything else is idolatry exteriorizing=
 your power, which
you thereby believe is outside of you. When everything a=
ctually happens
within consciousness, which is who you are. The key is you =
can only have
what you can believe. How many degrees into idolatry you are =
thereby the
amount of choices you allow yourself, is determined by your ans=
wer to
this question. Why when you look at the possibility that you are mad=
e in
the image of God, do you only see the differences? Because you are
ido=
lizing God or something, God is not outside examining creation, God
is the =
consciousness everything is a reflection from. The definition of
omni prese=
nce is within everything, meaning you can not go elsewhere to
find you, and=
 you are made in the image.
          The Quantum demonstrates that there a=
re only a couple rules,
too few to understand by someone who exteriorizes t=
heir beliefs.
Consciousness is the Quantum, and the two rules are infinite =
and
unlimited. Everything is within the One consciousness, no matter how
ma=
ny point the One chooses to be the entire image is within each. So
literall=
y there is no thing outside of you, no matter how much less you
choose to r=
epresent. So though it appears things are outside of you, you
are the consc=
iousness that all things are within. That all realities are
projections of =
only portions of the One and the whole is within each
portion is the origin=
 of the paradox. But the illusion is that any of it
is outside you. When yo=
u negatively effect what you think is outside of
you, inside you know you o=
we for damage to who you truly are and thereby
have created karma.
        =
  Time is a component of consciousness's projection of realities,
so there =
is no time to measure the length of consciousness, before. But
as that is w=
ho I am, I can tell you we are infinite and unlimited. Even
before this ide=
a of less then the whole portions, called realities.
There is no time betwe=
en you and enlightenment, using the Quantum view
put it directly in your wa=
y. When you see life as you, a tremendous
compassion surrounds everything. =
We are creating this time to interact
with other sentient creators. That re=
alization grows reverence for
others, no matter what limitations they are c=
hoosing. You know
everything they are going through, because they are you. =
These are easy
rules to follow because they are what we all want, what seem=
s tough is
getting use to choosing what we want again. It has been a while.=
 What
also can appear scary is you must take responsibility if it's all you=
.
Anything appearing negative in your life, you only need to choose the
ans=
wer that feels good for that idea and represent it anytime you see
the old =
one. It can not continue because its been answered, lesson
learned.
       =
   I know this is me, I see now and it set me free. Make the
choice to see =
through the big three and come with me. I know all that I
see is me, I take=
 responsibility and represent only the answers. Even if
nobody else wants t=
hem. I will be the problem nevermore. So knowing I'm
out of here shortly, I=
 am going to do everything to show as many as I
can the Quantum view. When =
the transformation is complete if every One
of us doesn't make it, will be =
my only regret.
          The only opposition is to create disbelief it can=
 all be that
good. Why not stand together and see that we can! Prove this n=
ot true,
find opposition other than that, can you? If anyone out there can =
find
that, we'll all go back to our box. But since that can't be done, lets=

all go home! Together.
           As you are infinite possibilities, we mu=
st stop debating
points, both sides are always within infinite possibilitie=
s. Which do
you prefer! Here is simplicity that can clear the view, there i=
s only
nothing in creation that we don't want. Everything is what we want, =
or
doubt we can. Everthing you don't want in creation is only doubt you
can=
. I am channeling what we all want because that is my choice, and
have no d=
oubt, I can! Everywhere everywhen there is One we want. Stand
with me, for =
every thing we all want. We will exceed our absolute
greatest expectations =
many times to come.
           Give up everything you have, that is in the =
way of every thing
that you want! When we stop all the time we are creating=
, for believing
in what we don't want, is the realization we've made it!!! =
Get very
excited, it's OK by me, I am. We are the Ones that get to tell the=

World. We are Saved and we've done it all ourselves! The only way there
is=
, is by choice. And if you don't choose it you can't have it. You
think of =
anything more, we can have it. But vibrating about anything
less was yester=
day and yesterday's gone. There is no more meaningful
questions my heart ca=
n't answer. Don't think I'm not well, I have just
gotten well after lifetim=
es. Stand next to me, it looks real good. Here,
have my perspective, it's o=
nly what is best for all and nothing else.
          We have all thought we=
 are separate pearls, I have before you
strung the neckless. Stop measuring=
 your pearls against others, as
receiving the whole string does not diminis=
h your pearls. Life is us
dividing into every individual thing, but we are =
not any individual
thing, we are first the string and then every single pea=
rl. You do not
'need' to look for anything, as you are everything. The trut=
h will not
go away now that you know. Some may go away for awhile, but when=
 the
limitation more important then the truth becomes too heavy,they'll be
=
back this is the only store in creation. I have put all of my lifetimes
int=
o this. Your actualizing that is to realize I am not someone out
here, this=
 is you writing this to you. Saying, lets all stand together
for what we al=
l want.
          You have been infinite forever, you have just pretended n=
ot to
be for a bunch of life times. As we are now coming out of limitation
=
exploration for the exalting of emotions, we are riddled with doubt.
Doubt =
can only exist after asking for what you want, so as your ancient
eyes open=
, you need not even look for what you want, you've already
asked to have do=
ubt. Remove doubt and what you want must remain.
Actualize what's best for =
all as what's best for self, because it is.
Have the wisdom to uncover the =
right, the will to choose it and the
strength to endure.
          'You're =
The One' is the looking glass into infinite
possibilities, which is the kno=
wing that no thing is outside of you,
because the truth is you are the One.=
 A few transformations down the
road and you'll realize your coming ascenti=
on, as I have. You'll embrace
'You're The One' like she's your long lost mo=
ther, until your closet's
empty. The Wonder of you will thereby and then be=
 actualized.
          Though I do not know if I'll hear from you, there is=
 one thing
I know, everything I'm doing is what you want in your heart. I h=
ave
scared the life into everyone so far, but I have my hopes for every One=
.
Those that want to dominate others and those that don't know how to live
=
without being dominated may think otherwise, but they want this too. If
you=
r heart is open you want the results of this experiment, doubt or
not. Anot=
her fact is I could not pull any punches, so I've offended
every limitation=
 and all who think that is who they are. The game is on,
the pieces are all=
 in place, and I'm right. I will wake up many, if some
help me I'll wake up=
 the world, sadly my support track record doesn't
exist. As I am blowing a =
canon off down main street, any comunication or
help will be confidencial u=
nless otherwise specified. I pray what I've
said serves you.

We are the On=

Dear Every One,<BR> <BR>re: You're The One<BR><BR>   &n=
bsp;    I had a vision that I'm now presenting to The People=
, you may find it fits. It's about the elephant that's always been in the l=
iving room, he wants to come and play again. Looking for presention op=
portunities I found you, I intend that we become good friends. Just a =
brief background, I studied health and law until I figured them out, t=
he truth is always the shortest distance between here and there. But the&nb=
sp;smoke and mirrors surrounding the truth is very complicated to tang=
le reason. I put together a four part presentation of how our country is be=
ing destroyed and what needs to be done, it's on youtube under 'The Wolves =
are in the Chicken Coop'. I presented it to Alex Jones to see if he would k=
ey his viewers to it, as he had publicly said he would do if he saw&nb=
sp;a good idea and it would mean hundreds of thousands of hits. I=
f he had I could have made it work, but he would not even discuss it.<=
BR>        Without help I found that eve=
n though I was getting the highest star rating, less then twenty present we=
re even looking at part two. So I realized it's hard to get people out=
 of their cubicle bubble, until their bubble bursts which is too late. I wa=
s wrestling with how to give the wake up call that people could consider in=
 the comfort of their cubicle. Going through the three DVD set of 'Wha=
t The Bleep' and arguing with David Icke in my mind, while reading his 'Inf=
inite Love is the Only Truth' book. He nailed so many things, but his idea =
that the matrix was projected by somebody somewhere else to keep us in an i=
llusion was the exteriorization that cleared my path.   <BR>=
        I saw the paradigm shift, a=
ll the answers were before me. I formed The Experiment in its entirety=
. I spent April 12-17, designing the overview and presentation of 'The=
 Experiment to Maximize the Observer's Effect' by presenting it, which=
 is seven pages titled 'You're The One', to about five hundred gr=
eat scientific minds at Stuart Hameroff's 'Toward a Science of Consciousnes=
s'. Sponsored by the University of Arizona in Tuscon. I'm proud and dismaye=
d at the dead silence that left most with mouths gaping. About a =
half dozen of them voiced appreciation and encouragement, not one negative =
comment but most avoided any. Nobody's dening the elephant is in the living=
 room, but nobody will talk about him. If you could comment I'd r=
eally appreciate it.  <BR>      &nb=
sp; I am proud to be the One with the opportunity to present the next =
step in science, which is The Experiment. This is an experim=
ent to find why observation changes results by maximizing the effect. It is=
 the demanded and natural next step of Quantum physics, based on speci=
fic principles and scientific experimentation.<BR>    &=
nbsp;    The first innovation is to add the observer to=
 The Experiment. Because we have never dealt with this before we =
refuse to come to terms with this mandatory addition. We first 'tried'=
 to eliminate and when we found that impossible, to stay separate we 'try' =
to minimize instead of maximizing our effect. Now that we know we=
 can not be separate, this is the step we must take but have not until now.=
 <BR>         The second =
is if consciousness changes results, do results change according to be=
lief as they certainly did in the double slot dilemma that finali=
zed the mess we are in, which herein we are finally&nbs=
p;dealing with. Everywhere there are indicators of this, in fact there =
;are no answers outside of this perspective, so why not?   &=
nbsp;<BR>         The third is=
 the possibility that Quantum physics is how all physics actually works and=
 only needs actualizing to be effective, if belief is the focus o=
f consciousness and the creator of all things. As all preliminary inve=
stigations demonstrate this is true, The Experiment will be proved correct =
and will cause a paradigm shift in the perspective of the observer(mass-con=
sciousness).<BR>         This =
change of perspective comes from the observer considering life through=
 the inter-connected big three Quantum laws. We are all the same One, =
there is no thing outside of us, and we are all and infinite possibilities.=
 Which is the interiorization of the exterior view. This effort is the natu=
ral genesis of science, the intentions are clear, what this is going t=
o find is we are all responsible for the beliefs that create reality.<BR>&n=
bsp;       The following is the aca=
demic overview, the quotation portion within is offered to The People with =
slight modifications. If One of The People wants to know after reading the =
quotation portion, they are offered 'You're The One' to have and read at th=
eir leisure. They are now One of the first hundred monkeys, as all that is =
needed is wanting to know.        &=

<P align=3D"center"><STRONG>Overview an=
d Presentation of </STRONG><STRONG>The Experiment</STRONG></P>
<P align=3D"=
center"> <BR>Question: As consciousness changes results, can results c=
hange to anything wanted if we have a consensus by the observer? If every O=
ne is choosing what we all want, will it manifest? This question is&nb=
sp;based on the Quantum fact, we now know we are all the same One outs=
ide the field. Therefore we must all want exactly the same things=
 at our core. <BR>      <BR>Assumption: =
To work the observer must realize infinite possibilities, meaning anything =
is possible with belief. Anything less is belief in finite possibiliti=
es and its creation. You must realize there is no thing outside of you=
 to believe in infinite possibilities, and to accomplish that you must real=
ize you are the One.
