 Madhavaswami rendered dedicated service to Sri Bhagavan for approximately
=
twelve years. Below are two instances where Sri Bhagavan talks about
Madhav=
aswami with great compassion.

Letters from Sri Ramanasramam,by Suri Nagamm=
a

12th July 1946, (51) DEATH OF MADHAVASWAMY

Madhavaswami was a Malayalee=
. His birthplace is a village near Palghat. He
was a brahmachari. He came h=
ere about 15 years back, when he was only 20
years of age and did personal =
service to Bhagavan. For some time past, he
had had a desire to visit holy =
places, and so used to go away frequently and
come back. When Acharyaswami,=
who was another devotee of Bhagavan, in charge
of the Math which was built =
for him in Kumbakonam,came here some time back
and passed away,Madhava went=
 there as head of the Math and passed away
within a short time there after.=


About four days ago, i.e. in the morning of the 8th or 9th, I went to
Bha=
gavan=E2=80=99s presence at 7-30. As I got up after prostrating before him,=

Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CMadhava is gone.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhere to?=E2=80=
=9D I asked, as he was in the
habit of going away from the Asramam on pilgr=
image now and then. Smilingly
Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CWhere to? To that pla=
ce, leaving the body here.=E2=80=9D I was
shocked and asked, =E2=80=9CWhen?=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThe day before
yesterday at 6 p.m.,=E2=80=9D replied Bha=
gavan, and looking at Krishnaswami, said,
=E2=80=9CAcharyaswami who was the=
re came here and died, and the one who was here
went there and died. Everyt=
hing moves according to fate. For a long time
Madhava had a desire that he =
should be independent and without anyone in
authority over him. His desire =
has at last been fulfilled. Anyway he was a
good man. Merely for fun when A=
charyaswami who was in Kumbakonam passed
away, I asked Madhava whether he w=
ould go, as there was no one there in the
Math. He took up the idea, went t=
here and thus
fulfilled his desire. See how things happen! When I wrote Tel=
ugu Dvipada and
other verses in Malayalam script in a notebook, he used to =
read them well
just like Telugu people. He had some Telugu =E2=80=98Samskar=
a=E2=80=99 (knowledge). He took
away that notebook saying that he would be =
looking into it now and then. If
it is there, tell them to bring it here. I=
t was the same with Ayyaswami. He
took away a notebook, saying that he woul=
d bring it back after reading it.
He himself never came back. The same thin=
g has happened with this man also.=E2=80=9D
So saying he changed the topic.=
 When they heard that a person who had
followed Bhagavan almost like his sh=
adow for 12 years, and was extremely
meek and gentle by nature, had passed =
away suddenly somewhere, there was no
one in the Asramam who did not shed a=
 tear.

Kunjuswami who had gone from here to supervise Madhava=E2=80=99s bu=
rial ceremonies,
came back this morning at 8 a.m. and after prostrating bef=
ore Bhagavan said,
=E2=80=9CMadhavaswamy was wandering about in search of p=
eace of mind but could not
gain peace, and so he told people that he would =
not live any longer, and
came to the Math at Kumbakonam. He had a sudden at=
tack of diarrhea for a
day, and as he complained of difficulty breathing wh=
ile taking soda water,
he was made to lie down. He never regained conscious=
ness,according to what
the people in the Math told me.They kept the corpse =
till I got there. It did
not deteriorate in any way even though three days =
had elapsed. I got it
buried and have come back. I could not find the note-=
book anywhere.=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana Reminiscences, by G.V. Subbaramayya

On=
e noon Sri Subbalakshamamma observed that the white peacock who was being
s=
o much fondled by Sri Bhagavan might be Madhavaswami, the late attendant of=

Sri Bhagavan. A little later as I entered the Hall, Sri Bhagavan said that=

some people believe that the white peacock was the reincarnation of
Madhav=
aswami; and ever afterwards Sri Bhagavan used to address him as
=E2=80=98Ma=
dhava=E2=80=99.

On June 20, 1947, I composed eight Telugu verses on the wh=
ite peacock in
Mayura Vrittam (peacock-metre) and presented them to Sri Bha=
gavan in the
Jubilee pandal. He appeared greatly pleased with them and hand=
ing them to
Srimati Lalita Venkataraman, he suggested that she might sing t=
hem with her
veena . Within half and hour she brought her veena and got rea=
dy to sing.
Just then the white peacock was absent. Sri Bhagavan said, =E2=
=80=9CBut the hero
must be present to hear his praises sung! Where are you,=
 Madhava? Come.=E2=80=9D Lo!
At once the white peacock jumped down from the=
 roof of the pandal; and while
Lalita Venkatraman sang, he spread out his t=
ail feather and danced as Sri
Bhagavan sat and watched him with beaming eye=
s. When the singing concluded,
the peacock walked to the veena and pecked a=
t its strings with his
beak.Thereupon Sri Bhagavan told the singer, =E2=80=
=9CMadhava wants you to repeat
the song.=E2=80=9D So she sang once more and=
 the peacock danced again. It was a
sight for the gods to see.
