Hello Biswas,

Respected Manish has answered your questions very clearly. I=
 am just illiterate in this subject, although I will like to put my view in=
 the regard of celibacy and food consumed during saadhna.

Every type of ta=
pas produce energy in our mind and body. To be able to absorb and sustain t=
his energy we need a stable mind. Any thing like sex, non-veg food, intoxic=
ants or any other similar thing cause instability in mind, obviously except=
 for those who know how to handle them. So it is best to avoid such things =
atleast for the newbies like us so that we can sustain, absorb and use the =
spiritual energy in more efficient way.

IT is like we are filling water in=
 a container. If the container is leaking, we will loose all the water and =
in some cases this water can also mess our clothes. So it is better to make=
 the container leak proof so that we can really handle our energy well. It =
is necessary for the newbies who have very less water in start and every dr=
op is precious.

In addition, growing a beard can also be a good idea.

Ple=
ase forgive me if I sound rude.

Kind Regards
Atul
