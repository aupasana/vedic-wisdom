Namaste Utpal-ji,
  <<My second thought is that tgough Fire Seem to be put =
off during Homam, but actually it is not and always present there in the fo=
rm of spark so i would like to think that it may not be even necessary to r=
ecite any verse.>>
   that's a nice logical thing, i was always worried and=
 felt bad about fire going off in middle (actually it is a lesson i suppose=
, initially the fire never went away and that bloated me in due course), bu=
t having the thought that fire is always there releives me of the undesirab=
le concern of fire going off in between, because of the reasons which are b=
eyond our control when there is enough samidah to burn.
 

Thanks and Regar=
ds,
sarma.
