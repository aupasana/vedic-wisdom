Ego! How this small yet powerful part of man c=
an be completely blind! It is like a destructive drug, for whoever falls vi=
ctim to ego loses everything. It is like a wild animal that destroys everyt=
hing in its path without consideration. Destruction of others and of one's =
self, is the result of an uncontrolled ego. 

Nourishment for the powerful =
ego is found in the intellect. Intellect is both wonderful and dangerous. T=
rained, developed and properly used, the intellect is one of the highest fa=
culties. However if used improperly, the intellect only gathers impressions=
 and passes judgement. Nothing is integrated, nothing is experienced and Re=
ality is disregarded. The intellect then believes itself to be Omniscient a=
nd Master of the world.

There is a wise Indian saying. There are eight man=
ifestations of mental alcohol which blind the intellect: pride of race, of =
youth, of beauty, of physical strength, of family, of position, of money an=
d of knowledge. Vanity blinds like the strutting arrogance of a drunkard wh=
o considers himself superhuman. In reality he has lost control. Many people=
 suffer from the illness of pride, which brings symptoms of jealousy, being=
 argumentative, hate and distrust.

It's not difficult to carry a full wate=
r pot on the top of your head, as they do in India, but you will not get fa=
r before a half-filled one sloshes and spills. In the same way, the mind is=
 always subject to disturbance as long as knowledge is imperfect and incomp=
lete.

This is how it was with one group of men who had retired from their =
profession. Formerly railway officials, professors, military men and Sanskr=
it scholars, each of them possessed a certain amount of knowledge and skill=
, but were terribly conceited about them. Having nothing to do, they passed=
 their time travelling around, humiliating people by challenging debates. T=
hey especially liked to embarrass other learned men or swamis with their pr=
acticed questioning.

One day, this group came to Mahaprabhuji' s ashram as=
 he was holding satsang.

"We have heard you are a great scholar and we hav=
e come to be convinced it is so," one of them provocatively asked. "Tell us=
 what you know!"

Mahaprabhuji had no chance to reply before another interr=
upted, who had some poetic ability.

"Recite one of your poems, we want to =
assess your skill!"

Remaining peaceful, Mahaprabhuji welcomed the men with=
 a loving heart, just as he welcomed all visitors and graciously invited th=
em to sit down. He looked at them and as nothing was hidden from him, he kn=
ew their thoughts and characteristics. In a bhajan he began to reveal their=
 negative attributes, so as to instruct them in better behaviour.

Dear rea=
ders, it is difficult to translate Mahaprabhuji' s beautiful poetry into En=
glish, as it has quite a different feeling in Hindi. Therefore I can only a=
ttempt to convey the general essence of that bhajan here.

KAHA VED PATHI T=
RIPATHI KAHAVE

Those who study and call themselves scholars,

Those who co=
nsider themselves poets,

Those who dress themselves like holy men,

Those =
who prize external cleanliness,

What do they gain if they have not studied=
 the Supreme

Or purified their mind?

If they have not realized God,

What=
's the use of poetry or a splendid gown?

Those who study law yet still don=
't know the law of God,

Those who think only of their body

Which will one=
 day be ash spread by the wind,

What can they gain from this?

Only God ca=
n stop the fallacy of such thoughts,

Without Him, all is just pretence.

I=
n further verses the bhajan refers to the true aim of life: to behave well =
and not only to `appear' well.

Suddenly it seemed to these retired men, th=
at they had accomplished absolutely nothing in their entire lives. They wer=
e seized with sorrow as they realized that they were growing old and might =
not have much time to make amends.

"O Master," they cried, "is it really t=
oo late for us? We surrender ourselves to you and humbly beg your guidance =
and protection. Gracious Lord, can you forgive us?"

Mahaprabhuji' s heart =
is full of love for all creatures and there was no question of anger or ann=
oyance within him. He denied no one, forgave all and corrected and removed =
the negative qualities of those who put their trust in him. Lovingly he loo=
ked at them and sang again:

SANTO SE KOI SIROMANI MANUSYA

The Saint is th=
e crown of humanity!

The Gita, Ramayana, Bible and Koran all praise the gl=
ory of Saints,

Their words shower all mankind in Blessing.

The Saint self=
lessly gives, he gives everything to everyone,

He lives not for himself, h=
e lives only for others,

As a messenger of God, he comes in love and compa=
ssion

To purify the world of sins!

God's mercy we experience through the =
blessing of the Saint,

The Saint is unsurpassed

In love, devotion, humili=
ty, kindness and mercy.

When Mahaprabhuji had finished the bhajan, he said=
, "With the blessing of a Saint it is possible to realize everything, but d=
on't be deceived, dear brothers! As you well know, the ego surrounds itself=
 with the appearance of wisdom and many call themselves holy or pretend to =
be wise. Go where your thirst will be quenched. If your heart is really see=
king then you will find your Master. My dears, your prayers for forgiveness=
 are heard, it is never too late to do good, every second is valuable."

Th=
e men begged Gurudeva, "Lord, please initiate us and take us as your discip=
les."

"I will give you a mantra which you shall practise every day," Mahap=
rabhuji answered. "From now on learn to be as kind and humble to all as muc=
h you were unkind before. Never forget there is something you can learn fro=
m everyone and only God the Almighty is perfect."

Grateful for his words, =
they left Mahaprabhuji and praised him with all their hearts. For these men=
 the following words from The Ramayana proved true: "Only by God's mercy is=
 it possible to meet a realized Master."
