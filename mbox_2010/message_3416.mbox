 6th March, 1949

When Bhagavan was living in Skandasramam, on a Dipavali d=
ay, devotees from
the town came early morning and offered him sweetmeats su=
ch as laddoos,
jilebis etc. It was about 8 a.m. The Asramites who had by th=
en finished
their oil bath, took the sweets from the devotees, sent them aw=
ay after
giving them prasadam, and were about to eat them, when another dev=
otee, an
old woman, came with a meal of millet boiled in water, and placed =
it before
Bhagavan. She had lost her husband when quite young and was livin=
g in a mutt
with the help of her brother.

She was giving gruel (kanji) to =
the poor and to Sadhus. Even when Bhagavan
was living in Virupaksha Cave, s=
he was now and then bringing cooked ragi for
him. One day he told her that =
ragi makes for chilliness in the body, and it
should therefore be mixed wit=
h some ground wheat like suji. From that day
onwards she prepared ragi meal=
 accordingly and gave it to Bhagavan. On this
festival day, therefore, she =
prepared the food and brought it to the Ashram
like all the others.

Thereu=
pon, Bhagavan took the food, put it in a widemouthed vessel, added
water, d=
ry ginger, salt and lime juice and mixed it all together.

Telling the peop=
le who were serving food that they might eat the laddoos,
jilebis, etc., he=
 ate that mixture himself with great relish.


The devotees said, =E2=80=9C=
When there are nice preparations available why are you
filling your stomach=
 with ordinary food? How unfair!=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan said,=E2=80=9CWhat is u=
nfair? Like all the other items, this food also has
been received. What am =
I to do? Do you want me to throw it away?=E2=80=9D

The devotees replied, =
=E2=80=9CWhy throw it away? If all of us eat a little, it will
be finished.=
 Should Bhagavan alone eat it?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CWell said! But =
when there are such nice things available, who
would care to eat this? Peop=
le would feel disgusted that on a festival day
they had to eat such food. W=
hy trouble others?=E2=80=9D

Devotee: =E2=80=9CIf not now, we can eat it in=
 the afternoon.Why not keep it over?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CWill it n=
ot be spoiled if kept over for sometime? But the sweets
will not be spoiled=
, if kept over,and people will eat them without needing
any persuasion.They=
 will merely open the almirah and take them, while this,
if kept over, will=
 stay where it is. That is why I have decided to take it
myself. When she h=
as brought it with such great devotion, could we throw it
away?=E2=80=9D


=
It seems Bhagavan ate the whole thing himself. Who knows how often such
thi=
ngs happened in the Ashram?
