One day a female leopard came to the watering place near the Virupaksha
Cav=
e. The frightened devotees beat upon their plates and drums to drive her
aw=
ay. But she quenched her thirst unconcerned and then went on her way with
a=
 roar. Ramana said astonished,=E2=80=9CWhy do you worry so much? The leopar=
d
intimated to me by the first roar that she was coming here. After drinkin=
g
water she told me by another roar that she was going. She went her own wa=
y.She
never meddled with your affairs. Why are you so scared? This mountain=
 is the
home of these wild animals, and we are their guests. That being so,=
 is it
right on your part to drive them away?=E2=80=9D

Ramana was equally =
fearless with regard to scorpions. Vasudeva Sastri
recounts, =E2=80=9COne d=
ay, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a
scorpion climbing u=
p over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body in the front and another at the
same time cl=
imbing down his back. I was terrified and wanted to do
something. But Bhaga=
van remained calm, as if nothing happened, and the two
scorpions, after cra=
wling over his body as if over a wall, eventually left
him. After they left=
,Bhagavan explained to us, =E2=80=98They crawl over you just as
they would =
crawl on the floor or a wall or tree. Do they crawl over
these,stinging as =
they go? It is only because you fear them and do
something,that they fear y=
ou and do something in return=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D

However, in so far as con=
cerns insects which were a nuisance to people, Sri
Ramana did not object to=
 killing them. When once a whole army of black ants
invaded the Hall throug=
h the water drain,he told Annamalai Swami to detect
where they were coming =
from and to put an end to it. The hole was cemented
over without further ad=
o. He also used to pluck blood-sucking insects out of
the coats of the dogs=
 and throw them into the gleaming coals. Similarly he
did not object if dev=
otees killed mosquitoes or used insecticide in the
cowshed.

Maharshi had t=
he same compassionate attitude towards plants as towards
animals. One day w=
orkers had been deputed to gather mangoes from one of the
trees. But instea=
d of climbing up the tree and picking them one by one, they
knocked them do=
wn with
sticks. In this way a large number of leaves were knocked down alon=
g with
the fruit. Ramana, who was as usual sitting in the Hall,heard the be=
ating
and sent a message via his attendants that it should stop at once. Wh=
en he
later passed by the tree and saw the mango leaves in heaps on the flo=
or, he
cried out harshly, =E2=80=9CIn return for giving us fruit, is the tr=
ee to be beaten
with sticks? Who gave you this work? Instead of beating the=
 tree, you might
as well cut it to the roots. You need not gather the fruit=
. Go away!=E2=80=9D

When one of the attendants beat the monkeys, because t=
hey had stolen nuts,
Bhagavan rebuked him, =E2=80=9CYou are not beating the=
 monkeys, you are beating me.
The pain is mine.=E2=80=9D

The monkeys often=
 stole the fruit which devotees had brought as a food
offering, if the latt=
er were not careful or were meditating.One of the
attendants was entrusted =
with the task of receiving the fruit from the
visitors. One day he was sitt=
ing with eyes closed, a basket full of fruit at
his side, listening to the =
radio. In the mean
time the monkeys were freely helping themselves to the c=
ontents of the
basket. When people in the Hall tried to chase the monkeys a=
way, Ramana
joked, =E2=80=9CWhen these attendants are immersed in deep medi=
tation, the monkeys
come and see to the work of the attendants. Someone has=
 to look after the
work! The attendants put the fruit into the basket, the =
monkeys put the
fruit into their stomachs; that is all the difference. Whil=
e people forget
themselves while listening to the music over the radio the =
monkeys busy
themselves in enjoying the sweet juice of the fruit. That is g=
ood, isn=E2=80=99t
it!=E2=80=9D

The monkey mothers liked to come with thei=
r babies, to show them to Ramana
full of pride. Suri Nagamma reports, =E2=
=80=9CYesterday a monkey with her baby stood
in the window by the side of B=
hagavan=E2=80=99s sofa. Bhagavan was reading something
and so did not notic=
e
it. After a while, the monkey screeched and one of the attendants tried t=
o
drive her away by shouting, but she would not go.Bhagavan then looked up =
and
said, =E2=80=98Wait! She has come here to show her baby to Bhagavan; do=
 not all the
people bring their children to show them? For her, her child i=
s equally
dear. Look how young that child is.=E2=80=99 So saying, Bhagavan =
turned towards her,
and said in an endearing tone, =E2=80=98Hullo! So you h=
ave brought your child? That
is good!=E2=80=99 And, giving her a plantain, =
he sent her away.=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana felt a deep admiration for the monke=
y tribes and was convinced
that tapas was not unknown to them. Once he said=
, =E2=80=9CI have known something
about their organisation, their kings, la=
ws,regulations. Everything is so
perfect and well-organised. So much intell=
igence behind it all. I even know
that tapas is not unknown to monkeys. A m=
onkey whom we used to call
=E2=80=98Mottaipaiyan=E2=80=99 was once oppresse=
d and ill-treated by a gang. He went away
into the forest for a few days, d=
id tapas, acquired strength and returned.

When he came and sat on a bough =
and shook it, all the rest of the monkeys,
who had previously ill-treated h=
im and of whom he was previously mortally
afraid, were now quaking before h=
im. Yes, I am clear that tapas is well
known to monkeys.=E2=80=9D

One day =
when Ramana inadvertently bumped against a sparrow=E2=80=99s nest, an egg
f=
ell out and cracked. He was dismayed and cried out to his attendant
Madhava=
, =E2=80=9CLook, look what I have done today! Oh,the poor mother will be so=

sorrow-stricken, perhaps angry with me also, at my causing the destruction=

of her expected little one! Can the cracked eggshell be pieced together
ag=
ain? Let us try!=E2=80=9D

So saying he took a piece of wet cloth, wrapped =
it around the broken egg and
laid it back into its nest. Each third hour he=
 took it out again, removed
the cloth, took it in his hand and glanced at i=
t for a few minutes. Seven
days later, after taking the egg from its nest, =
he announced with the
astonishment of a schoolboy, =E2=80=9CLook what a
won=
der! The crack has closed.=E2=80=9D Some days later he found the egg hatche=
d out,
the little bird had come out. With a face beaming with joy he took t=
he
nestling into his hand, stroked and caressed it and handed it to the oth=
ers,
that they could also admire it.

One day some new born squirrels had f=
allen out of their nest and landed on
Ramana=E2=80=99s couch. Their eyes we=
re still closed and they were very tiny. The
mother, however, did not take =
them back. But how should one feed such tiny
things? The squirrels laid in =
Ramana=E2=80=99s palm. His face was glowing with love
and affection towards=
 them. The devotees looked on helplessly, but he was
happy and cheerful. He=
 asked for some cotton and made a soft bed for
them.Then he took a piece of=
 the cotton, rolled it up so that the end looked
like a sharp needle, dippe=
d it into some milk and trickled it in their tiny
mouths. This he did repea=
tedly. He looked after them with great care and
love until they grew up and=
 started running around. They did not run away,
however, but always ran aro=
und their =E2=80=98mother=E2=80=99.

Something similar happened, when a cat=
 ate the mother of some young
squirrels. Again Ramana took on the task of c=
aring for the young. As he
liked to use daily events to teach his devotees =
he said to them, =E2=80=9CThese
little ones do not know that wisdom lies in=
 remaining in their nest. They
keep attempting to come out. All trouble lie=
s outside but they cannot remain
within. Similarly if the mind is not exter=
nalised, but remains sunk in the
Heart then there would only be happiness. =
But the mind keeps moving out.=E2=80=9D
When Rangaswami asked, =E2=80=9CWha=
t is the path for keeping it inward?=E2=80=9D, Bhagavan
said, =E2=80=9CIt i=
s exactly the same as what I am doing now. Each time a young
squirrel comes=
 out, I keep putting it back into its nest. When I go on doing
it, it learn=
s the happiness of staying in the nest.=E2=80=9D

Shantamma reports, =E2=80=
=9COnce Lakshmi came into the Hall. She was pregnant at
that time. It was a=
fter lunch time, when Bhagavan was reading the
newspapers. Lakshmi came nea=
r and started licking the papers. Bhagavan
looked up and said: =E2=80=98Wai=
t a little, Lakshmi.=E2=80=99 But Lakshmi went on licking.
Bhagavan laid hi=
s paper aside, put his hands behind Lakshmi=E2=80=99s horns and his
head ag=
ainst hers. Like this they stayed for quite a long time. I stood
nearby loo=
king at the wonderful scene. After some ten minutes or so,
Bhagavan turned =
to me and said: =E2=80=98Do you know what Lakshmi is doing? She is
in
samad=
hi.=E2=80=99 I looked at her and tears were flowing in streams down her bro=
ad
cheeks. Her breathing had stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagavan. A=
fter
some time Bhagavan changed his position and asked: =E2=80=98Lakshmi, h=
ow do you feel
now?=E2=80=99 Lakshmi moved backwards, as if reluctant to tu=
rn her tail towards
Bhagavan,walked round the Hall and went out.=E2=80=9D

=
Several dogs lived in the Ashram. The most famous was Jackie,who was later
=
buried in the Ashram compound alongside the deer Valli and a crow. He did
n=
ot much like playing and did not join the other dogs, but would sit in
fron=
t of Sri Ramana, fixing his gaze on his eyes incessantly. He would also
not=
 start eating until Ramana had taken a mouthful of food. One day when a
str=
ay dog entered the Ashram through the back door, Jackie started barking.
Ra=
mana calmed him saying, =E2=80=9CYou just close your eyes. You just close y=
our
eyes. You just close your eyes. If you do this you will not be able to =
see
the dog.=E2=80=9D At once Jackie closed his eyes.

One day Jackie was a=
ttacked by a ferocious pig and was seriously injured.
His stomach was torn =
open and the intestines came out. It required a lot of
stitches to close it=
 up and afterwards Jackie was carried to a mantapam
opposite the Ashram to =
recover. At the same time Kunju Swami was suffering
from a severe abscess o=
n his foot and was also staying in the same mantapam.
When Sri Ramana came =
to visit them, Kunju Swami was crying out in pain and
fell at Maharshi=E2=
=80=99s feet. But Ramana said to him, =E2=80=9CSee, how Jackie is
silently =
bearing his pain after such a major operation, without so much as a
whimper=
!=E2=80=9D This was helpful to Kunju Swami and his pain became bearable for=

him. Ramana stroked Jackie and enquired if the meal had been brought and
t=
hen left both patients.

<span style=3D"font-style:italic">One day Jackie was attacked by a ferociou=
s pig and was seriously injured. His stomach was torn open and the intestin=
es came out. It required a lot of stitches to close it up and afterwards Ja=
ckie was carried to a mantapam opposite the Ashram to recover. At the same =
time Kunju Swami was suffering from a severe abscess on his foot and was al=
so staying in the same mantapam. When Sri Ramana came to visit them, Kunju =
Swami was crying out in pain and fell at Maharshi=E2=80=99s feet. But Raman=
