That is nice to read that someone is doing Homam on a daily basis and lives=
 in the West. 

I am looking for someone in New Jersey area in USA who is d=
oing Homa on a daily basis and who can guide me with this. 

Thanks

=C2=A0 =

Namaskaram.

I do daily homa and am sharing here my method (which may not =
be wholly orthodox or correct, so take it with lots of grains of salt) to m=
ake it feasible. I think my prep time takes less than 5 mins; the actual ho=
ma takes me 45 - 50 mins. I also do a separate sadhana that takes me 20 min=
s--so, all together, I spend 80-90 mins in the morning doing homa and sadha=
na. These are the steps I follow for the homa:

I keep the copper kunda in =
an aluminum tray, which rests upon two bricks on the floor, and the two bri=
cks are on top of a folded heavy-duty black garbage bag. I don't fuss much =
about cleaning before and after each homa, because this arrangement protect=
s the floor, so just on the weekends, I clean it up properly by replacing /=
 emptying the tray, and vacuuming / wiping any residue. This havan "area" i=
s fixed and I do not remove it after each homa--it's like a fixed altar. 

=
Next to the kunda area, I keep a small shrine where everything is laid out =
for the daily homa. There is a small mandap for keeping the kalasha and vig=
rahas, and in front, I keep a supply of the samagri needed for the puja (gh=
ee, aarti tray with diya and dhoop stand, kumkum, gandhan, agarbatti, etc.)=
, oil for the diya, matches=C2=A0and a tray full of coconut halves. (I do n=
ot cut the coconut halves into strips for the homa; I just use one coconut =
half per homa). This arrangement prevents having to=C2=A0gather and arrange=
=C2=A0everything from scratch each day.

The main kalasha I only exchange t=
he water once a week; during the week, I let=C2=A0the water=C2=A0accumulate=
 the vrttis from the successive homas.

Accordingly, on any given day, all =
I have to do to prepare for the homa is the following: Empty the burnt offe=
rings from the previous day's homa (which I offer to my plants outside as "=
fertilizer"--they really thrive on it!), fill the pancha patra with water, =
and cut a few flowers for the homa offerings. I bring these back to the hav=
an kund, fill the lamp with oil and a wick, arrange the vigrhas for that da=
y's homa (I do homa to different deities on different days), put the prasad=
 in a little offering bowl, and can sit directly for homa. So, this whole p=
rocedure takes me less than 5 mins. 

I do not bother with melting the ghee=
, even though I live in cold climes in England. I have a 1/2 kg container o=
f ghee, that I use each day, and I find that after using it once, it stays =
in melted / liquidish form (if homa is done at least every 2-3 days) and on=
ce I bring the wooden spoon to the kund and heat up the ghee, and go back t=
o scoop some more ghee from the container, the heat from the spoon does the=
 rest of the melting. (Again, maybe this is not kosher and is "wrong" from =
a madi perspective, so please take with a grain of salt.)

For prasad, I us=
e nuts, and I also use nuts for the bali, so I do not spend time preparing =
food or cutting fruit. 

I have found this to be quite feasible to do on a =
daily basis--that, too, while keeping a separate sadhana that takes an addi=
tonal 20-30 mins in the morning and working a hectic 80+ hours / week job, =
so it can definitely be done! Just try it for a few days and I think you'll=
 be able to come up with your own routine.

Again, I'm not at all advising =
to follow what I do (because my shortcuts may be wrong), but just wanted to=
 share as a brainstorming idea.

Warm regards,
Aditi
