Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,

You have mentioned the importance of initiation.=
 What is the consequence of 
practicing a sadhana (which requires initiatio=
n) without initiation?

>From the Aghora books, I got the feeling that the n=
ature of the sadhanas 
mentioned in there absolutely required guidance for =
the sake of safety of the 
native such as to prevent the native from insani=
ty or death. But ofcourse that 
would be expected if one to a crematorium a=
nd performs some sadhana only on the 
basis of reading from some book or fr=
om word of mouth.

What I have read multiple times in Siva Purana is that i=
nitiation is necessary 
for quick results of sadhana, without initiation, d=
esired results are either not 
achieved or takes a long time to acheive.

W=
hat is your take though on why initiation is important?

Thanks,
Bhupendra.=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Translations, Initiation, Vedi=
c vs Tantrik

=C2=A0 


Namaste friends,

Essentially I agree with Narasimh=
a garu in most matters in this discussion. The 
only major point where I di=
sagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path 
*without initiation*. The=
 rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs 
some clarification =
as there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few 
pointers:

1. There=
 are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas 
etc.=
 Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras=
, 
kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras=
 and 
mantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantr=
as.

2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original.=
 Reading a 
translation is not even comparable to chanting the original cha=
nt. So far it is 
fine.

3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based=
 on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes 
a distinction between them.

4. As per the =
traditional view one doesn't need to be initiated to chant a 
stotra or dhy=
anam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras 
containing bijak=
sharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need 
initiation. This is=
 the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not 
the same as t=
hese other mantras that need initiation, which are generally 
referred to a=
s Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the 
actual idea =
is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct 
spiritual =
specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such 
as Ka=
li or Sri.

5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do no=
t need initiation 
as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasrana=
ma and Devi Mahatmyam 
are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or pa=
rts of puranas. They have a 
larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya=
 sadhana. Chanting them without 
initiation is not recommended especially w=
hen the reader combines the navarna or 
shodashi mantras too as an integral=
 part of the chanting.

6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas b=
elonging to both Kanchi as 
well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiatio=
n for both the sadhanas of Sri 
Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their r=
espective NAVAKSHARI AND 
SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INT=
EGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the 
sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold t=
hat one needs to be initiated 
to chant the Navarna as well as shodashaksha=
ri mantras.

7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text=
 that has an 
independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is si=
multaneously a 
Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the =
spirit of the 
Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral =
part of Sri Sri 
Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be =
initiated to chant it. 
However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Veda=
nta or Sacred myth aspects of 
the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myt=
h in the vernacular has been 
recommended in my write-up, as chanting the o=
riginal along with the navakshari 
amounts to practicing the sadhana of a M=
ahavidya. In that case it is recommended 
to be initiated and go through th=
e specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.

8. Arguably if an uninitia=
ted person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original 
Sanskrit as part of th=
e *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an 
inherent problem i=
n our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of 
Devi Mahatmya=
m from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers 
inadvertently=
 end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the 
Siddhakunj=
ika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.

9. I you carefully peruse m=
y write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, 
nowhere do I put dow=
n the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I 
attempted to write a =
commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the 
power of the ori=
ginal mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know 
the essenc=
e or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. 
Infac=
t `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! 


10. Fo=
r those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, 
ther=
e is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level of 
s=
amskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. 
Oth=
erwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep =

doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. A=
s 
Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadha=
na 
WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will re=
duce a 
lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accor=
d in the 
natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. 


Hop=
e the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. 

Regards,
Satya Praka=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>From the Aghora books, I got the feeling that the =
nature of the sadhanas mentioned in there absolutely required guidance for =
the sake of safety of the native such as to prevent the native from insanit=
y or death. But ofcourse that would be expected if one to a crematorium and=
 performs some sadhana only on the basis of reading from some book or from =
word of mouth.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>What I have read multiple times=
 in Siva Purana is that initiation is necessary for quick results of sadhan=
a, without initiation, desired results are either not achieved or takes a l=
ong time to acheive.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>What is your take though =
on why initiation is important?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>

<P><BR><BR>Nama=
ste friends,<BR><BR>Essentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matters=
 in this discussion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one c=
an do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion o=
n translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some=
 unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:<BR><BR>1. There are various sacred =
chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking suc=
h sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams =
etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samh=
ita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.<BR><BR>2. Undoubted=
ly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a transl=
ation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is f=
ine.<BR><BR>3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak=
, tradition makes a distinction between
 them.<BR><BR>4. As per the traditi=
onal view one doesn't need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. Th=
e case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, a=
gamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the tradi=
tional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other =
mantras that need initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tan=
trik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these=
 mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities t=
hat need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.<BR><=
BR>5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need in=
itiation as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Dev=
i Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of pura=
nas. They have a larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Ch=
anting them without initiation is
 not recommended especially when the read=
er combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the =
chanting.<BR><BR>6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas belongin=
g to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for bo=
th the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective=
 NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB=
 (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one nee=
ds to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.<=
BR><BR>7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that =
has an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultane=
ously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit o=
f the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of S=
ri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated =
to chant it. However if one
 wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sac=
red myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the ve=
rnacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original alon=
g with the navakshari amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In =
that case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the specialised =
sadhanas properly under guidance.<BR><BR>8. Arguably if an uninitiated pers=
on reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauran=
ik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our time=
s. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from text=
s alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also=
 chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram w=
hich too contain the bijaksharas.<BR><BR>9. I you carefully peruse my write=
-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Na=
varna mantra even in
 writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commenta=
ry on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power of the original man=
tra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know the essence or impor=
t (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha' i=
s the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! <BR><BR>10. For thos=
e who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no=
 need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara =
to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we=
 would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing wha=
tever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimh=
a garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT =
asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot o=
f the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natu=
ral flow.
 Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. <BR><BR>Hope the ab=
ove pointers help in clearing any confusion. <BR><BR>Regards,<BR>Satya Prak=
