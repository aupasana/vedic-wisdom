Subject: [vedic-wisdom] "Invading the Sacre=
d"

   
Namaste friends,

A member of this group gifted me a book when he m=
et me for a saamoohika Satya 
Narayana vratam we conducted at Cary, North C=
arolina last year. I finally got to 
read a little from it. I am impressed =
with this work.

The book is called "Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hi=
nduism Studies in 
America" (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicola=
s and Aditi Banerjee). 
It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 section=
s.

Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upo=
n India 
and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted re=
searches in 
the name of academic freedom at the religious studies departme=
nts of western 
universities, published them and gained name and fame, tram=
pling the sacred in 
the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with th=
is will not improve the 
situation or solve the problem. Interested religio=
us scholars have to firmly and 
patiently crtique these works in the same a=
cademic style, in order to reclaim 
the rightful place for Hinduism.

Sever=
al papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western=
 
scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hast=
y, 
nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.

*=
        *        *

I will just give an example of the offensive work that =
was rebutted in this 
book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive =
writings should skip the 
next three paragraphs.]

Jeffrey Kripal from Univ=
 of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal 
and did research on=
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there 
enthusiastically helped him=
 in the researches. In the end, what he produced is 
utterly nonsensical an=
d filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation 
without showing it t=
o Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or 
linguistic inaccuraci=
es. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he 
produced only years=
 later, after his book "Kali's Child" based on the PhD 
dissertation won gr=
eat acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal 
Academy of Religi=
on for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was 
sadly mentioned=
 in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for 
learning ab=
out Ramakrishna.

In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perve=
rted person, a 
homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hind=
i or Sanskrit well 
and did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mi=
ssion for this work. He 
used his own faulty translations, willful distorti=
ons and manipulation of 
sources to arrive at sensational (and damning) con=
clusions. For example, he 
translated a word that means "lap" as "genitals"=
, in the context of Swami 
Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a =
young boy then) sitting in 
Ramakrishna's lap. He translated a word that me=
ans "touching softly" as 
"uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penise=
s of boys".

Even in places where there was no material to mis-translate, h=
e simply 
speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri=
 and 
Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught=
 advaita 
vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and exp=
erience 
nirvikalpa samadhi: "What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, =
a homosexually 
oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with =
another, stark-naked 
man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man's nu=
dity, and more especially, 
his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna's a=
ttention. How could it not?" 
Please note that he is not referring to any s=
ource and mis-translating it, but 
simply speculating based on his perverte=
d agenda!

*        *        *

If you see the book, you will see many exam=
ples of such pseudo-scholarship 
driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact th=
at many perverted people under asuric 
influences make their livelihood, mo=
ney and fame lying and spreading falsehoods 
about Hinduism, Hindu deities =
and Hindu saints.

Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha agai=
nst this may ignore this 
and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enou=
gh people do sadhana to 
strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things wi=
ll automatically weaken. 
However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scho=
lars academically is really 
required on the ground. We need to give our en=
couragement to the pioneers who 
are doing this important scholarly rebutta=
l.

Best regards,
Narasimha
