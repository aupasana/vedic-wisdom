Dear Girish,
=C2=A0
Let me try to answer from my perspective. 
=C2=A0
While=
 I have been doing the Ganapathi homam for the past few months as regularly=
 as I can , I have always been very drawn to bhagawati / Devi upasanas. I g=
et very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi or see an =
endearing image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with great effort in=
 such situiations. This does not happen with any other God /deity .
=C2=A0
=
It could be that you have a connection with Devi from some life time. 
=C2=
=A0
Does this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it just m=
y mind at working overtime. 
=C2=A0
Even if it is your mind, the feeling gi=
ves you intense happiness. You can't reject the happiness. Can you? If you =
feel that you can and should do worship of Devi, then do it. Don't worry ab=
out the pros and cons of whether it is suitable or not suitable. Just do it=
.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
That seems to be some time away considering that its an exh=
austive script. While I continue to work on this path, I wanted to do some =
kind of homam for the devi in the mean time.
=C2=A0
Keep trying to get fami=
liar with the text as much as you can. This may take time. Different people=
 depending on their samskaras may take different amount of time to be comfo=
rtable with the text. One person I know (Narayan Iyer)=C2=A0who was not flu=
ent in devnagri script took more than 10 hours to do the first Chandi homa.=
 He had fantastic determination. Before I had started with my first homa or=
 even read the Chandi once, I had the good fortune of meeting him.=C2=A0Man=
ish had told me that I needed to do Chandi homa, but I was too scared of th=
e text. It looked complex. Then when I met Manish, he showed me one Chandi =
homa. At that time I also met Narayan and heard from him how he did his fir=
st homa. That inspired me and=C2=A0that is when I decided, come hail or sto=
rm, I have to do it. My first homa took me a good 6 and half hours.=C2=A0My=
 advise is that=C2=A0use your=C2=A0will power to tell your mind, that you W=
ILL do it. Set a timeframe, that you will keep practising the Chandi
 path =
for say 3 months or whatever is comfortable with you and stick to it. Where=
 there is a will, there is a way.
=C2=A0
Is it possible to recite only spec=
ific portions from the Chandi for the Chandi homam instead of going through=
 the entore 700 verses?
=C2=A0
A good strategy would be to start with the 1=
1th Chapter homa or 4th Chapter homa. The Devi Stutis. Narasimha had mentio=
ned this once in this forum. While trying to familiarize yourself with the =
text, start with chapter 2/3/4. Once you are comfortable with it, then read=
 2/3/4 and 1. Once you are comfortable with that, then read 2/3/4/1/5. If y=
ou can do the first five chapter, the rest will follow. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Can =
I use some other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra "om ai=C3=A0 hr=
=C3=A9=C3=A0 kl=C3=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce" .
=C2=A0
=
Sure. However understand that a Chandi homa is homa of the 13 chapters. In =
parts of West Bengal many people often claim to do Chandi homas but all the=
y end up doing is ahutis of only the Navarna Mantra. That - in my opinion -=
 is NOT=C2=A0a Chandi homa. 
=C2=A0
Alternatively can I perform the homam u=
sing the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the procedure if I am using just=
 the Durga suktam for performing the homam.
=C2=A0
The Durga Suktam is a Ve=
dic Suktam. The pronunciation is a key here. But why not start with a Chapt=
er from teh actual Shaptasati for homa. That would be the best strategy, I =
feel.

Namaskarams Nara=
simhaji and other Masters,
I have been following the discussions on Aghori =
practices and accounts in the smashan bhumi homams with great interest and =
curiosity. I also managed to read some portions of the Aghora series by Svo=
boda. While I have been doing the Ganapathi homam for the past few months a=
s regularly as I can , I have always been very drawn to bhagawati / Devi up=
asanas. I get very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi=
 or see an endearing image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with grea=
t effort in such situiations. This does not happen with any other God /deit=
y .

1) Does this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it ju=
st my mind at working overtime. 

After reading the accounts there is an in=
tense desire to perform the Chandi homam. But before that I need to become =
comfortable with the Chandi recitation. That seems to be some time away con=
sidering that its an exhaustive script. While I continue to work on this pa=
th, I wanted to do some kind of homam for the devi in the mean time.

2) Is=
 it possible to recite only specific portions from the Chandi for the Chand=
i homam instead of going through the entore 700 verses?

3) Can I use some =
other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra "om ai=C3=A0 hr=C3=A9=C3=A0=
 kl=C3=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce" .

4) Alternatively c=
an I perform the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the proc=
edure if I am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.

Thanks=
 and Regards with my humble pranaams,
Girish Sundaram.
