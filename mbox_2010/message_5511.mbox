Please cut down on this belligerance. If you keep polluting the =
list with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the list. We welcome a=
ll views, but one can disagree with great scholars and masters without beli=
ttling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.
 
Aadi Shan=
kara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, yo=
u will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in his commentari=
es, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic =
scriptures, breadth of commentaries of Vedic literature and the linguistic =
richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of K=
ali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about the importance of =
devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar =
of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.

Sanskrit=
 is a very useful language. So much great literature that shows various pat=
hs to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras=
 directly resonate with the energy centers in one's subtle consciousness. S=
o, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in S=
anskrit, it is a great idea.
 
At the same time, Shankara's advice of chant=
ing the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue o=
ne in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *comple=
te* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in =
the end. Learning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplinin=
g the mind with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - al=
l these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending=
 on one's rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activit=
ies, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing =
rituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so th=
at people do not forget it and get bogged down.
 
If one wanting to climb a=
 mountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb,=
 one may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be st=

assionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.

I am reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekanan=
da.
 
Swami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: "I am the disciple o=
f a man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his s=
hoes. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into t=
he Ganges!"
 
Student said, "But, Swami, that is the part of you I like bes=
t."
 
Swami Vivekananda said, "That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=
=94 like I am."
 
Vivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he h=
ad viveka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but becau=
se TRUE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was t=
o realize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical =
mind).

Maturity of a teac=
her is not measured by the following. And great teachers do not care about =
being "celebrated".
 
In any case, it is not true that Adi Shankara is not =
well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Vedanta scholarship of the las=
t 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shankara's commentaries. He shap=
ed the thinking of Indian philosophers for many many generations.
 
Apart f=
rom his scholarly works, the mutts established by him have shaped the relig=
ious consciousness of a significant percentage of Hindus in the last couple=
 of millennia.
 
Any teachings in written/spoken words can never be perfect=
 and perish quickly. The words of great great teachers also lose their mean=
ing and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings of rishis and gods retai=
n their meaning and their ability to influence the thinking of people forev=
er (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara's words - scholarly works as =
well as composed prayers - have retained their meaning and power for more t=
han a couple of millennia. The longevity of his works is amazing.
 
*      =

It is ok to have strong opinions. As people's understanding =
evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend others =
with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras of gods=
 and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, is not g=
ood karma. I request members to be considerate, tolerant and respectful to =
others.

There are other people to whom Scotch gives them more high than your Vyaaka=
rana. Adi Sankaracharya's message tells you that God's name, Govinda's name=
 gives you more high than the mundane vyaakarana or anything else. If you a=

 but don't comment. People who are happy to receive just mere scotch will n=

way! So,no point in bringing about this comparison. So, please ignore all t=
his but try to look for the truth within.
