The stories of curses on mantras and deities are metaphorical repr=
esentations of things to watch out for. Please do not think that your mantr=
a is not working because it is cursed and that it will magically work if yo=
u chant the shaapa vimochana mantra (curse relieving incantation) .
=C2=A0
=
Take Savitru Gayatri mantra for example. It extolls the effulgence of the C=
osmic Sun who lights up the Sushumna nadi (subtle channel of realization) .=
 The chhandas Gayatri is the shakti controlling the entrance of Sushumna na=
di in Mooladhaara chakra. Repeated chanting of Gayatri mantra with focus wi=
ll open the entrance of Sushumna nadi and let self-awareness (Kundalini) fl=
ow in the channel of realization. The ultimate goal is self-realization.
=
=C2=A0
However, if one does not realize the goal and thinks in terms of a l=
imited I-ness and its
 desires (good health, wealth, children, fame etc etc=
) even as one chants Gayatri mantra, one will not achieve self-realization.=
 One's Kundalini may rise, but will stop somewhere. One is blocked from the=
 "full results" of Gayatri mantra. THAT is what is meant by it being cursed=
.
=C2=A0
Gayatri mantra has three curses. Take the one from Vasishtha for e=
xample. The word Vaishtha comes from vasu and means "the purest and the mos=
t excellent one". If an impure one, i.e. one with desires of a limited I-ne=
ss, is chanting it, there is a curse from Vasishtha that blocks one. If you=
 see the shaapavimochana mantra given in tradition for Vasishtha's curse, y=
ou will see that it says "I am the light that fills the entire universe, I =
am Shiva etc". It implores sadhaka to let the limited I-ness go.
=C2=A0
If =
one merely chants that shaapa vimochana mantra, it is akin to chanting "Adv=
il stops headache". Chanting that does not stop headache. One needs to
 act=
ually take Advil. Similarly, one needs to imbibe the meanings of the shaapa=
 vimochana mantras, in order for the Veda mantra of Gayatri to work fully a=
nd make one self-realized.

=C2=A0
Bottomline: Storie=
s of curses and curse relieving incantations for various deities and mantra=
s are metaphorical in nature. Instead of searching for a magical formula, o=
ne should work on one's mental attitude and thinking. Surrender to god and =
consider all actions as offerings to god. Do whatever sadhana you can, whet=
her it is japam or homam, for whatever time you can. In the rest of the tim=
e, keep a close watch on your thinking and eliminate undesirable thoughts (=
thoughts emanating from the desires of a limited I-ness) at the root. Expan=
d I-ness to include others - wife and children, parents, family, friends, c=
ommunity, country, world etc. Rooting out of
 conditioning though constant =
contemplation enables one to do a better japam or homam. The time spent in =
japam and homam enables one to contemplate better and eliminate conditionin=
g faster. The external sadhanas and the internal contemplation aid each oth=
er.
=C2=A0
When one's attitude is pure, all mantras become possible. Mantra=
s chanted by an impure and selfish mind have all kinds of curses on them an=
d give no results.

Narasimha
