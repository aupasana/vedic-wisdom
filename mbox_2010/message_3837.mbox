deeply over the matter. One moment I felt that the God whom we all worshipp=

and prostrated myself before him. Thus did God come into my life to remove =
the veil of caste-distinctions.

d realize very soon after this: for I was to enter the medical profession a=
nd serve all, and the persistence of caste-distinction would have made that=
 service a mockery. With this mist cleared by the light of God, it was easy=
 and natural for me to serve everyone. I took very keen delight in every ki=
nd of service connected with healing and alleviation of human misery. If th=
ere was a good prescription for malaria, I felt that the whole world should=
 know it the next moment. Any knowledge about the prevention of diseases, p=
romotion of health and healing of diseases, I was eager to acquire and shar=
e with all.

is unnecessary. Time and space are concepts of the mind and have no meaning=
 in God. I can look back now upon the whole period of my stay in Malaya as =
a single event in which God came to me in the form of the sick and the suff=
ering. People are sick physically and mentally. To some, life is lingering =
death; and to some others, death is more welcome than life. Some lead a mis=
erable life, unable to face death; some invite death and commit suicide, un=
able to face life. The aspiration grew within me that if God had not made t=
his world merely as a hell where wicked people would be thrown, to suffer, =
and if there is (as I intuitively felt there should be) something other tha=
n this misery and this helpless existence, it should be known and experienc=
ed.

ife that God came to me as a religious mendicant who gave me the first less=

uman life, were made apparent. This drew me from Malaya to the Himalaya. Go=

Self of all.

 that lurk in man.

w "Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma." Early in 1950 (on the 8th Jan.) God came to me=
 in the form of a half-demented assailant, who disturbed the night satsanga=
 at the ashram. His attempt failed. I bowed to him, worshipped him and sent=
 him home. Evil exists to glorify the good! Evil is a superficial appearanc=
e; beneath its veil, the one Self shines in all.

ht to be mentioned here. In this evolution nothing gained previously is ent=
irely discarded at any later stage. One coalesced into the next; and the Yo=
ga of Synthesis was the fruit. Murti-puja, selfless service of the sick, me=
ditation, the cultivation of cosmic love that transcended the barriers of c=
aste, creed and religion, with the ultimate aim of attaining Cosmic Conscio=
usness, was revealed. This knowledge had immediately to be shared. All this=
 had become an integral part of my being.

ur. Then God came to me in His virat-svarupa, multitudes of devotees, eager=
 to listen to the tenets of divine life. At every centre I felt that God sp=
oke through me, and He Himself in His virat-form spread out before me as th=
e multitude, listened to me. He sang with me; He prayed with me; He spoke a=
nd He listened. Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma.
