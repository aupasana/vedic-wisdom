Dear Narasimhagaru,
=C2=A0
Thank you for your reply. 
=C2=A0
I understand t=
hat Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother.=C2=
=A0But what I am trying to understand=C2=A0is that how to worship both form=
s simultaneously. For=C2=A0instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gre=
at composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagar=
aja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamala=
mba Navavarna Krithis=C2=A0mention=C2=A0great details about all the=C2=A0ni=
ne avaranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through ea=
ch avarana.=C2=A0In the Dhyana Krithi=C2=A0of those, in the very=C2=A0first=
 line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'.=C2=A0That line t=
ells me that=C2=A0even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that=
 form.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your re=
ply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by la=
yers of duality! I never thought in those terms. 
=C2=A0
I have started rea=
ding Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before =
I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I =
really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see h=
ow mother will help me achieve my target. 
=C2=A0
Also, I have started to r=
ead the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mix=
ed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more!

Namaste,

Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue t=
o me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring.=
 On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all a=
nd took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first att=
empt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now.=
 THAT is awe-inspiring.

Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem=
 that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one =
or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting t=
he time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better t=
o dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if on=
e wants to find water.

One possibility is to do a homam and then meditate =
at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to.

I am=
 not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have be=
en exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of the layers of dua=
lity surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality=
 and realize Self.

Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one=
. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If yo=
u have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you =
can face the strictness). Both are valid paths.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sri Narasimharao g=
aru,

I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyda=
y. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your ch=
andi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a shor=
t time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes=
)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam wi=
th pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - =
40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times =
a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these alon=
g with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you ple=
ase explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivat=
ed to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen inte=
rest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-ava=
rna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.
