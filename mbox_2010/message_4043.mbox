Dear Kshroum Garu,

Our walking state influences our dream state to major e=
xtent.

Might be you are a devotee of Goddesss Kali or atleast you should h=
ave age
old vasanas in your mind regarding goddess kali and her ugra-svarup=
am.

Anyhow it is encouraging that you are dreaming gods,goddesses and temp=
les in
your dreams state which is excellent and a positive sign towards you=
r
spiritual sadhana.

      <p>Hi all,<br>
 I had an unusual dream last n=
ight and I would appreciate if learned members can decode the meaning to me=
?<br>
I saw myself watching a person and a goddess (4 arms, white sari, cop=
per-gold hued faced, about 10 feet tall, floating about 2 feet above air)pe=
rson was on the left and goddess was on right as I was watching this conver=
sation. He went on explaining (complaining) the goddess how bad the world h=
as become etc. after listening to that, the goddess proceed to cut his face=
 from right underneath the bottom of his nose all the way down to the jaw. =
Then I saw that person still has his face intact, but half of his tongue ha=
s been cut (the cut tongue resembled a quarter of an ellipse cut into four =
equal parts)<br>

Then she took that tongue and replaced it on her own tong=
ue. So now she had half of her own tongue and half of that persons tongue. =
The tongue of that person was now green like moss covered green. Then she l=
ooked at me and it was kind of a fierce look.<br>

<br>
I don't know wh=
at to make out of it. I don't know at what time I saw this dream. <br>
