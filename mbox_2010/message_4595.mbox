Namaste,
 
Physical gravity is not constant across the world we live in. It varies from place to place. See a recent BBC news item at:
 
http://tinyurl.com/geograv
 
In the Aghora series of books, Vimalananda had mentioned that gravity was different in India compared to the rest of the world. As the gravity in the subtle body plane is also accordingly different in India from the rest of the world, Vimalananda said this contributes to spiritual sadhana and progress being a little easier in India.
 
You can look at the gravity map and see that India indeed stands out from the rest of the world!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
