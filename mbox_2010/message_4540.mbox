Dear Sri=C2=A0Sashi Deshpande ji,
=C2=A0
It is my belief that you have prob=
ably incorrectly understood some of Narasimha's points. He is not saying th=
at a grossly mispronounced mantra will give you specific results, BUT, if t=
he fear of the 64 things that bind a mantra stops an individual from even t=
rying to do japa, THAT is an even more serious problem. Therefore, his advi=
se was to start doing sadhana in whatever way possible without getting bogg=
ed down by technicalities too much.
=C2=A0
So desire is from yajamana, mind=
 is of priest and blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro tr=
eaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recommended various rituals of various devat=
as for removing bad effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wo=
nder if mantra and rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many ho=
ma manuals. 
=C2=A0
Mantra and rituals surely count, BUT, they by themselve=
s are incapable of producing results UNTILL the individual performing the r=
itual has requisite Shaktih. 
=C2=A0
I have seen learned priests performing=
 elaborate and technically complex (costly too!)=C2=A0rituals which did not=
 produce any result. I wonder how many priests in todays time can say with =
100 percent certainty that if he does X ritual, he can gaurantee a Y result=
 for a yajamana? I have met people who can do this too, they were not pries=
ts, but sadhakas.
=C2=A0
Most=C2=A0ordinary priests today have zero capabil=
ity of producing results. The ritual is a tool to be used, through which Sh=
akti accumulated by the priest is directed to gain a certain specifc result=
. Without the Shakti elaborate rituals are of no use. They will just not pr=
oduce tangible results. And results are the parameter of judgement. 
=C2=A0=

Shaktih is the result of accumulated sadhana. Like Narasimha said, a ritua=
l is like a gun and the Shaktih is like a bullet. Having the gun is good, b=
ut without the bullet it won't work. These days priests do not do enough sa=
dhana and therefore, they cannot gaurantee any results most of the times. I=
n the light of the above, it is better if people perform their own rituals =
or own sadhana and=C2=A0 sincerely ask the Deity to give the results instea=
d of waiting for a priest to do it, who anyway cannot gaurantee results the=
se days. Religion is a practical art. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
To consider spi=
ritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have dharanA like a=
 solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not require mantr=
a or tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can do work. =
Normal people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of pata=
njali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these=
 all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tan=
tra, nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many many thing=
s count.=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Yes many things count, but if the count is so h=
igh that it stops one from even attempting, it is hardly of any use then. A=
 saint or a yogi does not become a yogi in a single day, but by rigorous an=
d continuous sadhana day in and day out, across lifetimes. Follow whatever =
rules one is comfortable with, and just plunge into sadhana. The results wi=
ll manifests on their own. And Nature is ever kind. It guides the ones who =
have are ready to make the effort with a sincere heart. BUT effort, even if=
 flawed, is the key.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
There are people who are theoritically kn=
owledgeable about so many rules/technicalities etc of mantra sadhana, such =
that they themselves never tried anything, and yet there are others who har=
dly know any rules but just plunge into sadhana and in due coarse=C2=A0of t=
ime=C2=A0start experiencing the beauty of the Deity! So therefore, all said=
 and done, the key is practical, day or day sadhana. Unless one is making e=
fforts, all theoritical discussions don't really effect much.
=C2=A0
Yama/N=
iyama/aAsana etc will come through effort and practise. Waiting for it to d=
awn one fine day won't happen. Which again means, start sadhana in whatever=
 way one can if one is really serious about experiencing divinity or for th=
at matter getting a specific saatwik result.
=C2=A0
This is the practical f=
act of the matter. Which, IMHO, is what Narasimha was saying.

Dear Narsimhaji and all respected membe=
rs - Namaste

Astrologers routinely recommend remedial measures involving m=
antras and
poojas and people spend a lot of money on them.

Do they work? I=
 will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and
insights. I will =
be honest, straight-forward and blunt.

=C2=A0

Like
me and all others who =
respect Shri PVR Narsimhaji as a noble, honest,
intelligent, spiritual pers=
on and Sanskrit scholar must be feeling sad after
reading contents in the p=
ost heading efficacy of astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really
painful to read=
 such thing from a person of his status whom lot of people
considered as a =
good astro-spiritual personality. Though I am not having
scripture referenc=
es i=E2=80=99ll try to post my humble protest and request to all
members to=
 understand and study shastra deeply for better understanding. 

Though bel=
ievers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their
problems wi=
ll be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any
results. As=
 a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding
exists=
 even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some
intelli=
gent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address
=
why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. 

Results
ar=
e produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or deity a=
nd
blessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [
krupA] Here =
we think results are produced; so let us understand the method. If
somebody=
 wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to
perform=
 remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the
focal p=
oint is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=
=99s
behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire an=
d in return get
paid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator o=
r a technician who
can interact with both parties. And interaction means co=
rrect rituals with
appropriate mantras. So his spiritual or mental strength=
 is not required but
his skill and knowledge is of prime importance. Can we=
 consider a mortal priest
to bless a yajamana? And if a priest can bless ya=
jamana what is the role of
rituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are be=
stowed upon the human beings by
devatas as only divinity is capable of this=
. And many times fruits are not
received due to karmic blockages of yajaman=
a. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87
=E0=A4=
=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82=
 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [=
 in kaliyuga four
times efforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anus=
htAna falA for doing
bhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an eas=
y
task on the part of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of
ya=
jamana.

If one has one million dollars in one's bank account, a check give=
n by one
for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one's bank account is empty=
, what good
is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Simila=
rly, poojas done
and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual e=
nergy cannot bring
one any benefits.

=C2=A0

Yajamana get fruits of the ri=
tuals from the inbuilt bank balance of deities
and not of a priest. A power=
house of divine energy, called devata can give
million dollar check to unli=
mited no of people as GOD has sanctioned rather
appointed them for this wor=
k. In Rugveda tradition in vedic rituals in any
pooja with or without homa =
in the beginning there is one ritual called
aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=
=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means y=
ajamana nominate a
priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf an=
d in the end before
visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=
=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is perfo=
rmed
in which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to ya=
jamana.
Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of d=
eity. As per
karmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and bles=
sed one get that
share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can a=
 mortal though highly
qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he interac=
ts with many in his lifetime?
This could be possible only for highly evolve=
d soul like saints and yogis as
due to great penance they do have such powe=
rs. But even for them also some time
loss of spiritual energy leads for fur=
ther penance. We read lot of stories in
ancient mythology of sages enticed =
by apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if
they cursed some body results =
in renewed penances to regain there status.

=C2=A0

One important note: Th=
e power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)
or a sequence of phys=
ical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that
FOCUSES on a combinati=
on of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical
actions (ritual). Energy=
 is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to
wander and instead focuse=
s on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus
points may gener=
ate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without
it, no mantra =
or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice.
Most pries=
ts are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas.
In the =
old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the
table =
when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.

s the most subtle and
imp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus =
which originates from
naval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of univers=
e. This is puran based
concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are =
having same concept with
different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak =
is at naval and creator
brahma creates this world with the help of saraswat=
i and sarsawati is nothing
but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=
=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syll=
ables. When two unknown person meets first
time how they get connected? Thr=
ough communication and thought is a form of
vak, pashyanti. First there is =
desire to know each other and then communication
starts. And in communicati=
on if some body express negativity communication
stops. So for communicatio=
n soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we
assume that mantra or=
 rituals are of no importance? These show qualities, tools
necessary to get=
 connected with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures
every syllable =
is assigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of that
syllable re=
sulting in typical energy. To be precise power rest with desire and
mind is=
 a mere tool to channalise that power and strength of desire will decide
de=
pth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of priest and
bles=
sings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage
p=
arAsharA recommended various rituals of various devatas for removing bad
ef=
fects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and
rit=
uals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. 

To consi=
der spiritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have
dharanA=
 like a solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not
requir=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0This whole confusion is due to
Narsim=

heart. Yes, focus mind is one of the factors in this whole exercise.=
 Many have

it in terms of desires. This is because devata is pleased =
by offerings, japa
and hOme which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS bless=

Many people think that poojas to gods are a se=

of rituals should never be a
deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST=
 eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams
of protein, so many grams of vitamin =
A etc. Suppose you have no access to such
balanced food. Will you starve yo=
urself until you find a balanced meal or will
you manage with whatever you =
have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)
and rice,

you will simp=
ly eat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do
not know the "=
perfect way" to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait
till you know the per=
fect way. You can start with what you know. It will only

The fear to do rituals without "perfect knowledge" stems from the
notion th=
at some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally
basele=
ss, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind on some
ma=
ntras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a hig=
h
level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast an=
d give
specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (alm=
ost) such
things in this age.

Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are compl=
ex and should be done by experts only
as these are for special purposes and=
 should be done by trained people. There
are hundreds of ways for GOD reali=
zation and a single way to fulfill our
desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know h=
ow to drive a car why opt for a fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elde=
rs, gurus have sanctioned it
then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden a=
nything but due to loss of energy
in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. f=
or removing karmic blocks we feel we
need more energy and we are not gettin=
g it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect
thing as perfection is subjective=
 matter but we must read study, think, analyze
before accepting any concept=
. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as
this is one of the best way=

 spirituality and for desires to get full filled through
deities every thin=

Different mantras and rituals are like begging b=
owls of different shapes.
They matter only so much. Depending on what kind =
of a begging bowl you use, you
may be given different kind of alms. But it =
is important to start begging with
some begging bowl or the other, instead =
of spending years looking for the
perfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting =
for astrologers with half-baked or
ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the =
perfect mantra or ritual, do what your
heart tells you or what your guru (o=

 our karma and to
surpass them HE has given us power and rights to use our =

healthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma don=

Yes, unfortunately there are lot of fake as=

sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.

your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy may be e=

It
seems Narsimhji is in too mu=

Yes, as this concept is b=
lessed by divine mother homa is going to be popular
sadhana in coming years=
. In his anxiety to spread this blessing he is
contradicting his own words.=
 Mantras do have vargabheda and can be broadly
categorized as=C2=A0 shrutim=

smritimantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We can broadly =
classify savitur
gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as smrutinmantra; vis=

puranmantra and shabarimantra[created by great navanath y=

Let us have a quick look at Narsimhji=E2=

remedy for begetting a child. He has suggested main remedy =
as santangopal

mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he suggested
that? I=

a=
ny one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be like this. Here we will
s=
idetrack depth of karma as this is near impossible to understand =E0=A4=97=

=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a
childl=
ess couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need
a =
baby. Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible fo=
r
sustenance of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itsel=
f is
self explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp it w=
ill
generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic mant=
ra is
capable of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is time=
frame. If
we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy to ha=
ve all
pleasures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends upon th=
e
individual. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing so we=
 need
that energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lad=
y will be
capable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give c=
hild but in
next birth as specific form of punya required to beget a baby w=
ill be
accumulated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole li=
fe time. As
said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next bi=
rth including
baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said c=
ause of baby
leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden hamme=

it might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer can d=
o this in five
minutes. This science, not logic is behind different mantra,=
 rituals sanctioned
by sages for different purposes as karma is never gener=

<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>It is my belief that you have probably incorrectly understood s=
ome of Narasimha's points. He is not saying that a grossly mispronounced ma=
ntra will give you specific results, BUT, if the fear of the 64 things that=
 bind a mantra stops an individual from even trying to do japa, THAT is an =
even more serious problem. Therefore, his advise was to start doing sadhana=
 in whatever way possible without getting bogged down by technicalities too=
 much.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><EM>So desire is from yajamana,=
 mind is of priest and blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great ast=
ro treaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recommended various rituals of various =
devatas for removing bad effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements.=
 I wonder if mantra and rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so ma=
ny homa manuals. </EM></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG> =
</DIV>
<DIV>Mantra and rituals surely count, BUT, they by themselves are in=
capable of producing results UNTILL the individual performing the ritual ha=
s requisite Shaktih. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I have seen learned prie=
sts performing elaborate and technically complex (costly too!) rituals=
 which did not produce any result. I wonder how many priests in todays time=
 can say with 100 percent certainty that if he does X ritual, he can gauran=
tee a Y result for a yajamana? I have met people who can do this too, they =
were not priests, but sadhakas.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Most ordi=
nary priests today have zero capability of producing results. The ritual is=
 a tool to be used, through which Shakti accumulated by the priest is direc=
ted to gain a certain specifc result. Without the Shakti elaborate rituals =
are of no use. They will just not produce tangible results. And results are=
 the parameter of judgement. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Shaktih is the r=
esult of accumulated sadhana. Like Narasimha said, a ritual is like a gun a=
nd the Shaktih is like a bullet. Having the gun is good, but without the bu=
llet it won't work. These days priests do not do enough sadhana and therefo=
re, they cannot gaurantee any results most of the times. In the light of th=
e above, it is better if people perform their own rituals or own sadhana an=
d  sincerely ask the Deity to give the results instead of waiting for =
a priest to do it, who anyway cannot gaurantee results these days. Religion=
 is a practical art. </DIV>

t my humble protest and request to all<BR>members to understand and study s=
hastra deeply for better understanding. <BR><BR>Though believers call pries=
ts and get poojas done, in
 the hope that their<BR>problems will be solved,=
 many priests today are incapable of producing any<BR>results. As a result,=
 some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding<BR>exists even w=
ithout eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some<BR>intelligent=
 people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address<BR>w=
hy this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. <BR><BR>Resul=
ts<BR>are produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or=
 deity and<BR>blessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [<B=
R>krupA] Here we think results are produced; so let us understand the metho=
d. If<BR>somebody wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some =
priest to<BR>perform remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or prie=
st. Here the<BR>focal point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual;=
 as on yajamana=E2=80=99s<BR>behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yaja=
mana=E2=80=99s desire and in return get<BR>paid. So in
 this whole exercise=
 priest is a mere mediator or a technician who<BR>can interact with both pa=
rties. And interaction means correct rituals with<BR>appropriate mantras. S=
o his spiritual or mental strength is not required but<BR>his skill and kno=
wledge is of prime importance. Can we consider a mortal priest<BR>to bless =
a yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of<BR>ritua=
ls, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human beings by<=
BR>devatas as only divinity is capable of this. And many times fruits are n=
ot<BR>received due to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=

 saraswati and sarsawati is nothing<BR>but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=

tops. So for communication soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can=
 we<BR>assume that mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show quali=
ties, tools<BR>necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective=
. In scriptures<BR>every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which deno=

. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage<BR>parAsharA recommended vario=

bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and<BR>rituals do not count wh=

 these<BR>all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as ma=

whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)<BR>and rice=

It is possible to focus the mind on some<BR>mantras and rituals and get spe=

 punya required to beget a child is missing so we need<BR>that energy in re=
