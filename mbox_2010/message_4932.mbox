Dear Narasimhaji and wise fellow members, 

Namaste. 

First of all, I woul=
d like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the write-up of the homam manu=
als. I have browsed several posts here and I do not know of any reference i=
n any traditional shastras, so I have a question regarding the performance =
of homam in one's mind. There must be times in one's life when several rest=
rictions of time or place or any other reasons - do not allow one to perfor=
m an external homam under the "perfect" conditions that one would like.  

=
1. So how does one go about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself perfo=
rming all the external rituals from A-Z? What if one's mind cannot "multi-t=
ask" and synchronize the mental recitation of mantras with the mental perfo=
rmance of actions? What if one cannot maintain the same standards of extern=
al environment purity, discipline etc? Is it then best to avoid mental homa=
m altogether?

2. Can one derive the same benefit from a mental homam that =
one would derive from an external homam?

3. Could a regular performance of=
 mental homam remove the impediments that is blocking one in doing homam in=
 real life and may it result in one becoming fortunate enough to carry out =
real-life homam by the grace of God?

Many many Thanks
