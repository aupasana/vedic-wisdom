By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty. What is essential for life
=
and honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is=

for this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should
=
not increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their
pr=
osperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we
in=
crease our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it
=
will only produce poverty and sorrow.

Vedanta which is the peak of the Ved=
as teaches the way for the removal of
sorrow. Hatred and desire arise only =
in respect of the objects other than
us. That desire will not arise if thos=
e objects are rendered identical with
us, if there is nothing other than us=
, then desire will not arise. If there
is no desire, there will be no effor=
t and no sin. When there is no sin,
there will be no body and there will be=
 no misery.

We may get many types of sorrow. What seems to be sorrow to al=
l the people
of a place may not seem sorrowful to us. If we stay always hap=
py, without
wanting to attain anything untouched by sorrow like the lotus-l=
eaf and the
Kalakodi - seed, that is called yoga. "Know that to be indicate=
d as yoga
which is separation from being united with sorrow, The removal of=

association with sorrow."

In order to reach one purport, why should the V=
eda speak of many matters?
This question may arise in our minds. It is thro=
ugh many matters that it is
possible to understand that one purport which i=
s Reality - yoga, meditation,
austerity, sacrifice, performance of karma; w=
hen these are accomplished,
what they indicate is that one Reality. It is t=
hat Reality which is the true
purport of the Veda. Other things are of a ch=
anging nature. They become
woven into a story and then even that story disa=
ppears.

What for is the science of medicine? It is for keeping the body st=
rong and
healthy. What if the body is not strong and healthy? The body will=
 be
subject to diseases. What if there is disease? One will not be able to
=
function properly. He who has given this body is the supreme Self. This is
=
the truth, we should practice several disciplines. We can practice them onl=
y
if the body is well. In order to keep it well, we must prevent it from
be=
coming a prey to disease. The science of medicine tells us how to prevent
d=
iseases. Thus, Ayurveda helps in the realisation of Advaita experience.

Sa=
vikapla Samadhi: The mind is steady without any distraction, contemplating
=
its object wholly absorbed therein.
Nirvikalpa Samadhi: This is the goal of=
 yoga. In this, the mind ceases to
function and vanishes once and for all, =
leaving the self to shine forth
alone. In Advaita too, the path of meditati=
on is recognised; but here the
object of meditation is the distinction-less=
 Brahman.
Sahaja Samadhi: This is realised through the path of enquiry. It =
is the
natural state of Self - realisation and one of utter unconcern for t=
he
fleeting phenomena.

There is nothing to feel elated about seeing the pe=
ople worshipping me. But
when I reflect that is worship to the God, who the=
y think are approachable
through me, I feel glad that there are so many who=
 believe in a
compassionate God who will hear them and remove their misery.=


Our religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -
purifi=
cation. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and
conflict. Th=
e reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of
Hinduism, in=
 spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure
of money, e=
tc., is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are
impressed.=
 We develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion.
There is a =
text in the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees
automatical=
ly. If we examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect,
the world=
 will follow him.

A child eats earth. Its hands are tied by the mother. Th=
e child gets angry
and cries. Is it without reason the mother ties it's han=
ds? We do not know
the mercy of Universal Mother. The good or harm coming t=
o us has its source
in Her Grace; Suffering - Her Grace for some reason. We=
 must accept whatever
comes to us, good or bad, as Her Grace. We do not kno=
w why she gives it. Our
vision is limited. We do not know what precedes it =
or follows it. If we are
able to look into the past present and future, we =
will know that God does no
harm to us. Other than God, there is no kith or =
kin for us.

We cannot say that a child or an idiot who keeps quiet without=
 activity like
a stone is great. We cannot presume that he has attained jiv=
anmukti. This is
the result of sin. He is a Yogi or Jnani whose intellect i=
s very subtle and
as sharp as a sword. He has to become like a withered tre=
e, an immovable
object with a steady mind. He must understand all that is h=
appening around
him. His knowledge should be perfect. He should not be affe=
cted by passion
or sorrow. He should always be happy. None of us is like th=
at and Iswara is
described as Sat-Chit-Ananda.

If God is the ocean of merc=
y and if He knows everything, He must know what
we want. Why should we appe=
al to Him to do this or that? The reasonable
answer is that instead of begg=
ing useless people at useless places, we plead
before the Highest and the O=
mniscient. Otherwise, we have no justification
to ask Him to give us this o=
r that.

Everything disintegrates on earth and this earth also will vanish =
one day.
The sun will disappear and the whole universe will go. Then there =
must be
some powerful substratum responsible for creation, protection and
d=
estruction. We call it God. We have the faculty of thinking and capacity of=

doing, in smaller or greater measure. This also merges after our death wit=
h
the omnipotent. Being, from whom we derive this energy. The stable princi=
ple
which is the cause of creation and destruction of all energy is God, ca=
lled
by any name.

Mother loves her child but later on, an unfaithful sun c=
auses her sorrow. We
know of cases where mother starts litigation against s=
ons or sons against
mother. If one loves another, and if one of them dies, =
the bereavement
causes sorrow. The bank helps people who have deposited mon=
ey with them. It
is supposed to remove the sorrows of the people in times o=
f need. But when
the bank itself is liquidated or closed, the depositors we=
ep. Their sorrows
once gave sustenance to the bank. The more we love, the g=
reater the sorrow
in consequence. Then, shall we decide that we should not =
love anyone at all?
The object of this birth is to bestow undivided love on=
 someone. The subject
of our love should not be quarrelsome or separable. I=
f we say that we should
love only the imperishable God, then the question i=
s: can we hate others?
Let us learn to love all be realising that God is in=
 all. God is eternal and
our love for him should be eternal.

I am prone to=
 come to the conclusion that there lives none without
predominantly selfish=
 motives. But with years rolling on, an impression,
that too a superficial =
one, true to my nature, is dawning upon me that there
breathe on this globe=
 some souls firmly rooted in morals and ethics who live
exclusively for oth=
ers, voluntarily forsaking not only their material gains
and comforts but a=
lso their own sadhana towards their spiritual
improvements.

It is clear to=
 us that there is birth and there is death. Passion is the
cause of birth. =
Time is the cause of death. What is created by passion is
destroyed by time=
. If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the
tree dies. Kaalo J=
agat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate
when time comes. If =
there is no passion, there is no production. If there is
no time then there=
 is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and
Kaama. Iswara bu=
rnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is
neither birth nor d=
eath for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father
and Mother.

"Jag=
atha pitarau Vande Paarvati Parameswarau"

A master has two servants. One a=
lways flatters the master, the other just
performs his duties without any l=
ove for the master. If the master is a
fool, he would love the flattering s=
ervant. If the master is too clever, he
will not love either the man workin=
g for wages or the flatterer. The master
will love more the one who does hi=
s job as his own out of devotion. So is
the case with the Good Master, God.=


Why do we break coconut before Lord Ganesa's idol? He is the Son of
Param=
eswara and asked His Father to sacrifice His head with three eyes
because o=
nly then, he thought any effort would be crowned with success and
without a=
ny obstacle. So, instead of the head with three eyes, we are
breaking cocon=
ut which has three eyes. Ganesa is so powerful as to demand
the head of his=
 own father. Whatever is superior to everything else must be
sacrificed to =
God. Symbolically, we are sacrificing the three - eyed
coconuts created by =
God, as ordained by Him. When a sannyasin attains
Siddhi, this is done. Thi=
s practice is in vogue only in Tamil Nadu.

Thinking that God is far away f=
rom you, you are wandering in search of Him.
So long as you do not know, He=
 is far away. Though you may wander, you
cannot see Him, but he is near you=
. He is distant, yet near. The story of a
girl wanting to marry the highest=
 among men, a king, ended, after all the
travels, in the discovery of an or=
dinary man her parents had already
selected. The bridegroom was so near. Sh=
e took a long route to arrive at a
point so near.

We see our reflections i=
n a mirror. In a row of mirrors, thousands of
reflections are seen. It is o=
nly one person who sees all these reflections.
The one who resides within u=
s and who sees all this, is God. The seer is the
cause of all the seen. Tha=
t cause is knowledge which is the basis of this
world. Where is that knowle=
dge? Within you, what is macroscopic is
microscopic in you.

Joy comes in t=
he form of status, money, etc. comes from without. We feel
isolated. But it=
 is the smallest fragment of the great joy from within,
which is Ananda. Pa=
ramatman, the ananda within is not worried whether any
joy comes from outsi=
de and mixes with it or not. Waters enter into the sea,
which though ever b=
eing full, is ever motionless.

If we analyse the teachings of the Gita, th=
ere may appear to be many
contradictory matters regarding bhakti, karma and=
 jnana. But the Lord takes
the devotee step by step. We must meditate on th=
e form of God as described
in the scriptures. This bhakti will enable us to=
 understand the universal
nature of God. Spiritual vision will then make it=
 clear that God without
form is the Supreme Reality, which hears without ea=
rs, moves without legs.
To worship God at the initial stage, metaphysical k=
nowledge is not
necessary. The more and more we meditate, bhakti grows and =
we automatically
realise the universal form. There is no distinction betwee=
n the devotee and
the object of devotion.

Our minds should automatically s=
eek and cling to God just as iron filings
are attracted by the magnet; the =
heart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;
the creeper embraces the tree; =
the rivers go to the sea.

Philosophical truths and ordinary people have no=
thing much in common.
Therefore outward garb is useless. The representative=
s of religion must have
real worth, peace - loving nature (shantam), auster=
ity (tapas) and unselfish
nature. Hinduism, in spite of its vicissitudes, i=
s surviving even to this
day. This is due to the blessings of a succession =
of saints. If there is one
saint among us, the world will prosper.

It is n=
atural that man should seek to satisfy his wants like hunger, thirst,
and a=
 place to rest. There are duties which an individual has towards
himself, t=
he social group and the nation. Ordinarily, the performance of
these duties=
 remains on the level of satisfying the creaturely wants. But
there is a wa=
y of performing these duties which will elevate everyone
concerned spiritua=
lly. That is dharma. And it is the duty of the king or the
state to see tha=
t the citizens are provided every opportunity for spiritual
growth and prog=
ress. That is the meaning of saying: "Raja Dharmasya
Kaaranam".

Upaasana i=
s dhyaana or concentration of meditation. A form is required for
concentrat=
ion. Reality is always the same and changeless. God, as the
Ultimate Realit=
y, is Formless. But Upasana of a Form is done with a purpose,
namely, the a=
ttainment of a given benefit. The purpose to be attained by
worshipping or =
concentrating on a Form differs. The scriptures tell you how
to meditate an=
d on what all Forms and with what results. For Upasana, you
have to follow =
the Sastras or Scriptures. The different upasanas are all
aids in the path =
to the ultimate goal, namely, understanding Reality.
Scriptures prescribe U=
paasana n order to train the mind to concentrate.
Upasana is the affair of =
the individual; there is nothing collective about
it.

Neither the raw frui=
t nor the tree wants to leave each other. But when the
fruit becomes ripe, =
this attachment automatically disappears. Man requires
to experience anger,=
 jealousy, passion, etc. just as the fruit had to
undergo various stages of=
 growth and taste before it became fully ripe so to
get automatically detac=
hed from the tree. We cannot overcome these
experiences in the beginning. B=
ut we must ponder over the fact why we
undergo these experiences. Otherwise=
 we will be the losers. We will become
slaves of these experiences and can =
never achieve fulfillment or
contentment.

When adversities overtake us, we=
 blame God and complain that He is blind to
our misfortunes. But if we indu=
lge in a little introspection, we will
realise that our faults are so enorm=
ous that we are utterly unworthy of His
grace and, in spite of that we are =
able to get food, shelter and clothing.
It is due to the abundant mercy of =
God. We must consider the difficulties we
encounter as a blessing in disgui=
se.

A mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick=
 up
and eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the
=
child. Similarly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire
=
picture of life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to
visuali=
se the past and the future, we complain when we suffer in the
present. A pr=
oper perspective will enable us to understand our present
plight in its pro=
per setting.

Whenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must re=
member the
divine source from which he derived the qualifications to receiv=
e that
honour, and feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - impo=
rtance.

Cultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;
Look at o=
thers as yourself;
Give up war; give up jealousy;
Don't commit aggression w=
ithout reason;
Mother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;
The Lord Go=
d is like father showering mercy
People of the World !
Live with discipline=
;
Live with charity;
Live with mercy;
May all people attain greater well - =
being

 asked His Father to sacrifice His head with three eyes because only then, =
he thought any effort would be crowned with success and without any obstacl=
e. So, instead of the head with three eyes, we are breaking coconut which h=
as three eyes. Ganesa is so powerful as to demand the head of his own fathe=
r. Whatever is superior to everything else must be sacrificed to God. Symbo=
lically, we are sacrificing the three - eyed coconuts created by God, as or=
dained by Him. When a sannyasin attains Siddhi, this is done. This practice=
 is in vogue only in Tamil Nadu.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thinking that G=
od is far away from you, you are wandering in search of Him. So long as you=
 do not know, He is far away. Though you may wander, you cannot see Him, bu=
t he is near you. He is distant, yet near. The story of a girl wanting to m=
arry the highest among men, a king, ended, after all the travels, in the di=
scovery of an ordinary man her parents had already selected. The bridegroom=
 was so near. She took a long route to arrive at a point so near.</div>

<d=
iv><br></div><div>We see our reflections in a mirror. In a row of mirrors, =
thousands of reflections are seen. It is only one person who sees all these=
 reflections. The one who resides within us and who sees all this, is God. =
The seer is the cause of all the seen. That cause is knowledge which is the=
 basis of this world. Where is that knowledge? Within you, what is macrosco=
pic is microscopic in you.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Joy comes in the form=
 of status, money, etc. comes from without. We feel isolated. But it is the=
 smallest fragment of the great joy from within, which is Ananda. Paramatma=
n, the ananda within is not worried whether any joy comes from outside and =
mixes with it or not. Waters enter into the sea, which though ever being fu=
ll, is ever motionless.</div>

<div><br></div><div>If we analyse the teachi=
ngs of the Gita, there may appear to be many contradictory matters regardin=
g bhakti, karma and jnana. But the Lord takes the devotee step by step. We =
must meditate on the form of God as described in the scriptures. This bhakt=
i will enable us to understand the universal nature of God. Spiritual visio=
n will then make it clear that God without form is the Supreme Reality, whi=
ch hears without ears, moves without legs. To worship God at the initial st=
age, metaphysical knowledge is not necessary. The more and more we meditate=
, bhakti grows and we automatically realise the universal form. There is no=
 distinction between the devotee and the object of devotion.</div>

<div><b=
r></div><div>Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as i=
ron filings are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks=
 her husband; the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.</div=
>

<div><br></div><div>Philosophical truths and ordinary people have nothin=
g much in common. Therefore outward garb is useless. The representatives of=
 religion must have real worth, peace - loving nature (shantam), austerity =
(tapas) and unselfish nature. Hinduism, in spite of its vicissitudes, is su=
rviving even to this day. This is due to the blessings of a succession of s=
aints. If there is one saint among us, the world will prosper.</div>

<div>=
<br></div><div>It is natural that man should seek to satisfy his wants like=
 hunger, thirst, and a place to rest. There are duties which an individual =
has towards himself, the social group and the nation. Ordinarily, the perfo=
rmance of these duties remains on the level of satisfying the creaturely wa=
nts. But there is a way of performing these duties which will elevate every=
one concerned spiritually. That is dharma. And it is the duty of the king o=
r the state to see that the citizens are provided every opportunity for spi=
ritual growth and progress. That is the meaning of saying: "Raja Dharm=
asya Kaaranam".</div>

<div><br></div><div>Upaasana is dhyaana or conc=
entration of meditation. A form is required for concentration. Reality is a=
lways the same and changeless. God, as the Ultimate Reality, is Formless. B=
ut Upasana of a Form is done with a purpose, namely, the attainment of a gi=
ven benefit. The purpose to be attained by worshipping or concentrating on =
a Form differs. The scriptures tell you how to meditate and on what all For=
ms and with what results. For Upasana, you have to follow the Sastras or Sc=
riptures. The different upasanas are all aids in the path to the ultimate g=
oal, namely, understanding Reality. Scriptures prescribe Upaasana n order t=
o train the mind to concentrate. Upasana is the affair of the individual; t=
here is nothing collective about it.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Neither the=
 raw fruit nor the tree wants to leave each other. But when the fruit becom=
es ripe, this attachment automatically disappears. Man requires to experien=
ce anger, jealousy, passion, etc. just as the fruit had to undergo various =
stages of growth and taste before it became fully ripe so to get automatica=
lly detached from the tree. We cannot overcome these experiences in the beg=
inning. But we must ponder over the fact why we undergo these experiences. =
Otherwise we will be the losers. We will become slaves of these experiences=
 and can never achieve fulfillment or contentment.</div>

<div><br></div><d=
iv>When adversities overtake us, we blame God and complain that He is blind=
 to our misfortunes. But if we indulge in a little introspection, we will r=
ealise that our faults are so enormous that we are utterly unworthy of His =
grace and, in spite of that we are able to get food, shelter and clothing. =
It is due to the abundant mercy of God. We must consider the difficulties w=
e encounter as a blessing in disguise.</div>

<div><br></div><div>A mother =
may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and eat mu=
d. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child. Similar=
ly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire picture of=
 life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the pas=
t and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper persp=
ective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper settin=
g.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Whenever any honour is done to a person the r=
ecipient must remember the divine source from which he derived the qualific=
ations to receive that honour, and feel humble and not elated with a feelin=
g of self - importance.</div>
