Ramana=E2=80=99s disappearance and his parting note were soon noticed.His f=
amily was
stunned. His mother Alagammal, who was living in Manamadurai, was=
 informed
and every effort was made to try and find him. But nobody, neithe=
r friends
nor neighbours, had any idea where he might be. People hoped for =
his return,
but in vain, as weeks and months went by without any news. Alag=
ammal=E2=80=99s
anguish increased and she beseeched both her brothers-in-la=
w, Subba and
Nelliappa Iyer, to try and find him. It was rumoured that Rama=
na had joined
a theatrical troupe performing religious dramas in Trivandrum=
. Nelliappa
Iyer twice went there to look for him among the various troupes=
, once
accompanied by Alagammal =E2=80=93 but without success.

Almost two =
years went by and people started to believe that they would never
see the l=
ost son again. On 1st May 1898 Subba Iyer died. Nelliappa Iyer and
the rest=
 of the family came to the funeral in Madurai. During the funeral a
young m=
an from Tiruchuli brought the unexpected news that he had met
Tambiran and =
had heard him talking about a young Swami, called Venkataraman,
who came fr=
om Tiruchuli. The Swami was a venerated saint in Tiruvannamalai
and was und=
oubtedly the person they were looking for.

Immediately after the funeral N=
elliappa Iyer and a friend started out for
Tiruvannamalai. There they learn=
ed that the young Swami was living in the
mango grove. However, when they w=
ent there they were prevented from entering
by the owner of the garden,who =
said that Ramana was a mauni, a silent saint,
and should not be disturbed. =
Nelliappa Iyer therefore wrote the following
message ona piece of paper for=
 his nephew, =E2=80=9CNelliappa Iyer, pleader of
Manamadurai,wishes to have=
 your darshan=E2=80=9D, and asked Naicker, to pass on the
message.

Ramana =
recognized his uncle=E2=80=99s handwriting. The piece of paper came from a
=
records office and had on the back some official entries in the handwriting=

of his older brother Nagaswami. From this he was able to conclude in
addit=
ion that Nagaswami had become an employee in a records office. He
agreed th=
at his uncle should enter.

Nelliappa Iyer argued and pleaded with all the =
eloquence of a lawyer. But
Ramana did not move and gave not the least sign =
of recognition.

The uncle finally had no alternative but to give up. He se=
nt Alagammal the
joyful news that he had found her son, but that he had cha=
nged a lot and
sadly would not return. Nelliappa Iyer himself returned to M=
anamadurai after
five days, unsuccessful in his mission.

About his two unc=
les, Nelliappa and Subba Iyer, Sri Ramana later remarked,
=E2=80=9CSubba Iy=
er had great courage and pride, but this man [Nelliappa] was very
meek and =
mild. If it had been Subba Iyer, he would never have gone back home
leaving=
 me here. He would have bundled me up and carried me away. As I am
destined=
 to stay here, my whereabouts were not known so long as he was
alive.Nellia=
ppa Iyer, being spiritually minded and mild in his ways, left me
here sayin=
g, =E2=80=98Why trouble him?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

Later, Nelliappa Iyer visit=
ed his nephew twice while he was living in the
Virupaksha cave. Ramana had =
by then started to give spoken answers to his
disciples=E2=80=99 questions =
and to interpret the holy Advaita scriptures. Once,
whilst he was in the mi=
dst of an explanation about the Dakshinamurti
Stotram, his uncle unexpected=
ly came to visit and was astounded by his
nephew=E2=80=99s erudition. From =
that day on Nelliappa knew that he need not trouble
himself anymore and ret=
urned home deeply satisfied. Soon afterwards he died.

A few months after N=
elliappa=E2=80=99s first visit, Sri Ramana left the mango grove
to live in =
a small temple in Arunagirinathar. He had decided that he should
no longer =
be dependent upon the care of others and that from now he would
look for hi=
s own daily meal. So he said to Palaniswami, =E2=80=9CYou go one way, beg
y=
our food and get on. Let me go another way, beg my food and get on. Let us
=
not live together.=E2=80=9D But Palaniswami, in the evening returned to the=

Arunagirinathar temple, saying, =E2=80=9CWhere can I go? You have the word=
s of
life.=E2=80=9D Now Ramana felt compassion for him and Palaniswami was =
allowed to
stay with him.

After they had spent about four weeks during Aug=
ust and September 1898
living in the small temple, they went to live for a =
week in the quiet upper
rooms of the towers of the Arunachaleswara temple a=
nd in the Alari garden,
one of the temple gardens. There Ramana was again t=
racked down by admirers.
He withdrew from them and went to Pavalakkunru, on=
e of the eastern foothills
of Arunachala where there was a Shiva temple, a =
cave and a spring.

He sat most of the time in samadhi in a tiny room in th=
e temple,which was so
small that it was impossible to stand upright. Severa=
l times, after
performing the puja, the priest forgot to see if the Swami w=
as sitting in
his room and inadvertently locked him in.His admirers also tr=
acked him down
in Pavalakkunru. Patiently they waited until he appeared fro=
m inside the
temple or the cave to have his darshan.

In the meantime Raman=
a had decided to look for his own food and used to go
into town to beg for =
his meals. About the first time he went begging he
said, =E2=80=9CThe first=
 day, when I begged from Gurukkal=E2=80=99s wife, I felt bashful
about it a=
s a result of habits of upbringing,but after that there was
absolutely no f=
eeling of abasement. I felt like a king and more than a king.
I have someti=
mes received stale gruel at some house and taken it without
salt or any oth=
er flavouring, in the open street, before great pandits
[scholars] and othe=
r important men who used to come and prostrate themselves
before me at the =
Ashram.=E2=80=9D

During the Christmas holidays of 1898 his mother came to =
visit him for the
first time, accompanied by her eldest son Nagaswami,who h=
ad a few days off
work. They had searched for him in the mango grove in vai=
n. Now they had
climbed up to Pavalakkunru.Ramana was laying on a rock in a=
 state of neglect
such that he was barely recognizable, clothed in a dirty =
scrap of a
loincloth only.Twenty-eight months had passed since his mother h=
ad last seen
him. Bitterly she complained about his neglected bodily condit=
ion and
implored him to come home with her, but he did not react.

Day afte=
r day they came up to see him, brought him sweets and entreated him
tireles=
sly, but all to no avail. Ramana remained silent.Alagammal tried
everything=
. One day when she broke down in tears, he was unable to bear it
any longer=
 and simply went away.

Once she despairingly turned to the others present =
and asked for their
support. Then one of them said to Ramana, =E2=80=9CYour=
 mother is weeping and
praying. Why do you not answer her? Whether it is =
=E2=80=98yes=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98no=E2=80=99, why not
give her a reply? Sw=
ami need not break his vow of silence. Here are pencil
and paper. Swami may=
 at least write out what he has to say.=E2=80=9D So Ramana wrote
down, =E2=
=80=9CThe Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their past=

deeds =E2=80=93 their prarabdhakarma. Whatever is destined not to happen w=
ill not
happen, - try how hard you may. Whatever is destined to happen will=
 happen,
do what you may to stop it. This is certain. The best course, ther=
efore, is
for one to be silent.=E2=80=9D

Whether this message convinced hi=
s deeply religious mother or not, there was
nothing left for her to do but =
to leave him to the life he had embarked
upon. Furthermore Nagaswami=E2=80=
=99s holidays were coming to an end and he had to
return to his office. Wit=
hout having achieved what they had set out to
achieve and with a heavy
hear=
t, they returned to Manamadurai.
