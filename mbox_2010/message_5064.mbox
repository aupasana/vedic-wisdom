I'm one of the co-editors of the book. Thanks for the messages of support.
=
There is a lot of work to be done in this area. For example, Wendy Doniger,=

who is the culprit behind a lot of negative misportrayals of Hindus and
Hi=
nduism (as described in the book) recently wrote a history of Hinduism
book=
 (though she admits she is not a historian) that she is aiming to have
be u=
sed as a standard textbook in Indian schools in the high school levels
(as =
stated in the introduction to the book). There have been some articles
and =
other reports written critiquing the book--for example, I wrote an
article =
in Outlook India refuting her claim that Rama threw out Sita because
he was=
 afraid of becoming a sex addict like his father, Dasaratha, etc.--but
ther=
e needs to be more of a coordinated movement not only to refute such
writin=
gs but to produce scholarly and objective descriptions of Hinduism
that can=
 replace the more bigoted / denigratory writings.

I am not really into pol=
itics, but I can tell you from having been born and
raised in America, that=
 the school envirionment (including at the very
liberal schools I attended)=
 is poisoned for learning about Hinduism. The
most frustrating thing for me=
 as a young girl wanting to learn about
Hinduism was the lack of resources-=
-I would go to the Hinduism shelf at the
library or bookstore only to find =
exposes on the "cult of the Hare Krishnas"
or trashy books on Tantric sex, =
or go read textbooks or other scholarly
books on Hinduism at school only to=
 be inundated with denouncements of caste
and mockeries of the Hindu panthe=
on as, at best, amusing mythology or, at
worst, as a mythology that reflect=
ed certain disturbing pathologies of the
Indic people.

Had I not the great=
 fortune of finding my guru and other true acharyas who
were able to provid=
e me a correct understanding of Hinduism, I may have
eventually given up my=
 search and lost out not only on knowing my heritage
but on finding the pat=
h of sadhana.

It is for this reason that I think this work is so important=
 and urgent.

More information on these issues in general is available at
w=
ww.invadingthesacred.com. I also have many extra copies of the book. If you=

or someone you know would be interested, please let me know and I can
arra=
nge to have copies shipped. We are trying to provide copies to temples
and =
local libraries so that it is there as a resource for those who are
interes=
ted.

Warm regards,
Aditi
