Subject: Homam on Sankranthi/Eclipse Questions

Namaste,
 
There were questions on what homam is the best to perform on the Sankranthi day and/or eclipse day. I suggest performing the same homam that one does every day or week (or every now and then). Pick one homam and do it whenever you can, including eclipses, Sankranthi days or any other special occasions. That is always the best strategy. If you do not know which one to do, I suggest Ganapathi homam for a few months before finding something else.
 
The eclipse times change from place to place, but there is an eclipse going on at some place or the other, from 4:05 am to 8:55 am (GMT) on 2010 January 15. That time is a good time for a homam. This is unfortunately an inconvenient time (midnight) in US, but a convenient time in Asia and Europe.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
