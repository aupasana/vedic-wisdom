Dear Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,
Namaste.

At the begining of the "Pitr=
i Tarpana" section it say..
"First place the water pot in front of you, bow=
 to it and say the following. This means, "may my ancestors come here and a=
ccept my water oblations".

Does bowing here means:
(1) Nodding the head wi=
th folded hands in the postrue we are or
(2) Touching the forehead to the g=
round.

I am asking this question becasue we are in a specific posture (e.g=
. left knee in contact with ground etc) and to touch the forehead to the gr=
ound we have to unlock our legs from the given posture.

What has happened =
a few times is that I unlocked the legs and touched my forehead to the grou=
nd - but then forgot to resume the correct posture (i.e. touching the left =
knee to the ground). I am training my self to follow the instructions corre=
ctly. Personally I'd like to bow down by touching foreahead to the ground, =
and then resume the posture. I hope it is OK either ways, and wish to confi=
rm whether *changing your posture* during Tarpana to Bow down is OK, PREFER=
RED or PROHIBITED. 

Please guide.
Reverently,
Mahesh
