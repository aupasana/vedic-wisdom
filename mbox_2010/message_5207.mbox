Namaste Ranjan-da,
 
Nice words! Simplicity and not trickery, surrender and=
 not mastery, humility and not technical perfection, is what one needs to s=
ucceed in spiritual sadhana.
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said, "you may =
serve a normal human being perfectly 99 times and fail once. He will forget=
 the 99 times you served well and only remember the one time you failed. Go=
d is different. You may fail to serve god well 99 times and serve him well =
only once. Still, he will remember that one time and be pleased with you."
=
 
If one's spiritual sadhana and remedies are not working, it is unlikely t=
o be due to technical imperfections. It is likely due to lack of a perfect =
surrender and humility.
 
If an over-confident and arrogant adult is lost i=
n a fair and running around frenetically, nobody would care. If an innocent=
 child is lost in a fair and looking for his parents while crying, everyone=
 will come forward to help and reunit the child with parents. In the fair o=
f this samsaara, be an innocent child lost and cry sincerely for the "paren=
ts". You are sure to get all the help you deserve and also find your "paren=
ts" quickly!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 badly needed. I am a strong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the =
ultimate answers to things not in our control. Thank you for sharing this s=
imple mantras with the readers; literally hundreds would benefit from this =
as they seek their solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on intern=
al strengths (of individuals) and become stronger to overcome difficulties.=

at we have a few simple mantras listed for the benefit of the members to ad=
dress the common issues people face, plus to appease the lords of the house=
s (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji=
 has listed some, but would be good to develop such list and make them avai=
lable in one place. I truly believe that would be more useful and powerful =
than prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with possible high degr=
