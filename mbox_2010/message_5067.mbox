  "For the fault of many, judge not the whole".
  It is these westerners, t=
hat have driven the engine of science and technology, and resisted the evil=
-beliefs and practices of all major religions.
  Without the European domin=
ation that overthrew all other kingdoms, the generation-X of most of the 3r=
d world countries would be a slave to a muslim living in dark age.
  Vedas =
are the original scriptures of Hinduism. Vedas have been thoroughly attacke=
d over and over again by the so-called Vedantis to propound their own ideol=
ogy including the line of Advaitins, Vaishnavas eulogized Vishnu, Shaivas e=
ulogized Shiva. What is left intact in Hinduism without recognizing the fou=
ndation that is Vedas, and without recognizing our weakness of Eulogizing h=
uman in name of divine ?
