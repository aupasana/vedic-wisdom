Once someone asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Even for one who walks on good path,
g=
ets all sorts of troubles and tribulations,why?"

Bhagavan Ramana replied:
=

"It is good that devotees get troubles and tribulations."Then He took out =
a
poem from Guhai Namasviaya and read out:

"The washerman smashes the clot=
hes on the stone slab vigorously.Why?Is it
for tearing the clothes?It is on=
ly for removing the dirt on the clothes.Like
that, God gives troubles to th=
e devotees only to purify their minds and not
to annihilate them."

He cont=
inued:"What we need is perseverance(Persistent determination) and
chitta su=
ddhi."

Talk 197

Devotee.: Being always Being-Consciousness-Bliss, why doe=
s God place us in
difficulties? Why did He create us?

Maharshi : Does God =
come and tell you that He has placed you in
difficulties? It is you who say=
 so. It is again the wrong =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. If that
disappears there wi=
ll be no one to say that God created this or that.
