The Imitation of Christ  (part 1)


THE IMITATION OF=
 CHRIST




THE FIRST BOOK



ADMONITIONS PROFITABLE FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE=


CHAPTER I

Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and a=
ll
its vanities

He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,(1) saith =
the
Lord.  These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far
we must=
 imitate His life and character, if we seek true
illumination, and delivera=
nce from all blindness of heart.  Let
it be our most earnest study, therefo=
re, to dwell upon the life
of Jesus Christ.

2. His teaching surpasseth all=
 teaching of holy men, and such as
have His Spirit find therein the hidden =
manna.(2)  But there are
many who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, =
yet feel but
little longing after it, because they have not the mind of
Chr=
ist.  He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom
understand the wo=
rds of Christ, let him strive to conform his
whole life to that mind of Chr=
ist.

3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion
concerning =
the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus
displeasing to the Tri=
nity?  For verily it is not deep words that
make a man holy and upright; it=
 is a good life which maketh a man
dear to God.  I had rather feel contriti=
on than be skilful in the
definition thereof.  If thou knewest the whole Bi=
ble, and the
sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit t=
hee
without the love and grace of God?  Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity, =
save to love God, and Him only to serve.  That is the
highest wisdom, to ca=
st the world behind us, and to reach forward
to the heavenly kingdom.

4. I=
t is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches
that shall peri=
sh.  It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to
lift up ourselves on high.=
  It is vanity to follow the desires of
the flesh and be led by them, for t=
his shall bring misery at the
last.  It is vanity to desire a long life, an=
d to have little
care for a good life.  It is vanity to take thought only f=
or the
life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which
shall=
 be hereafter.  It is vanity to love that which quickly
passeth away, and n=
ot to hasten where eternal joy abideth.

5. Be ofttimes mindful of the sayi=
ng,(3) The eye is not satisfied
with seeing, nor the ear with hearing.  Str=
ive, therefore, to
turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are=
 seen,
and to set it upon the things that are not seen.  For they who
follo=
w after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and
destroy the gra=
ce of God.

(1) John viii. 12.   (2) Revelations ii. 17.
(3) Ecclesiastes i=
. 8.

CHAPTER II

Of thinking humbly of oneself

There is naturally in ever=
y man a desire to know, but what
profiteth knowledge without the fear of Go=
d?  Better of a surety
is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud phi=
losopher who
watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.  H=
e
who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither
regardeth he t=
he praises of men.  If I knew all the things that
are in the world, and wer=
e not in charity, what should it help me
before God, who is to judge me acc=
ording to my deeds?

2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for there=
in is found
much distraction and deceit.  Those who have knowledge desire t=
o
appear learned, and to be called wise.  Many things there are to
know whi=
ch profiteth little or nothing to the soul.  And foolish
out of measure is =
he who attendeth upon other things rather than
those which serve to his sou=
l's health.  Many words satisfy not
the soul, but a good life refresheth th=
e mind, and a pure
conscience giveth great confidence towards God.

3. The =
greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely
shalt thou be ju=
dged, unless thou hast lived holily.  Therefore
be not lifted up by any ski=
ll or knowledge that thou hast; but
rather fear concerning the knowledge wh=
ich is given to thee.  If
it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things,=
 and
understandest them well, know also that there are many more
things whi=
ch thou knowest not.  Be not high-minded, but rather
confess thine ignoranc=
e.  Why desirest thou to lift thyself above
another, when there are found m=
any more learned and more skilled
in the Scripture than thou?  If thou wilt=
 know and learn anything
with profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be =
counted for
nothing.

4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, wh=
en a man
truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.  To account nothing
of=
 one's self, and to think always kindly and highly of others,
this is great=
 and perfect wisdom.  Even shouldest thou see thy
neighbor sin openly or gr=
ievously, yet thou oughtest not to
reckon thyself better than he, for thou =
knowest not how long
thou shalt keep thine integrity.  All of us are weak a=
nd frail;
hold thou no man more frail
