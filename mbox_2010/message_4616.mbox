 Swami Satyananda was one of the attendants of Sri Bhagavan during the last=

few years of His physical existence. He was with Sri Bhagavan at the time =
of
His Mahanirvana.

The following article has been extracted from the Janu=
ary 1973 issue of The
Mountain Path. It is a first person account of how th=
e Swami was drawn to
the Maharshi and his recollections of serving Sri Bhag=
avan.

I was born in 1916 in a village named Mavelikara in South Kerala. My=
 mother
who was of a pious disposition used to serve sadhus and was happy t=
o help
them in various ways. Her piety made me turn to the spiritual path w=
hen I
was only eighteen but home I left later. Meanwhile I ran a small scho=
ol for
children on the verandah of our house.

After four years I went on a=
 pilgrimage to Rameswaram in the company of some
sadhus. In the course of m=
y pilgrimage I halted at an abode of sadhus called
Pandikkan Mazhi Matham s=
ituated between Madurai and Manamadurai. This matham
was managed by one Nar=
ayanaswami who had stayed at Sri Ramanasramam for some
time. He was the fir=
st person who spoke to me about Sri Bhagavan and His
greatness. He wrote ou=
t the full
address of Sri Ramanasramam on a piece of paper and gave it to m=
e.

>From Rameswaram I came directly to Tiruvannamalai. This was in 1938. I =
was
overcome with joy when I saw Arunachala. After spending a few days at t=
he
Virupaksha Cave I came down one day to Sri Ramanasramam in the company o=
f a
sadhu. When we arrived Sri Bhagavan had just returned from His afternoo=
n
walk and was sitting in the hall alone. He looked at us and smiled. I can=

never forget that smile. After sitting in His presence for some time I
ret=
urned to the cave. Thereafter I used to visit the Ashram daily and have
dar=
shan of Sri Bhagavan. I changed my abode from the Virupaksha Cave to the
Ma=
ngo tree Cave,Skandaramam, etc., from time to time and spent seven years
in=
 this manner, begging my food in the town.

I then obtained, by Sri Bhagava=
n=E2=80=99s Grace, the good fortune of serving Him as
His personal attendan=
t from 1946 till His final Nirvana on 14th April
1950.One day Sri Bhagavan =
described to me how one Sadguru Swami from Kerala,
under the influence of s=
ome intoxicating drug, kept on embracing Him tightly
saying, =E2=80=9CYou a=
re a good boy. It is a pleasure to see you.=E2=80=9D Sri Bhagavan
acted the=
 part of the sadhu in His inimitable way while narrating the
incident. I wa=
s alone with Him at the time and still remember the scene with
joy!

I was =
present when the tumour on Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s arm was operated upon in
=
1949. Although I cannot stand the sight of blood I managed somehow to
contr=
ol myself. On the evening of the 14th of April 1950 we were massaging
Sri B=
hagavan=E2=80=99s body. At about 5 o=E2=80=99clock He asked us to help Him =
sit
up.Precisely at that moment devotees started singing Arunachala
Siva=E2=
=80=94Arunachala Siva. When Sri Bhagavan heard this His face lit up with
ra=
diant joy.Tears began to flow from His eyes and continued to flow for a
lon=
g time. I was wiping them from time to time. I was also giving Him
spoonful=
s of water boiled with ginger. The doctor wanted to administer
artificial r=
espiration but Sri Bhagavan waved it away. He also wanted to
give some frui=
t juice so I begged Sri Bhagavan to agree to this and when He
graciously co=
nsented the doctor gave it to Him. Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s breathing
became =
gradually slower and slower and exactly at 8.47 p.m.subsided
quietly. At th=
at very moment, as is well known, devotees who were outside
saw a big,brigh=
t meteor in the sky.

I observed silence from 1950 to 1963. I have all thes=
e years been feeding
the peacocks, monkeys and squirrels, a job that was al=
ways pleasing to Sri
Bhagavan. I also look after the room in which Sri Bhag=
avan attained Nirvana.
I wish to end my life doing this service.

Sri Swami=
 Satyananda was absorbed in Arunachala on the evening of
Monday,27th Novemb=
er 1989.
