 have no idea but I read somewhere that patal loka is near Latin America ex=
.Mexico,Argentina etc.
About sea/island and sweet water I have one ready ma=
de example for you,I have seen few places where I live where one can dig a =
small well just few feets deep=C2=A0near the sea coast and find very sweet =
water and when tide comes the distance between this well and sea is hardly =
few feets but still one can find very sweet water in these wells during tid=
es,they are spread in a line with an area about 100 kms going north to sout=
h and around this coast line there is an old civilization burried under the=
 soil and many people find broken vessels in this area.Search is going on t=
o find more info on this old civilization and incidently there is an old fa=
ult line of earthquake near this area !
Namaste and all the best.

Hard work can do wonders 





In Indian culture vairaagyam was always g=
iven ultimate importance. But careful, there is a very thin line that separ=
ates vairaagyam and laziness. In vairaagyam all karma is done but without e=
xpecting anything in return, without being involved in the materialistic as=
pects of karma. Bhagiratha, with his unparalleled effort to bring Ganga to =
earth, showed us how much effort a man can put in and as a result what wond=
ers can be done.

On knowing that his ancestors (60000 Sagara Kumaras) will=
 reach swarga only if the pure waters of Ganga flow through their ashes, fr=
om his mother, Bhagiratha immediately leaves to Himalayas to do tapas for L=
ord Brahma:

After purifying himself in a pushkarini, it starts tapas with =
extra-ordinary concentration. Starts with padmaasana and in winter stood in=
 the freezing waters of the lake with water up to chest! In Summer stands i=
n the middle of burning pancha-agnis (four agnis + sun) and steadily stared=
 at the sun with eyes wide open (all the while concentrating on Brahma deva=
)!!

During the first few days, he had food only once a day. Later it was o=
nce in a few days. Then it became once in a month. After that, he just used=
 to drink a little water and continue his `Tapas'. Finally the air was his =
only food!!! 1000 years passed=E2=80=A6.!!!!

Brahma, the creator of the wo=
rlds, on the requests of Gods to save them from the tremendous tapaagni of =
Bhagiratha, appears before him and blesses him with children and Ganga. How=
ever, Brahma deva suggests that none except Parama Shiva can take the force=
 when Ganga falls onto earth, and if not with that force earth will be wash=
ed away=E2=80=A6

Men are of three kinds:

There are cowards, who do not be=
gin their work at all, afraid that some trouble may arise midway. Those who=
 begin but later give up the task, afraid of the difficulties that arise. B=
rave people who belong to a third group. They continue to work in spite of =
even an army of difficulties, and finally achieve the goal.

Bhagiratha bel=
onged to this third category of brave men. He again began a severe `Tapas' =
to please Lord Ishwara. With folded hands, and standing on one leg, he medi=
tated on Lord Iswara with the deepest concentration. So a whole year passed=
. Pleased with Bhagiratha's devotion Lord ishwara takes the immense force o=
f Ganga and controls her in his jataajutam. He completely stops her from fl=
owing to teach her a lesson (she was a mischievous girl, proud of her stren=
gth!), but for Bhagiratha it was another difficulty=E2=80=A6 But he again w=
ith tapas pleases Lord Shiva to release Ganga down to earth. Ganga followed=
 Bhagiratha shyly and slowly, like his daughter (Bhaagirathi). But she grew=
 a little mischievous, though Shiva taught her a lesson once, when near Jah=
nu maharshi's ashram. She wandered all over the Ashrama like a small girl a=
nd the entire place was filled with water. Disturbed from tapas by it, Jahn=
u maharshi in a single gulp swallows her entirely. And
 suddenly difficulti=
es again for Bhagiratha. But it is not the first time for him, so immediate=
ly pleases Jahnu maharshi (Jaahnavi comes out of Jahnu maharshi's ear) and =
finally sends his ancestors to higher worlds=E2=80=A6..

Morals in the stor=
y: 

1.Karma must be done in massive quantity as Bhagiratha did, but selfle=
ssly=E2=80=A6

2. Brave people continue to work in spite of even an army of=
 difficulties, and finally achieve their goal.

3. Man can achieve wonders,=
 once he puts in effort and dedication=E2=80=A6.

4 One must never be proud=
 of one's strength or other qualities. Else you will be humiliated when you=
 meet a greater person. (Shiva taught the naughty kid, Ganga, a lesson by c=
ontrolling her unparralled strength & force, with great ease=E2=80=A6.)
