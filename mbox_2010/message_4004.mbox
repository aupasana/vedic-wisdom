 THOSE who have realized the Self remain uninvolved,even when they are
enga=
ged in everyday activities.They are always in a state of utter
stillness. B=
hagavan himself has described this in the thirtieth verse of the
Supplement=
 to Reality in Forty Verses.

=E2=80=9CThe mind that is devoid of attachmen=
ts, though it may appear to be engaged
in activity, is in reality inactive =
=E2=80=94 just as the mind of a person listening
to a story might wander of=
f to a faraway place.=E2=80=9D

Once, in the Jubilee Hall, we were all list=
ening to the radio. At the end of
the program the names of all the artists =
were announced.Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CSee!
The radio sings and gives speec=
hes. It even announces the names of the
performers. But there is nobody ins=
ide the radio. Our existence is also like
that. The body might appear to wa=
lk and talk and perform a number of
functions, but in fact there is no indi=
vidual inside the body. Everything is
God.He alone exists.=E2=80=9D Bhagava=
n continued, =E2=80=9CThe concepts of time and space
are also imaginary. Wh=
en we listen to a concert on the radio are we bothered
about the exact time=
 and location at which the concert took place? What
difference can it make =
to our enjoyment of the music? Whether the concert
took place in Hyderabad =
or in Madras, we can listen to the music and derive
the same degree of enjo=
yment sitting right here in this hall.

The wise one does not attach any im=
portance to concepts of space and time.
One has to go through certain situa=
tions in a given lifetime and for this a
body is required.That is the only =
reason for acquiring a body. One goes
through various experiences, without =
getting involved in anything. To an
ordinary person, worldly experiences
se=
em real.An ordinary man might think that a liberated person has all the
exp=
eriences that others have. But the liberated person has no attachment to
th=
e body and therefore physical experiences hold no significance for him.

Th=
e jivanmukta has the same attitude towards his body that a railway porter
h=
as for the luggage he carries.Just as the porter carries the luggage up to
=
the destination and lays it down at that spot, the jivanmukta carries the
b=
ody through the pre-ordained experiences of a lifetime and at the end of
th=
e course he lays down the burden with relief. The porter thinks of the
load=
 on his head only as a burden; he does not identify with it on a
personal l=
evel. That is why he feels no regret when he puts it down. It is
the same i=
n the case of a jivanmukta. As he never thinks of the body as
having any pe=
rsonal significance, he feels no sorrow when the time comes for
him to leav=
e the body.=E2=80=9D

During the last days of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s earthly li=
fe, when his devotees besought
him to retain the human form for a long time=
, Bhagavan used to say, =E2=80=9CA jnani
(a realised soul) knows that the s=
ole purpose of acquiring a body is to
enable the spirit to attain knowledge=
 through experiences.Do we feel sad
because we have to throw away the used =
leaf-plate after a meal? In the same
way, a jnani discards the human body w=
ithout any regret or sorrow.=E2=80=9D
