Devotee: =E2=80=9CThe illumination plus mind is jivatma and the i=
llumination alone
is paramatma; is that right?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan assented =
and then pointed to his towel and said,

=E2=80=9CWe call this a white clot=
h, but the cloth and its whiteness cannot be
separated, and it is the same =
with the illumination and the mind that unite
to form the ego.=E2=80=9D

Th=
e lamp in the theatre is the Parabrahman or the illumination, as you put
it=
. It illumines itself and the stage and actors. We see the stage and the
ac=
tors by its light, but its light still continues when there is no more
play=
.

Another illustration is an iron rod that is compared to the mind. Fire j=
oins
it and it becomes red-hot. It glows and can burn things,like fire, but=
 still
it has a definite shape, unlike fire. If we hammer it, it is the rod=
 that
receives the blows, not the fire.The rod is the jivatma and the fire =
the
Self or Paramatma.=E2=80=9D
