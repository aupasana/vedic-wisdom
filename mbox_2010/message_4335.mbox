Dear Veneet,

 That is a very interesting bit of inf=
ormation. I do not have the JHora software with me now at work. Can you ple=
ase tell what tithi,nakshatra etc you get when you subtract 3 months?.

If =
possible can you please provide the original sanskrit verse also, This will=
 help us to validate the translation from sanskrit literates.

Warm Regards=
,
Sanjay P
