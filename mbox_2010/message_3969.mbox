 29th May, 1938

Talk 495.

A Cochin Brahmin, Professor in the Ernakulam Co=
llege, had an interesting
conversation with Sri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan advi=
sed surrender to God.

The visitor gave a glimpse of an ICS Officer. The ge=
ntleman while a student
was an atheist or an agnostic. He is very pious now=
 and the change has
surprised everyone who had known him before.

In furthe=
r conversation, the following points were noteworthy.

The visitor said: =
=E2=80=9COne must become satiate with the fulfilment of desires
before they=
 are renounced.=E2=80=9D

Sri Bhagavan smiled and cut in: =E2=80=9CFire mig=
ht as well be put out by pouring
spirit over the flames.(All laugh). The mo=
re the desires are fulfilled, the
deeper grows the samskara. They must beco=
me weaker before they cease to
assert themselves. That weakness is brought =
about by restraining oneself and
not by losing oneself in desires.

D.: How=
 can they be rendered weaker?

M.: By knowledge.You know that you are not t=
he mind. The desires are in the
mind. Such knowledge helps one to control t=
hem.

D.: But they are not controlled in our practical lives.

M.: Every ti=
me you attempt satisfaction of a desire the knowledge comes that
it is bett=
er to desist. Repeated reminders of this kind will in due course
weaken the=
 desires. What is your true nature? How can you ever forget
it? Waking,
dre=
am and sleep are mere phases of the mind. They are not of the Self. You
are=
 the witness of these states. Your true nature is found in sleep.

D.: How =
can I do my duties without attachment? There is my wife,there are my
childr=
en. I must do my duty towards them. Affection is necessary. Am I
right?

M.=
: How do you do your work in the College?

D.: (laughing) For wages.

M.: N=
ot because you are attached, simply as doing your duty.

D.: But my pupils =
expect me to love them.

M.: =E2=80=9CDetachment in the interior and attach=
ment in appearance,=E2=80=9D says Yoga
Vasishta.
