 ON August 29, 1896, Venkataraman (later Sri Bhagavan) left Madurai for
Tir=
uvannamalai. One week later,Munagala S. Venkataramiah, later known as
Raman=
ananda Saraswati, went home from Madurai to Sholavandan and told his
mother=
 that a brahmin boy who was studying in Madurai at an adjoining school
had =
run away from home. At that time he little realised that he was to meet
thi=
s runaway boy later in 1918 at Skandasramam and that he was to become his
d=
isciple, live in close proximity of Sri Bhagavan from 1933 to 1950, and be
=
the compiler of Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi.

S.V. Ramanathan and M. V. =
Krishnan, sons of Munagala S. Venkataramiah came
to the Ashram with their p=
arents in the summer of 1930. They were just
thirteen and ten years of age.=
One morning they were standing near the old
dining hall (where now Sri Bhag=
avan=E2=80=99s samadhi stands) when Ramu, the elder
brother,remarked that f=
or the last few days no onion sambar had been tasted
by them. At that preci=
se moment Sri Bhagavan was passing by the boys, as he
was returning from th=
e kitchen. He smiled and asked Ramu: =E2=80=9CSo, you want
vengaaya (onion)=
 sambar!=E2=80=9D The boys blushed and kept quiet. Next morning, the
boys w=
ere served with vengaaya sambar. Everybody thought it was onion
sambar.Sri =
Bhagavan later in the day asked Ramu how he relished the sambar
to which he=
 replied: =E2=80=9CVery well.=E2=80=9D

Ramu, however, was surprised to kno=
w the truth only a few days later when
his mother told him that what he ate=
 was not onion but garlic sambar! There
was no onion at that time in the As=
hram and yet Sri Bhagavan wanted to
fulfil the boy=E2=80=99s wish. Through =
his expert culinary knowledge, he brought the
smell and taste of onion to g=
arlic itself!


IN THE 1930s, Dr. T. N. Krishnaswamy wanted to visit the As=
hram and be with
Sri Bhagavan during the weekend. He asked a friend to acco=
mpany him. This
friend at that time did not even put on his shirt. He was i=
n his dhoti and
upper cloth and had two
or three rupees in his purse. He re=
adily agreed to go then and there. Both
travelled up to Katpadi by train, t=
ook a bus to Vellore and changed onto
another bus for Tiruvannamalai. In Ve=
llore the friend wanted to take
something to Sri Bhagavan. On the roadside =
he saw a woman selling kovai kai.
He bought the lot for a few annas. It was=
 about one viss, or 1=C2=BD kg in
weight. Since he had no bag to carry the =
vegetable, he bundled them at one
end of his upper cloth. Both of them reac=
hed Tiruvannamalai in the evening.
The vegetable bundle was put in front of=
 Sri Bhagavan when both the devotees
paid their respects. On an enquiry fro=
m Sri Bhagavan, the bundle was opened.
Sri Bhagavan saw the contents and sa=
id that if kovai kai was cooked with
brinjals it
would be tasty. The next m=
orning a devotee arriving from Madras through
Villupuram brought brinjals! =
The curry was cooked in the morning and all of
them relished it.

IN 1937, =
AN elderly American came along with a group to visit Sri Bhagavan.
The tren=
d of the discussion was that the five senses were to be put under
check. Si=
nce the old American was deaf he could not follow the discussions.
Sri Bhag=
avan remarked that the American needed to control only four senses
as the f=
ifth (hearing) was already under check. Someone in the Hall
explained this =
to the American and he beamed with joy.

MUNAGALA V. KRISHNAN went to Delhi=
 in December,1940, in search of a job. He
could not secure a job up to the =
end of February, 1941. So he wrote to his
father Sri Venkataramiah saying t=
hat he had to return to the south as no job
was available. This letter was =
shown to Sri Bhagavan who went through it and
said: =E2=80=9CLet him stay o=
n in Delhi.=E2=80=9D In March he got a job. From then V.
Krishnan prospered=
 very well.

AFTER SRI BHAGAVAN moved down and settled near the Mother=E2=
=80=99s samadhi there
was only a thatched roof over the samadhi and an adjo=
ining hut. Some
devotees decided to build
a more solid hall. So bricks and =
building material were gathered.The bricks
were carried to the site by the =
devotees. Sri Bhagavan also wanted to work
but the devotees would not permi=
t him.One moonlit night, when all were
asleep, a devotee woke up and found =
that Sri Bhagavan was missing. He woke
up the others and they all began to =
search for him. They found Sri Bhagavan
taking part in bringing bricks to t=
he site from a kiln opposite the Ashram.

IN THE EARLY 1920s there was a bi=
g mango tree near Palitirtham. Chinna Swami
was also in the Ashram, althoug=
h he had not yet taken charge of the
management. Dandapani Swami, a huge fi=
gure, was another Ashram inmate.
Chinna Swami and Dandapani Swami did not l=
ike each other. One night
Dandapani Swami wanted to settle scores with Chin=
na Swami, so he seized
Chinna Swami to crush him. Bhagavan appeared on the =
scene and slapped the
back of Dandapani Swami, who immediately put Chinna S=
wami down. No words
were spoken and each retired to his place of rest. Late=
r Dandapani Swami
described the slap as =E2=80=98terrific=E2=80=99.
