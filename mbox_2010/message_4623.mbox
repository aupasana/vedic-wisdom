 In 1937, T. S. Anantha Murthy visited Sri Ramanasramam for ten days. He
ga=
ve a detailed account of this visit in his book the Life and Teachings of
S=
ree Ramana Maharshi. With this issue we conclude his story related in
chapt=
er sixteen, titled "Sree Ramana Bestows His Grace on the Present
Biographer=
 in 1937."

There were more guests than on the previous night. Some were wo=
men. Among
men, some were Christians. One Mussalman guest was also sitting =
along with
us. Some were foreigners. All castes of Hindus were represented =
in that
dining room. Sri Ramana's habits were cosmopolitan.Cooks and server=
s were,
however, all brahmins.Among cooks, there was a woman cook also. All=
 were old
devotees of the sage and they had volunteered to serve in the ash=
ram by way
of spiritual sadhana. Sri Ramana was seated on the raised platfo=
rm and a
leaf was spread in front of him.

During morning hours, there was =
no restriction of women's movements in the
ashram. When all the guests were=
 seated, the servers began to serve the
midday meal. Echammal, a woman devo=
tee of the sage, had brought cooked rice
from her house in a vessel. She se=
rved a handful of it on Sri Ramana's leaf.
She then served small quantities=
 of it to the other guests of the day. She
had been permitted to perform th=
is kind of service, and I learnt that she
had been doing so for many years.=
 Her ancient story was ascertained by
questioning some of the attendants of=
 the ashram. She was old in years. She
was dignified and quiet and did not =
speak with anyone. After rendering this
kind of service, she went back to t=
he town to take her own meal.

Though there was complete informality in the=
 dining room, every guest ate
food respectfully, looking at Sri Ramana at f=
requent intervals. Some of the
guests were orthodox brahmins. They did not =
like to mingle with the
non-brahmin guests. So they were made to sit in an =
adjacent room and the
same articles of food were served to them by the same=
 servers. The midday
meal too was simple. It consisted of rice, pickles, ve=
getable curry,
chutney, sambar, and buttermilk. The meal was finished in fi=
fteen minutes.
Sri Ramana stood up after he had finished the meal and walke=
d out into the
courtyard and washed his hands and feet and then went into t=
he hall and
reclined on the sofa for rest. His attendants closed the doors =
and asked
visitors not to cause any disturbance.

At about 9.00 a.m. on the=
 next morning, I was sitting in the hall of the
ashram a few yards in front=
 of Sri Ramana, who was seated in samadhi state
on the sofa. Many men and w=
omen devotees were also sitting on the floor with
their eyes closed. Perfec=
t silence prevailed. We were all watching the sage,
who was effortlessly si=
tting absorbed in the Self. To watch him was itself a
great inspiration. An=
 old brahmin pundit, who was till then sitting with his
eyes shut, stood up=
 and walked one or two steps forward and stood near Sri
Ramana's sofa. This=
 pundit was clad in silk upper anga-vastram and a dhoti
beneath his waist. =
He wore two diamond rings on two of his fingers of the
left hand. He had di=
amond-set earrings also. His tall forehead was marked by
vibhuti stripes. T=
here was also a big kumkum mark between his two eyebrows.
He was a well bui=
lt old man. He loudly addressed Sri Ramana in Telugu and
spoke with a stent=
orian voice. He said, "Swamiji, many men and women are now
sitting before y=
ou in order to get some instruction. You do not speak even
one word. They t=
oo do not put any questions to you. They are all silently
sitting to learn =
something. What are you teaching them? What are they
learning from you? Ple=
ase explain this secret to me."

Sri Ramana did not stir. He did not open h=
is eyes or make any gesture to
indicate that he had heard the loud words ut=
tered by the old pundit. All of
us were eager to listen to any answer that =
the great sage might give. The
questioner stood for five minutes hoping tha=
t the sage would give a reply.
However, the sage continued to sit with his =
eyes closed as before. The old
pundit started to speak again and said in Te=
lugu as follows: "My two
questions have not been answered by you, Swamiji. =
I too cannot discover the
answers. Please explain the matter by word of mou=
th." After having thus
spoken, he continued to stand. Sri Ramana then opene=
d his bright eyes and
looked at the old pundit and replied in Telugu as fol=
lows: "What are you
asking me? Is there any one here to teach others?" Unab=
le to give an answer
to the questions put by the sage himself, the Telugu p=
undit said again as
follows: "If it is so, why are so many men and women si=
tting patiently in
front of you? What profit do they derive by sitting in t=
his hall?"

Sri Ramana, with a slight smile on his serene face, gave the fo=
llowing
instructive reply. He said in Telugu, "The question must be put the=
re. Why
are you putting that question here?" When he used the adverb there,=
 the sage
stretched his hand towards the assembled devotees. When he used t=
he other
adverb here, he turned his hand towards himself. Such were his sug=
gestive
gestures and answers. From the words and gestures of Sri Ramana, I =
realized
a profound secret. Other devotees assembled in the hall must have =
also
realized the same thing. That was this: Sri Ramana had no notion or id=
ea
that he was a teacher or a Guru. Likewise, he had no notion or idea that=
 the
men and women sitting in the hall were ignorant and that they needed
e=
nlightenment. From the great sage's point of view, every one in the hall
wa=
s Brahman or Atman. His drishti was that of a knower of Brahman. Knowers
of=
 Brahman have Brahman drishti.

Once answering to one devotee question Sri =
Ramana replied as follows: "Yes,
everything is Brahman. Every vritti of the=
 mind including grief or sorrow is
Brahman. Every kind of strength, includi=
ng physical strength, will be
obtained by a person when he realizes his Atm=
an."

The last day of my sojourn at Ramanasramam arrived. On that morning, =
I took
my breakfast sitting in front of Sri Ramana in the same dining room.=
 Many
other guests were also present. Some of them were newcomers. The usua=
l
breakfast of iddli and sambar and hot coffee was finished in ten minutes.=

Sri Ramana sipped the coffee slowly after reducing its temperature. On tha=
t
morning, one or two fried vadais were also served by the attendants. I
im=
agined that fried vadais were indigestible and so I told Sri Ramana that I
=
was afraid to eat vadai. That was the first occasion when I had the courage=

to talk to him in the dining room. The sage looked at me with his
delightf=
ully pleasing eyes and said, "You will digest it. You may eat." Then
my fea=
rs fled away and I ate the vadais without suffering any indigestion.

After=
 the breakfast was finished, I purchased a photo of Sri Ramana from the
boo=
kstall of the ashram. I desired to get it from the hands of the sage
himsel=
f. Carrying it in my hands I went into the hall and prostrated to Sri
Raman=
a, who was seated in jagrat state. There was no one else in the hall on
tha=
t occasion. That was a surprise to me. I told him that I had purchased
his =
photo and that I desired to receive it from his hands. Having said so, I
ga=
ve the photo to him. He graciously stretched his hands and took it from me
=
and looked at it for half a minute without saying any word by word of mouth=
.
He was pleased to give it back to me. I received it with great satisfacti=
on.
