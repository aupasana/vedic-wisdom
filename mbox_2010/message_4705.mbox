 Talk 68

D.: Is there knowledge in Realisation?

M.: Absence of knowledge =
is sleep. There is knowledge in Realisation.But
this knowledge differs from=
 the ordinary one of the relation of subject and
object. It is absolute kno=
wledge. Knowledge has two meanings:

(1) vachyartha =3D vritti =3D Literal =
meaning.
(2) lakshyartha =3D Jnana =3D Self =3D Swarupa =3D Secondary signi=
ficance.

D.: With vritti one sees knowledge.

M.: Quite so, he also confou=
nds vritti with knowledge. Vritti is a mode of
mind. You are not the mind. =
You are beyond it.

Later Sri Bhagavan explained: Vritti is often mistaken =
for consciousness. It
is only a phenomenon(Any state or process known throu=
gh the senses) and
operates in the region of abhasa (reflected consciousnes=
s).

The knowledge lies beyond relative knowledge and ignorance. It is not =
in the
shape of vritti.There are no subject and object in it.

Vritti belon=
gs to the rajasic (active) mind. The satvic mind (mind is repose
i.e The ab=
sence of mental stress or anxiety) is free from it. The satvic is
the witne=
ss of the rajasic. It is no doubt true consciousness.

Still it is called s=
atvic mind because the knowledge of being witness is the
function of abhasa=
 (reflected consciousness) only. Mind is the abhasa. Such
knowledge implies=

mind. But the mind is by itself inoperative. Therefore it is called satvic=

mind.

The satvic mind is in fact the Absolute consciousness. The object t=
o be
witnessed and the witness finally merge together and Absolute consciou=
sness
alone reigns supreme. It is not a state of sunya (blank) or ignorance=
.

It is the swarupa (Real Self).Some say that mind arises from consciousne=
ss
followed by reflection (abhasa);others say that the abhasa (reflection)
=
arises first followed by the mind. In fact both are simultaneous.
