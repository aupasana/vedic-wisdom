By Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya

"The rishi phenomenon is an instance of a human being =
who, through the allied processes of yoga, tapas (vows of austerity), sadha=
nas (systematic spiritual disciplines), intense meditation (dhyana), and ot=
her esoteric means of systematic self-purification, has achieved absolute t=
ranscendence over the non-atman (non-spiritual) aspects of herself. Having =
gained complete control over the body, mind, speech and senses, the rishi b=
ecomes transformed into a being who is thoroughly absorbed in the spiritual=
 reality. Being thus absorbed,
she has a direct and unmediated experiential=
 connection with the truth. In the terminology of Yoga philosophy, such a s=
tate is known as samadhi, or perfect meditative absorption...."
