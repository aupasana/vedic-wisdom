Dear Sri.Utpalji,
=C2=A0
I am extremely sorry and sincerely apologize if I =
have conveyed an impression that I am personally attacking Narasimhaji. I m=
erely reproduced his own words.
=C2=A0
Narasimhaji is a person I adore and =
respect as an astrolger for years together and nobody can underestimate his=
 scholarship in that field and jHora is not only his personal achievement b=
ut of the whole astrological fraternity.
=C2=A0
Narasimhaji, once again I a=
pologize if I have offended you.
=C2=A0
Each of us should own up to the res=
ponsibility of testing the validity and correctness of any knowledge before=
 handing it out to others. You come back after a few years and say " I was =
all wrong" is it good ? Every word coming out of a person of the stature of=
 Narasimhaji weighs in tons and he only has to take note and care of it.
=
=C2=A0
While as you said you can easily justify this "shift", what about al=
l those who learned these teachings from him and tried putting it to practi=
ce. What about all those failed predictions and guidances =C2=A0based on Na=
rayana dasa etc.?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
God bless you.

Namaste Sindh=
u ji,

In your message which was describing an interesting arguments with n=

[
The apprehension is=
 that in the year 2000 you said,
"I cannot possibly finish this preface wit=
hout expressing my deep gratitude for my

and now you say

"In my well-considered view, S=
anjay ji got some specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may b=
e imperfect, like with ......
]

With the above, you created enough doubt a=
bout your intentions because you went on Personal attack on Narasimha strai=
ght away without any provocations. His Astrological differences and opinion=
s are something totally-off the subject which concerns Homam issues. 

I ca=
n easily answer the above point which indicates the shift of Narasimha's op=
inion on one of his jyotish Gurus teachnigs. but Narasimha may not approve =
of it so it is best left to him.

Best Regards,

Utpal

to be
 absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa=

 by desa-kaala-paatra?<BR>> <BR>> Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celeb=
rated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a=
 different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is th=
at Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative t=
ruths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That=
 is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything th=
at is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the=
 divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=
=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and de=
sires.<BR>> <BR>> Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam<BR>> <BR>=
> Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and s=
o aagamic/tantric yagya ritual
 is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in per=
spective using a metaphor.<BR>> <BR>> Once there were many people who=
 lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the=
 sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They des=
cribed the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].<BR>> <BR>> As peopl=
e started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], som=
eone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said=
, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew with time. People f=
aithfully followed the instructions [rituals].<BR>> <BR>> People star=
ted moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked de=
sert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water =
like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walki=
ng towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one h=
ad to walk one mile or
 two miles or three miles and formed different schoo=
ls of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buildin=
g or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!<B=
R>> <BR>> Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to tak=
e a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other =
tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instr=
uctions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and=
 tantra].<BR>> <BR>> People performing the old rituals objected to th=
is and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. T=
his is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic rit=
ual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the =
original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taug=
ht the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully =
unaware that the
 original instructions were meant for someone already clos=
e to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the =
sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from ther=
e!<BR>> <BR>> Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, =
chariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instea=
d of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tant=
ra/yantras].<BR>> <BR>> One particular path through jungles was dange=
rous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, =
wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle,=
 it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it=
. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ri=
tual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A w=
ise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that pat=
h and
 discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people wh=
o were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.=
<BR>> <BR>> As time progressed, people started fighting too much abou=
t whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the=
 original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-c=
alled "new" path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed=
 times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not =
reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual go=
al of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow th=
e instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geo=
graphical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went t=
o sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for =
violating tradition.<BR>> <BR>> In case the analogy is not clear,
 he=
re is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic de=
ities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slight=
ly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state=
 of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. O=
ther allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state.=
 While definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state o=
f self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to r=
each it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. T=
he path depends on one's current position!<BR>> <BR>> Great men in ma=
ny spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experie=
nced that state, understood the current state of people around them and gav=
e specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. =
Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some
 instead kep=
t arguing about the contradictions between paths.<BR>> <BR>> Stop Arg=
uing and Do Sadhana<BR>> <BR>> As the metaphor above illustrates, arg=
uments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is importan=
t is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aag=
amic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether one does ho=
mam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and ho=
w one is being transformed internally.<BR>> <BR>> Just as a twenty co=
urse meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =
=E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or=
 a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just a=

all the 100 associates together and seat them together by violating the pro=
tocol and use that time to let the President eat in peace?<BR>> <BR>>=
 Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and gives very li=
ttle time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries and give more=
 time to eat?<BR>> <BR>> In a fire ritual, making offerings to the ma=
in
 deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before t=
he offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and=
 offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for th=
e fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one =
has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the b=
enefit. It is far better than doing nothing.<BR>> <BR>> <sections =

, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) e=
veryday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual und=
erstanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do =
a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudd=
ing is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a fe=
w
 months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s att=
itude, focus and clarity of thinking.<BR>> -----------------------------=

ese steps.<BR>> > <BR>> > 5. The procedure in the manual is not=
 as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions=

 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a=

ion for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra "deva savita =
prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not b=

 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghe=

ctly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked
 into agni. =
Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (h=
avya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agn=
i carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked =
it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)<BR>> > <BR>> > 18. In=
 the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni ac=
ts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted in=
to the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahuti=
s.<BR>> > <BR>> > 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are a=
vailable in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal fo=
r sadhakas. They don't involve veda mantras so that you don't have to strug=
gle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designe=
d for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily ad=
apted to perfrom homam for any devata.<BR>> >
 <BR>> > 20. Homa=
m should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned=
 from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with dev=
otion, precision and perfection.<BR>> > <BR>> > 21. I suggest t=
