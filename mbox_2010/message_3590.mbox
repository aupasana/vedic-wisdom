Namaste,

Please note that the characters in the story told in Chandipath a=
re metaphors for things inside us.

Suratha means a good intention (su=3Dgo=
od and ratha=3Ddesire/intention).

King Suratha is a metaphor for a good in=
tention/desire. Intention/desire is a powerful thing. It controls our mind =
and our actions. Because of its power and control over the mind, it is comp=
ared to a king.

Samaadhi means focus or concentration. Businessman named S=
amaadhi is a metaphor for one's focus and concentration. While desires typi=
cally excite mind into an active mode, focus (on anything) typically tricks=
 the mind and soothes it. That is why it is compared to a vaisya (a busines=
sman), who knows what he wants and mesmerizes people into giving it to him.=


Medhas means intelligence. Rishi named Medhas is a metaphor for intellige=
nce. While one's desires and focus may be deluded and run after material th=
ings, one's intelligence is firmly established in god and clear about what =
is what. No confusion. That is why intelligence is compared to a rishi!

*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If one desires a luxury car, wife's happiness, son's profes=
sional success and other material things like that, one's intelligence cann=
ot really educate and direct the desire within one towards finding Self. Si=
milarly, if one's concentration is directed at work and various mundane tas=
ks, intelligence cannot really educate and direct one's concentration towar=
ds finding Self.

Similarly, when king Suratha and businessman Samadhi were=
 pre-occupied with their families, their kingdom, wealth etc, rishi Medhas =
could not really direct them towards the divine Mother.

Once the king and =
the businessman were forced to turn away from their families etc, they land=
ed up at the ashram of rishi Medhas and he could educate them on how to fin=
d the divine Mother.

Similarly, when one's desire and concentration are tu=
rned away from the regular things they are usually centred around (sense ob=
jects and material things), then intelligence can direct one's desire and c=
oncentration towards finding the Self.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Of course, desire =
and concentration turning away from material things and approaching intelli=
gence for guidance is the *beginning* of the thirteen chapters of Chandipat=
h. The rest is how intelligence instructs them on finding Self. All the sto=
ries are a metaphorical representation of various phases and challenges enc=
ountered as one strives to find Self.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

The last (13th) ch=
apter says that the king and the businessman worshipped the divine Mother a=
fter the instruction from the rishi and She appeared before them. The divin=
e Mother gave them boons.

King got a boon that he will get back his kingdo=
m and be born as the son of Sun named Saavarni. Businessman got a boon that=
 he will get absolute knowledge and liberation. Now let us understand what =
that means.

When one's desire and focus are directed to Self-realization, =
one finally realizes Self.

One's power of concentration always becomes one=
 with the object of concentration when it succeeds. When one's power of con=
centration is not directed at a mundane object/task but not imperishable Se=
lf, one's concentration merges with the imperishable Self. That is why the =
businessman named Samadhi got absolute knowledge and liberation.

A Self-re=
alized person becomes a jeevanmukta (liberated while living) and his power =
of concentration is directed at god even as he pursues many things. He may =
"want" to build a temple or spread dharma or destroy a kingdom or establish=
 a new kingdom or whatever, but, despite his apparent activities, focus of =
his mind is on Self. One is an instrument of infinite divine Will and engag=
es in various actions non-volitionally. The intentions/desires of such a pe=
rson are not his, but those of Nature. When he gets an intention to do some=
thing, he non-volitionally engages in an action, with a full and deep under=
standing that the objects he is interacting with during that action are jus=
t projections of Self.

This is the meaning of king Suratha being reborn as=
 the son of Sun. The intentions/desires within one are now coming from Natu=
re/Self and not from one's own conditioning (which is non-existent now). Th=
at is the meaning of Suratha being reborn as the son (coming from) of Sun (=
Self).

Saavarni is the name of the reborn king. Some people may translate =
"saavarni" to mean "one having the same color", but my translation is "the =
transparent one". The desires/intentions behind the actions of a jeevanmukt=
a are transparent, i.e. free from any conditioning or individual agenda. Su=
ch a person may engage in many kinds of actions, but the power of concentra=
tion of such a person never wavers from Self!

Thus, the ending of the stor=
y metaphorically represents what happens to the desires/intentions and the =
power of concentration/focus within one, after they have been directed at f=
inding Self, one finds Self and becomes liberated while living.

=A0 *

This is very high philosophy. Whatever little I could understand, I =
tried to express it in simple words. I hope it made some sense to some of y=
ou. If this is confusing, please do not worry. Bookish knowledge and intell=
ectual understanding helps only a little. Do sadhana. That is far more impo=
rtant than understanding this mail.

Best regards,
Narasimha

=C2=A0



  


    
      
 =
     
      

Narasimhaji and other Gurujan,



In the Chandipath, the name=
 of the King is Surath (a good charioteer)

and he is obviously skilled in =
administration and leading people on the

right path but due to circumstanc=
es or some past karmas his kindom is

snatched away from him by the Kolavid=
hwamsis (Kola is translated as a

barbaric tribe but is also related to Sat=
urn representing past Karmas). 

When he does Devi Araadhana in the end he =
is given the boon of getting

his kindgom back and ruling it with a sense o=
f detachment (like Raja

Janaka), which will never again be taken away as w=
ell as he is made the

Manu in the next Manvantara.



However, I wonder wh=
at is the significance of the Vaishya being named

Samadhi?  Unlike Suratha=
 who gets a boon related to his natural

abilities, the Vaishya does not ge=
t a boon to get his family back or a

boon to become the best merchant who =
is detached from the fruits of his

work but rather he is given the boon of=
 getting the knowledge which

leads to final emancipation.  Is the message =
simply here that we need to

step away from a business oriented mind into a=
 spiritual mindset?



Veenu
