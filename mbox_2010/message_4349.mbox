Namaste Narasimha,

***
If internal fires of several people are looking for=
 oneness with the same external fire, their karmas will be mixed up and wil=
l block each of them from a oneness with it. None will experience "Yoga" wi=
th fire and their karmas will be mixed up.
***

Will the participation in g=
roup homam conducted in temples have a similar adverse karma implications?
=

In these group homams, the priest 'processes' the individual sankalpams an=
d then performs the homam on behalf of many participants. Only the priest(s=
) makes the offering into the fire.

Is there any 'goodness' at all in thes=
e group homam or offering poornahurti when the homam is being performed by =
others? 

I have been thinking that there would be some element of goodness=
 in taking part in these homam and am thankful for your highlighting the ka=
rma mixup factor.

Thank you.

Warmest Regards
Narayanan

Namaste,

Durga is simply Vishnuma=

Durga Sooktam. It says that Durga belongs to Vishnu and She deludes (or int=
oxicates) things in this universe. (Of course, please do not take the word =
"delude" in a bad connotation here. If that delusion is absent, there would=
 only be non-dual Brahman and no field of duality and no concept of space/t=
ime, no objects, no I, no you at all. This delusion is neither good nor bad=
. It is just there, that's all.)

Also, MahaLakshmi's 108 names contain "na=
vadurgaaM mahaakaaLIM brahmaviShNushivaatmikaaM". "Durga of nine forms" is =
a name of Mahalakshmi, i.e. nine forms of Durga are Mahalakshmi's different=
 manifestations!

The Vaishnava vs Shaiva vs Shaakta schisms are a product =
of Kali yuga. Do not worry about the distinctions and compartmentalizations=
 that have some basis but are unfortunately amplified in the Kali yuga. For=
 example, Ramakrishna said that Krishna and Kaala are not really different =
- he said Krishna is like Sun and Kaali is like the sunlight.

Bottomline: =
When you invoke Vishnu or Lakshmi in fire, you can chant prayers of Durga a=
nd make offerings too.

* * *

Though letting others make offerings in one'=
s homam fire is a very common practice today, ancient practice was that eac=
h person performing homam would have a separate homa kundam and a separate =
fire. Multiple people could chant mantras and handle/process offerings, but=
 one single person would start the fire and make offerings into it. I very =
strongly recommend sticking to this rule.

Let me say a few words on the re=
asoning behind this rule.

* * *

The goal of all sadhana (spiritual practi=
ces) is "yoga". Though people today think that "yoga" means physical jerks =
and intricate postures, actually the literal meaning of Yoga is "joining tw=
o in oneness".

When one engages in bhakti yoga by praying to a deity, one =
is trying to lose one's self-awareness and become one with a tiny particle =
at the deity's feet. When one engages in praanaayaamas, bandhas etc of raaj=
a yoga (e.g. hatha yoga), one is trying to merge the praana and apaana vaay=
us in oneness and merge Kundalini (self-awareness) in the supreme self-cons=
ciousness at Sahasrara chakra. When one engages in jnaana yoga, one is tryi=
ng to find (by the process of elimination) that which is permanent and impe=
rishable and merge one's consciousness in oneness with it (instead of focus=
ing on impermanent and perishable objects such as body).

As I said, the go=
al of all sadhana is some form of oneness or "yoga". That is the same even =
with homam!

* * *

When one does homam, one is first trying to merge one's=
 bhootaagni (the basic fire controlling one's existence, self-awareness and=
 perception of the universe) with external fire. In the beginning, one may =
feel that there is just an *external* fire that is not connected to one's s=
elf. But, as one does sadhana with fire regularly and forms an attraction f=
or fire, a relationship is slowly formed. In the company of a strong extern=
al fire, one's bhootaagni will be aroused and one's bhootaagni will have a =
union with the external fire oneday. In other words, one feels the external=
 fire to be connected to one's own internal fire of perception.

This yoga =
or association will strengthen one's bhootaagni considerably and make it ca=
pable of perceiving various divine beings and divine energies present aroun=
d one. This will eventually enable one to obtain yoga with different divine=
 energies and beings.

* * *

Suppose a young person is seriously intereste=
d in a relationship with an experienced person and shows interest over a pe=
riod of time. The experienced person may eventually take the young person u=
nder the wing and build the relationship. Even if the young person does not=
 know how to do his/her part in the relationship, the experienced one may t=
each the young one.

Similarly, when one tries to create a union between ex=
ternal homam fire and one's internal fire of existence and perception, it d=
oes not matter if one's internal fire is small or ineffective. If one persi=
sts enough, external fire will guide the internal fire like an experienced =
partner in a relationship. However, one has to be persistent and one has to=
 be serious.

* * *

[My apologies in advance if this analogy offends some =
of you.]

A lot of young boys may move with a woman and have a friendship. =
But, in order to have a union with her and get a child through her, one may=
 need to court her and cultivate an intimate relationship. Similarly, to ha=
ve a union with a homam fire and get subtle perception through it, one may =
need to cultivate an intimate relationship.

If several people are offering=
 things to fire, it is like a lot of boys moving with a woman. She may not =
have union with any of them there. If you handle the fire by yourself and d=
o not let others handle the fire, it is like having a personal and intimate=
 relationship with a woman. Just as the woman may have a union with the boy=
 who is pursuing her whenever she wants, external fire may have a union wit=
h your internal fire whenever it wants. You just wait. But, one does not ma=
ke it faster by pursuing many women or going out with the woman with many f=
riends always. Similarly, one does not make it faster by offering in homam =
fire with many people.

Just as a friend who accompanies a boy when he goes=
 out with a woman may misbehave and spoil the boy's chances with the woman,=
 a person who offers to (or otherwise handles) your homam fire can spoil yo=
ur chances of yoga with fire by having undesirable thoughts.

Whenever you =
start homam fire, imagine it to be your internal fire. Offer in it sincerel=
y. Do not let others offer in your homam fire or handle the fire. They can =
chant along with you and watch, but not handle the fire.

* * *

Even if yo=
u imagine the fire to be an external and do not imagine it to be your inter=
nal fire, your internal fire may still be seeking a union with that fire wi=
thout your knowing it consciously! Thus, it is not a good idea to let other=
s offer in the fire.

* * *

If internal fires of several people are lookin=
g for oneness with the same external fire, their karmas will be mixed up an=
d will block each of them from a oneness with it. None will experience "Yog=
a" with fire and their karmas will be mixed up.

Non-dually speaking, exter=
nal fire in homam kundam 1 and external fire in homa kundam 2 are the same.=
 But, that way, your internal fire and internal fire in a friend may also b=
e the same. But, at the level of duality, your internal fire and that in a =
friend are different, carry the weight of different karmas and are conditio=
ned differently. So, they are different and need to seek union with a diffe=
rent external fire.

* * *

Bottomline: Apart from the concern about mixing=
 up karmas, one needs to cultivate the habit of doing homam in a personal h=
oma kundam with a personal fire in order to reach the goal of Yoga with fir=
e (and thereby with a deity) oneday. One allowing others to make offerings =
in the homam fire may block oneself from that goal. When you do homam, do n=
ot start off assuming that you will never achieve god-union with homam. Ins=
tead, do everything you can to maximize the chance of it.
