Dear Jai,
*
> Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real

*
In=
 the above sentence replace "real" with "permanent" and read it again with
=
the
notion that all that is not permanent is not important and the meaning =
might
come through.
For a moment, let's also assume we can change viewpoint=
 of world from us
(duality)
to Brahman (non-duality). Brahman is formless a=
nd attribute-less. Any thing
that has
an attribute is temporary from that f=
rame (as described by learned). World
and life have
attributes and will def=
initely look temporary. Karmas of a normal
individual, who will
have multip=
le attributes, may seem trivial compared to Nature's actions. So,
it is not=

really surprising to see saints, those who merged into Brahman, to say wor=
ld
and
life are unreal.

Coming back to us, karma is the most important thi=
ng. Until karma is
selflessly
performed, I-ness expects, observes, judges a=
nd experiences the results.
Those
results cause future karmas and the cycle=
 continues. As long as I-ness
exists,
consciousness exists to operate on ou=
r karmas. Based on my understanding
others
may correct this -- Consciousnes=
s constructs things just to be active till
our soul is
relieved of all karm=
as.

> Which scientist says universe is a construction of consciousness ?
N=
ot everything scientists say is real nor all real things were found by
scie=
ntists only. So,
we'll leave that there.

I haven't read vedas or any epics=
, so I am not eligible to comment on that
topic. That
said, above statement=
 on unreal world seems to be a wise statement to
trigger this
kind of quest=
ioning. Also, as yogis and wise people have repeatedly pointed
out, above
d=
iscussion is heavily based on theory and will help to realize those
concept=
s only
when supported by intense practice. If you already realized all this=
, ignore
this message.

Regards,
-Kishore
