 The following article was first published in the September 1931 monthly
ma=
gazine called PEACE, the journal of Swami Omkar's Shanti Ashrama in Andhra
=
Pradesh. It was later reprinted in the April, 1966 issue of the Mountain
Pa=
th.

It describes Paul Brunton's first visit to Sri Ramanasramam and one of=
 the
dialogues he had with the Maharshi. In this article, his former name "=
Hurst"
was used. He later adopted Paul Brunton as his pen name which he ult=
imately
made his permanent name.

IT WAS half past four in the afternoon an=
d the disciples were sitting before
the Maharshi in the hall and were talki=
ng about a notification that had
appeared in the dailies [newspapers] to th=
e effect that a Mr. Hurst and a
Buddhist Bhikshu were intending to visit th=
e Ashrama. The clock struck five
and there entered the hall a man in Europe=
an costume, bearing a plate of
sweets and followed by a Buddhist monk. The =
visitors offered the sweets to
the Maharshi and then, after making obeisanc=
e in the Eastern way, they both
squatted on the floor before him. These wer=
e the visitors of whom the
disciples had been talking. The man in English c=
lothes was R. Raphael Hurst
[Paul Brunton], a London journalist who was the=
n on a visit to India. He was
keenly interested in the spiritual teaching o=
f the East and thought that by
an intelligent study and appreciation of it =
the cause of cooperation between
East and West might be greatly promoted. H=
e came to Sri Ramanasramam after
visiting many other ashramas. The Bhikshu =
who came with him was also an
Englishman by birth. He was formerly a milita=
ry officer but was known as
Swami Prajnananda. He was the founder of the En=
glish Ashrama in Rangoon.
Both visitors sat spellbound before Maharshi and =
there was pin-drop silence.
The silence was broken by the person who had br=
ought the visitors, asking
them if they would like to ask any questions.

T=
hey were, however, not in a mood to do so, and thus an hour and a half
pass=
ed. Mr. Hurst then stated the purpose of his visit. In a voice of
intense e=
arnestness he said that he had come to India for spiritual
enlightenment. "=
Not only myself," he added, "but many others also in the
West are longing f=
or the Light from the East.''

The Maharshi sat completely indrawn and paid=
 no attention. One of those who
were sitting there asked them if they had c=
ome to the East for a study of
comparative religions. "No," the Bhikshu rep=
lied, "we could get that better
in Europe. We want to find Truth; we want t=
he Light. Can we know Truth? Is
it possible to get Enlightenment?" The Maha=
rshi still remained silent and
indrawn, and as the visitors wanted to take =
a walk, the conversation ended
and all dispersed.


Early next morning the =
visitors entered the hall and put some questions to
the Maharshi with great=
 earnestness. The conversation reproduced below is
from rough notes taken w=
hile it was going on.

Bhikshu: We have travelled far and wide in search of=
 Enlightenment. How can
we get it?
Maharshi: Through deep enquiry and confi=
dent meditation.

Hurst: Many people do meditate in the West but show no si=
gns of progress.
Maharshi: How do you know that they don't make progress? S=
piritual progress
is not easily discernible.

Hurst: A few years ago I got =
some glimpses of the Bliss but in the years
that followed I lost it again. =
Then last year I again got it. Why is that?
Maharshi: You lost it because y=
our meditation had not become natural
(sahaja). When you become habitually =
inturned the enjoyment of spiritual
beatitude becomes a normal experience.
=

Hurst: Might it be due to the lack of a Guru?
Maharshi: Yes, but the Guru =
is within; that Guru who is within is identical
with your Self.

Hurst: Wha=
t is the way to God-realization?
Maharshi: Vichara, asking yourself the 'Wh=
o am I?' enquiry into the nature
of your Self.

Bhikshu: The world is in a =
state of degeneration. It is getting constantly
worse, spiritually, morally=
, intellectually and in every way. Will a
spiritual teacher come to save it=
 from chaos?
Maharshi: Inevitably, when goodness declines and wrong prevail=
s He comes to
reinstate goodness. The world is neither too good nor too bad=
; it is a
mixture of the two. Unmixed happiness and unmixed sorrow are not =
found in
the world. The world always needs God and God always comes.

Bhiks=
hu: Will He be born in the East or the West?

The Maharshi laughed at the q=
uestion but did not answer it.

Hurst: Does the Maharshi know whether an Av=
atar already exists in the
physical body?
Maharshi: He might.

Hurst: What =
is the best way to attain Godhood?
Maharshi: Self-enquiry leads to Self-rea=
lization.

Hurst: Is a Guru necessary for spiritual progress?
Maharshi: Yes=
.

Hurst: Is it possible for the Guru to help the disciple forward on the
p=
ath?
Maharshi: Yes.

Hurst: What are the conditions for discipleship?
Mahar=
shi: Intense desire for Self-realization, earnestness and purity of
mind.

=
Hurst: Is it necessary to surrender one's life to the Guru?
Maharshi: Yes. =
One should surrender everything to the Dispeller of Darkness.
One should su=
rrender the ego that binds one to this world. Giving up
body-consciousness =
is the true surrender.

Hurst: Does a Guru want to take control of the disc=
iple's worldly affairs
also?
Maharshi: Yes, everything.

Hurst: Can he give=
 the disciple the spiritual spark that he needs?
Maharshi: He can give him =
all that he needs. This can be seen from
experience.

Hurst: Is it necessar=
y to be in physical contact with the Guru, and if so,
for how long?
Maharsh=
i: It depends on the maturity of the disciple. Gunpowder catches fire
in an=
 instant, while it takes time to ignite coal.

Hurst: Is it possible to dev=
elop along the path of the Spirit while leading
a life of work?
Maharshi: T=
here is no conflict between work and wisdom. On the contrary,
selfless work=
 paves the way to Self-knowledge.

Hurst: If a person is engaged in work it=
 will leave him little time for
meditation.
Maharshi: It is only spiritual =
novices who need to set aside a special time
for meditation. A more advance=
d person always enjoys the Beatitude whether
he is engaged in work or not. =
While his hands are in society he can keep his
head cool in solitude.

Bhik=
shu: Have you heard of Meher Baba?
Maharshi: Yes.

Bhikshu: He says that he=
 will become an Avatar in a few years.
Maharshi: Everyone is an Avatar of G=
od. "The kingdom of heaven is within
you." Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Krishna=
, all are in you. One who knows the
Truth sees everyone else as a manifesta=
tion of God.

Bhikshu: Will the Maharshi make a statement about Meher Baba?=

Maharshi: What statement? That (the existence of an outer Avatar) is a
que=
stion which seekers of Truth need not consider.

Bhikshu: Will the world be=
 rejuvenated?
Maharshi: There is One who governs the world and it is His bu=
siness to look
after it. He who has created the world knows how to guide it=
 also.

Bhikshu: Does the world progress now?
Maharshi: If we progress the =
world progresses. As you are, so is the world.
Without understanding the Se=
lf what is the use of understanding the world?
Without Self-knowledge, know=
ledge of the world is of no use. Dive inward and
find the treasure hidden t=
here. Open your heart and see the world through
the eyes of the true Self. =
Tear aside the veils and see the divine majesty
of your own Self.
