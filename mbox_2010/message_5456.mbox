Dear Sir

Well written article about Bhagirathan and Ganga.=C2=A0 Mythology=
 apart, 60,000 Sagara Kumaras burnt to death and became ashes when they wen=
t in search of the Horse
of 'Aswamedha Yajna.=C2=A0=C2=A0 There is an islan=
d near present California in US namely 
"Ash" Island and there is another i=
sland namely "Horse Island" nearby.

I also understand that the water aroun=
d the Ash Island is pure and sweet in the midst of
sea.=C2=A0 Is it our Gan=
ga?.=C2=A0 

Is there any connection between Mythology and reality?

With r=
egards
S. Subramanian

=C2=A0



  


    
      
     =
 
      Hard work can do wonders 









In Indian culture vairaagyam was=
 always given ultimate importance. But careful, there is a very thin line t=
hat separates vairaagyam and laziness. In vairaagyam all karma is done but =
without expecting anything in return, without being involved in the materia=
listic aspects of karma. Bhagiratha, with his unparalleled effort to bring =
Ganga to earth, showed us how much effort a man can put in and as a result =
what wonders can be done.

On knowing that his ancestors (60000 Sagara Kuma=
ras) will reach swarga only if the pure waters of Ganga flow through their =
ashes, from his mother, Bhagiratha immediately leaves to Himalayas to do ta=
pas for Lord Brahma:

After purifying himself in a pushkarini, it starts ta=
pas with extra-ordinary concentration. Starts with padmaasana and in winter=
 stood in the freezing waters of the lake with water up to chest! In Summer=
 stands in the middle of burning pancha-agnis (four agnis + sun) and steadi=
ly stared at the sun with eyes wide open (all the while concentrating on Br=
ahma deva)!!

During the first few days, he had food only once a day. Later=
 it was once in a few days. Then it became once in a month. After that, he =
just used to drink a little water and continue his `Tapas'. Finally the air=
 was his only food!!! 1000 years passed=E2=80=A6.!!!!

Brahma, the creator =
of the worlds, on the requests of Gods to save them from the tremendous tap=
aagni of Bhagiratha, appears before him and blesses him with children and G=
anga. However, Brahma deva suggests that none except Parama Shiva can take =
the force when Ganga falls onto earth, and if not with that force earth wil=
l be washed away=E2=80=A6

Men are of three kinds:

There are cowards, who =
do not begin their work at all, afraid that some trouble may arise midway. =
Those who begin but later give up the task, afraid of the difficulties that=
 arise. Brave people who belong to a third group. They continue to work in =
spite of even an army of difficulties, and finally achieve the goal.

Bhagi=
ratha belonged to this third category of brave men. He again began a severe=
 `Tapas' to please Lord Ishwara. With folded hands, and standing on one leg=
, he meditated on Lord Iswara with the deepest concentration. So a whole ye=
ar passed. Pleased with Bhagiratha's devotion Lord ishwara takes the immens=
e force of Ganga and controls her in his jataajutam. He completely stops he=
r from flowing to teach her a lesson (she was a mischievous girl, proud of =
her strength!), but for Bhagiratha it was another difficulty=E2=80=A6 But h=
e again with tapas pleases Lord Shiva to release Ganga down to earth. Ganga=
 followed Bhagiratha shyly and slowly, like his daughter (Bhaagirathi). But=
 she grew a little mischievous, though Shiva taught her a lesson once, when=
 near Jahnu maharshi's ashram. She wandered all over the Ashrama like a sma=
ll girl and the entire place was filled with water. Disturbed from tapas by=
 it, Jahnu maharshi in a single gulp swallows her entirely. And
 suddenly d=
ifficulties again for Bhagiratha. But it is not the first time for him, so =
immediately pleases Jahnu maharshi (Jaahnavi comes out of Jahnu maharshi's =
ear) and finally sends his ancestors to higher worlds=E2=80=A6..

Morals in=
 the story: 

1.Karma must be done in massive quantity as Bhagiratha did, b=
ut selflessly=E2=80=A6

2. Brave people continue to work in spite of even a=
n army of difficulties, and finally achieve their goal.

3. Man can achieve=
 wonders, once he puts in effort and dedication=E2=80=A6.

4 One must never=
 be proud of one's strength or other qualities. Else you will be humiliated=
 when you meet a greater person. (Shiva taught the naughty kid, Ganga, a le=
sson by controlling her unparralled strength & force, with great ease=E2=80=
=A6.)
