Truth on Trial



If truth could be placed in the courtroom dock for  its =
Reliability,
Veracity, Integrity and Honour, then how many I wonder would b=
e  its
advocates; and as to how chosen the board of adjudicators, and by wh=
om 
elected. Would that such a thing could be done, and such a trail take
p=
lace,  then I for one would rather play the part of advocate on its
behalf =
than juror  and judge of it. That is to say that I would rather
fight the c=
ause for the  plaintiff than sit in judgment of it, for
without that action=
 there could be no  trial; and no judgment made.  And
whom I  wonder would =
be the advocates for its guilt and unreliability,
or even non  existence.  =
But what is it which would be  sitting in the
courtroom dock?  It would  be=
 that entity by the first name of AS IS SO.



The prosecutors case would b=
e that there is no  such thing as truth;
whereas my advocacy would be that =
there is nothing extant  which is not
true; and that everything which exist=
s IS true. The jurors position 
would have to, by needs must, take the stan=
ce that some things may be
true and  others may not be true, and therefore =
find out as to which was
what; and if  indeed anything was true; and by the=
 process of the
courtroom digging out  whatever evidence could be found for=
 either.



Truth, however, has a number of faces, facets.  There is that w=
hich is
found to be true with regards to extant phenomena AS IS,  and also =
the
various truths of the facts which make it so and bring it about by  way=

of its structure and workings. Then we also have the face or facet of
huma=
n  pronouncements upon those phenomena. Does this witness speak the
truth o=
r not?  Then there is the face or facet of as to how much can a
human being=
 know of what  is true and what is not true beyond the range
and spectrum o=
f human experience.  How is truth recognised as being
true? This was a dial=
ectical process which I  myself went through at
quite a young age. My stanc=
e was that nothing would be  true, or said to
be true, unless it could prov=
e to me that it was true. I had no  vested
interest in its veracity and int=
egrity; but simply curiosity.  But how
can truth prove itself in order to  =
justify itself? And thence be said
to BE SO by observers of it.



It is mo=
st empathically NOT arrived at by a  democratic vote due to
opinions and be=
liefs. Let us envisage a scenario that  every human being
was born blind bu=
t then one day a baby was born who had vision  and
could see. The democrati=
c vote would be that it is true that there is no
such thing as vision. But =
the one instant of a child with sight would
prove that  judgment to be wron=
g, and even though it were true that the
rest if them were  blind and witho=
ut sight. But how would the sighted
child prove to the others  that he or s=
he had vision? That would be a
very difficult undertaking. But that  child =
would have the fact of sight
as its witness and proof, whereas the  consens=
us would have no poof of
it not being the case; other than their own  blind=
ness. Could a thousand
blind people prove that one claiming sight could not=
  see?  Another
facet to this of course is  that the sighted child would no=
t be made
blind by their insistence that he or  she could not see. And even=
 if the
case was found it their favour. The child  would still have vision,=

whether they said so or not. Therefore their judgement  and
pronunciation =
is irrelevant to the truth of it. The child can see, and
that  is true. AS =
IS SO.



By what criteria then can a thing be said to be  true? Insofar as=
 I
found out at least, then my own criteria was in that of  throwing
everyt=
hing at it to see what could not be smashed and destroyed in so 
doing. By =
this I do not mean throwing sticks and stones at it but simply
that of  arg=
ument. It was not a case of my finding things so bad that I
did not wish to=
  accept them as being true, for they were easy to
accept;  but rather that=
 I found such things to be so  good that I found
it difficult to accept the=
m as being true (it is all in the  book). But
why should this be the case I=
 wonder. Why is it easier to accept not 
good things as being so and yet no=
t its opposite pole?  I don't
really know why, but maybe it has  something =
to do with conditioning and
nurture when young.



Put it to the test today=
 for yourself. Tell a  thousand folks about
something horrible which has ha=
ppened to you, and then go  elsewhere and
tell a thousand folks something e=
xtremely good which has happened  to
you. And watch the feed-back. In the c=
ase of the former it will be
sympathy  and aid; for the large part. But in =
the case of the latter
then for the large  part it will be hostility and so=
ur grapes. Why?



Time and time again in society, and generation  after ge=
neration, we
come up against the comment, `I am seeking truth'. But the 
tr=
uth and truths of what? Ask them that question, and see what they say.
As f=
or  myself then I certainly did not go in search of truth when
young, but r=
ather  that which was not true. Thus an attack on the
negative in order to =
see what  could not be destroyed in that battle.
Find out as to what is NOT=
 SO in order to  find out what IS SO. That
process, which took twenty years=
, is far too long and  involved for an
email, or even a book. So, I offer i=
t instead as merely food for 
thought. Is not a lie truly a lie?  Is  not a=
 mistake truly not a
mistake?  Does  anything exist, at any level of existe=
nce, which is not
so?  Find me something which does not  exist. Even now, a=
fter all these
years, I  still demand proof of every phenomenon which I enc=
ounter, and
the claims which  people make about phenomena; and never ever, =
for as
long as I exist, would I  ever take something as being true on faith=
.
Faith has nothing to offer me.  Albeit that it seems to make life easy
fo=
r  some.



To what degree this or that person has found  things, or even s=
earched
for things, then that is another question. As for me  than I am not=
 in
love with truth. I just admire it; and would uphold it.  If Johnny sits=

in a dark room all his life  and complaining that there is nothing to
find=
, then, well, what can one expect.  The fault dear Brutus - - ! 
Lays where=
?
