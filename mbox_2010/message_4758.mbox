Namaste,

Amavasya is considered an appropriate tithi to perform Tarpana.

=
Would it be appropriate to perform the FIRST Tarpana ritual on Amavasya (to=
day). 

I wish to start performing the Tarpana Ritual regularly. One of my =
weaknesses is perseverance (continuity). Hence my questions/desire to chose=
 an appropriate mahurat/tithi which lends spiritual support for regular per=
formance of this important ritual.

Will appreciate vedic insight/guidance =
from the learned ones.

Regards,
M Harichand
