Namaskar Narasimha and list members,

   I am following a particular spirit=
ual path, and need confirmation of some sort from an advanced practitioner,=
 about the progress and the direction taken, that am on the right track. It=
 involves an attempt at curing my physical, mental and spiritual malady. Wh=
o should I seek or ask for a divine confirmation and/or intervention ?

Reg=
ards,
Aryama
