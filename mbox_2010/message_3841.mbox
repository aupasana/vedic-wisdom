Namaste Sri Atul,

What Manish means is, if you take advantage of the patie=
nts situation and charge him unfairly or prolong the medication/treatment w=
ith the intention to make more money, then the results would be as Manish s=
ays. Sometimes, a Dr. may not indulge in such lowly activities, but the hos=
pital may, and hence may force the Dr. At such a point, the Dr. is supposed=
 to take a decision like Manish did, and take another path. But, most of Do=
ctors, just go with the flow, and hence it makes them responsible for at le=
ast some of the bad karma, if not all.

Hope this helps.
Regards
Narayan
