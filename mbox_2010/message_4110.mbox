      Nam=
aste,

 

Everyone plays their allotted role. But the roles are not static.=
 They are dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or modification or evolution =
from time to time (and life to life) based on how we play our allotted role=
s. 

 

The role you are given is your destiny and how you play it is your =
free will. How you play your role now (free will) influences what role you =
are given in future (destiny).

 

If the role given to you (e.g. Arjuna) i=
s to kill your guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot escape it. But you ca=
n either do it with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or you can do it with a=
 calm mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom=
, you cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule th=
e kingdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role g=
iven to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji=
) in resisting the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it. But you can=
 either do it with an attached and agitated mind or a calm mind.

 

People=
 in the examples I mentioned above engaged in what may seem like material a=
ctions, but they did them after overcoming attachments and with an equanimo=
us mind.

 

As I keep saying, what you do is a secondary factor and how yo=
u do it is primary. Even as we engage in actions that we believe to be our =
dharma, we should work on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has=
 surrendered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and ce=
nsure in the same way, then one's dharma will be far clearer to one. One wh=
ose mind is densely conditioned by duality and desires will see one's dharm=
a through the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge. On the other =
hand, one with a clear mind with very little conditioning will see one's dh=
arma clearer.

 

In simpler words, one who heavily identifies with the bod=
y and wants comforts and pleasures of the body will see one's dharma from t=
hat motivation. One may identify with body, with a group of people, with a =
deity etc. As is the identification, so is the conditioning and so is one's=
 vision of one's dharma.

 

Though everyone is playing their allotted role=
, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearl=
y and pursuing adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allotted roles=
 where densely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in future.

 

Som=
e have very clear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pursuing h=
igher dharma. As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where lighte=
r and lighter mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they become=
 free.

 

One can try to use free will to move from the former case to the=
 latter case.

 

Best regards,

Narasimha
