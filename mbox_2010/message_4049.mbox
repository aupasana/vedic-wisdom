You have put this beautifully.=
  This latter describes my position quite accurately.  I meditate and read,=
 but I somehow feel as if there is more that I can do.  As you put it earli=
er, using the tools of duality to overcome duality.  And I had no clue how =
to do this.

Thank you (and Rajarshi) for this recommendation.  Previously I =
had no real idea what a homam even was.  The links you provided below will =
be very helpful.  It may be a few weeks before I can get what is needed, an=
d my living arrangements may make it a little difficult.  Would it be appro=
priate to ask questions regarding the practical aspects of it on the forum?=

Interesting!  I live not relatively close to Rice, just ou=
stide the southwest corner of the 610 loop.  There is now a Vedanta Society=
 within a few minutes of where I live, but I see it was only started in 200=
2.  Just after I came to town, interestingly enough.
