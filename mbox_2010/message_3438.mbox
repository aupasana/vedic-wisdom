Dear Narasimhaji,
 Thank you for your reply. I already know all this that y=
ou say - I am simply trying to draw you into explaining the logical quandar=
y that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibly because of my poor pr=
esentation). Let me try once more to communicate more effectively, this tim=
e I'll start from the basics as I understand them (please feel free to nega=
te/correct them).

To me, as I have understood whatever texts I have read, =
that the ONLY source of consciousness, is Brahman. This has exactly 3 attri=
butes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is unconditional), it is pure awareness a=
nd it is pure bliss. There is absolutely nothing else. There is no sense of=
 time, no sense of space, no sense of any boundary of any kind (spatial, te=
mporal etc). Because boundaries would mean duality (at the very least). Con=
sequently, there is no thought either - because thought has objects, and ob=
jects are objects because they are a boundary between something that is the=
 object and something that is not the object.

So how do boundaries (e.g. t=
hought) come about in the first place? See, Western thinking believes (and =
we unknowingly mix concepts) in matter and consciousness, where matter is a=
ll that can be sensed (by the 5 senses), and consciousness is all that cant=
 (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking goes deeper, and effectively divides con=
sciousness into proto-matter (non-(5)-sensory matter - everything from the =
gunas upto the mahabhutas) and pure/essential consciousness (brahman). 

So=
, if you want to use Western thinking, you can say - my sense of I and all =
my thoughts are in my consciousness. And you can get away with this stateme=
nt, no one in the Western style of thinking will ever contradict you. But i=
f you are to think the Vedic way, you cant say my sense of I and my thought=
s are in Brahman. Due to the above definition of Brahman, every single thou=
ght or every single boundary you perceive or identify, has to have a corres=
ponding unique signature in proto-matter. Do you see where I'm going with t=
his? There is no thought or feeling or identity or uniqueness that's "just =
in the mind". Every single one must have a signature i.e be a particular "c=
onfiguration" of proto-matter. Consequently, at the immediate moment before=
 you enter NVKS, when you say "I" went into NVKS, the statement is a contra=
diction in itself. Because that "I thinking of entering NVKS" is nothing bu=
t a configuration of proto-matter - it is simply a particular state of the =
sookshma sarira. When NVKS is achieved, all you can say is - "I" disappeare=
d - you cant say "I got a feeling of enlightenment". You will now say - tha=
t is exactly what I am saying with salt water doll analogy. But I say to th=
at - then how can you say "I" reappeared. If pure consciousness is just as =
I said above, when the "I" disappears, the entire sookshma sarira - essenti=
ally nothing but a configuration of proto-matter disappears. Who can bring =
that back? Pure consciousness has no memory, no motive, no increase, no dec=
rease, no identity, nothing - it is INVARIANT. Then, if that configuration =
of proto-matter (sookshma sarira) is to reappear (even if in a changed form=
 "I got enlightened"), it means there must be a memory of it somewhere, whi=
ch acted as the agent for "reincarnating" it. The only logical place for th=
at memory (according to the argument presented above) is proto-matter itsel=
f. So unless there is some kind of new construct that I dont know about, it=
 isnt possible for that very sookshma sarira to reappear. Consequently, if =
the physical body were to remain, it must mean a brand new sookshma sarira =
got instantly attached to it. 

So I hope you get the point I'm trying to m=
ake - it is easy to sweep things under the rug by doing a "deux ex machina"=
 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_ex_machina), but this going in and out =
of NVKS isnt logically consistent with what NVKS is portrayed to be.

Pleas=
e tell me how I am wrong


Regards

Sundeep

 for most people who reach NVKS and they merge in Brahman like a salt doll =
melting in ocean. In some people, ahamkaara may arise again after NVKS so t=
