Namaste Davyd,

Welcome t=
o the group. I started this group a few years ago in order to share thought=
s related to spirituality and the wisdom of Vedic seers. Please feel free t=
o share your thoughts freely. We are all ignorant in some ways or the other=
, but what joins us is our desire to progress.

Adwaita is the final realit=
y. But the problem is that one stuck deeply in duality may not be able to c=
ome out it by merely telling oneself "all is Brahman". If one looks at plea=
sure and pain differently, if one looks at praise and criticism differently=
 and if one looks at different objects with a different attitude, it is bec=
ause of the conditioning accumulated through many lives. It does not leave =
one so easily. One needs some plan to use the tools of duality to overcome =
duality.

One already in Hawaii may enjoy its beauty directly. But one livi=
ng elsewhere may have to take a taxi, a train, a plane and a taxi before on=
e can enjoy its beauty.

Similarly, depending on how heavy one's karmas and=
 kaarmik debts are, one may need to engage in many actions in the world bef=
ore one can become enlightened.

The same rishis who taught the final truth=
 of Adwaita in Upanishads also taught many ways to navigate the currents of=
 duality to reach the shore of non-duality.

Just as one rowing a boat but =
not specifically eyeing the shore may keep rowing in the waters forever, si=
milarly one engaged in ritual practices without eyeing liberation may keep =
doing rituals forever. At the same time, just as one looking at the shore i=
ntently but not rowing the boat may be stuck in the waters forever, similar=
ly an adwaiti eyeing liberation but avoiding rituals or actions may be stuc=
k forever simply desiring liberation and not knowing how to attain it.

The=
 right balance is personal. One needs to engage in actions aimed at cutting=
 down one's karmik debts and keep contemplating the Final Reality.

Several=
 of us perform a homam (fire ritual) as a spiritual sadhana. Fire ritual is=
 found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and a=
ir, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. Th=
e Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god th=
at everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purif=
ies one's subtle consciousness. Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regula=
rly, for the benefit of the world. Several detailed manuals are available a=
t the website mentioned below.

BTW, I lived in Houston during 1991-1993. I=
 did my masters at Rice University there.

Welcome again and feel free to s=
hare your thoughts.

Best regards,
Narasimha
