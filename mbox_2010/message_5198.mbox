Namaste Rajarshi,
 
The mahabharata verse does not mention cows specifically and refers only to animals in general. Moreover, it is a relatively modern text and not immune to corruption.
 
As for Vedas, Brahmanas etc, they have been immune to corruptions. But it is not even worth considering their translations by today's scholars, let alone pseudo-scholars and propagandists.
 
In Vedas and associated literature, cows and horses frequently refer to jnanendriyas and karmendriyas of manas. For example, horse roaming the whole universe unconquered and then being sacrificed in fire (i.e. ashwamedha yaGYa) is symbolic of being able to perform ANY karma while giving up the sense of doership completely and surrendering it to god.
 
One who reconstructs English language based on some books after 1,000 years may read a line that says "so and so person had foot in his mouth" and imagine that a person really put the foot in his mouth. Sadly, idiomatic and, more importantly, symbolic expression is common in Vedic literature. See Aurobindo's thoughts on this in "Secret of the Veda".
 
Hinduism is a living religion. One cannot interpret its texts in isolation of the notions grasped from observing the living religion.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
