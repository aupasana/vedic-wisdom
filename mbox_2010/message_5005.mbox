Namaste Mitesh and Mahesh,

sometime back, Narasimha mentioned in a post th=
at in Tarpana, we call our ancestors in Water Pot and then "Release" them i=
n a particular way through some specific channels of our palms.

Thus we re=
lease them away through our palm saying specific Tarpana Mantra when we say=
 for instance "Mama Sarvajanmeshu.....svwadhaayibhya tebhya swadhaa namah" =
and that itself serves as the Mantra of sending them away satiated.

I hope=
 i understood it accurately.
***
I am doing Tarpana mostly in the night aft=
er coming back from work.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 I had the same exact question in my mind. In-fact something VERY strage ha=
