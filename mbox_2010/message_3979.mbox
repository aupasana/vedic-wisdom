Namaste Vijay,
                When one reads too much theory and spiritua=
lity is concentrated on intellectual understanding, there is much anguish a=
nd there is confusion. When one sits down and with Guru's grace and Devatha=
's grace starts concentrating on practice, this goes away. It is said that =
layer by layer, then truths are revealed. Indeed 'chitta vritti niruttah' n=
eed not happen all at once, the needless confusion and tossing of the mind =
reduces step by step. 


Regards,

S
