Dear Rajarshi,

I am some how finding your confusions, not so confusing but=
 easy to answer.

> Does one person in a two way rna, breaking off, result =
in the rna >ending?

Yes. I believe that. if it were not the case, then it =
would have been impossible for anyone to break free from chain of Karma/Rin=
a.

In given case, Mr.FL can end the Rina connected to Mr. VS if he remains=
 detatched. Consider Three of many possibilities -1) in some past life, Mr =
FL cheated Mr. VS about the same way with the same value. 2) in some past l=
ife, Mr FL cheated some other person about the same way with the same value=
 but that person got free somehow so now nature presented the fruits throug=
h Mr. VS.
3) Its a condition which started in this life between VS AND FL. =
  

Considering the situation no 1 & 2, Mr. FL is confronted with the situa=
tion in this life. If He is really able to detatch his mind (very very diff=
icult if not nearly impossible), then He has paid back his rinas successful=
ly AND He has successfully avoided new Rinas by *removing the doership* and=
 accepting the situation without resisting.
In the 3rd case, the above idea=
 stands as it is but only question of Mr. VS. - In my opinion, Mr.VS starte=
d this Rina link with FL but because Our Not so fool, Fool, managed to get =
free, Mother Nature will pay back the fruits to Mr VS by somebody else who =
is also required to settle simmilar Rinas from his/her stock.

I hope Naras=
imha does not get upset with such hairsplitting speculation by unrealised i=
ntellect of Mr really Fool.

 the permanent (Self).

 work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a=
 person who chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Se=
lf" and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to=
 absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on=
 the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the=
 big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwell=
s on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that fail=
ure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succee=

that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with h=
