Namaskarams Narasimhaji,
Its amazing that you already know my limitations a=
s far as recitation is concerned. I have been trying hard to recite Durga s=
uktam for the past 1 week or so and not been able to master the correct int=
onation. Probably I will do it a few more attempts. As a child I was always=
 drawn to fire rituals (homams, yagnas) . We had the namboodiri regularly c=
ome to our home for Ganapathy homam and also Bhagavathy Seva which is a tra=
ditional kerala pooja conducted for Bhagavathy using elaborate=A0rangoli fo=
r =A0durga padmam, Sri chakram =A0and using the deepam for devi pooja . Lal=
itha Sahasranama would be used along with Trishati for performing the pooja=
. I would join in for the recitation even as a child.

I still remember pes=
tering the Namboodiri to teach me the procedure for Ganapathy Homam and wha=
t he said at that time makes lot of sense now, even though I got put off th=
en. He said "Kutty (Malayalam word for a small kid)=A0 when you are ready a=
nd when the time is ripe you will know the method"..=A0 I am=A0fortunate to=
 have found the right guidance in this group. I stay in Pune not very far f=
rom Mumbai and Hope to meet Rajarshi some day so that I can learn a few thi=
ngs from him. 

Another thought that has come to my mind quite often is per=
forming group Homams in places where we have members from this group where =
all the members can come toghether and each person can perform homam in the=
ir own Havan kunds at a common place. Please let us know of your opinion. 
=

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
