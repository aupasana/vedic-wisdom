Do you make good use of your left foot?  How about your fingers?  How
abou=
t the ability to think and reason? Do you use all that which is
invested in=
 you? You do not have these things for nothing or for running
away from. Th=
at would be a lick in the teeth to life wouldn't it. An
illuminated person =
does not want anybody to follow them, that is a
highly egocentric thought i=
sn't it. To assist if one can is fine,
but don't force feed people, especia=
lly with so little to offer
them.  But assist, if you can and only if they =
ask you to. Each must
find their self for their self, and then act accordin=
gly to its
essential nature. You cannot live by proxy.
