Dear Devotees=

Hinduism is a vast ocean,more you go inside it more confusions arises and =
this is fact.Arguements and counter arguements bound to come when one start=
s studing hindu shashtra,honestly one will end up with a total=C2=A0confuse=
 mind-what to do and what to avoid.And such situation will bring us in a st=
age where a devotee becomes like Trishanku(seach Google for this if you nee=
d more info).
So what to do?One is to find a right Guru and do sadhana as p=
er his guidence,second option which I am following=C2=A0is to=C2=A0start ou=
r journey mentioned by Shri Manishji and Shri Narsimhaji without any doubt =
and as time goes by we shall see some positive results for sure.In last wee=
kend I was reading the book by Shri Narsimhaji which he has uploaded in his=
 site and I really liked it very much,one can get this book from here http:=
//www.vedicastrologer.org/articles/vedic_wisdom_1.pdf.
Trouble of ours is w=
e don't take it seriously when something is available freely and keep hunti=
ng for useless materials which is PAID type presuming it will be more rich =
and helpfull.
Above is my experence so I shared it with members.
In One lin=
e I can say that Hinduism is system like a tree which gives all kind of fru=
its so better is to stick with fruits available for picking and start eatin=
g them.
My Pranams to all members.
