Namaste,

Wonderful Vimalananda! I never knew till few months earlier that =
there was some divine person called Vimalananda lived in Mumbai. I wasn't e=
ven aware of "Aghora Series". I just got the recommendation from Manish's e=
mail. and I am gald that i read all the 3 books of Aghora.

A complete diff=
erent perspective from Vimalananda, about a famous incident in life of Thak=
ur and Rani Rasmani is given in Law of Karma (Aghora-III).

Ramakrishna's s=
lapping of Rani Rasmani has been ordinarily understood by people and even h=
is followers, as that He wanted to teach a lesson to Rani for thinking some=
 mundane thoughts while sitting in Kali temple. But Vimalananda said that i=
t is not same. According to him, Ramakrishna was in a complete different an=
d in a very high state of mind those days in which he wasn't aware of even =
his body and existence. It was Mother Bhavatarini who was residing in his b=
ody. Bhavatarini wanted to teach a lesson to Rasmani and she slapped her th=
rough Ramakrishna and in reality Ramakrishna was not aware of what has come=
 to pass. "Prakriti Siddhi" was performed on Rani. It is said that after th=
at slap, her mind remain fixed on Kali.

So that is one of the classic case=
s of creating Vacuum by effacing the ego so completely that the deity comes=
 and fills it. Like Kali for Thakur, Tara for Vimalananda and some deity fo=
r Manish.

Regards,

Utpal
