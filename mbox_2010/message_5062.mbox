Namaste,

For anyone interested, one can also read excerpts from the Judgem=
ent of Sri 
Sudhir Agarwal, how he rips apart lies by politically motivated=
 historians in 
the recent Ayodhya verdict. Also as Nithin mentioned, books=
 from Voice of Dharma 
are pretty good and genuine stuff.

I will also try =
and get a copy of "INvading the Sacred". Regarding this specific 
case of K=
ali's Child, one monk of=C2=A0 the Ramakrishna Mission had published a 
str=
ong and scholarly rebuttal of the same. It can be found on the internet as =

well.

But the problem is, the Kripal's of the world have the propaganda o=
n their side. 
Therefore, more unsuspecting people end up reading their rub=
bish rather than the 
rebuttals. In this respect, as mentioned above, the t=
ext of the Ayodhya 
judgement by the Allahabad HC does fine job of exposing=
 such shoddy, 
lie-dripped, politically motivated scholarship by the many K=
ripal's of India.
