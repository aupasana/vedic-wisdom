Namaste Guru!

[
I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Ir=

what you experience and irrespective of how much progress you=
 make, she
can delude you in a split second. In fact, the experiences one h=
as and
the progress one makes is not really one's. She gives them and she u=

"
and attributes those "experiences" and "progress" to that "I", one is
ins=

the univer=
se, while performing the duties that one is inspired to
perform using the b=
ody inhabited by one and without paying ANY attention
to ANY results that c=
ome, including praises and criticism, is the only
solution.

To me, this=
 Paragraph in perticular is the Purnaahuti (Crux) of all your

ired by whatever level of direct experience you have till
now. It is the mo=

The persona (body-nam=

and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The

attributes of that persona, one gets b=

that persona to fulfill dharma without f=

binds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona=
 is. At the end
of the day, everything that is temporary perishes.

perhaps go to Girnar for a=
 day?" I kept my thoughts to myself. It was
late in the evening and we were=

All of a sudden, Manish told the =

hotel. He announced that we were leavin=

to the child. The child was eating when we tur=

we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a combination of red and
black. Walking =
along the ghats we reached the samshan at around eleven
thirty. It was quit=
e crowded, with domes (people who work there to help
the bodies burn) and t=
he relatives. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres
burning simultaneously. Rig=
ht next to it was the Ganges, pitch black at
night. We sat on a stairs, wai=
ting for the crowd to ease out a bit, not
sure when that will happen, not s=
ure how people are going to react. As
we sat observing, the people too were=
 observing us with a mix of
curiosity and possible apprehension. Suddenly M=
anish closed his eyes and
meditated some time, then remarked that this plac=
e has a tremendous
energy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides i=
n this samshan
bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look a=
t something,
I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that ve=
ry instant
the dogs in the

>
> Af=
ter waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the
relative=
s had left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there
was enough l=
eft to last for some time still. We went and sat next to it.
Manish started=
 the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him
doing the Chandi path=
, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part of
my mind was also trying =
to adjust itself to the ambience. There were
quite a few people around watc=
hing what we were upto. But no one
disturbed. The dome had to come and take=
 wood from the pyre to light
other pyres. He did it in the most cautious ma=
nner possible, taking
pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time M=
anish indicated to
him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head =
and did not
disturb that pyre again.
>
> Very soon, within half an hour I n=
oticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had
come and were sitting around the pyre on=
 which the homa was being done.
As I read the Chandi I felt a great pressur=
e on my head, from all sides.
As if a something was pressing hard on my sku=
ll, gripping it tight. The
concentration become excellent. I soon forgot wh=
o was watching us or
anything else around me, except for the sound of the C=
handi Path. Very
nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was =
a piece of
iron and there was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulli=
ng the
mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am=

normally accustomed to. While the homa was on, suddenly one black dog
from=
 the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept
starting at=
 Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it's
head pointed i=
n an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a
feeling as if it is
> n=
ot an animal but a human being watching. Just staring and observing
every a=
ction. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of
that dog.
>
>=
 The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as
well =
as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a
few not=
ches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.
>
> Simply being in a=
 samshan and observing the human body burning up has
a powerful effect on t=
he mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones
of a female human body bur=
ning. Both the femurs were visible and spread
apart. In an ordinary setting=
, this kind of a scene would mean a woman
with "legs spread apart" which ha=
s a very sexual connotation. In
Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a=
 feeling of how eventually
the body is merely a covering for something far =
more real and powerful
that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will=
 perish as they are
ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.

> Manish sa=
id if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely
to please God =
through sadhanas - i.e you are not planning something
negative nor desirous=
 of petty mundane gains - there is very little
chance that you will ever co=
me to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi
homa, no ethereal beings will dis=

with someone who is worshipping Chand=
i. It is not difficult, neither
something to be unnecessarily scared of. Th=

but neither will you bother them nor will the=

to the deity is very good attitude to have. And=

is taken by the Goddess

Gorakhnath (Gorakshanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Mani=
sh saw their homa kundam there and asked, "we do a Chandi homam everyday. C=
an we do it in your homa kundam tonight?" The person said, "we are worshipp=
ers of Narayana and do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any ta=
amasik practices resorted to." We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fir=
e and there would be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.<BR>> &nbs=
p;<BR>> We left and reached the hill with materials around 8:30 pm. The =
hill and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent. There was no electric=
ity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish's cell phone backlight t=
o show the way. There were several dogs there and they started barking when=
 they saw us climbing. But when we started the homam, dogs stopped barking =
and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu also came out of the hut and s=
at near the fire.<BR>>  <BR>> The moment The Mother was invoked =
in fire, the whole place that was silent till then except for our chants su=
ddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a valley in the easte=
rn direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from their trees in that area=
 and started making loud sounds. The whole area resounded with the sounds o=
f birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this huge commotion felt=
 quite eerie.<BR>>  <BR>> *      &=
nbsp; *        *<BR>>  <BR>> =
While on the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demo=
nstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story=
 sent by Prasanth today.<BR>>  <BR>> During that trip in the Ind=
ian summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the ski=
es in front of several people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani =
Maharaj was talking about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the t=
opic and mention great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of =
people, I was first unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to =
feel special.<BR>>  <BR>> On the night of that homam atop a hill=
 in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed his rule of not allowing another person to =
put aahutis in fire when doing homam. Though the plan was that I would do h=
omam in my homa kundam and Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed=
 his mind at the last minute and said we would do together in the same homa=
 kundam. He said I was ready and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic=
 and saw it as an "acknowledgment" of my "spiritual progress". My already p=
rovoked pride peaked with this.<BR>>  <BR>> My mind was filled w=
ith proud thoughts and my focus on mantra and deity was weak, as we chanted=
 Saptashati during that night's homam. Manish said nothing there. The momen=
t homam was over and we went back, he scolded me with a very stern and seri=
ous tone, "what were you thinking? We called the Mother in fire and you wer=
e so distracted. You wasted a great opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (=
an expletive) and She is the Mother of the universe. How can you absorb you=
r mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence? Had I been strict like my guru=
s or like the gurus of the old times, you would've been killed today." He w=
as in that serious mood for an hour or so and then became very kind and com=
passionate again. He laughed, "are you still thinking about it? Leave it Na=
rasimha. These things happen. Everything happens for good. I have no doubt =
you will overcome. Time has to come for anything. Don't worry and keep doin=
g sadhana."<BR>>  <BR>> I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is =
very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irrespective of how =
much progress you make, she can delude you in a split second. In fact, the =
experiences one has and the progress one makes is not really one's. She giv=
es them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks "I, so-and-so =
individual, exist" and attributes those "experiences" and "progress" to tha=
t "I", one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, happiness, unhapp=
iness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the supreme power r=
unning the universe, while performing the duties that one is inspired to pe=
rform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY attention to A=
NY results that come, including praises and criticism, is the only solution=
.<BR>>  <BR>> This experience taught me a very valuable lesson. =
What Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of t=
esting me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does =
not matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temp=
orary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one's dharma. Attributes of th=
at persona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The m=
oment one looks at that persona as "I" and forms an attachment to the attri=
butes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that pe=
rsona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a p=
ersona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespectiv=
e of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything tha=
t is temporary perishes.<BR>>  <BR>> Also, note that pride can s=
trike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Ke=
ep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding against such =
an attachment. Pride is suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppre=
ssed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on until one's atta=
chment to the persona is killed completely. This is a long process. Don't w=
orry too much and just keep doing sadhana.<BR>>  <BR>> * &n=
bsp;      *      &nb=
sp; *<BR>>  <BR>> The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of s=
omething. When Manish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a l=
ame dog that was walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a =
long way. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (=
or rather stair-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, boug=
ht some biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following=
 us then. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy cloth=
es. He was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he =
lost all his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food=
. He decided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattat=
reya and leave it to him to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were=
 climbing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of m=
oney, all the biscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanke=
d and gave back a few<BR>> biscuit pieces to me and said, "you guys keep=
 this."<BR>>  <BR>> Later Manish told me the same thing he told =
you, "you never know when and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness =
and compassion towards needy people is an important dharma."<BR>>  =
<BR>> One does not need to do something beyond one's means. But, one can=
 have compassion, feel the other person's pain and help within one's means.=
<BR>>  <BR>> I considered the biscuit pieces given back by that =
old man as Dattatreya's prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, ple=
ase note that Vatuka Bhairava is depicted as a child.<BR>>  <BR>>=

p;   *<BR>>  <BR>> BTW, the Girnar trip happenened unp=
lanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for the=
 Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended. So I was th=
inking in my mind with dissatisfaction, "why does Manish want to prolong th=
ings here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can't we just leave Dwaraka=
 and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?" I kept my thoughts to myself. It was =
late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka. Al=
l of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the hotel. H=
e announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, "bulawa aa gaya. hum =
Girnar jaayenge" (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rushed =
to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around midni=
ght and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, Girnar is cons=
idered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.<BR>>  <BR>> Sometimes, Mani=
sh has the uncanny ability to respond to one's thoughts. However, he says i=

I hope you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that your signatu=
re changed after the trip.<BR>>  <BR>> We had a remarkable time =
at Varanasi. <BR>>  <BR>> The moment our flight landed at the Ka=
shi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish =
said there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpable =
throughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming aro=
und the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.<BR>>  =
;<BR>> By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Mani=
karnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is somethin=
g that many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Parama=
hamsa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a =
great siddha - spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doin=
g sadhana. The effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness ca=
n be apty used, for those who have such inclination, to further ones spirit=
ual growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure f=
orm of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have be=
en sadhakas, and many in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform h=
omas. They chose not to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someo=
ne feels that a funeral pyre is "unholy", he or she would be better off not=
 trying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are<B=
R>> Mahakala and Mahakali. <BR>>  <BR>>  We went to buy =
some samagri - til (black and white), couple of full coconuts, flowers=
, incense stick (agabatti),  kismis, havan samagri. While buying the s=
amagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a sma=
ll begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on th=
e other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish tu=
rned around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eatin=
g when we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagr=
i. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and f=
ound no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Ju=
st gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled a=
nd said, " The deity of this place wanted to see whether we had become=
 so big sadhakas that we are unable to feed a hungry child . That=
 is how God comes to test people. Kya<BR>> pata Narayan kab, kaha a=
ur kis roop me mil jaye."<BR>>  <BR>> At 11 pm we left for =
Manikarnik, dressed in a combination of red and black. Walking along the gh=
ats we reached the samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, w=
ith domes (people who work there to help the bodies burn) and the rela=
tives. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next=
 to it was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting fo=
r the crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure&nbs=
p;how people are going to react. As we sat observing, the people too were o=
bserving us with a mix of curiosity and possible apprehension.&nb=
sp;Suddenly Manish closed his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked t=
hat this place has a tremendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilit=
ies resides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned beh=
ind to look at something, I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space=
. But that very instant the dogs in the<BR>> samshan went running t=
o that direction.<BR>>  <BR>> After waiting like this for about =
an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major portion had=
 been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some time still.=
 We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering was of t=
il. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his =
recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the ambience=
. There were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. But no o=
ne disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to light oth=
er pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pieces fro=
m the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him not to ta=
ke any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that pyre ag=
ain. <BR>>  <BR>> Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that =
a pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the h=
oma was being done. As I read the Chandi I felt a great pressure =
on my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull=
, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who =
was watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Cha=
ndi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a =
piece of iron and there was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pu=
lling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I=
 am normally accustomed to. While the homa was on, suddenly =
one black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs an=
d kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with i=
t's head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeli=
ng as if it is<BR>> not an animal but a human being watching. Just stari=
ng and observing every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into t=
he body of that dog.<BR>>  <BR>> The homa finished at around 3 A=
M. The meditations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellen=
t. The mind would just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with sli=
ghtest bit of effort.<BR>>  <BR>> Simply being in a samshan and =
observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a=
 nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Both th=
e femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind o=
f a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart" which has a very sexu=
al connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of h=
ow eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more real and=
 powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as th=
ey are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.<BR>>  <BR>> Man=
ish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to pleas=
e God through sadhanas - i.e you are not planning something negative n=
or desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you w=
ill ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal bein=
gs will disturb you because no one wants to mess with someone who is w=
orshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessari=
ly scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother t=
hem nor will they bother you.  Surrendering to the deity is very good&=
nbsp;attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyr=
e the homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of pun=
ya.<BR>>  <BR>> Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa =
on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again=
 we did homas at Manikarnik. <BR>>  <BR>> -Regards<BR>>  =
