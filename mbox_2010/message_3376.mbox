Namaste,

First of all, a very happening 2010 (Sprirtually) for you and eve=
rybody on the list.

Detailed article and i understand that you wish to str=
ess that various Samadhis(or probably All samadhis including Nirvikalpa) ar=
e but Steps to reach Realisation and should not be given over importance.

=
your message raised some questions in me. i put it infront of you.

* What =
is Final realisation or simply 'Realisation' or 'Ultimate' achievement - re=
aching where, there is nothing more left?

* It is claimed by experienced p=
eople that Nirvikalpa samadhi is 'Merging in the absolute'. *No objectifica=
tion* state. No distinction of Obsever, Obseved and observation. Ekmevaadwi=
tiya.
Then if it is still not the realisation then what is called the reali=
sation?. Whom we can call Brahma Gnyaani?

* If a person goes in to Nirvika=
lpa Samadhi *first time*, is he/she not comeout as Knower of Brahman?


Ple=
ase share your understanding by answering my queries.

Regards,

utpal

 down at some point. All samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high w=

u. Now, you have come to an experiential understanding that, this is not it=

 this is not it. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most re=

their contact with the body has become very minimal. The smallest disturban=
