 Householder: Revered Sir, how can we know or recognize a saint?

Ramakrishna: He is a saint whose heart, soul, and inner nature have turned
towards God; he who has renounced woman and wealth. A saint does not look at
women with the eye of desire; if he comes near a woman, he sees the Divine
Mother in her and worships her. His thoughts are always on God and his words
are of Him.

He sees God everywhere and knows that by serving others, he serves Him.
These are some of the outward signs of a saint.Householder: Revered Sir, is
it necessary to remain long in solitude? Ramakrishna: Until right
discrimination is acquired.[p. 77 & 78]
