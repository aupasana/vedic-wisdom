Hello Sanjayji

I do not have the Sanskrit text of Jaimini MBH. I took this=
 date from the Hindi translation published by Gita Press.

1. I used the da=
te of Jan 23 -3102 in JHora with Delhi as the place. 

2. By going back by =
three months from this date we arrive at the month of Paushya. 

3. In this=
 month the Shukla Dashami was on Oct 16 -3103, Tuesday in Ashwini Nakshatra=
.

ract 3 months?.



If possible can you please provide the original sanskrit=
 verse also, This will help us to validate the translation from sanskrit li=
terates.



Warm Regards,
