 Suri Nagamma used to fast on Ekadasi, Sivarathri, Kartikai star day,Monday=

and other such occasions.Those days, it would so happen that many proof
re=
adings of Telugu prints would come to the Asram.

Those days, Bhagavan used=
 to do the proof reading Himself.When someone asked
why Bhagavan had not gi=
ven them to Suri Nagamma, He would say: "O poor
thing. She is fasting today=
!"

After sometime,she realized that the service for Guru was more noble th=
an
fasting.

Even Kunju Swami had told her that Bhagavan Ramana would not g=
ive any work
to him on the fasting days.He was shown the verse 3 of Ulladu =
Narpadu -
Anubandham by Bhagavan Ramana.

One day, a devotee asked the purp=
ort behind such fasting.

Bhagavan replied:"All these things are only to co=
ntrol the senses.In
afasting person, the senses will be more subdued and wi=
ll not go out, and
the mind will be non vacillating.But best thing is to co=
ntrol the mind.Where
is the mind? Where is the body?Where is the Jiva? It i=
s all in the Self.Food
alone does not make up one's determinations, thought=
s.The very "fasting"of
determinations, doubts and thoughtsalone would contr=
ol the mind. Even
otherwise we are the Self.All these ideas, are only to be=
 in the Self.If the
Self is understood,all food controls are unnecessary."
=

He also said that Sat Sangh is more sublime than the poojas,sacrifices,
ab=
ulations and pooja, bhajans, nama chantings, which are only secondary in
na=
ture.
