We may not have rakshas as depicted in puranas with huge physical and fearf=
ul appearances, and super powers. But i think rakshas of present youga are =
much more fearful and dangerous such as people who are disturbing the world=
's peace in the name of terrorism. Why cannot we classify them as rakshasas=
? they are killing women, children, innocent, and disturbing the normal hum=
an life.
likewise, why can;t we classify any killer as=C2=A0a rakshasa.
The=
 only difference i find between rakshas of kaliyuga Vs previous yugas is , =
those rakshas were higlhy devoted, spritual and acqired the powers from dev=
atas=C2=A0 itself. They had to be born as rakshasas due to some curse
Where=
as current day rakshas are no spiritaul, no divine acquantance and not even=
 born due to curse and hence are more "rakshasa" in nature. They are born o=
ut of endless desire, arrogance, lust and ignorance

Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
In=
 the actual=C2=A0Mahabharata, before the=C2=A0actual story starts there are=
 many parts and descriptions of different things and spiritual lineages. Th=
ere is history to the place of Kurukshetra it says.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is ment=
ions=C2=A0that once there was a time when - due to the actions of Sri Paras=
hurama - the brahmanas gained supremacy and they started marrying kashtriya=
 women. This resulted, in ashuric forces being born in this material plane =
of existence. So all the deities came to Narayan asking for help. Narayan c=
onsoled them saying he will come down to earth himself and that they - the =
gods and rishis=C2=A0- too must sent down their own amsa along with him and=
 chose which ashuras they must fight. 
=C2=A0
Thus during the course of the=
 Mahabharata, at many times Krishna made Arjuna fight and destroy different=
 cluster of ashuras and finally made sure Ashuras do not take birth in huma=
n forms. Aurobindo says these days an Ashura can influence the minds of peo=
ple, not come down directly.

-Regards

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>In the actual Mahabharata, before the actual=
 story starts there are many parts and descriptions of different things and=
 spiritual lineages. There is history to the place of Kurukshetra it says.&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It is mentions that once there was =
a time when - due to the actions of Sri Parashurama - the brahmanas gained =
supremacy and they started marrying kashtriya women. This resulted, in ashu=
ric forces being born in this material plane of existence. So all the deiti=
es came to Narayan asking for help. Narayan consoled them saying he will co=
me down to earth himself and that they - the gods and rishis - too mus=
t sent down their own amsa along with him and chose which ashuras they must=
 fight. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Thus during the course of the Mahabha=
rata, at many times Krishna made Arjuna fight and destroy different cluster=
 of ashuras and finally made sure Ashuras do not take birth in human forms.=
 Aurobindo says these days an Ashura can influence the minds of people, not=
 come down directly.</DIV>
