Namaste Narasimha,

Please explain the below message from Shiva. I've never=
 read any works of Maharshi Aurobindo.

Importance is given to Physical bod=
y also as a complete integral transformation. It reminded me also of Chapte=
r called 'Science of Miracles' in Autobiography of a Yogi (Light Particles =
which is the basis of all physical matters) and BABAJI who is said to remai=
n in physical form till the end of creation.

However, what is the importan=
ce of making physical form which last for ever? What is the idea?. Even tod=
ay, beings like Lord Krishna, Saibaba, Ramakrishna and many other beings ar=
e believed to appear in original physical appearance.

Best Regards,

Utpal=

    Our physical body as such is not plastic enough. The nature of Universe=

ours. Either their body is transformed or they will have to lose their body=
 after some time. By power of yoga one can prolong existing body into sever=

. The necessary condition for that is the matter that forms the body regain=

mmortal as it can modify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousnes=
s. So there will not be a necessity to break that form and create another n=

 In Sahaja Samadhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but =
body still is unconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they=
 remain mostly detached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Maharishi).=
 A person in Sahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her=
 body will also be transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi a=
nd vibration of the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri=
 Aurobindo calls as Supramental transformation.

the Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too other=

ness from a very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to =
vital, mental, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a un=
ique biography which deals not with mundane life details of the subject, bu=

What ever I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to t=

 not capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have d=
one it. Once "Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness" is read, then al=
l of Sri Aurobindo's works and what he says about Supramental descent and t=
ransformation can be comprehended more easily.  Alternately one can start w=
ith the works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit's writings are very luci=
