PRANAM Narasimha Ji and Others

Got the answer very clearly, its upto me, h=
ow and what percentage could I achieved about "Bramhachariya", I will try w=
hatever possible to me in the family life...time-span concept is very usefu=
l I think...

Anyway, what about food? is not it better to eat a small non-=
veg item rather a full non-veg meal? Sometimes some social burden force to =
eat non-veg items, in that case, should I stick to the hardest rule to eat =
"veg" food or may relax the rule with taking little "non-veg" food item som=
etimes?

best regards,
Biswajit

NB: If I use a normal coconut, it takes mu=
ch ghee to burn, but dry coconut burns easily with little ghee...but dry co=
conut are little expensive...which actually suggested?

macharya is very important in any spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan sai=

nd holds all the water. Similarly, a sadhaka who is accumulating some shakt=
i through sadhana and does not leak that energy through acts of lust, anger=
, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serve dharma better.

 other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impu=

lization. But one can start with physical celibacy and control over anger.
