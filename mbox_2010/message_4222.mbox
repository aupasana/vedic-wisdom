Respected Sir,

I have been told=C2=A0Pitri tarpana should be performed onl=
y by men. In the manual you haven't mentioned this point whether a woman ca=
n perform tarpana as well. Kindly guide.

Thanks,
Priya

=C2=
=A0 
Namaste,

This dream presumably happened in Pisces lagna with lagna lo=
rd Jupiter in 12th and 9th lord Mars in 5th. There may be something in this=
 dream to aid your own spiritual progress. Except that, I do not think the =
dream means much literally.

* * *

My take is that this dream is a message=
 to you to start doing pitri tarpana. Pitri tarpana (meaning: satisfying an=
cestral manes) is a procedure that can be finished in 5-10 min in its short=
est form. In fact, a short pitri tarpana used to be an integral part of dai=
ly religious sadhana every morning, not so long ago.

* * *

One can downlo=
ad free Pitri tarpana manuals at

http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana

T=
he manuals explain in detail three versions of the procedure - super-short =
(5-10 min), short (12-20 min) and regular (30-45 min). Manuals are availabl=
e with mantras given in various scripts (English, Sanskrit, Bengali, Gujara=
ti, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu).

* * *

If a pitri or anc=
estral mane is stuck in pitri loka, it affects one's mind. Suppose a lustfu=
l ancestor got stuck upon death in pitri loka (i.e. the realm of consciousn=
ess where mind and its predispositions dominate), instead of progressing to=
 another realm of consciousness or being reborn to fulfil remaining desires=
. Then minds of some descendants may be genetically/ kaarmically predispose=
d to lust. Same with other weaknesses.

Though one can look at a pitri as a=
n external being, everything external maps internally. One's pitris are pre=
sent within one as various tendencies based on genetic and kaarmik predispo=
sitions. Freeing a pitri and granting him rebirth is essentially the same a=
s freeing one's own mind from certain genetic and kaarmik predispositions.
=

* * *

In astrology, horas in hora chart are ruled by Sun (fire) or Moon (=
water). Sun's horas are controlled by devas (gods) and Moon's horas are con=
trolled by pitris (ancestral manes).

We all have a physical body (lagna), =
a mind (Moon) and a soul (Sun). Pitris are beings that self-identify more s=
trongly with the mind (Moon) and they are best propitiated using the medium=
 of water (tarpana). Devas are beings that self-identify more strongly with=
 the soul (Sun) and they are best propitiated using the medium of fire (hom=
am).

If one does a 30-minute homam to any deity (e.g. Ganapathi) and a 10-=
minute pitri tarpana everyday (or every weekend), it can accelerate one's s=
piritual progress and make everything else one does more effective. In fact=
, a fire ritual and a tarpana were part of the daily routine of learned Hin=
dus not long ago.

* * *

Modern world looks down upon rituals, but rituals=
 are externalized actions that are carefully designed and that eventually b=
ring internal transformation on repetition.

Every action and every thought=
 of ours has an impact and leaves an imprint on our consciousness. If we wa=
nt to shape our consciousness in a particular useful way, some repeated act=
ions coupled with some thoughts can be used.

Thinking of stuck ancestors a=
nd praying for their freedom, while water flows over some important energy =
centers in the palm, is certainly a useful exercise. Contemplating a deity =
while imagining him/her in fire is certainly a useful exercise.

* * *

The=
 decrease of dharma and increase of adharma in the world places our earth i=
n a precarious position. Though very patient, Mother Earth cannot let her c=
hildren destroy themselves with their careless actions that ruin earth and =
irresponsible inaction in important matters. If Mother Earth takes correcti=
ve action to change the course, it will be painful for many people. For cha=
nges to occur smoothly and relatively painlessly, we need to maintain a cer=
tain level of dharma in the world.

If a few thousands of people are doing =
homam to various deities on a regular basis, without any selfish material m=
otivations but to just increase dharma in the world and to progress spiritu=
ally in the process, it will make a big difference to the world.

In fact, =
the divine Mother appeared and asked my guru in March 2006 to teach simple =
homam procedures to anybody who is interested in spiritual progress and hel=
p increase dharma in the world. I see that some people who never even lit a=
 lamp in their lives are doing a daily homam today and I am convinced that =
the Mother's will will be fulfilled in time.

Detailed manuals of a short h=
omam ritual to various deities are available at:

http://www.VedicAstrologe=
r.org/homam

* * *

Interestingly, I was thinking a few days back to write =
a few lines about the importance of pitri tarpana and homam on yahoogroups.=
 Your mail gives me the opportunity. .

Narasimha
