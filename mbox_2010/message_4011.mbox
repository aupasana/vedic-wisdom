Awesome article Hemanth ji and it lifted a huge cloud from my heart.

Rajiv=
 Malhotra is an princeton based researcher who is well known for his solid =
defense and refutall of the Aryan Invasion theory in the California Textboo=
k furore that came in 2007. He often writes strongly for hinduism for the p=
ast 50 so yrs has helped in defeating the likes of Wendy Doninger and Prof =
Witzel ( Harvard ) who have an agenda in defaming hinduism.

Anywaz :) from=
 my personal experience.

1.Nithyanda has always used the Shiva Sutras and =
he has been candid about the sexual practises in the sutras.

2.One of his =
gurus is a female tantrik and he has often said he is inspired by Osho.

3.=
Like Rajiv says he personally saw the Swamiji conduct his meditation camps =
where people would reach states of ecstasy and he does have the siddhi of c=
onveying great truths in simple words.


It takes nothing away from his dis=
courses , he is free to experiment in Tantra and who knows which rna he was=
 paying back. At the same time the public will misunderstand him either way=
 he puts it.



Thank you for posting this article.....Thank you again. The=
 article is written very objectively.


Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
