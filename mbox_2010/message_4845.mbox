Respected Sri Narasimhaji.
namaste. My name is Nageswara Rao. I am residing=
 in Vizag. Ima interested in doing Sri mahalakshmi Homam at home using supe=
r short proceedure. I have two doubts about this. I request you to kindly h=
elp me.

My first doubt is I am non brahmin. Are non brahmins permited to d=
o homams on thier own?

As non brahmin upanayanam was not performed for me =
by parents as the tradition is not in our community. Are the people who did=
 not undergo upanayanam can do homam on their own?

These are two doubts I =
have in my mind sir, kindly guide me on this.

Thanks and regards
Nageswara=
 Rao
