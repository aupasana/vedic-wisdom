Namaste Nagraj ji,

>>>>I am wondering why people are not discussing abou=
t my question >>>>no. 1 in mail to Shri Satya Prakash Garu. Is something in=
herently >>>>wrong with question itself? 


No sir. There is nothing wrong =
with the question itself. In fact it is a very good question in view of the=
 big picture.   


Whilst the Devi is assuring us that She will fondly acce=
pt all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and homas whether they are do=
ne with appropriate knowledge or not, Her assurance need not be taken as *p=
ermission* to dispense with knowledge of the same. She is proclaiming just =
as Lord Krishna too proclaims in the B. Gita,"Aham hi sarvayajnanam bhokta =
ca prabhur eva ca" (9.24) and "Patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya pra=
yacchati..." (9.28). 

Most of the verses in the Devi Mahatmyam have parall=
els in the B. Gita and Upanishads. Studying the 9th chapter of the B. Gita =
will enable the sadhaka to comprehend the depth of this verse better. 

Lor=
d Krishna further proclaims (9.30), "Even if the most sinful person worship=
s me with unwavering devotion, he must be considered as righteous for he ha=
s made the right resolve". So are we to understand that the sinful person s=
traightaway attains the same state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The=
 Lord Himself unambigiously clarifies this in the very next verse wherein H=
e says that such a person "BECOMES" righteous and attains everlasting peace=
. Here the EFFECT of the RIGHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are ass=
ured that they will never perish.  

Likewise the Devi too is assuring us t=
hat She will fondly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and h=
omas whether they are done with appropriate knowledge or not. Her devotees =
will never perish irrespective of whether they have the right knowledge of =
how to worship Her or not. She will fondly accept the worship, offerings et=
c of both classes of devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna's affirmatio=
n, here too those who worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras,=
 procedures etc, by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the=
 knowledge of the same and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminde=
r that one need not stay away from worshipping Her because they have no kno=
wledge or only limited knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has t=
o perform the worship to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly=
 after surrendering to Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen natura=
lly be it the required knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclu=
sion through this verse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her i=
rrespective of our current level of knowledge.

Satya Prakash
