What is the different between Pitri and ghost?

The common belief regarding=
 ghost is that a soul when attached to body and had unfulfilled desired kee=
ps wandering and stays on earth and is called a ghost/preta/pisacha.

>From =
what you have decribed about Pitri, they too seem to be falling in similar =
category but, have left the earth and gone to pitri loka. 
Is pitri loka on=
e of the urdhva lokas?

Few days back, my son asked me why are we reborn? I=
 tried explaining karma. He was not satisfied. His point is that people go =
to hell/heaver based on good/bad they do. So, God either punishes or gifts =
for bad/good karma we do already. So, why is that we have to come back to s=
uffer as result of bad karma we did? Why cann't God give all the punishment=
 in Hell itself?

Best regards,
Vijay
