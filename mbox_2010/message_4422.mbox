 As Sri Bhagavan's fame began to spread, the number of visitors to the
ashr=
am increased. Many of them tried to offer him presents such as fancy
sheets=
 for his sofa, curtains for the doors and windows, embroidered
carpets, etc=
. In order to satisfy the devotees who offered these things, Sri
Bhagavan w=
ould usually allow his attendant to substitute for a short period
of time t=
he new offerings for the ones which were already in use.

After a few hours=
 they would be removed and sent away to the ashram
storeroom, and the old, =
still-serviceable items would be brought back into
use. Sri Bhagavan would =
briefly utilize these presents merely to strengthen
the devotion of the don=
ors. Left to himself, he would use cheap or old
items, and never claim that=
 they were his own. Devotees who tried to get him
to use newer or better-ma=
de products could always count on resistance from
Sri Bhagavan himself. I d=
iscovered this for myself when I tried to give him
a new pen.

Sri Bhagavan=
 generally used two fountain pens: one contained blue ink, the
other, red. =
Both of these pens were quite old and looked, to me at least,
worn out. One=
 day the top cover of the red-ink pen cracked, so a devotee
took it to town=
 to have it repaired. It was gone for several days. During
this period Sri =
Bhagavan reverted to an old-fashioned nib pen which had to
be dipped in an =
ink pot of red ink. Since this seemed to cause him some
inconvenience, I de=
cided to get him a new pen. I wrote to a friend in Bombay
and asked him to =
send one immediately. A few days later the pen arrived by
post. I went stra=
ight to Sri Bhagavan and handed over the unopened parcel
containing the pen=
.

Whenever a parcel or letter bore the name of the sender on the cover, Sr=
i
Bhagavan never failed to notice it. As soon as he received the packet fro=
m
me, he turned it over and read the name of both the recipient and the
sen=
der. Having deduced that the parcel had been sent at my instigation, he
too=
k out the pen, carefully examined it, and put it back in the box. He then
t=
ried to hand the box to me.

Allowing it to remain in his hand, I explained=
, "It has been ordered from
Bombay especially for Sri Bhagavan's use."

"By=
 whom?" he asked.

"By me," I said, not without some embarrassment because =
I was beginning to
feel that Sri Bhagavan did not approve of my action.

"W=
hat for?" demanded Sri Bhagavan.

"Sri Bhagavan's red-ink pen was out of or=
der," I said, "and I saw that it
was inconvenient to write with the nib pen=
."

"But what is wrong with this old pen?" he asked, taking out the old red=
-ink
pen which had by then been received back in good repair. "What is wron=
g with
it?" he repeated. He opened it up and wrote a few words to demonstra=
te that
it had been restored to full working order. "Who asked you to send =
for a new
pen?" demanded Sri Bhagavan again. He was clearly annoyed that I =
had done
this on his behalf.

"No one asked me," I said, with faltering cou=
rage. "I sent for it on my own
authority."

Sri Bhagavan waved the old pen =
at me. "As you can see, the old pen has been
repaired and writes very well.=
 Where is the need for a new pen?"

Since I could not argue with him, I res=
orted to pleading and said, "I admit
that it was my mistake, but now that i=
t has come, why not use it anyway?" My
plea was turned down and the new pen=
 went the way of all its forerunners: It
was sent to the office to be used =
there.

Sri Bhagavan gave us an example of how to live simply by refusing t=
o
accumulate unnecessary things around him. He also refused to let anyone d=
o
any fund-raising on behalf of the ashram. In this too he set an example. =
He
taught us that if we maintain an inner silence and have faith in God's
p=
rovidence, everything we need will come to us automatically. He
demonstrate=
d the practicality of this approach by refusing to let anyone
collect money=
 for the construction of the temple over his mother's samadhi.
Though large=
 amounts of money were being spent on it every day, we had to
rely on unsol=
icited donations to carry on the work. I knew this from direct
experience b=
ecause one day the ashram manager asked me to get permission
from Sri Bhaga=
van to go to Ahmadabad to ask for a donation from a rich man I
knew who liv=
ed there. Sri Bhagavan, as usual, flatly refused. No amount of
persuasion c=
ould move him from his categorical "No."

"How is it," he complained, "that=
 you people have no faith?" He pointed to
the hill and told us, "This Aruna=
chala gives us everything we want."
