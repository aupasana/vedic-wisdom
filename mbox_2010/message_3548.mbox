I guess, by Supramantal Descent, he means Vijnana, the way Naths and Munis =
and Rishis even Siddhas can do.

      Dear S=
hiva,
=C2=A0
Here is a quote from Sri Aurobindo's own writings on Suprament=
al Descent mentioned in his book on Integral Yoga.
=C2=A0
"The change of co=
nsciousness is a necessary thing and without it there could be no physical =
siddhi. But the fullness of the supramental change is not possible, if the =
body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain, unconsciousn=
ess and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to remain the desc=
ent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of consciousness =
which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the Overmind is =
sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramental Descent is =
necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital and body. This=
 would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of the unconsciousnes=
s of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disease. That woul=
d mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which death comes. =
If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the will of the inha=
bitant. This would be the essence of physical
 immortality. If someone want=
ed to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the complete siddhi, =
it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the body without=
 supramentalization. "
=C2=A0
Again at another place Sri Aurobindo states t=
hat immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Descent, but one of the possi=
bilities.
=C2=A0
I did not quite understand, what exactly is this Suprament=
al Descent, if it has nothing to do with physical immortality. Because, con=
necting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity and fu=
nctioning from that sphere is something that most self realized Yogis do. T=
hen how is "Supramental Descent" so unique?
=C2=A0
Again if, as we see from=
 the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken off, th=
at would mean also a transformation of the body. 
=C2=A0
Well, the Naths(ni=
ne Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane. Is that w=
hat Supramental Descent is?
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

tya Hai..

Ther=
e are some inaccuracies in the below description of Sri Aurobindo Ashram by=
 Shri. Balram Reddy. Moreover, his understanding of Sri Aurobindo's work se=
ems to be very superficial and mistaken. It is surprising to see that after=
 being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo's teachings with physical im=
mortality.

It is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobindo =
and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy seems =
to confuse his imaginations for facts.

There were several instances when M=
other and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying the=
y are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yoga. =
I know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Maharishi =
sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path of I=
ntegral Yoga. 

It is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have said s=
omething specific to Balaram Reddy to
 help him come out of his guilt consc=
iousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his Gu=
ru. We need to take Balaram Reddy's recollections and opinions (especially =
his assumptions and interpolations) with a big pinch of salt.

 Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed<br>> disciple of =
both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then<br>> visiting S=
ri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his<br>> ashra=
ma.. His intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.<br>> N=
arasimhaswami' s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit=
<br>> to Ramanasramam in 1933.<br>> <br>> Before this second visit=
 to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan's<br>> biography. In it I fo=
und a passage relating to the possibility of changing<br>> one's guru. I=
 had a doubt about this and addressed it to the
 Maharshi. He<br>> told =
me, "Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What of that?"<br>> <br>&g=
t; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulated an=
d<br>> controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into town we=
 had to<br>> obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it was=
 totally<br>> different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, =
informality and<br>> spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the s=
ame time elevating.<br>> <br>> Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples =
were generally permitted to visit all<br>> other saints and ashramas, wi=
th the exception of the Maharshi and Sri<br>> Ramanasramam. It was belie=
ved that the Maharshi had the power to undo years<br>> of spiritual prep=
aration that the Mother and Aurobindo were effecting on the<br>> psyche =
of their followers. In other words, they considered the Maharshi too<br>>=
; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was
 aware of this and once when I was al=
one<br>> with him he told me, "Yes, I know of that place. They are afrai=
d of me."<br>> <br>> Leaving Aurobindo Ashram<br>> <br>> I had =
been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years<br>&g=
t; they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spiritu=
al<br>> path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain th=
eir<br>> permission and blessings before leaving. This turned out to be =
much more<br>> difficult than I imagined.<br>> <br>> In Aurobindo =
Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or<br>> ques=
tions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the<br>&g=
t; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with =
the<br>> Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writing. S=
ometimes we<br>> would see the lights burning all night as they were eng=
aged in this work.<br>>
 <br>> Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wro=
te a letter stating my desire to<br>> receive their blessings and permis=
sion to live at Ramanasramam. In the<br>> letter to Aurobindo I wrote th=
at since your yoga begins with<br>> Self-realization, kindly permit me t=
o go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes<br>> only Self-realization, a sta=
te I have not attained, or may not even be<br>> worthy of attaining. Aur=
obindo's reply was affectionate, but negative in<br>> regards to my leav=
ing his ashram. He wrote, "Both Self-realization and the<br>> supra-ment=
al state can be simultaneously developed and achieved here. There<br>> i=
s no need for you to go there."<br>> <br>> I was extremely disappoint=
ed at his response and consequently became<br>> frustrated, restless and=
 discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights<br>> and felt distra=
ught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same<br>> reque=
st. Again I was
 denied permission. It took a long five months and a<br>>=
; third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me th=
eir<br>> permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determine=
d to go and<br>> they saw no other recourse but to grant my request..<br=
>> <br>> In Aurobindo's final letter to me he wrote, "Since you are d=
etermined to<br>> follow a path in which you can achieve only partial re=
alization, we give you<br>> our blessings, though we believe it would be=
 better if you stayed on here<br>> and pursued your sadhana where both t=
he Mother and I can help you."<br>> <br>> It was the rule in Aurobind=
o Ashram that any letter written to or received<br>> from Aurobindo shou=
ld not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this<br>> rule, I b=
urnt all my letters, except the final letter I received from<br>> Aurobi=
ndo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.<br>> <br>> =
Settling
 at Sri Ramanasramam<br>> <br>> During the early years there=
 were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it<br>> was mostly jungle o=
r forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a<br>> brahmin's house =
near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would<br>> sometimes =
cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere<br>> o=
utside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.<br>> <br>>=
 Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the<b=
r>> hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again=
 to the<br>> ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on lik=
e this during the<br>> first year. If possible, I would always sit close=
 to Bhagavan so I could<br>> hear all of his precious utterances.<br>>=
; <br>> S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decid=
ed that the<br>> Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness.
 Conseq=
uently, one day he<br>> travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a=
 note to Aurobindo<br>> describing who he was, what he wanted from life =
(Self-realization) and where<br>> he was then residing (Sri Ramanasramam=
) . Cohen later showed me the reply he<br>> got from Aurobindo.. It said=
, in brief, that all his aspirations could be<br>> fulfilled at Sri Rama=
nasramam, where he was then living.<br>> <br>> I remember during my s=
econd visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day<br>> reading a leng=
thy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was<br>> Aurob=
indo's Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of<br>=
> this newspaper was Bhagavan's devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed t=
o take<br>> great interest in the review and would occasionally stop rea=
ding and comment<br>> on what he had just read to those sitting around h=
im. When he had concluded<br>> reading it, someone who was
 aware that I=
 had that very book with me, said to<br>> Bhagavan, "This man has come f=
rom the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book<br>> with him." Bhagavan t=
urned to me and said, "Oh, is that so? Let me have a<br>> look at it."<b=
r>> <br>> I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over=
 to Bhagavan.<br>> Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He ke=
pt on reading it well<br>> into the night, with the help of a small oil =
lamp, until he finished it.<br>> <br>> When I came into the hall the =
next day he began discussing the book with me,<br>> telling me that a ce=
rtain term used in the book might look like something<br>> new, but it i=
s actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and<br>> such =
ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing<br>> A=
urobindo's philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood<br>&g=
t; Aurobindo's philosophy both intellectually and also
 from the standpoint=
 of<br>> experience.<br>> <br>> One evening I said to Bhagavan tha=
t the major attraction of Aurobindo's<br>> teachings is that it professe=
s that immortality of the body can be achieved.<br>> Bhagavan made no co=
mment.<br>> <br>> The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and=
 sat down, Bhagavan<br>> looked at me and began saying, "In Kumbhakonam =
there was one yogi, C. V. V.<br>> Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his d=
octrine of the immortality of the<br>> body. He was even so bold as to d=
eclare that Dr. Annie Besant (a<br>> distinguished public and spiritual =
personality in India) would have to come<br>> to him to learn how to mak=
e her body immortal. But, before he had a chance<br>> to meet Dr. Annie =
Besant, he died." This brief story clearly illustrated his<br>> point.<b=
r>> <br>> On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramana=
sramam, I<br>> approached Bhagavan when no
 one was in the hall and show=
ed him that last<br>> letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan ask=
ed me to give it to him to<br>> read. I told him he would be unable to d=
ecipher Aurobindo's handwriting, as<br>> it was very illegible and only =
those who have studied it for sometime could<br>> read it.. He said, "Gi=
ve it to me. Let me try."<br>> <br>> After looking into it and realiz=
ing he could only make out a few words, he<br>> returned it and asked me=
 to read it out. I began reading it and when I came<br>> to the sentence=
, "Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can<br>> achie=
ve only partial realization . . .", Bhagavan stopped me and said,<br>> "=
Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is<=
br>> realization, it is not partial."<br>> <br>> This was the fina=
l blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this<br>> letter, l=
ike all the rest. And because of all the
 discussions I had had with<br>>=
; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a cle=
ar<br>> understanding of where the Maharshi's path and Aurobindo's path =
diverged and<br>> went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts and=
 distractions<br>> dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then knew=
 that I understood and<br>> the foundation work had been done. The purpo=
se of all our discussions were<br>> served and so they stopped automatic=
ally.<br>> <br>> I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan=
 was the power of his<br>> presence. Much of what he taught had already =
been transmitted to the masses<br>> down through the ages. In Bhagavan w=
e found a being that was surcharged with<br>> the Reality to such an ext=
ent that coming into his presence would effect a<br>> dramatic change in=
 us.<br>> <br>> Sources:<br>> <br>> a) <a rel=3D"nofollow" targ=
