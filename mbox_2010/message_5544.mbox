I was once =
taking to someone who is a well-qualified sanskrit scholar
and poet. He rel=
ated the following incident that took place between
his co-student (scholar=
-1) and his teacher (scholar-2) who is a great
pandita.

scholar-1 -- There=
 are so many Panditas these days, but people keep
talking about the scholar=
ship of some particular Pandit (scholar-3).
Is there really such a vast dif=
ference?

scholar-2 -- It is difficult to see the difference, unless you
yo=
urself have deep scholarship. Let me describe this by way of
example. Thoug=
h you yourself are well-qualified, you see the
difference between us. It is=
 like you are seated at the base of the
himalayas, and I am seated at the t=
op. Well, with this Pandita
(scholar-3), I feel the same way. I am seated a=
t the base of the
himalayas, and he is seated on top. But, for the average =
person, or
even a mere scholar, it is almost impossible to tell the differe=
nce.

There are many learned people who have access to a wide range of book=
s
and materials. They concentrate on breadth, and are limited to
scratching=
 the surface. A true scholar on the other hand, looks for
depth. It isn't j=
ust the sheer amount of material that they have
studied -- they have intern=
alized the material to such an extent that
they speak it with every breath.=
 Their way of thinking changes, and
their speech is pramANam.
