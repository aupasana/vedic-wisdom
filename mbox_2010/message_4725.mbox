Talk 146.

In reply to Miss Leena Sarabhai, a cultured=
 Indian lady of high rank,Sri
Bhagavan said: The state of equanimity is the=
 state of bliss. The
declaration in the Vedas =E2=80=98I am This or That=E2=
=80=99, is only an aid to gain
equanimity of mind.

D.: So, it is wrong to =
begin with a goal: is it?

M.: If there be a goal to be reached it cannot b=
e permanent. The goal must
already be there. We seek to reach the goal with=
 the ego, but the goal
exists before the ego. What is in the goal is even p=
rior to our birth, i.e.,
to the birth of the ego. Because we exist the ego =
appears to exist too.

If we look on the Self as the ego then we become the=
 ego, if as the mind we
become the mind, if as the body we become the body.=
It is the thought which
builds up sheaths in so many ways. The shadow on th=
e water is found to be
shaking. Can anyone stop the shaking of the shadow? =
If it should cease to
shake you would not notice the water but only the lig=
ht. Similarly to take
no notice of the ego and its activities, but see only=
 the light behind. The
ego is the I-thought. The true =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 i=
s the Self.

D.: The difficulty is to be in the thought-free state.

M.: Le=
ave the thought-free state to itself. Do not think of it as pertaining
to y=
ou. Just as when you walk, you involuntarily take steps, so too in your
act=
ions; but the thought-free state is not affected by your actions.

In Yoga =
Vasishtha it is said, =E2=80=9CWhat is Real is hidden from us, but what is
=
false, is revealed as true.=E2=80=9D We are actually experiencing the Reali=
ty only;
still, we do not know it. Is it not a wonder of wonders?

The ques=
t =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D is the axe with which to cut off the ego.
