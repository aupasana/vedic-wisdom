Namaste,
=C2=A0
I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami =
Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:
=C2=A0
1) How rel=
iable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=C2=A0is a VERY ques=
tionable organization.
=C2=A0
2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Ni=
tyananda was not practising say some sexual ritual?
=C2=A0
3) What exactly =
is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone=
?
=C2=A0
We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible=
 for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth til=
l death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, wou=
ld=C2=A0probably=C2=A0not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C2=A0i=
s a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different =
from other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.
=C2=A0
Furth=
er, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and comp=
lex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is on=
e going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudish=
ness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. 
=C2=A0
All said and d=
one, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who live=
d - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sa=
dhus and saints?
=C2=A0
And finally, it is q\uite possible that Swami Nitya=
nanda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the id=
ea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her g=
uru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. =
In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas =
for some years.

Namaste KK,

No matter how genuine the video may look, let=
 us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to co=
nclusions as someone said.

* * *

*Even if* his expose on video is genuine=
, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya's web. He is a fa=
ntastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing disp=
osition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simpl=
e and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been =
exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Wh=
o is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?

No matter =
how much one has read, no matter how much one has understood, no matter how=
 much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karmas one has done, no=
 matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how blissful one feel=
s during meditation or most of the time, no matter how elevated one is spir=
itually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a second and you CA=
N fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we ar=
e vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?

* * *

The most i=
mportant thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a =
dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who make=
 good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticin=
g their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by =
name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of =
a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one =
allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one th=
ing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.

* * *

Even if =
a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatso=
ever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, w=
e may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the great=
est liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invali=
d if a person who taught them fell.

* * *

Perhaps an increase of dharma i=
s not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in ke=
y places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her ways=
 are definitely inscrutable.

Best regards,
Narasimha
