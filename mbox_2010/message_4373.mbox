Subject: Ramana Maharshi Explains Why Non-self Is Not Pleasing

Disciple: Is not the non-self also pleasing?

Master: No.

D.: Why not?

M.=
: Not by itself but only as an object of enjoyment for the
individual self,=
 the non-self is dear as husband, wife, child,wealth,
home, pleasing unguen=
ts, sweet scents etc.

D.: Why are they said to be not pleasing by themselv=
es?

M.: Should they be so, they must always remain so. At one time, one
th=
ing is pleasing and at other times, the same thing is nauseating.

D.: How?=


M.: Take a woman, for instance. When the man is lustful,she is fancied
to=
 be pleasing; when he suffers from fever, she is not wanted; for a
man grow=
n desireless, she is of no interest at all. According to
circumstances the =
same woman can be pleasing,unwanted, or of no
interest. The same applies to=
 all other objects of enjoyment. Thus the
non-self cannot be pleasing.
