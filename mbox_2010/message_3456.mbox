      <p><span style=3D"color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-=
family:Verdana;">ALTHOUGH Thayumanavar lived less than 300 years ago and re=
mains the most popular Tamil poet-saint, there is no authentic record of hi=
s date of birth or death. What is known to have transpired between these tw=
o events can be summed up briefly:<br>

<br>At an early age he began workin=
g in the service of a king. When the king died he left this work because of=
 the amorous advances of the king's widow. He then travelled in search of a=
 Guru. <span style=3D"font-weight:bold;">At Tiruchilapalli he met Moun=
a Guru Arulananda Sivachari. He asked to be taken as a disciple, but the sa=
int answered 'chumma iru', meaning 'be still' or 'be quiet' or 'just be' (a=
 phrase which Ramana Maharshi also used on a number of occasions).</span>&n=
bsp;However, the saint said that when the time was ripe he would initiate h=
im.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic;">Thayumanavar then returned =
home and married. Soon after his wife delivered their first child, a boy, s=
he died. That again prompted Thayumanavar to leave home in answer to his sp=
iritual calling. He once more approached Arulananda Sivachari and, true to =
his word, the guru fulfilled his promise and initiated Thayumanavar into sa=
nnyas.</span><br>

<br>Thayumanavar followed the discipline of silence (mou=
na), which he describes as: "that state which spontaneously manifests after=
 the annihilation of the ego." He says: "It is a state beyond light and dar=
kness, but it is called light, since language is inadequate to express it.&=
nbsp;<span style=3D"font-weight:bold;">The ego disappears and 'I' spontaneo=
usly manifests in full glory." The Maharshi particularly singled out this v=
erse of his for admiration</span>.<br>

<br>Thayumanavar was equally great =
as a saint and a poet. Often he would retire to the forest or public garden=
s and remained for days absorbed in the bliss of the Self. Legend has it th=
at he was sitting thus, immobile in samadhi in a public garden in Ramnad wh=
en the gardeners, not noticing him, piled a heap of dry leaves and twigs ab=
out him and set fire to it, and thus his body was consumed and he merged in=
 the Supreme.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold;">Thayumanavar's key=
 teaching is to discipline the mind, control desires and meditate peacefull=
y. He went on to say that "it is easy to control an elephant, catch hold of=
 the tiger's tail, grab the snake and dance, dictate the angels, transmigra=
te into another body, walk on water or sit on the sea; but it is more diffi=
cult to control the mind and remain quiet".</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"=
font-style:italic;">Ramana Maharshi was often heard quoting from his exquis=
ite verses. The following are ten verses especially selected by the Maharsh=
i:</span><br><br>1 & 2. <span style=3D"font-weight:bold;">The indi=
vidual ego known as "I" having manifested and troubled everyone</span>, the=
 universal Maya, the diversifying agency, spontaneously follows in its wake=
. Who can possibly describe the vast ocean of misery consequent upon it? It=
 appears as the flesh, the body, the senses, interior and exterior, as the =
all pervading ether, air, fire, water and earth, as mountain, forest, huge =
visions like hills physical and subtle, as forgetfulness and memory, and so=
 on, rising up wave after wave and beating against man, bringing pleasure a=
nd pain, which are the result of his past actions, and also their remedies =
known as creeds, religions, God-Seeker, and the testimonies and sanctions f=
ound in various sciences, and explained by logic. All these are more numero=
us than even the fine grains of sand on the seashore.<br>

<br>3. Unaccount=
able troubles crop up spontaneously, sheaf upon sheaf. How to root them out=
 wholesale, even as burning up a hill of camphor without residue in a vast =
blaze of fire? In order to achieve this miracle, and to enlighten me, Grace=
 took shape. In every respect, like my self, eating and sleeping, suffering=
 and enjoying, bearing a name and born somewhere, it appeared as the Silent=
 Guru, like a deer used to decoy another of its species.<br>

<br>4. And cl=
aimed my body, possessions and life itself and consistently with the proces=
s of elimination, signified "you are not the five senses nor the five eleme=
nts, nor the limbs, nor the mind, nor their attributes, nor all these colle=
ctively, nor the body nor knowledge nor ignorance. You are pure consciousne=
ss, unassociated like a crystal, but reflecting the background to lookers-o=
n; whereas we (guru) are only the inherent nature revealing the truth on fi=
nding you ripe for it."<br>

<br>5. "If eager to reach Consciousness-<wbr>B=
liss-Eternity innermost in all, which is also the inner abode of refreshing=
 Grace, listen to the course I indicate. May you reach the Pure Heart and a=
bide there forever! May dense ignorance vanish for you! May you attain to B=
liss-Consciousness<wbr>! May bondage cease for you!" Communicating thus,<br=
>

<br>6. "And dispensing the true knowledge of the Natural and Unique Sile=
nce which destroys all bondage and where there is no meditation nor the ego=
, no space, no time, no direction, no association, no elimination, no diffe=
rentiation, no expression, no phenomena of night and day, no end, no beginn=
ing, no middle, no interior or exterior, nor an aggregate of all these."<br=
>

<br>7. (The Guru indicated further) that, though all these are eliminate=
d, "It" is not void, but is Natural, Eternal Be-ing inexpressible by words,=
 not manifesting as ego, but is the Reality engulfing all, having swallowed=
 all ignorance like day covering night, and absorbing unhindered all knowle=
dge, metamorphosing the person into Itself, It shines in Silence, Self-effu=
lgent;<br>

<br>8. With its emergence, It prevents any other from appearing=
; and all else is put out suddenly like burning camphor blown away without =
residual flicker or glow; and in its place It shines beyond the senses, and=
 apart from the knower, known and knowledge; and yet It is there, though wh=
o can speak of it and to whom? For if It arises, the individual is metamorp=
hosed; It will assert Itself (Literally: It Speaks Itself),<br>

<br>9. (An=
