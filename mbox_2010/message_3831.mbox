Respected Sir,

When we say "doctor's money is blood and pus" Does it means=
 that the person who treats a patient (or in case a diseased person)Transmi=
ts the person's karma to himself and will himself pay the karma of the pati=
ent which were to be paid by patient?

For example, A patient (or some othe=
r affected person) has to suffer some karma. But the doctor (or the aghori =
or priest who treats him). Then the karma will be suffered by the doctor  (=
Or the person who treats him). 

or something else? Sorry if I sound stupid=
 

Kind Regards
Atul
