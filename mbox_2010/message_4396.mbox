*15th April, l937

Talk 399.

Mr. Bose, the Bengali Engineer, has since rea=
d Gaudapada Karikas and Sir S.
Radhakrishnan=92s Indian Philosophy and so a=
sked questions as follows:

D.: Is there any genuine difference between dre=
am experience and waking
state?

M.: Because you find the dream creations t=
ransitory in relation to the
waking state there is said to be a difference.=
 The difference is only
apparent and not real.

D.: Is the waking state ind=
ependent of existing objects?

M.: Were it so, the objects must exist witho=
ut the seer; that is to say,the
object must tell you that it exists. Does i=
t do so? For example,does a cow
moving in front of you say that she is movi=
ng? Or do you say of your own
accord =93There is a cow moving=94? The objec=
ts exist because of the seer
cognising them.

D.: Gaudapada in Mandukya Kar=
ikas says that there is no difference between
the two states from the stand=
point of Reality-Absolute.

M.: Of course not.

D.: I believe Bhagavan also=
 says so. Prof. Radhakrishnan in his Indian
Philosophy says that in his Bra=
hma Sutra Commentary Sri Sankara makes a
distinction between the two states=
. Is it a fact? If so, what is it? How can
there be any distinction from th=
e viewpoint of reality? So long as the mind
exists in any form there will b=
e distinction.But from the standpoint of
Atman, non-dual Brahman, can there=
 be any distinction?

M.: The dream is for the one who says that he is awak=
e. In fact,wakefulness
and dream are equally unreal from the standpoint of =
the Absolute.

D.: The dream world is not purposeful as the jagrat world, b=
ecause we do not
feel that wants are satisfied.

M.: You are not right. The=
re are thirst and hunger in dream also. You might
have had your fill and ke=
pt over the remaining food for the next day.
Nevertheless you feel hungry i=
n dream. This food does not help you. Your
dream-hunger can be satisfied on=
ly by eating dream-food. Dream-wants are
satisfied by dream-creations only.=


D.: We recollect our dreams in our jagrat but not vice-versa.

M.: Not ri=
ght again. In the dream you identify yourself with the one now
speaking.

D=
.: But we do not know that we are dreaming as apart from waking as we do
no=
w.

M.: The dream is the combination of jagrat(waking state) and sushupti(D=
eep
dreamless sleep). It is due to the samskaras of the jagrat state. Hence=
 we
remember dreams at present. Samskaras are not formed contrariwise; ther=
efore
also we are not aware of the dream and jagrat simultaneously. Still e=
veryone
will recollect strange perplexities in dream. One wonders if he dre=
ams or is
awake. He argues and determines that he is only awake. When reall=
y awake, he
finds that it was all only a dream.

D : Is it a fact that drea=
ms arise because of the impressions received
during the waking state?

A. N=
o,it is not true.In your dream you see many new things and many new
people =
whom you have never seen before in your walking state.You may even
see a se=
cond dream within the dream.After waking up from the second
dream,you feel =
that you have woken up,but that is the waking state of the
first dream.In t=
he same way,man wakes up daily,but it is not to a real
waking state.
