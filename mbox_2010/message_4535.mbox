Dear Narsimhaji and all respected members          - Namaste





Astrolo=
gers routinely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and
poojas and=
 people spend a lot of money on them.

Do they work? I will give my 2 cents=
 of views based on my experience and
insights. I will be honest, straight-f=
orward and blunt.




=C2=A0

Like
me and all others who respect Shri PVR N=
arsimhaji as a noble, honest,
intelligent, spiritual person and Sanskrit sc=
holar must be feeling sad after
reading contents in the post heading effica=
cy of astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really
painful to read such thing from a=
 person of his status whom lot of people
considered as a good astro-spiritu=
al personality. Though I am not having
scripture references i=E2=80=99ll tr=
y to post my humble protest and request to all
members to understand and st=
udy shastra deeply for better understanding. 

Though believers call priest=
s and get poojas done, in the hope that their
problems will be solved, many=
 priests today are incapable of producing any
results. As a result, some be=
lievers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding
exists even without eati=
ng it and remain hungry throughout life. And some
intelligent people stoppe=
d believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address
why this has come =
to be and then talk about what we should do. 

Results
are produced rather =
bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or deity and
blessings are c=
alled =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [
krupA] Here we think results a=
re produced; so let us understand the method. If
somebody wants good match =
for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to
perform remedy and in tur=
n pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the
focal point is devata, a =
supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=99s
behalf priest p=
ray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire and in return get
paid=
. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator or a technician who
c=
an interact with both parties. And interaction means correct rituals with
a=
ppropriate mantras. So his spiritual or mental strength is not required but=

his skill and knowledge is of prime importance. Can we consider a mortal p=
riest
to bless a yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is the r=
ole of
rituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the huma=
n beings by
devatas as only divinity is capable of this. And many times fru=
its are not
received due to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=
=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87
=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=
=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=
=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga fou=
r
times efforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for d=
oing
bhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy
task on the pa=
rt of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of
yajamana.

If one =
has one million dollars in one's bank account, a check given by one
for tho=
usand dollars is meaningful. If one's bank account is empty, what good
is a=
 thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done=

and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bri=
ng
one any benefits.

=C2=A0

Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from the i=
nbuilt bank balance of deities
and not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine =
energy, called devata can give
million dollar check to unlimited no of peop=
le as GOD has sanctioned rather
appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tr=
adition in vedic rituals in any
pooja with or without homa in the beginning=
 there is one ritual called
aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=
=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means yajamana nominat=
e a
priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the end be=
fore
visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=
=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is performed
in which p=
riest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to yajamana.
Here we=
 can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of deity. As per
ka=
rmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and blessed one get tha=
t
share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can a mortal though =
highly
qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he interacts with many in=
 his lifetime?
This could be possible only for highly evolved soul like sai=
nts and yogis as
due to great penance they do have such powers. But even fo=
r them also some time
loss of spiritual energy leads for further penance. W=
e read lot of stories in
ancient mythology of sages enticed by apsarAs [sup=
erhuman beautiful lady] or if
they cursed some body results in renewed pena=
nces to regain there status.

=C2=A0

One important note: The power is not =
in a combination of syllables (mantra)
or a sequence of physical actions (r=
itual). The power is in the MIND that
FOCUSES on a combination of syllables=
 (mantra) or a sequence of physical
actions (ritual). Energy is generated w=
hen mind overcomes its tendency to
wander and instead focuses on one thing.=
 Different mantras and rituals as the focus
points may generate different k=
inds of energy, but the key is focus. Without
it, no mantra or ritual produ=
ces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice.
Most priests are just eng=
aging in casual practice when they go and do poojas.
In the old days, pries=
ts did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the
table when they did r=
ituals at the houses of people or in temples.

=C2=A0

=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=

=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 =C2=A0are two different things. This science of
mantra and =
devata is not easy to understand. Divinity is beyond logic and human
mind i=
s not capable to experience it easily. As per smruti =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=
=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=
=A4=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 is a dictum. We are ha=
ving four types of
vak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI and parA [=
=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80,
=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=
=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=82=
=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE] and last one is the most s=
ubtle and
imp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus which origin=
ates from
naval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of universe. This is p=
uran based
concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are having same =
concept with
different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak is at naval =
and creator
brahma creates this world with the help of saraswati and sarsaw=
ati is nothing
but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=
=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables. When =
two unknown person meets first
time how they get connected? Through communi=
cation and thought is a form of
vak, pashyanti. First there is desire to kn=
ow each other and then communication
starts. And in communication if some b=
ody express negativity communication
stops. So for communication soft speec=
h, good words, etc are imp. So how can we
assume that mantra or rituals are=
 of no importance? These show qualities, tools
necessary to get connected w=
ith devatas in right perspective. In scriptures
every syllable is assigned =
colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of that
syllable resulting in t=
ypical energy. To be precise power rest with desire and
mind is a mere tool=
 to channalise that power and strength of desire will decide
depth of focus=
ed mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of priest and
blessings are fr=
om pleased devata. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage
parAsharA rec=
ommended various rituals of various devatas for removing bad
effects of bad=
 dashas or bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and
rituals do not =
count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. 

To consider spiritua=
l aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have
dharanA like a soli=
d rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not
require mantra or =
tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can
do work. Norma=
l people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of
patanjali=
 like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these
all =
steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tantra,
=
nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many many things cou=
nt. =C2=A0

=C2=A0

=C2=A0This whole confusion is due to
Narsimhaji=E2=80=
=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality and he is doing this with pure
hea=
rt. Yes, focus mind is one of the factors in this whole exercise. Many have=

seen shatachandI or mahArudra anushathAna where many priest at a time read=
 or
chant mantras with different level of mind focus still yajamana get fru=
its of
it in terms of desires. This is because devata is pleased by offerin=
gs, japa
and hOme which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.=C2=
=A0 For spirituality focus, pure heart and
continuous efforts are of prime =
importance but for getting our desires to be
fulfilled we need correct proc=
edure, appropriate deity and correct mantra.

=C2=A0It is a hype of old great priests which we
constantly =

also always fruits were given by pleased devatas due to offer=

 priest was and is a
personal advantage due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=

=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 ] surroundings, time and environmen=
ts but we must not let go real ethics,
morals, rules of our ancient proved =
traditions. =C2=A0

Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious mat=
ter and only a
trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved t=
o become quite
complicated over the time too! However, complexity of ritual=
s should never be a
deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000=
 calories everyday, 40 grams
of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Su=
ppose you have no access to such
balanced food. Will you starve yourself un=
til you find a balanced meal or will
you manage with whatever you have? If =
you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)
and rice,

you will simply eat it=
. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do
not know the "perfect w=
ay" to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait
till you know the perfect way.=
 You can start with what you know. It will only
give you energy.

The fear =
to do rituals without "perfect knowledge" stems from the
notion that some m=
antras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally
baseless, but i=
t is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind on some
mantras and=
 rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a high
level o=
f spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give
sp=
ecific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such=

things in this age.

=C2=A0

Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and sh=
ould be done by experts only
as these are for special purposes and should b=
e done by trained people. There
are hundreds of ways for GOD realization an=
d a single way to fulfill our
desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know how to dri=
ve a car why opt for a fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elders, gurus=
 have sanctioned it
then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden anything b=
ut due to loss of energy
in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. for removi=
ng karmic blocks we feel we
need more energy and we are not getting it. Yes=
, we should not wait for perfect
thing as perfection is subjective matter b=
ut we must read study, think, analyze
before accepting any concept. I do fu=
lly agree with homA sadhana concept as
this is one of the best ways for acc=
eleration according to my experiences in my
twenties but it is for spiritua=
lity and for desires to get full filled through
deities every thing counts.=


=C2=A0

=C2=A0

Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of d=
ifferent shapes.
They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begg=
ing bowl you use, you
may be given different kind of alms. But it is import=
ant to start begging with
some begging bowl or the other, instead of spendi=
ng years looking for the
perfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting for astro=
logers with half-baked or
ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect m=
antra or ritual, do what your
heart tells you or what your guru (or an elde=
r you respect) tells you.

=C2=A0

WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but anshA =
of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8D=E0=
=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human being is the best creati=
vity
of HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to realize HIM. In=
 this
journey we may face many types of different obstacles due to our karm=
a and to
surpass them HE has given us power and rights to use our intellect=
, mind for
healthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma done for thi=
s in a pious
manner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfilled our desi=
res we do have a
relationship of respect, love, gratitude with devatas. Beg=
gars don=E2=80=99t have any
feelings for donors instead they even don=E2=80=
=99t remember them. We are =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=B8=E0=

ldren of
divinity. 

Yes, unfortunately there are lot of fake astrologers, =
gurus etc. who are
misguiding people;but again there is satyuga in kaliyuga=
. And for everybody,
karma counts resulting in happenings of life.

=C2=A0

panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahas=

are *generic* and can work for
anyone for any purpose.

There
are many gene=
ric mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for a sample list)
that are=
 appliable to everybody and can

solve
ALL problems. For example, Vishnu sa=
hasranaama stotra explicitly says it can
solve ANY problem. Instead of look=
ing for a

"perfect
mantra recommendation", you can pick a generic mantra l=
ike that and start
sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.

If
your kaar=
mik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy may be enough
to mo=

seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to=
 spread concept of homa in this world.
Yes, as this concept is blessed by d=
ivine mother homa is going to be popular
sadhana in coming years. In his an=
xiety to spread this blessing he is
contradicting his own words. Mantras do=
 have vargabheda and can be broadly
categorized as=C2=A0 shrutimantra,
smri=
timantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We can broadly classify sa=
vitur
gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as smrutinmantra; vishnusahastra=
nam as
puranmantra and shabarimantra[created by great navanath yogis] as va=
radamantra.
The term generic is itself illusive. Every devata, every mantra=
 is assigned
different power, different work by cosmic mother. It is HER wi=
sh for this
classification. =E0=A4=89=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=95=

can give desirable=
 fruits, how can we achieve this and last but imp how this
happen should be=
 focal point here. Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by
removing ka=
rmic blocks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures we
can ach=
ieve this and this happens due to generated punya in this whole
exercise. F=
or full filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to remove
karmic=
 blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must have exact
tool=
s in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generation of
pun=
ya in real timeframe. 

Let us have a quick look at Narsimhji=E2=80=99s pos=
t on
remedy for begetting a child. He has suggested main remedy as santango=
pal

mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he suggested
that? If every man=
tra from his generic list can do this he should have suggested
any one. As =
per the shashtra the analogy should be like this. Here we will
sidetrack de=
pth of karma as this is near impossible to understand =E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=
=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=
=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a
childless couple a=
ged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need
a baby. Snatan=
gopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible for
sustenance=
 of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itself is
self ex=
planatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp it will
generate=
 punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic mantra is
capabl=
e of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is timeframe. If
we=
 do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy to have all
pleas=
ures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends upon the
individual=
. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing so we need
that e=
nergy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will be
ca=
pable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give child but in
=
next birth as specific form of punya required to beget a baby will be
accum=
ulated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole life time. As
=
said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next birth includin=
g
baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said cause of baby=

leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden hammer to fix a n=
ail
it might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer can do this in fi=
ve
minutes. This science, not logic is behind different mantra, rituals san=
ctioned
by sages for different purposes as karma is never generic.

Dear Na=
rsihmaji you are doing very noble karma in a
sattvic manner so thousands wi=
ll read you, hundreds will follow you; so for
them and to our scientific sp=
iritual tradition i think you should do justice by
rethinking on this topic=
. I myself read your spiritual post with respect but in
this matter you mis=
s the target. =C2=A0

self explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp=

generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic=
 mantra is
capable of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is=
 timeframe. If
we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy =
to have all
pleasures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends up=
on the
individual. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing =
so we need
that energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely tha=

capable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will g=

said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in ne=

baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for s=

leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden =
hammer to fix a nail
it might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer =
can do this in five
minutes. This science, not logic is behind different ma=
