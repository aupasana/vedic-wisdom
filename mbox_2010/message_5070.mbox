Namaste,

Correct.

Vaishnavas eulogized Vishnu, Sha=
ivas eulogized Shiva."

Well understanding and interpretation of the Vedas =
can be questioned, but this 
so called "attack" is harldy an attack. It is =
different interpretations.

=C2=A0"What is left intact in Hinduism without =
recognizing the foundation that is 
Vedas, and without recognizing our weak=
ness of Eulogizing human in name of 
divine ? "

Who=C2=A0does not recogniz=

Vedas? Also, worship=
ping real spiritual men and women who have attained the 
highest states of =
spirituality is well accepted and a well regarded practise of 
Sanatana Dha=
rma. There is absolutely nothing "un-vedic" about it. Vedas are not 
a book=
 of rules, or a book of history, or law, or dos and don'ts. They only 
desc=
ribe spiritual states in allegorical terms without any frills. To comprehen=
d 
that what one needs is sadhana and only sadhana. In this respect, a lot =
of the
