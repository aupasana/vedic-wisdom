 "The Bible itself says, "the kingdom of
God is within you."
If you conside=
r yourself to be the body,
there is some difficulty in understanding
this s=
tatement.
On the other hand,
if you know who you really are,
the Kingdom of=
 Heaven and all
are included;
in your true Self."

[from] Talks with Ramana=
 Maharshi

-recorded, Jan 2, 1937-

"By association with Sages comes non-at=
tachment,
from non-attachment comes freedom from desire;
from desirelessnes=
s comes mental stillness,
from mental stillness comes freedom from the ego.=
"

"The Self is always pure and unaffected,
the impurities affect only the =
ego."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 16, 1936-

"Your v=
ery being is bliss.
....that means one remains in the primal
uncontaminated=
 state in sleep.
As for sorrow, there is none.
Where is it [?] in order tha=
t you
might speak of its absence in sleep?
The present wrong identification=
 of
the Self with the body
gives rise to all these misapprehensions.

Your =
nature is happiness.
You say that is not apparent.
See what obstructs you f=
rom your true Being."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi
-recorded Dec 14, =
1936-

"When you contemplate, the other
thoughts disappear. So long as you
=
need to contemplate, there are other
thoughts. WHERE ARE YOU?

You should m=
erge yourself into
the Source. What is contemplation?
It is to merge into t=
he source
consciously. Then the fear of
death will disappear, because
you a=
re able to merge into the
source consciously.

Why fear death?
Death cannot=
 mean non-being.
And the consciousness is beyond
relative consciousness or =
uncon-
sciousness."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Dec 26, =
1936-

"Why do you wish to meditate at all? Since you wish to do so,
you ar=
e told, 'fixing the mind in the Self'. Why do you not
remain as you are wit=
hout meditating? What is that mind?
When all thoughts are eliminated, it be=
comes fixed in the Self."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, De=
c 14, 1936-

"Self inquiry leads to realization by
removing the obstacles w=
hich make
you think that the Self is not already
realized."

"I do not ask =
anyone to come, nor ask
him to go. Everyone pleases himself here.
He says h=
e finds peace in the Hall and he
also wants a job. Evidently, the job must
=
be found in the Hall itself so that his peace
may not be disturbed.
Peace i=
s not in the Hall.
It is in the repose of the Self,
It can be gained anywhe=
re."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Dec 23 & 25, 1936-


"K=
arma has its fruits. They are
like cause and effect. The inter-
relation of=
 a cause and its effect
is due to a power whom we call God.

Oblivion and m=
emory are only thought
forms. They will alternate so long as
there are thou=
ghts.
But Reality lies beyond these.

Find out who does not realize
and wha=
t he does not realize.
Then it will be clear;
there is no ignorance."

[fro=
m] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 30, 1936-

"You are the Self.=

The Self is eternally realized.
Otherwise, there will be no pleasure in it=
.
If it is not eternal,
it must have a beginning;
what begins will also end=
,
so it is only transient.
There is no use seeking for a temporary state of=
 affairs.
The fact is, that it is the state of effort-less,
ever alert Peac=
e.
Effortlessness while remaining aware is the state of Bliss;
and THAT is =
the state of REALIZATION.
