Shri Narasimha ji, and others who may help

I have read that the vedas say =
that only grihastas and up should perform homams, yagnas, etc. Also I have =
read the same about agnihotra which I have been performing on and off for t=
he past almost 2 years?

Should I not do these practices if I desire to get=
 married, should I wait until (if) I do to continue?

Please advise me on t=
his as if I do get married it may be soon enough to take a break if I must.=


Thanks for your time
