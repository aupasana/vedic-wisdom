Dear chaudhuri.krishnendu ji,

Thank you for your suggestions.

1st 'ly I w=
ould like to apologise, as I could not reply back on this mail earlier.


I=
 am trying to go through the Homa Procedure and its mantras in what ever li=
ttle time am getting. I wanted be prefect with pronunciation of mantras and=
 its procedures, before I practically perfrom Homa.

Once am done with prac=
ticising these procedures and mantra reciting, I would start the Homa.

Can=
 you suggest some best day and time, to perfrom these Homa.


Secondly, I w=
ould like to thank Mr. Narshima Ji, I went through his Homa details , and v=
arious topics discussed on his website, I have a strang positive feeling wh=
ich says, their is some positve energy developing within me.

And today, I =
got to hear some good news, which is related to me and I would rather discl=
ose it, once I get a conformation. I have a feeling these things are happen=
ing because of reading the mantras and various good topics discussed here i=
n this forum.


I would like to thank one and all, who are contributing to =
these forums, and I promise to one and all, I would contribute these good t=
o all the people whom I new and try to help in what ever way i could.


tha=
nk you,

Regards,
Vishal.

n't afraid about the details procedure seen in the video, its hard to follo=
w all the details with perfection in first attempt, go through the manual w=
here you can find the shortest/simplest version of the Ganapati Homam "Supe=
r-Short Homam Procedure".. .start with that simplest version and eventually=
 incorporate part-by-part from the main homam procedure, writeup of mantras=
 in your own language sometimes makes things simpler...
