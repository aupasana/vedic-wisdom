Namaskaram Narsimha garu,

Can you please explain to me about the nature of=
 Goddess Mahalakshmi? I am practising detachment from money. During this pr=
ocess I have frequently observed anything I speak about money she gets hurt=
 as I immediately see some financial loss. If one says I don't want money i=
t is like offending the Goddess and when one says I want money it becomes d=
esire. So how to detach mind from money the right way? I am spiritually con=
nected to that Goddess and have seen her visions almost all my life and don=
't wish to hurt her in anyway. I am also sorry if my question sounds silly =
but whatever I am today is only because of your teachings. I don't have muc=
h spiritual knowledge and neither do I get time to read books. I rely compl=
etely on your teachings and any words of wisdom coming from you would be of=
 great help. Kindly guide,

Thanks and Best regards,
Priya
