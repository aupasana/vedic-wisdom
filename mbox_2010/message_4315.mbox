 The real nature of this Arunachala Hill the ocean of grace divine, is to
b=
estow liberation on those who contemplates on it in their heart.

*One who =
circumambulates this holy hill, on Sunday becomes liberated.
Piercing throu=
gh the solar disc, he shall go to Siva=E2=80=99s City. The man who
circumam=
bulates on Monday attains immunity from old age and death. One who
circumam=
bulates on Tuesday becomes free from all indebtedness. He shall
certainly b=
ecome an Emperor.The man who circumambulates the Lord of Arunadri
on Wednes=
day shall attain omniscience and become lord of eloquence. One who
circumam=
bulates on Thursday shall be bowed by all the Devas. He shall be the
precep=
tor of the worlds. One who circumambulates on Friday shall attain
great for=
tune and thereafter the region Vishnu. One who goes round the hill
on Satur=
day shall be rid of the tortures caused by evil spirits and adverse
planets=
 and becomes the conqueror of the entire universe.*

Significance of the Be=
acon: Getting rid of the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea and
turning t=
he mind inwards and merging it in the Heart to realize the real,
non-dual a=
nd effulgent Self, is the real significance of seeing the beacon
of light o=
n Annamalai, the centre of the universe.

This Arunachala is destructive of=
 all the sins of men through
circumambulation prostrations, recollections, =
worships and eulogies.

On seeing the peak of Arunachala people will not on=
ly have the benefit of
having their eyes but also the destruction of all si=
ns and the acquisition
of the vision born of wisdom.

A person desirous of =
salvation shall stay in the holy place Aruna and
worship Aruneswara. He sho=
uld repeat the mantra of Arunesvara with great
respect. If anyone wishes fo=
r anything he should circumambulate Arunachala
on foot. He shall obtain aus=
piciousness immediately.

When one sneezes falters and slips sees and bad d=
ream or is highly delighted
or if a great danger is imminent, the learned m=
an should utter the name of
=E2=80=98Arunasankara=E2=80=99.

Neither the de=
fects of Kali nor the eruptions of ailments and worries will
be present the=
re where the Linga named Arunachala.

How can the mind go insane or lose it=
s powers on the path of vichara that
leads to the clarification of consciou=
sness and the attainment of
tranquility? (Guru Vachaka Kovia 745)

The loss=
 of ego can never be fully and perfectly accomplished by the jivas
through =
sadanas alone. (648)

So long as distinctions persist in your viewing of th=
e world. Self-abidance
(Atma-nishta) is indispensable. (765)

Spoken words =
are of no use what soever if the eyes of the Guru Meet the eyes
if the disc=
iple. The highest form of grace is silence. It is also the
highest upadesa.=


Know the pure state (suddha) as your own real nature, by keenly observing=

the interval between two thoughts. (760)

That which dwells within as the =
supreme Self is indeed that which sports
before (you) as pure consciousness=
. (656)

There are no effective means other than vichara to chase out the e=
go from
within you and kill it. (885)

The delusion-filled mind has caused =
samsara to merge with you. It will cease
when that mind is completely destr=
oyed. (920)

That which is termed omniscience is associated with delusion b=
ecause in
reality no kind of objectified knowing exists. (926)

Until the f=
alse appearance of the snake goes, the underlying truth, the rope
will not =
shine. Until the false world-appearance becomes non-existent, the
underlyin=
g reality, the truth, the swarupa, will not reveal itself. (876)

Truly vas=
anas are association (sanga). You should therefore know that their
extincti=
on is the total abandonment of all association. (912)

The Vedas proclaim t=
hat God is omniscient only for the sake of those who are
confused thinking =
that they possess limited knowledge. When carefully
examined, (it will be k=
now that) God does not at any time know anything
because in his very nature=
 he is the fullness of being (umnai pooranam).
(930)

Whatever experiences =
are gained by any being, from any object is nay place,
if they are enquired=
 into, they (the experiences) will be known to really
fractions of the expe=
rience of the Self. (945)

If a state is being experienced as something new=
, because that state is not
one=E2=80=99s own, it will definitely go away. =
The Self that is in the beginning and
in the end exists in the intervening =
time also, as that which is. (887)

The cause of all miseries is the impure=
 vasana, the belief that holds the
body to be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. (954)

F=
eeling anger and hatred in the mind on account of blind fanaticism towards
=
one=E2=80=99s own religion is a cruel and ignoble deed. (991)

Until the ji=
va knows that its own essential nature is matchless bliss, it
will, like th=
e must deer, be confused. (1028)

Those who are experiencing the excellent =
bliss of samadhi knowing their real
name, will not get deluded by what is f=
alse and then seek objects perceived
by the five senses. (947)

Since mauna=
 (stillness of mind) the culmination of knowledge, is their
common nature, =
all religions are acceptable as a means to advaitic truth,
which shines uni=
que and pure, they are therefore not opposed to the
wonderful Vedanta (endi=
ng of knowledge). (989)

Unlike a blossoming lotus that closed (during the =
night), the Heart-lotus
which has blossomed after the untying of the ignobl=
e knot, will never close
again. (1124)

Nothing happens except that which i=
s divinely ordained. Consequently it is
pointless for people (who want the =
world to be different) to experience
anxiety and to be debilitated by distr=
ess. (1191)

God, the extremely intense, true and supreme grace, takes ten =
steps
(towards) the devotee) when the devotee takes one step (towards God).=
 (965)

Looking at you from within the Self, I never leave you. How can thi=
s fact be
known to your externalized vision. (Sri Bhagavan, 966)

The teach=
ings of true jnanis who are established in the experience (of the
Self) wil=
l bestow the light of truth on those who mediate on them (the
teachings) in=
 their heart. (1159)

Other than by hearing and knowing it from the lips of=
 those who have seen
and known it, we know of no other =E2=80=98royal road =
to realizing jnana.=E2=80=99 (1158)

When enduring true bliss exists and fi=
les the heart to the brim, it is an
error of ego to fell distress. (969)

K=
now that suffering is only in the bewildered vision of the jiva that has
be=
en grabbed by the stupidity of becoming attached to the false ego. (952)

S=
o long as you are seeking something other than yourself as the agent for
ga=
ining bliss, there is no bliss of you. (1026)

Only as long as the mind sur=
vived will there be religion. When the mind
attains silence, religion also =
will cease. (993)

Nothing that is worth grieving over ever happens to you.=
 Examine your real
nature. (953)

The radiance of consciousness-bliss in th=
e form of one awareness shining in
the same way within and without is the s=
upreme and blissful primal reality
whose form in silence and which is decla=
red by jnanis to be the final and
incontrovertible state of true knowledge.=
