Namaste,
 
Yes, this is a reasonable substitute for Satya Narayana vratam. =
If you want, you could add aahutis for loka palakas also (OM gaNapataye swa=
ahaa, OM brahmaNe swaahaa, OM lakShmyai swaahaa, OM viShNave swaahaa, OM ru=
draaya swaahaa, OM gauryai swaahaa).
 
Manish specifically mentioned to me =
that Ganapathi homam, Chandi homam and Vishnu sahasra naama homam are very =
important in this age and we need several people doing them regularly. Gana=
pathi homam and Chandi homam seem to have caught on and a critical mass of =
people are already doing them. This will only increase with time. I hope Vi=
shnu sahasra naama homam also catches on. Many people know how to chant Vis=
hnu sahasra naama stotra and doing a homam with it adds only 10 minutes to =
the chanting time! Of course, if one wants to make it longer, one can repea=
t a few times.
 
Vishnu's 1000 name prayer is very powerful and charges one=
 with saattwik energy, a sense of dharma and purpose in life.
 
Best regard=
s,
Narasimha

I am really happy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vishnu Homam at m=

nted me to perform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But since I did not=
 know how to do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not inclined to get d=
etails on Sudarsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Narasimha here bef=
ore as a homam for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik homam like Vish=
nuHomam and suggested the same. They agreed and we first did a Ganapathi Ho=
mam and then proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short break. Indeed it =
was a great experience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranamam and offering=
 Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot and half in h=
eight with just three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonderful sight). Thi=
s is very similar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahutis to navagraha=
s, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the 'Pancha Loka Palaka P=
ooja' and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vishnu homam, a=
ll the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam is a good subst=
itute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if one is falling =
short of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?
