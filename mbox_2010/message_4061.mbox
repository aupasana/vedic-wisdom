 Ranvir wrote the following memoirs about his father and his own early
visi=
ts to Sri Ramanasramam before he was absorbed into the Feet of his
Master o=
n April 8, 1999.

MY grandfather was a very religious man known to sing bha=
jans the whole
night long. He was also very well read and used to read the =
daily
newspapers. In one of the newspapers of the early 1930's he read an a=
rticle
about Ramana Maharshi, who was said to be a Self-realized man living=
 in
Tiruvannamalai. He cut out the article with an intention to visit Sri
R=
amanasramam. He tried his best but could not make it. He kept that cutting
=
for few years and then showed it to his son, Hari Chand Khanna, who was the=
n
living in Kanpur, working for the Oriental Insurance Company.

My father =
Hari Chand Khanna was born in the year 1905 in a small village
called Satgh=
ara, which is now part of Pakistan. He was a hard working man.
He first wor=
ked for the Indian railways and then joined an Insurance
company.

One summ=
er vacation, my uncle from Bibana, Madhya Pradesh, invited my father
to com=
e with his family for a visit. My uncle was then serving in the
Railways in=
 Bibana. My father agreed to the proposal and our family visited
my uncle. =
After two days in Bibana my father made inquiries as to how to
reach Tiruva=
nnamalai and then set out on his own, leaving our family with my
uncle. If =
my memory serves me right, this took place in 1939.

On reaching Kanpur my =
father smashed all the liquor bottles and liquor
glasses in his possession.=
 He had always been an outgoing man, but now he
started spending much more =
time at home reading Ramana's books and in
meditation.

We used to spend al=
most a month at the Ashram. I was six or seven when we
first started visiti=
ng the Ashram. At that time Bhagavan's brother,
Niranjanananda Swami, was t=
he sarvadhikari looking after the Ashram.

During those early visits, I rem=
ember that every night we would find father
missing from his bed. Then he w=
ould return in the morning, saying he was
with Bhagavan through the night, =
and if Bhagavan didn't sleep, he also kept
awake. He considered it the grea=
test good fortune to be able to spend his
nights with his Guru in the Old H=
all.

Often large bus loads of pilgrims would come to Tiruvannamalai during=
 the
night for Bhagavan's darshan. The pilgrims would wait until dawn for t=
he
doors of the Old Hall to be opened. When Bhagavan noticed that, he asked=
 the
sarvadhikari to keep the doors open all the time. After that the doors=
 to
his room were kept open all the time. Devotees would enter through one =
door,
have darshan and exit from the other door.

Our annual visits went on=
 for some years, but then were suspended for a few
years for reasons unknow=
n to me, though my father was in constant touch with
the Ashram. When again=
 we resumed the annual visits to the Ashram, my father
would sometimes carr=
y bottles of the Ayurvedic medicine (Mahanarayan oil)
for Bhagavan. Bhagava=
n had rheumatism in his legs and could not walk
properly. No sooner was Bha=
gavan given the bottles of medicine than he would
announce then and there t=
hat Khanna has brought Mahanarayan Oil, which
relieves pain in the legs, an=
d anyone with pain in their legs could make
free use of the same.

In those=
 days the Ashram's financial condition was not good. My father would
send m=
oney to the Ashram regularly when there was a need.

At the Ashram I rememb=
er feeling very happy when Bhagavan played with my
younger sister Kusum, wh=
o was then maybe a year old. Bhagavan would hold one
end of his staff, whil=
e Kusum played with the other. Bhagavan would laugh
and pull the staff away=
 as the child reached out for it. Bhagavan used to
call her Jhansi Ki Rani,=
 after the courageous queen of Jhansi, who died
fighting the British in the=
 first war of independence in 1857. Afterwards, I
used to tease Kusum with =
that name.

Immediately after Ramana Maharshi's Mahanirvana, my father rush=
ed to the
town and bought a very large, beautiful garland for Bhagavan's bo=
dy. When he
reached the Ashram, a dispute between different groups was goin=
g on as to
who would be the first to garland the Maharshi's body. On seeing=
 my father,
both the Brahmins and non Brahmins amicably settled that Khanna=
, one of the
oldest and staunchest devotees, must be allowed to garland Bha=
gavan's body
first. Thus my father was the first to garland the deceased bo=
dy of Ramana.

My father always used to say that all his desires have been =
fulfilled by God
and that his last one wish was to die at his Father's Feet=
, Arunachala. I
used to question as to how that is possible because he is a=
 karma yogi and
always in Kanpur. My father would always reply: "We will se=
e." In spite of
this, I was stunned when my father passed away at the Ashra=
m in good health.

Funeral rites were performed by me and others from the A=
shram. The Ashram
has honored him with a samadhi within the Ashram compound=
, and a yearly puja
is done by the Ashram at his tomb.

During his life, my=
 father's earnest desire was to explain Bhagavan's
teachings to all who vis=
ited him at his house in Kanpur. He considered
Bhagavan's teachings to be t=
he simplest and the best. He also stressed that
if one wanted to lead a hap=
py and contented life, then the only way was to
follow the teachings of Sri=
 Bhagavan. Also, whenever he visited someone, he
would explain the same. He=
 used to tell everyone, and especially his
children, not to be outgoing but=
 to turn inward and enjoy one's true
nature. He used to impress upon his ch=
ildren not to strive for material
wealth, which one has to leave behind aft=
er death, but instead to aspire for
the real, everlasting spiritual wealth,=
 as taught by Sri Bhagavan Ramana.
