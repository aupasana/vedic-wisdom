Hello,

I agree with Rajarshi Ji.

In total about 60% of world's total prot=
ein need is fulfilled by non-vegetarian sources that too very cheap as comp=
ared to vegetarian sources. Practically it is impossible to shift all the p=
opulation to vegetarian sources without triggering riots for food.

I belie=
ve that a person should choose his dietary habits based on his varna (aptit=
ude and attitude) and more specifically, on his Goal in life.

Regards
Atul=
