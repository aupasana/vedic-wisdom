 The mind is nothing other than the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. The mind and the e=
go are one and
the same. The others, [i.e. the other two antahkaranas or in=
ner organs] the
intellect and chittam [the storehouse of tendencies] are on=
ly this. Mind
[manas], intellect [buddhi], the storehouse of tendencies [ch=
ittam] and ego
[ahankara]; all these are only the one mind itself. This is =
like different
names [such as son, husband, father, clerk, Hindu, etc.] bei=
ng given to a
man according to his different functions. The individual soul=
 is nothing but
this mind or ego=E2=80=A6

The =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 =
which rises in this manner appears in the form of the three
gunas, and of t=
hese three, the rajas and tamas aspects cling to and identify
with the body=
. The remaining one which is pure sattva is alone the natural
characteristi=
c of the mind, and this stands clinging to the reality.
However, in this pu=
re sattvic state, the =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 is no longer really a
tho=
ught, it is the Heart itself.

'The wise understand the apparent meaning of=
 prajnana [consciousness] to be
the mind, and its true meaning to be the He=
art. The Supreme is not other
than the Heart. ' (Sri Ramana Gita, V. 18)

S=
ri Bhagavan is saying that when the mind is active, that is, dominated by
r=
ajas and tamas, identification with the body takes place, but when the mind=

is quiet and still, that is, in its pure sattvic state, it subsides into t=
he
Heart until only the Heart remains. Sri Bhagavan has stated in the
quota=
tions from Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospel and Self Enquiry that were given earli=
er
in this article that the mind is nothing other than the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99-thought.

When this =E2=80=98I-thought identifies itself with objects, =
the rajasic and tamasic
mind arises, but when the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thoug=
ht alone remains, it can be termed the
sattvic mind. However, Sri Bhagavan =
states in this section that the term
=E2=80=98sattvic mind=E2=80=99 is some=
thing of a misnomer, for when only the feeling of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99
remai=
ns, the mind has ceased to exist.

Sri Bhagavan often stated that the bigge=
st obstacle to Self-realisation is
the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea=
. Since he states here that a mind dominated by
rajas and tamas identifies =
with and clings to the body, a rajasic or a
tamasic mind is obviously an un=
productive vehicle for sadhana. According to
Sri Bhagavan, realisation is o=
nly attained by abiding in the sattvic state.
However, since the mind has c=
eased to exist in this state, one cannot say
that abidance in this state is=
 abidance in the mind; rather, it is abidance
in the state where the mind i=
s absent.

When the mind, the distinctive knowledge that rises from the non=
-distinctive
state of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, clings to and identifies with th=
e Self, it is called true
knowledge. It may also be called =E2=80=98knowled=
ge which is the movement of the
mind in the form of the Self=E2=80=99 or =
=E2=80=98knowledge in an unbroken form=E2=80=99. The state
in which this pu=
re sattvic mind shines clinging to the Self is called
=E2=80=98aham-sphuran=
a=E2=80=99.

In this passage Sri Bhagavan is describing the state where the=
 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 feeling
alone remains and clings to the Self. This sta=
te is not the final state of
realisation, for in this state there is still =
the dualistic feeling that
there is an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that is clinging=
 to the Self.Bhagavan calls this state the
=E2=80=98aham-sphurana=E2=80=99 =
and it may be described as the subjective experience of the
feeling of =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 that manifests when the mind is quiet and still.

This sph=
urana cannot remain independently apart from the reality, but it is
the cor=
rect sign that indicates the forthcoming direct experience of that
reality.=
 The source to which this sphurana clings alone is called the
reality or pu=
re consciousness. In Vedanta this is expressed by the saying
=E2=80=98prajn=
anam Brahma=E2=80=99, or pure consciousness is the absolute reality. When t=
he
pure sattvic mind abides in that sphurana and attends to its source, it =
is
called upasana or meditation; when one is firmly established in the stat=
e
which is the source of that mind, this is called jnana.

'During the time=
 of practice the natural state is called upasana
[meditation], and when tha=
t state becomes firmly and permanently established
it is called jnana.=E2=
=80=99 (Sri Ramana Gita, 1.13)

=E2=80=A6Therefore, leaving the corpse-like=
 body as an actual corpse, and remaining
without even uttering the word =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 by mouth, if one now keenly enquires
=E2=80=98What is it t=
hat rises as I?=E2=80=99, then in the heart a certain soundless
sphurana, =
=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99 [that is, an awareness which is single and undivided,=
 the
thoughts which are many and divided having disappeared], alone will sh=
ine
forth of its own accord.If one remains still without leaving it, even t=
he
sphurana [having completely annihilated the sense of the individuality, =
the
form of the ego =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99], will itself in the en=
d subside, just like
the flame that catches the camphor. This alone is said=
 to be liberation by
great ones and scriptures.

In the same way that a pie=
ce of camphor, once it has caught fire, will not
subside until the last tra=
ce of camphor is burnt, so when the aham sphurana
is experienced it will no=
t subside until the last trace of the ego is
destroyed. That is, when the m=
ind or =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought turns 180 degrees away from
the non-Self=
 and turns towards the Self, it is caught in the grip of the
Self. After th=
is, it cannot turn towards the non-Self again. This is the
state of sphuran=
a, which is the correct sign indicating that the reality is
about to be exp=
erienced directly.

But since in this state there is still a feeling of att=
ending to the Self,
this sphurana is not actually the Self, the reality; th=
e reality is the
source to which this sphurana attends or clings. When even=
 this feeling of
attending to the Self subsides, the sphurana itself subsid=
es, and only being
remains. This state, in which even the slightest trace o=
f the ego or
individuality has been completely annihilated, is called liber=
ation, the
direct experience of the reality, or the natural state of the Se=
lf
(sahajatma sthiti).

In Self Enquiry (Chapter 7) Sri Bhagavan says:

The=
 mind alone is the kundalini. It is described otherwise as a serpent only
f=
or those having a gross outlook. The six yogic centres and so on are all
on=
ly mental imaginations and are meant only for beginners in yoga.The same
co=
mments apply equally well to the description of the Heart as a
downward-fac=
ing lily-bud.
