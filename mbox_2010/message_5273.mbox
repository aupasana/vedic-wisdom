Bhupendra Jamnadas Ji

I would like to just share some information regardin=
g the question you had asked in the previous post. 

"While I am on this su=
bject of success in sadhana, I do the Super Short version of the homa on a =
weekly basis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, I see that it=
 makes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you in Boston, we h=
ave a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass let alone darbh=
a during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in a pot?=
 If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? "



Dried Darbh=
a grass is available in Northern america in most of the Hindu temples . Ple=
ase do enquire with the priest of your nearby temple and they would be able=
 to assist you with that, just a google search revealed two devi temples in=
 Ontario ( Durga and Bhuvaneswari temples ) and looks like coincidentally a=
 major Chandi homam is ongoing in the Durga temple right now. They would su=
rely be carrying darbha grass , you could procure a bunch from them for yea=
r long use.


Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
