Shri Narasimha ji,
  Namaste,
  please forgive me for asking few silly ques=
tions. Some of my questions are already answered in your post, but I have f=
ew more that hopefully you may throw some light on:

1.What is it exactly t=
hat we want to preseve? Is it phyiscal in nature e.g. seminal fluid/sperm a=
s a result of Brhamacharya? How does that affect the outcome with man w/ va=
sectomy?  

2. The end-product is a continious non-volunteery secretion of =
gland(s), similar to Saliva being generated. Sperms continiously die within=
 72 hrs or so and been replaced with new ones whether we want it or not. Wh=
at is it we are preseving then? Is it something non-tangible (the thoughts,=
 the process?) that we want to preserve?

3. What is the significance of Br=
ahmarshi Shukracharya being one-eyed and having one daughter (devyani?)?

3=
. Is there a corelation between Brahmarshi Shukracharya owning Maha Mrityun=
jaya Mantra and Brahmacharya?

As usual your revoulutionary , relevant , to=
-the-point and out-of-box thinking is shreshtha among men! Your explainatio=
ns and parables are simply exemplary! I thank you for your efforts!

Regard=
s

3. When the talking of "AGHORA" going on, is it really needed to perform "B=
