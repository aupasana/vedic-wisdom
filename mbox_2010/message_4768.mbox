Namaste Narasimha,

>However, let us not be forceful or agreessive like the=
 missionaries

This is a very important warning to keep in mind. We shouldn=
't be like missionaries. We dont need to prove any point and we are not her=
e to *convert faiths*. It is good to tell people what you belive to be good=
 and effective and then let them decide by themselves. I remember your word=
s - We should not worry about Whether we can teach homas to a thousand pers=
ons or a single person. we must try to perform our duty as mother's work di=
spassionately. She is doing everything and not we.

Thanks for this small b=
ut very important note and needless to say that i was waiting for your feed=
back of the conference and was always confident that you'll be very succesf=
ul.

Best Regards,

Utpal
