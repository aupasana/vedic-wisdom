Namaskarams Narasimhaji and other Masters,
I have been following the discus=
sions on Aghori practices and accounts in the smashan bhumi homams with gre=
at interest and curiosity. I also managed to read some portions of the Agho=
ra series by Svoboda. While I have been doing the Ganapathi homam for the p=
ast few months as regularly as I can , I have always been very drawn to bha=
gawati / Devi upasanas. I get very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ =
name of the devi or see an endearing image of the mother. I have to stop my=
 tears with great effort in such situiations. This does not happen with any=
 other God  /deity .

1) Does this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to=
 me ? Or is it just my mind at working overtime. 

After reading the accoun=
ts there is an intense desire to perform the Chandi homam. But before that =
I need to become comfortable with the Chandi recitation. That seems to be s=
ome time away considering that its an exhaustive script. While I continue t=
o work on this path, I wanted to do some kind of homam for the devi in the =
mean time.

2) Is it possible to recite only specific portions from the Cha=
ndi for the Chandi homam instead of going through the entore 700 verses?

3=
) Can I use some other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra "om ai=E0 =
hr=E9=E0 kl=E9=E0 c=E4mu=EB=F2=E4yai vicce" .

4) Alternatively can I perfo=
rm the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the procedure if I=
 am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.

Thanks and Regar=
ds with my humble pranaams,
Girish Sundaram.
