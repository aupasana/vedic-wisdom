Namaskar,
   How did Ravana got success with Mantras if success with Mantra=
s comes only with loss of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?
   Where is the lib=
eration without shakti, even the slaves were humble, devoted and with compl=
ete surrender to their masters, what results did they ever get ?
   There i=
s a saying in sanskrit, "Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, =
usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral ho". Meaning, the shakti-heen =
(powerless) person needn't worry about forgiving, because his anger can do =
no harm to another. 
   
Regards,
Aryama
