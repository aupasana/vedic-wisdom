 28th December, 1945.

Morning

It seems Echammal passed away at about 2-30=
 a.m. and the matter was reported
to Bhagavan only about 8 a.m. in the hall=
. The talk naturally was about
Echammal and how from 1907 she persevered in=
 offering food to Bhagavan
without any break. Bhagavan also remembered thre=
e other persons who fed him
when he was under the iluppai tree in the Big T=
emple. One was Dasi Rajambal
who, it seems, took a vow that she would not e=
at before feeding Bhagavan and
was feeding him for about two months until h=
e moved away to Gurumoortham. It
seems she continued to send food even to G=
urumoortham for a day or two. But
Bhagavan asked her to discontinue it. It =
seems this lady died only
recently.

Bhagavan mentioned also Meenakshi Amma=
l, a Kammala woman, and said, =E2=80=9CShe was
like a rakshasi. She would d=
aily go round the hill and then come and cook
and bring food to me. After s=
ome time she began assuming control over
everybody including Palaniswami. I=
f others brought food, etc., she would
give some to me and whatever remaine=
d she used to take away with her.=E2=80=9D
(Bhagavan said, in the afternoon=
, =E2=80=9COur Nagappa=E2=80=99s mother Ratnamma also used
to bring food in=
 those days=E2=80=9D). Of food supplied regularly, (Kattalai) as
Bhagavan p=
ut it, he said, =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t know what trouble all such regul=
ar
supply involves. Those who make it expect some control over you. It also=

creates some aham in them.

Everyone of them expects you to take something=
. One would say =E2=80=9CI say, serve
something with your own hand=E2=80=9D=
, and then each would serve something. The
quantity would become too great.=
 Any number of people bring any number of
things, and at all times, and you=
 must take them. Sometimes we used to mix
up all things received, milk, foo=
d, porridge, etc., and drink it if the
resulting mixture was a liquid. =E2=
=80=98Swami-hood=E2=80=99 is very difficult. You cannot
realize it. I am sp=
eaking from fifty years=E2=80=99 experience. After such
experience in Gurum=
oortham I wanted to avoid it by not remaining in anyone
place.=E2=80=9D
