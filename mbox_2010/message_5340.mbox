Dear Dr Bhatla,

"Practically it is impossible to shift all the population =
to vegetarian sources 
without triggering riots for food."

Nothing could b=
e farther from the truth! This is about the most common argument 
used by p=
eople who want to justify eating animals.

For a very well researched and w=
ritten book on this subject, I would suggest 
reading Jonathan Safran Foer=
=E2=80=99s book, =E2=80=9CEating Animals=E2=80=9D 


Here is a link to it's=
 website: http://www.eatinganimals.com/

BTW, this is not the first time th=
is topic has come up for discussion on this 
listserv, so please feel free =
to browse through the archives.

I do agree with your view about eating bas=
ed on your "goal in life".

sincerely,
Chandraprakash

Subject: [vedic-=
wisdom] Re: IS NON VEG FOOD BAD FOR MEN?

  
Hello,

I agree with Rajarshi =
Ji.

In total about 60% of world's total protein need is fulfilled by non-v=
egetarian 
sources that too very cheap as compared to vegetarian sources. P=
ractically it is 
impossible to shift all the population to vegetarian sour=
ces without triggering 
riots for food.

I believe that a person should cho=
ose his dietary habits based on his varna 
(aptitude and attitude) and more=
 specifically, on his Goal in life.

Regards
Atul
