 Bhagavan Ramana once commented that Verse 14 in Paya Puli of Saint Poet
Ta=
yumanavar was His most favourite verse. This was included in the Tamil
Para=
yana at Sri Ramanasramam, along with the nine verses from Akarabhuvanam-
Ch=
idambara Rahasyam.

Once there was a discusssion about Heart and Mr Nanavat=
i asked:

How can we conceive such a heart?

Bhagavan: Why should you conce=
ive of anything? You have only to see
wherefrom the 'I' springs.

Nanavati:=
 I suppose mere mauna in speech is no good, but we must have mauna
of the m=
ind.

Bhagavan: Of course.If we have real mauna, that state in which the mi=
nd is
merged into its source and has no more separate existence, then all o=
ther
kinds of mauna will come of their own accord, i.e., mauna of words, of=

action and of the mind or chitta.

Bhagavan also quoted in this connection=
 the following verse from
Tayumanavar. (Day by Day, 29th April 1946)

O Sup=
reme of Supremes!
If the pure silence[suddha mauna]
arises within me,
my mi=
nd will be silence,
my actions and words, all
will be silence. (Parapara Ka=
NNi, verse 276)

Tamil:

Chitta maunam seyal vaakku elam maunam
Suddha maun=
am en pal thonrin paraparame!

In Talks Bhagavan mentions that Tayumanavar =
mentions mauna in many places,
but only defines it in one verse. The defini=
tion,given in Talks, is
that: "Mauna
is said to be that state which spontan=
eously manifests after the
annihilation of the ego." (Talks No.122.)

The s=
pecific verse is not given, but in the Tamil edition of
Talks,Viswanatha Sw=
ami identifies it as Paya Puli, Verse 14.

The unique source [taan], fullne=
ss [poornam]
prevailed within, in my Heart
so that the 'I' which deemed its=
elf
an independent entity
bowed its head in shame,
Conferring matchless bli=
ss,
consuming my whole consciousness
and granting me the state of rapture,
=
if nurtured in me the condition of mauna.
This being so, what more is there=
 to be said?

Tamil:

Naan enru oru mudhal undenra naan thalai naaNa ennuL
=
Thaan enru oru mudhal pooranamaka thalaippatoppil
Anandam thanthu en arivai=
 ellam uNdu avasa nalhi
Monam thanai viLathal ini yadhu mozhiguvathe?

This=
 verse is a clear expression of the state that Tayumanavar finally
reached,=
 clearly parallels the idea contained in Sad Darsanam,Verse 30, in
which Bh=
agavan describes how the individual 'I' subsides into its source,
the Heart=
, leaving only the perfection of the Self. Verse 19 of Upadesa
Saram also g=
ives the simile of ego bowing its head in shame.
