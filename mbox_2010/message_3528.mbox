Subject: Question about tarpana during homam

Namaste,

When tarpana is offered towards the end of homam, is it normal for there
to be violent spluttering and noise as the water/milk trickles into the
fire from the corners of the kundam?

I have noticed that this is also damaging the bottom of the homa kundam,
causing small pieces of copper to shear and making the surface jagged
and sharp. Is this normal or could I be doing something wrong? I
normally only use a small amount of water.

Thank you,

Samir
