       The following is from=
 the Amazon.com comments about the book 'The Dark Night of the Soul'.

Howe=
ver, Self Realization is a marvelous experience. Have you read or had any e=
xperiences with Kundalini awakening? In that, there is an energy surge whic=
h clears out what a friend of mine calls the 'moldy oldies', like the sludg=
e which builds up in engines, which must be cleaned out for the car to oper=
ate optimally. Through proper Sadhana, one can prepare. When mine occurred,=
 it was like a great surge of energy going through my Chakra and Nadi syste=
m with a wonderful cleansing effect and I was experiencing Hatha Yoga postu=
res, even though I had never practiced it before. A little scary, but fun a=
t the same time. All from God.

------------ --------- ---

As a Carmelite =
monk, the
16th-century Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross was well traine=
d in
the systematic theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. In Dark Night of the So=
ul,
St. John's sharply organized mind gives clean shape to his mystical
bel=
ief in a loving Being somewhere outside the realm of feeling,
thought, or i=
magination, who can only be known through love. Dark Night of the Soul
desc=
ribes the process of purgation, first of senses, and then of
spirit, that p=
recedes the soul's loving Union with God. To quote from
this book would det=
ract from the coiled power of its tightly focused
picture of the soul's pro=
gress; suffice it to say that there has never
been a better book for discou=
raged Christians. When you cannot
understand what or why you believe, but y=
ou find yourself unable to
abandon faith, look to St. John for help.

      Product Description
  
  If
a man wants to know for certain the ro=
ad he is on he has to keep his
eyes closed and walk in darkness. "The dark =
night of the soul" has come
to typify that condition of spiritual dryness, =
depression, and seeming
abandonment by God that many Christians experience =
at some stage in
their lives. Here St. John, a 16th-century Spanish mystic =
and poet,
describes the spiritual road that leads to union with God. On thi=
s road
the soul must enter the Dark Night to be stripped of its imperfectio=
ns,
including the famous "seven deadly sins"=E2=80=94a process that often t=
akes a
number of years.
