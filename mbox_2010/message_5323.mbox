Dear Devotees
Hinduism is a vast ocean,more you go inside it more confusion=
s arises and this is fact.Arguements and counter arguements bound to come w=
hen one starts studing hindu shashtra,honestly one will end up with a total=
=A0confuse mind-what to do and what to avoid.And such situation will bring =
us in a stage where a devotee becomes like Trishanku(seach Google for this =
if you need more info).
So what to do?One is to find a right Guru and do sa=
dhana as per his guidence,second option which I am following=A0is to=A0star=
t our journey mentioned by Shri Manishji and Shri Narsimhaji without any do=
ubt and as time goes by we shall see some positive results for sure.In last=
 weekend I was reading the book by Shri Narsimhaji which he has uploaded in=
 his site and I really liked it very much,one can get this book from here h=
ttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/articles/vedic_wisdom_1.pdf.
Trouble of ours =
is we don't take it seriously when something is available freely and keep h=
unting for useless materials which is PAID type presuming it will be more r=
ich and helpfull.
Above is my experence so I shared it with members.
In One=
 line I can say that Hinduism is system like a tree which gives all kind of=
 fruits so better is to stick with fruits available for picking and start e=
ating them.
My Pranams to all members.
