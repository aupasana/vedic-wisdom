Namaste,

Respected Bhupendra Ji, I am sorry for replying late. I was not a=
ble to understand what points you are making so it took time to understand =
what you are saying. 

sir, below are some words which constitute my thinki=
ng. with deep regards i want to share them here with a hope that they may a=
nswer your questions. Please forgive me for my mistakes.

1) Regarding beha=
viour and thinking of Vimlananda and other Rishis, i honestly admit that I =
do not understand properly why they do what they do. This is because I am n=
ot able enough to reach that level of intelligence. But when it comes to Vi=
malananda, when I try to understand why they are doing so, I always refer t=
o his saying that he wanted to die with a clean karma account. Here clean m=
eans 'empty'. 

Second, he usually said that it is best to exist at two lev=
els of conciousness at the same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like when=
 he is playing chess with Robert at the same time he is wandering at higher=
 level of conciousness, without anyone realising that what he is thinking.
=

So, i assume that whatever he did was because of above two principles whic=
h he was always aware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or messing =
with Sadhu at his cave or any other incidence. 

At the end, he gave his li=
fe for saving son of one of his disciples without even letting them know. 
=
I may never be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he did. 

What I=
 think of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some rinanuband=
ha left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came to pay them =
and to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has again taken birth=
 in this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.

I believe Mani=
sh Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nitya siddha soul=
. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help others evolve.
=

Raman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch before going on a =
walk. once his disciple became late for bringing the Paan. Ramana Maharishi=
 waited for about 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt arrived he went on =
his walk. but after that he never ate Paan. This can be interpreted as his =
ego or his realisation that he was attached to Paan so he quit a thing whic=
h he was attached to.

2) Second thing you pointed out about "pre-requisite=
" of sadhna. what i think is that Pre-requisite of sadhna is just "want to =
do sadhna"

While Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite to reach god (or to atta=
in Moksha or any other objective)

Controlling anger, greed etc; to remove =
conditioning of mind and to empty our 'Karma-fruit account balance'. These =
all three constitute sadhna. Process which constitute doing all the above t=
hings is sadhna. 
Controlling anger etc are not pre-requisite of saadhna, b=
ut controlling them itself is saadhna.

When we achieve them, we attain the=
 moksha or what ever objectives we have. If we haven't achieved them yet, i=
t means our Sadhna is incomplete. 

Now whether Vimlananda or Rishis were a=
ngry because of their incomplete sadhna or because of Divine will, I can no=
t judge. Even if they were incomplete, Still they were lot lot better than =
me and I need to respect them and learn from them.

Udhav ji had Brahmgyana=
. He was one of few persons who, in their living conciousness realised that=
 Shri Krishna is God Himself. But still he had some ego left in him. So Shr=
i Krishna taught him lessons in his own way. And even after Lord Krishna le=
ft his Body, Udhav had to do Tapasya for many many years to achieve ultimat=
e stage.

3) Third thing was about saadhna and Sidhis.

There are numerous =
paths for reaching God or we should say that there are many paths for doing=
 Sadhnas. Many in Hinduism itself, In sikhism, in Islam, Budhism etc etc al=
l are paths for doing Saadhna. These all paths are different. But still the=
y take us to same objective.

These all paths have two things in common.

a=
) Mind Training
b) Surrender to God.

In most of the Paths one is more prom=
inent other is less prominent. Like in bhakti Yoga, Surrender to god is giv=
en utmost important but Mind Training is to some extent only. While in Rajy=
oga or Hath Yoga Mind training is given more important and Surrender is to =
some extent.
In Karma yoga, Mind is trained in a different way using differ=
ent methods and in Gyan yoga Mind is trained in different way using differe=
nt methods.

Tantra is a saadhna method where both Mind training and Surren=
der are given equal importance and both these are done in a very aggressive=
 and fast manner. So it works very fast. 

Mind Training part of Saadhna, p=
roduces lot of energy in us. many names are given to this energy. This ener=
gy is what gives Siddhis. 
So on quest to find God, these Sidhis are just b=
y-products or I term them as "side effects" for my own reference. They are =
not our aim when we are trying to reach God. We do not need sidhis but stil=
l they are produced. When Vivekananda was offered sidhis by His Guru he ref=
used to accept them as his guru acknowledged that these sidhis will not hel=
p him in achieving god. Although at later stage Vivekananda achieved lot of=
 Sidhis by himself.

What I want to point here is that For achieving Sidhis=
, 2nd aspect of surrender is not needed. One can achieve Sidhis by followin=
g some methods but they will not help him reach God. They just add to his K=
arma-Fruit account and take aways from God.

In the book "Concentration - B=
y Mouni sadhu", Author explains simple techniques to achieve some simple si=
dhis step by step. He also adds that one need not to believe in God to atta=
in these sidhis. But if he use these sidhis in Quest for God these can be h=
elpful. 

So a person who had controlled his mind and trained his mind to a=
chieve some powers does not mean that he has controlled his anger etc and h=
as a love for God.

But for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he=
 was a person who had control on most of his instincts including anger. Alt=
hough his level of intelligence and concious was so much different from us =
that we may not be able to understand why he did so.

I am sorry for stretc=
hing this mail too long. I hope some of your points were addressed in this =
mail.

please pardon for my mistakes

Kind Regards
Atul
