Dear Priyaji,
=C2=A0
I think there is no mistake as it depends on what is t=
he thithi at sun rise. 
=C2=A0
The actual ekadasi thithi started yesterday =
afternoon(16th) in india which continued till today morning(17th) so we hav=
e ekadasi today.
=C2=A0
In USA 16th morning started by then so ekadasi thit=
hi is on 16th there and not on 17th.
=C2=A0
Manish
