Namaste Friends,



I am just restate a unique discrepancy which has came =
to fore with
reference to Actual days of our festivals. Narasimha has alrea=
dy
discussed it.



Taking example of MahaaShivaraatri which is celebrated =
today Night
almost every where. MahaaShivaraatri is celebrated on Krishna P=
aksha
Chaturdashi of Lunar month called Magha (or Maha).



Magha Month sho=
uld be said to commence logically - (considering two
views - Amavasyaa as M=
onth end AND Pournima as Month end)





1) When Amavasyaa coincides with M=
oon being approximately opposite to
Magha Nakshatra which eventually create=
s a situation where in succeeding
Pournima coincides with Moon being in Mag=
ha or very close to it.



To clarify with example:

Current Magha Month po=
pularly started on 15th January 2010 (at approx.
12.45 in Noon as per IST).=
 The Pournima of That Month started on 29th
Jan at around 15.35 IST. At tha=
t time, Moon was in 1st pada of Pushya
Nakshatra. When Pournima ended on 30=
th Jan at around 11.50, Moon was in
4th pada of Pushya Nakshatra.



So Moo=
n was neither *In* Magha Nakshatra nor *very close* to it.



***

If one t=
akes, Next Pournima which falls on 28th February, Moon is IN
Magha Nakshatr=
a.

So does it mean that IN REALITY, MAGHA MONTH starts on 14th Feb instead=

of 15th Of Jan. AND MahaaShivaraatri is in Reality should be celebrated
on=
 13th March Night and NOT on Today Night?



God Knows!



2) Consider if M=
onth is said to be ended when Pournima coincides with
Moon being in Magha o=
r very close to it.

I.e. Magha Month is taken to be ending on Pournima whe=
n Moon is also
traversing through Magha Nakshatra during that time. Next da=
y, new month
Phagan (Phalgun) starts.



As stated in previous example, Moo=
n is in Magha on Pournima which falls
on 28th Feb. If that really means Mag=
ha Month's last day, then
MahaaShivaraatri can be said to be falling on 13t=
h/14th Feb i.e. today
in Reality and the celebration of the Shiva festival =
is rightly
celebrated.



Not sure as to what it is Reality.



Sorry for a=
 long message.



Best Regards,



Utpal
