Dear Sri Narasima Garu, 
=C2=A0
In the flood of messages and your busy sche=
dule, you might have missed my previous questions that I have posted long a=
go. I am requesting you to respond to the following questions of mine. 
=C2=
=A0
1.=C2=A0With your blessings, I was able to perform 40 day Ganapati homa=
m that ended with Vinayaka chaturthi. Since Ganapathi moola mantram itself =
ends with Swaha, I was adding one more swaha after the first Swaha to offer=
 in the homam. Along the way, Once I heard your mp3 recording and you were =
saying only once 'swaha'. Did I make a mistake?
=C2=A0
2.=C2=A0Are there=C2=
=A0specific homams for Gayatri and Kartikeya forms of the divine?
=C2=A0
3.=
 Wanted to know your opinion on Rambhav Swami videos that were discussed on=
 this forum a while ago, if you had a chance to view them.

Do not think of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not =
like egoistic people who compete with others and have qualities like possis=
siveness, jealosy etc. Gods are different aspects of (and pathways to) the =
Supreme.

All gods are slightly different emanations of the supreme cosmic =
being, who may also be called "the Self of all". In order to realize Self, =
one needs to reach the supreme cosmic being. That can be done through vario=
us gods. First develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities,=
 think of him/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the su=
preme cosmic being through that god.

One who is most attached to Vishnu/La=
kshmi/Shiva/Durga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as the supreme god =
from whom all gods emanate. All other gods are created from that god and re=
st in that god. It is fine to worship various gods, thinking that they are =
all different manifestations of the god one is attached to.

If one has not=
 found a god one is attached to and about whom one can think like this, the=
n one may have to look more.

> During navratri is it ok to read devi mahat=
myam when a women has her
> periods? If no then what can she do to acheive =
the maximum benefit?

In my personal opinion, it is ok to read mentally. If=
 you do external rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, I suggest n=
ot doing them during periods and to read mentally instead. This is particul=
arly true for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationale through =
personal experience, I like to respect the words of tradition and of people=
 who know more than me.

> My homam fire is small so just wondering if it i=
s ok to put chopped basil

hole leaf only. I always see

n etc hence this doubt. 

Yes. Undivided and full parts are better, but off=
ering something compatible with the size of your fire and making sure that =
it burns fully and comfortably is the most important criterion. So feel fre=
e to pur chopped things.

* * *

Namaste Mitesh,

> In the tarpana process =
we invite all ancestors in the copper vessel
> but in the end what should w=
e do, request them to go back to their respective places?

The mantra used =
for invocation does not ask for ancestors to enter the water in the kalasha=
. It asks them to come to the area to receive the water offering. When they=
 are satisfied with the sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendoff is not d=
one in the tradition I am familiar with. If one feels uncomfortable and wan=
ts to send off formally, one can say "OM pitruun yathaasthaanam sthaapayaam=
i".

> Also is it ok to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?

It is not idea=
l, but it is better to do sometime than not to do at all.

* * *

Namaste A=
shok,

> "At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in c=
onclusion:
> "narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su..."
> 
> Can =
you clarify the meaning also?

The verse "narakeshu samasteshu" at the end =
means: "Whoever are stuck in various hells (inauspicious realms of existenc=
e in which mind can be stuck after death) and suffering there, I am offerin=
g this water for them, thinking of their relief.". The next 4 verses pray f=
or the relief of relatives, non-relatives and relatives in previous lives a=
nd people born in one's lineage without spouse/children and all beings of t=
he universe.

Words come with baggage and may mean differe=
nt things to different people depending on their life experiences and outlo=
ok in life. It is very tough to convey sophisticated philosophy using words=
.

All pervading shakti works through all of us and expresses in all of our=
 desires, actions and knowledge, as per the universal rules of action and r=
eaction. Under the push of one's own previous karmas, one is placed in situ=
ations that are conducive to certain desires, actions and awareness. The cu=
rrent karmas 

Best regards,
Narasimha
