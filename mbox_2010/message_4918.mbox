Namaste Narasimha,

Thank God !=A0i was unhappy at the time of sending prev=
ious message as=A0i=A0was 
having an argument with you and believe it or no=
t, at that very moment, the same 
explanation which you gave in this mesage=
 flashed in my mind.=A0i could not pay 
attention to that thought because i=
 had to sit for Maha Ganapati homam.

I completed a nice Maha Ganapati homa=
m and=A0saw your message! I now firmly 
believe that Lord Ganapati conveyed=
 me the true meaning from my Guru. I am 
completely satisfied now. intellec=
tually as well as heartily.


Ganapati Bappa Moriya !!!

Utpal

Namaste Utpal,

It is saying that one will get the result of "Durgapath",=
 but is NOT saying 
"WITHOUT doing Durgapath". There are a bunch of things =
one does *along with* 
Durgapath, i.e. *in addition to* the actual Durgapat=
h (or Chandipath), without 
which one supposedly cannot get the results of =
Durgapath. This line is saying 
that the results of Durgapath can be obtain=
ed by replacing all those supplements 
with Kunjika. But it is not saying t=
hat the basic Durgapath can also be 
replaced.

It is literally saying "one=
 can get the result of Durgapath without doing 
Kavacha, Argala, Keelaka, R=
ahasya, Sookta, Dhyana, Nyasa and Archana and by 
doing just Kunjika stotra=
 instead of them." It is not saying that Durgapath can 
also be skipped. It=
 is only saying that the supplements can be skipped.

Best regards,
Narasim=

path", but is NOT saying "WITHOUT doing Durgapath". There are a bunch of th=
ings one does *along with* Durgapath, i.e. *in addition to* the actual Durg=
apath (or Chandipath), without which one supposedly cannot get the results =
of Durgapath. This line is saying that the results of Durgapath can be obta=
ined by replacing all those supplements with Kunjika. But it is not saying =
that the basic Durgapath can also be
 replaced.<BR><BR>It is literally sayi=
ng "one can get the result of Durgapath without doing Kavacha, Argala, Keel=
aka, Rahasya, Sookta, Dhyana, Nyasa and Archana and by doing just Kunjika s=
totra instead of them." It is not saying that Durgapath can also be skipped=
. It is only saying that the supplements can be skipped.<BR><BR>Best regard=
