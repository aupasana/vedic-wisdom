Namaste,
 
> Please find below entire dhatupATha, to prove that lakSh mean =
objective.
 
If the word "noticeable" comes from "notice", it does not prov=
e that the word "notice" means "noticeable".
 
The word "khaadya" (edible) =
comes from the root "khaad" (to eat); the word "gamya" (target/destination)=
 comes from the root "gam" (to go); the word "kaarya" (work/deed) comes fro=
m the root "kR^i" (to do); and, the word "GYeya" (knowable) comes from the =
root "GYaa" (to know).
 
Yet, "khaad" does not mean "edible"; "gam" does no=
t mean "destination"; "kR^i" does not mean "work/deed"; and, "GYaa" does no=
t mean "knowable".
 
Similarly, though the word "lakShya" (objective) does =
come from the root "lakSh" (to observe/notice), the word "lakSh" does not m=
ean "objective".
 
If you go off on a tangent, you cannot reach the centre =
of the circle even after travelling miles and miles. What's the point in qu=
oting reams and reams when you miss the main point?
 
*        *        *
 =

You wrote earlier: "With computer facilities - it is a likely that what pe=
ople took 12 years in Shankara's times can be learnt by kids in 3 months".
=
 
You may be able to create in 3 months overconfident newbies who can cut &=
 paste reams of material from the computer and try to connect the dots with=
 guesswork, but you cannot create true scholars.
 
If one has a whole treef=
ul of mangoes, one can eat them everyday over a period of time and get ener=
gy from them. If one rams all of them into the stomach in a single day, all=
 one will get is indigestion and vomiting. Learning Sanskrit takes more tha=
n 3 months because one needs to *digest* what one learns.
 
*        *     =
   *
 
You seem to be working on a good project. Good luck with it!
 
If on=
e cuts down on belligerance, sense of self-importance and sajjana dUShaNa (=
abuse of good people), then one can make faster progress with the knowledge=
 of rishis. Otherwise, one will be bogged down.
 
Best regards,

 Actually, lakSh does not mean objective. The word lakShya means objective.=
 Without ya, lakSh only means "to notice, to observe, to perceive". Moreove=
r, lakShmI comes from "lakShma[n]", which means a mark or token or symbol, =
typically of excellence or something good. Lakshmi is the giver of tokens a=
nd symbols of excellence. Money, food, vehicles, kingdom, knowledge, braver=
y, children etc are all symbols/tokens/marks of excellence and well-being. =
Lakshmi in her various forms (dhana lakShmI, dhaanya lakShmI, vaahana lakSh=
mI, raajya lakShmI, vidyaa lakShmI, vikrama lakShmI, santaana lakShmI etc) =
is the giver of these. THAT is the correct derivation of the name lakShmI a=
nd not what you gave.

New York city to drop off a senior Indian priest who visited us for a coupl=
e of months, at the New York airport. As there was still time for the fligh=
t, we went to a small temple. A young priest was chanting Chandipath to an =
audience of just one person in a nice voice. We were happy to hear it. The =
senior priest who was with us was in a 3-year mouna vratam (vow of silence)=
 then. BTW, he is about to finish the vratam and start talking again next m=
onth. Anyway, he wrote on a paper and asked us to tell him about our daily =
Chandi homam. So we told him that I do a Chandi homam everyday. He asked if=
 I do the entire Saptashati. I said yes. He was surprised. To gauge my spee=
d and judge how long it takes, he asked me to read a few verses. I was amus=
ed, but read a few verses. He complimented me saying my pronunciation was v=
ery good. The senior priest who was with us likes me very much and fondly c=
alls me "guruji". He likes telling people good things about me, even in my =
presence. He wrote on the paper asking other people with us to tell the you=
ng priest about Guruji's (my) Sanskrit scholarship. So they told him I was =
a Sanskrit scholar. That young priest asked me what I studied and kept gett=
ing technical. I knew where it was going and kept answering tersely, trying=
 to end it. Finally, he started discussing Sanskrit grammar. I was not real=
ly interested. He was doing Chandipath before and then he got distracted in=
to Sanskrit grammar! If he wanted to discuss (or just chant!) Chandipath or=
 discuss any spiritual matters, I would've loved to spend some time with hi=
m. If he wanted to leave those and discuss grammar instead, I had no intere=
st. Moreover, it was clear to me that he did not have any questions per se =
or any useful information for me and he simply wanted to show off his own s=
cholarship and getting into my scholarship was a license for him to show of=
f his scholarship! What happened later was exactly along those lines.
> >
>=
 > Uncomfortable as I was, one small thought came to me when the senior pri=
est wrote something critical about the attitude of that young priest on our=
 way out. It takes just a split second for Her to change a person and remov=
e a weakness, if and when She decides to do it! After all, I had been exact=
ly like that, wanting to show off my scholarship and various abilities, not=
 so long ago. Theoretical understanding of scriptures does not bring true d=
ispassion. Only when the scriptural knowledge is internalized and one exper=
iences the transientness of maayaa first-hand, does one start to develop tr=
ue dispassion. Even then, passion about this and that may return now and th=
en. Why deplore an unhealthy fancy of someone else, when we ourselves had t=
hat fancy before and when we ourselves have various other fancies even now?=
 Instead of feeling unhappy or disappointed, my mind was filled with compas=
sion for that young priest as we came out.
> >
> > My 2 cents of advice to =
anyone interested in it is: Scholarship is good, but put it to a positive u=
se. Do not show off to impress someone or for an ego trip. Use it to remove=
 confusion, use it to stop someone from creating confusion, and use it when=
 you feel there is a chance of serving a productive purpose. Otherwise, it =
is better to keep quiet. However, when someone else is showing off or being=
 arrogant/egoistic, ignore as much as you can. Engage only when you are cle=
ar about why and how you are engaging.
