A Certificate Is Much The Same As An Associate's Degree
<http://www.studyv=
enture.com/Courses/certificates.html>

A certificate is much the same as an=
 associate's degree. Many times,
students go through a certificate program
=
<http://www.studyventure.com/Courses/certificates.html>   as a jumping
off =
point to go into an associate's or a bachelor's degree program.
There are c=
ertificates similar to the Associate of Arts, which is a
generalized curric=
ulum in a particular field of study
<http://www.studyventure.com/Courses/ce=
rtificates.html>  . However, most
certificates are more like the Associate =

student for one particular field in preparation=
 for immediate employment
in that trade.  Read more...

Several different career fields have=
 certificate programs now
<http://www.studyventure.com/Courses/certificates=
.html>  . They have
been designed to give the student specialized and speci=

particular area. When someone has completed a certificate=
, he/she has
completed approximately 12 to 33 college credits
<http://www.s=
tudyventure.com/Courses/certificates.html>   in a
particular career field. =
