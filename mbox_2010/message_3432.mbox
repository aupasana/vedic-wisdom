Dear Sundeep,
=C2=A0
(a) Yes, one enters NVKS when ahamkaara is gone.
=C2=
=A0
Regarding the question on how it comes back:
=C2=A0
Ahamkaara does not =
come back for most people who reach NVKS and they merge in Brahman like a s=
alt doll melting in ocean. In some people, ahamkaara may arise again after =
NVKS so that they continue to operate with that body for more time. How it =
comes back is a tough question, just as the question of how and why this cr=
eation took place.
=C2=A0
(b) Ahamkaara is not there.
=C2=A0
(c) Suppose on=
e looks at a rope and thinks it is a snake. Suppose one later realizes that=
 it is not a snake but merely a rope. Whatever quantity changed in the pers=
on is inside his mind. Similarly, whatever quantity changed when one realiz=
es one's nature is inside one's mind.
=C2=A0
Body, senses etc exist and do =
their job when intelligence operates through them. If the intelligence oper=
ating through them has a limited I-ness and that I-ness identifies with the=
 body and senses, then that is ignorance. Removal of that ignorance and rea=
lization of true nature does not necessarily mean a destruction of body, se=
nses etc. They may continue to exist and intelligence may continue to opera=
te through them. But the I-ness of the intelligence operating through them =
expands from the limited nature of before.
=C2=A0
Only a deity or a rishi o=
r a yogi who can read one's mind can capture the state before and after and=
 see what changed. The change is not necessarily observable by other people=
 using their sensory observation.
=C2=A0
However, one who is no longer delu=
ded by the limited I-ness ("this body, name and entity is I") may behave di=
fferently compared to before. One may be less sensitive to praises/criticis=
m of one's body-name-entity. However, it is tough to describe exactly how o=
ne will behave.

      Dear Narasimhaji,

 

 P=
lease answer this question (if you have the time) - I am going to ask it in=
 a very technical "computer sciencey" way so that you get the import of the=
 question I am trying to ask (which so far you have never answered): Lets s=
ay you have a hypothetical camera that can take snapshots of everything mat=
erial (material in the vedic sense i.e. gunas and higher), then what has ch=
anged in a snapshot of a person immediately before they enter Nirvikalpa sa=
madhi (NVKS for short) and after, assuming the eventual goal is to "return"=
 from NVKS? I do not include Brahman in any "snapshot" since it is non mate=
rial and invariant anyway.



a) Is the Ahamkara gone after they enter NVKS=
? If so, how do they return from NVKS, and who is this "they" anyway?

b) I=
f Ahamkara and consequently sookshma sarira are still there, how are they d=
ifferent. 

c) If they are not different, what quantity is it in the person=
 that has gotten enlightened/ changed?

All these questions are related to =
the "doughnut questions" I posed in http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =
wisdom/message/ 3357, but I guess you didnt see those (and that's quite ok =
by me, you have so many people constantly expecting replies)



Regards,


=

Sundeep
