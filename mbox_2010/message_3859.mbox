Dear Sri Utpalji and Rajarshiji, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for the response. I do=
 understand that Telang Swamy might have been a great yogi but my point is =
how are we to understand that greatness and in that context what is ununsua=
l in the priest's reaction that God had to punish him that hard! If priest =
was aware and still did that, then I can understand the consequence. I have=
n't yet the second book though! Probably that will explain. 
=C2=A0
Also, I=
 understand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa's famous 'Dig at one place 10 feet inst=
ead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find water'. But contrary to that=
 we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indeed worshipped=
 many forms of the God and were successful in that approach as well. For in=
stance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshipped by Adi San=
kara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that Muththuswamy Dikshit=
ar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal coil by singi=
ng to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his disciples. But h=
e composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and depth on Lord=
 Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So=C2=A0wer=
e many great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they were al=
l great advaitis and never saw any difference=C2=A0between any form of the =
God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra who
 translated B=
hagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems,=C2=A0pays homage to Lord Vishnu=
, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order b=
efore declaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lord Rama to write =
the Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any form of God her=
e! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalananda accuses=C2=A0=
many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just because their puja mandirams are =
filled with many photographs/idols of different murthis of Almighty.

Nagaraj Garu,

I thought exactly the same way when I recently read the bo=
ok. If i would have been there, i would have done probably the same thing u=
nless i knew Trailanga swami very well. 
But the matter is clarified in Agh=
ora Part-2.
If i remember correctly, In Aghora Part-2, Vimalananda has clar=
ified the seemingly extreme behavior of Trailanga Swami. I don't remember t=
he chapter now but it was said that Trailanga swami, being a very advance S=
aadhaka exactly knew how to convert faces and urine in to Nectar or some di=
vine substance or else how he could have dared to commit such act.

Beautiful... i find vimalananda' s extreme views, very appea=
ling and full of wisdom. The underlying advise in those external rough word=
s is same as Thakur Ramakrishna used to say "Dig at one place rather than d=
igging at many places...". It does not require to disrespect or disbelive o=
ther deities or faith.

Jusr my 2 cents...

Regards,

Utpal
