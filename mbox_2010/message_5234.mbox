Dear Friends,

At the moment "Guru" is almost Stationary and precisely, HE =
will become PERFECTLY stationary on 18.11.2010 (i.e. tomorrow) at 20.47 (Du=
bai time). After that Guru will slowly start forward Motion.

Its a rare co=
incidence that "Shukra", who is stationary currently, is also becoming Stat=
ionary and Margi just 5/6 hours after Guru (i.e. 19.11.2010, 1.54 Dubai tim=
e).

Suffice to say that Today, tomorrow and a couple of days after, are a =
very important days. Such conditions are not easily formed wherein 2 planet=
s are stationary around same time.

My logic and Intuition tells me that It=
s a great time to START some spiritual Sadhana OR take some vow of doing sp=
iritual Sadhana and most probably that will result in to a life changing de=
cisions and long lasting as well. This is my Personal opinion though.

Warm=
 Regards,

Utpal
