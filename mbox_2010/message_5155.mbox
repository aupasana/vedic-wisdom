Dear Narasimha Garu, 

Thanks for your reply. I am wondering why people are=
 not discussing about my question no. 1 in mail to Shri Satya Prakash Garu.=
 Is something inherently wrong with question itself? 

Also, about this fea=
r about kundalini going awry in untrained/unsupervised people, how justifie=
d is it if one is prepared to face the consequences? For instance in Dhyana=
 Yoga (atma samyama yoga - chapter 6) Arjuna asks the lord as to what happe=
ns to the yoga brashta and the Lord replies saying that such a person would=
 be given a better opportunity in the next life to continue the sadhana (ve=
rses 37-47)! When there are such assurances by the Lord himself in devi mah=
atmyam and bhagavadgita, why are we debating on every other point but these=
 divine words themselves? Please correct me if I am wrong here. I don't mea=
n to question your deep knowledge here, but eager to learn something here. =
