With deepest respect I beg to differ from Dr. Bhatla about the "cheapness" =
of protein derived from Animals.
We have to take into consideration that an=
imals consume "x" quantity of veg food and convert it to "x-y" meat (y will=
 be due to metabolism - 100% conversion or more than 100% conversion is imp=
ossible).
Now this "x-y" meat consumed should be compared to what is actual=
ly absorbed by the human body. I think it is generally known that animal pr=
otein is absorbed at a lower rate than plant protein.
Without taking into c=
onsideration the entire food chain (and taking an end to end view) there wi=
ll be fallacies.
Again with sincere respect.
Girish

      Hello,



I agre=
e with Rajarshi Ji.



In total about 60% of world's total protein need is =
fulfilled by non-vegetarian sources that too very cheap as compared to vege=
tarian sources. Practically it is impossible to shift all the population to=
 vegetarian sources without triggering riots for food.



I believe that a =
person should choose his dietary habits based on his varna (aptitude and at=
titude) and more specifically, on his Goal in life.



Regards

Atul
