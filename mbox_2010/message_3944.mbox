Namaste

The original question from Rajesh was a very good one, and a real =
one . I compliment him for asking it and having the courage to ask it.

Lor=
d Shiva in Guru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- "There is no mukti without b=
ukti".

Any good saint I have had a chance to read or listen or speak to,
n=
ever says that "Do Sadhana with spiritual expectations only" In general I m=
ean any type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donatio=
n, bhajan,satsang and many other types.

They always try to increase furthe=
r the Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that captivates a Sadhaka's mind due =
to his or her state of sanskars.

They always try to help the Sadhak walk o=
n the path that leads towards spirituality. They always wish well for their=
 disciples and have good amount of patience.

Many Sadgurus take care of th=
eir disciples for many life times, helping and guiding in each life time.

=
They always preach many things and show value for different types of sadhan=
as depending on their state, time, and type of disciple.

For householders =
always there are challanges and one should request God to look into it and =
give guidance and help, whether it is food, house, marriage, car, or any ma=
terial issue. There is nothing wrong in doing this, even if sadhana done fo=
r materialistic benefits.

Today even those who have renounced householder =
life have to pray god to fulfill some of their material needs.

We live in =
very difficult and challanging times and it appears it is going to become m=
ore challenging.

Some material gain can at times make a person better or m=
ore balanced or be more prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. 

Ev=
en during an eclipse many people do mantras etc to solve problems or improv=
e material conditions, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read message=
s in the past on this group suggesting natives not to do it or it is wrong.=
 These type of messages are not correct, it only confuses people. Time duri=
ng the eclipse is very good for getting results for any sadhana done during=
 that time. it is equally good for material or spiritual type.

Everyone ha=
s right to have a opinion and share their views but one needs to also under=
stand the influence aspect of those views.

Every Shotra or prayer or even =
Geeta or Ramayan, there are riders at the end for results like becoming wea=
lthy, overcoming challenges, enemies etc.
If it were inappropriate the Seer=
s from the past would not write it.
Are they wrong in writing that?
 
They =
write it to motivate people to read them as one reads more times there is a=
 possibility that may lead to change in the person's attitude.

Moving to o=
riginal set of questions,

Every one is born with accumulated sanskars out =
of which as a native interacts with the world some of these accumulated or =
sanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars=
 give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are lik=
e seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.

All human =
beings are also born with another quality and that is known as will power. =
They say will power can change destiny ...

When one does sadhana like say =
Homaam or Japam. Many things happen
at many levels, at times there is impro=
vement in materialistic situation, problems get solved or if the problems r=
emain that state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she pays less attention=
 to the problem or attaches less importance to the problem. God or Guru or =
Shakti shows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana does increase will=
 power and makes one more tolerant and 
Sadhana also help in eliminating th=
e sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your =
sanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they can never germinate or fru=
itify into prarabdh sanskars.

So yes doing sadhana can help one overcome m=
any things at different levels and help one move in the right direction. At=
 times one moves faster or very slowly. The important thing is moving and i=
f one falls down, than one should immediately get up.

There are many ways =
to improve and move faster towards spirtuality,
Vimalanda is not just one s=
aint, there are many who have reached similar or higher or lower realizatio=
ns adopting different methods and have written very good books too. Spritua=
lity is much bigger, deeper and broader than what Vimalanada has described =
in his books.

I find it little cultish to just refer him all the time in t=
he group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.

Please note that I hav=
e nothing against Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the bot=
tom of my heart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in nea=
r future.

I urge all the readers of this group to read more books from dif=
ferent sects, different saints and try to get appropriate influence. Get br=
oader and deeper views as that helps forming a good base for spirituality. =
Spirtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in different situation=
s.

The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,
=
Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of Mirdad=
) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realiz=
ations and experiance. There are many sects in south india too, kerala, tam=
il nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajasthan, gujarat and other states, a=
ll of them had great saints.

Generally these saints never bothered to writ=
e or explain or were not able to explain. But some did write and a lot of g=
ood work is out there to explore along with doing sadhana.

We live in time=
s where there is very little guidance available on the path of spirituality=
. So in these times we have to make up with reading good books written by s=
aints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.

There is scarcity of Sadgur=
us and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level and confused situation :-) ..=
..

If you look at sikhism, the last sadguru dev from their sect made the b=
ook "granth saheb" as the guru instead of making anyone else take his seat.=


When Lahiri Mahashaya met a famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect=
 from him. Some of the famous saint's disciple were upset,
at that the sain=
t reminds them that to reach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so year=
s but Lahiri Mahashaya did it in one birth.
His name slips my tongue, he wa=
s big and very strong lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts =
with tri. They say that one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue =
of the saint at his samadhi mandir.

One must always try to broaden ones pe=
rspective, all of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that=
 oh I only have some more things left so I may be done in some years, even =
that is an interesting situation as there is always a chance of falling dow=
n.

Even for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but =
he also had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and=
 than suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before his birth as th=
e rajah.

I did not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertan=
tly did it I appologize in advance, Narashima has written very well many ti=
mes and of late has written some good stuff.

Best Regards
Mitesh
