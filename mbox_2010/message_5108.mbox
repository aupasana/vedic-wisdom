Namaste Shri Nagaraj,

Congratulations!

> Also, is the navaavarna mantram =
same as "Om aim hrim srim >chamundaayai vichche" ?

Thats all Mantra with 9=
 syllables but Navarana Mantra of Chadi paatha is "Om Aim Hreem Kleem Chamu=
ndaayei Vichche"

Aim Beeja represents Maha Kali
Hreem Beeja Maha Lakashmi
=
Kleem Beeja Maha Saraswati

I hope thats what you were asking

Best Regards=
,

Utpal

 this document is pretty inspiring. I am very happy to tell you=C2=A0that I=

and encouragement=C2=A0on this forum all the while. I=C2=A0did 6 homams wit=

perience. Last time I did with Sapta Sati, I became very emotional while re=
ading "Sarva mangala mangalye" verse in 11th chapter and started forgetting=
 swaha after each verse, but was putting ahutis in the fire at the end of e=
ach verse, after a few verses, I composed myself again and resume saying "s=
waha" as usual. I was able to constantly feel that the mother was right the=
re in front of my eyes in the fire and was filled with joy. I did not do ar=
gala, kavacham and keelaka and suktams etc. I just did recite Siddha Kunjik=
a Stotram at the end on each day, whether I did the homam with sapta sloki =
or saptasati. Please
