Namaste,

In different paramparas, different theories are propagated relati=
ng to Kunjika Stotra. In some paramparas, specially in North India, it is c=
onsider to be equal to the Saptasati. Where as in eastern India, Bengal/Ass=
am areas, and also some Kaula sampradayas in Varanasi, this is not consider=
ed to be equal to Saptasati. 

The reasons why these sampradayas do not con=
sider KS to be equal to Saptasati is the same as what Narasimha stated. 


=
In my personal experience, about a year before I actually started reading t=
he full Saptasati, I used to do the KS for a few months. I was shown a spec=
ific method of chanting the KS - there is some breath control required at c=
ertain lines etc etc. I had almost mugged it up. But the experience of chan=
ting the actual Saptashati (full) is vastly more powerful and different tha=
n the KS. I have serious doubts whether a person doing only the KS can ever=
 experience samadhi at all; whereas the Saptasati by itself is capable of b=
estowing the highest and varied types of spiritual experiences to a sadhaka=
. Therefore, I tend to agree with the sampradayas from Bengal and Assam tha=
t the actual Saptasati is anytime more powerful than the KS when it comes t=
o spiritual experiences. KS is about siddhis. That too, not a simple straig=
ht chanting but with some modulations, breath controls etc etc which have t=
o be learnt from someone qualified.

Just my 2 cents on the topic.

 If one studies Kunjika Stotra (aka "Siddha Kunjika Stotra"), one will see =
that it is filled with beejas of several forms of divine Mother and the moo=
la mantra contains powerful beejas and phrases. I am afraid it is a coded p=
rayer. It contains hints in coded form for several specific sadhanas to get=
 specific results using Devi Saptashati.

 one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without Kunjika stotra. =
However, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by merely chanting Kunjik=
a stotra or adding it to one's Saptashati chanting. In fact, siddhi often c=
omes to those who do not consciously pursue it.
