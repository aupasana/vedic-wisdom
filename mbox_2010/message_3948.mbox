Namaste everyone,

I am reading these books with a lot of interest and almo=
st completed the first two. They need a lot more iterations though since I =
don't seem to grasp everything that they offer. Anyway, some of the questio=
ns that I have at this point are as follows.

1. While the stories in these=
 books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly believe tha=
t these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is easy to rejec=
t them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it that these =
stories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should not be tak=
en literally as real incidents?

2. While there is a wealth of information =
in the second book, and co-incides a lot with Bhagavatham, there are quite =
a few places that left me quite confused too. Maybe with the help of others=
 from the group, I hope to get a better perspective. For instance, on the c=
hapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the real Gayatri M=
antra is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no one can really pr=
onounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the influence of K=
ali. At the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a mantra by doin=
g japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happens! How to reco=
ncile these two?  To be more specific, I have tried in the past a puraschar=
ana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred thousand times and was successf=
ul in finishing the ritual part (and I intend to do a lot more with a lot m=
ore discipline), but with the real Gayatri Mantra being hidden and not in o=
ur knowledge, is any there any use in continuing in this path?  

3. Since =
perfect pronounciation is impossible, he recommends that mantra sadhana sho=
uld be done mentally, with not even tongue moving. I find this very difficu=
lt to practise. At least for me, mind wanders in a crazy fashion if Mantra =
sadhana is practised silently. In fact, it wanders so much that I start wit=
h Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the middle of japa, I realize that=
 my mind is elsewhere and try to come back to the japam. What is shocking t=
o me is that at that time my mind is constantly repeating Savitru Gayatri M=
antra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. And the rosary keeps moving reg=
ardless, so the counts are lost.........

4. He warns that without proper p=
ronounciation and/or disciplines, bad things will happen, like the example =
of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaking his celibacy! This kin=
d of examples could potentially scare many people from taking to any sadhan=
a at all, in the lack of a proper Guru! And for a proper guru, one must kee=
p doing sadhana.... how?
