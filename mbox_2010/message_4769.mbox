Namaste learned friends,
 
I have been writing a lot of mails on various topics related to spirituality and sadhana on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup for a few years now. These writings are free-wheeling in nature and not well-organized.
 
On 2010 Guru Pournima, my Jyotish students in Boston gifted me a book they created out of some of those writings. They organized the writings topically in the form of a book.
 
A lot of topics that may be of interest to spiritual seekers are addressed in one place, in a *somewhat* organized form. A lot of questions from members were answered in simple language and several subtle issues were addressed.
 
The book in PDF format is only 1.5 MB in size and is FREE to download. If you are interested, please go to:

If you want the full link, use the following:

If you find the book useful, please feel free to benefit from it and pass the word around. Otherwise, as I always say, kindly ignore.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
