000 queens. Unable to bear the tyranny of the demon, the celestial beings p=
leaded with Lord Krishna to save them from his torture. But Naraka had a bo=
on that he would face death only at the hands of his mother Bhudevi. So, Kr=
ishna asks his wife Sathyabhama, the reincarnation of Bhudevi, to be his ch=
arioteer in the battle with Naraka.
=C2=A0
When Krishna fell unconscious af=
ter being hit by an arrow of Naraka, Sathyabhama takes the bow and aims the=

d also be taken to interpret that parents should not hesitate to punish the=
ir children when they step in to the wrong path. Lord Krishan was covered i=

anuman. Hanumanji as a baby was really hungry. Whilst fibbing down he saw a=
 object in a sky as excellent as suspicion it was a ripened offspring as ex=
cellent as went to collect it. He flew in to a sky as excellent as place a =
total object in his mouth causing dark via a complete universe. Lord Indra =
requested that Hanumanji lapse a sun. When Hanumanji refused, Lord Indra un=
leashed his vajra as excellent as knocked Hanumanji down to earth releasing=
 a Sun. Recite Hanuman Chalisa 11 times and offer ladoo to Lord Hanumanji.
