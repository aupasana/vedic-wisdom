Namaste

What you are describing seems to be a higher state of visual aware=
ness of energies around of you.  Now usually this state is achieved through=
 some increased saadhana or spiritual practice but it can come involentaril=
y as well, although that is a bit rare.  If you say that you are meditating=
 less than before then just have a quick eye check up done as well to rule =
out anything medical but from what you describe it does indicate higher vis=
ual awareness of energies.   

A few points

1. Usually darker colors such =
as Blue, Purple, Indigo, and Magenta are associated with higher forms of sp=
irituality (VIBGYOR).  Clairvoyants claim to report deeper color auras arou=
nd spiritual practitioners although they also claim that a highly evolved s=
piritual person would have a white or a light pink aura

2. Colors could al=
so associated with closeness to specific dieties that one mediates on.  For=
 example one meditating on the Devi might visualize red more in their medit=
ation or sleep where as on meditating on Rama may see more solar colors etc=
.  

2. There is no universal standard of the interpretation of energy visu=
alization. As an example, one person may associate spirituality with blue w=
hereas another "energy sensitive" may associate white.  There could be no r=
elationship between the color you visualize and a particular characteristic=
 as well.  If you are energy sensitive you will have to develop your own un=
derstanding of what each color means and usually it takes time, practice, a=
nd greater spiritual saadhana.  

3. I would recommend that you get a coupl=
e of books on auras and learn more about energies and colors and they even =
have some exercises to develop this siddhi further. 

4. Most importantly, =
as Narasimha says, don't get mesmerized by the scenery along the way and lo=
se sight of the destination.  If you are attaining a siddhi, knowingly or u=
nknowingly, then use this to get closer to the divine and ask him/her for g=
uidance so that this may be used for the welfare for which it is intended. =
 Surrender the fruits of any siddhi to the divine and don't let it get to y=
our head.  

Regards

Sumeet
