Dear tejomaya

Very truly said that the search for guru must not be given u=
p.But GURU is such a thing that is sanctioned,mailed,and delivered by GOD a=
lone.The apprentice he uses in this endeavour is TIME.
One thing is sure if=
 one finds a true guru "he can distinctly within 2 to 3 days feel a definit=
e powerful change from WITHIN".Even if one is not a shishya just simple eye=
 contact or chat with such an acharya is very effective.

So the thing is w=
hoever has got such a guru knows what a guru is. 

I think Narasimha will n=
od his head(up and down not sideways) silently in this matter.
