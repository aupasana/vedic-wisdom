Hello Biswajit

"...and sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minim=
um. "

When is mind ever satisfied?  Even if by some luck, through a conflu=
ence of various factors, mind becomes 'satisfied', it is usually not for lo=
ng.

the following is a repost of the simplest procedure that Narasimha pos=
ted a while back

Materials needed: Homa kundam, wooden/copper/ silver 
spo=
on/ladle, melted ghee and pieces of dried coconut (or wood or dried cowdung=
 
cakes).
 
(0) Sit facing east and place homa kundam in front 
of you.
 
(=
1) Place some dried coconut pieces or wood or 
dried cowdung cake pieces in=
 homa kundam (fire pit).
 
(2) Light a camphor and place it in the homa kun=
dam 
while saying "om bhuurbhuvassuvarom" and make sure that the pieces pla=
ced 
in homa kundam catch fire.
 
(3) Pour ghee drops with a wooden/copper/=
 silver 
spoon/ladle in the fire while saying the following:
 
om prajaapat=
aye svaahaa
om indraaya svaahaa
om agnaye svaahaa
om somaaya svaahaa
om bhu=
urbhuvassuvaH svaahaa
 
(4) Thinking of Ganesha in your mind, pour ghee 
dr=
ops in fire while saying the following:
 
om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa
o=
m gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa
om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa
om gam gaNap=
ataye namaH 
svaahaa 
(5) Pick any deity and any mantra. Thinking of the 
d=
eity of the mantra, pour ghee drops (or any other valid offering - see manu=
al) 
while saying the mantra. Just add svaahaa at the end of the mantra. If=
 the 
mantra already has a svaahaa at the end, there is no need to add one =
more 
svaahaa.
 
It is also fine to pick a collection of verses 
(e.g. Vish=
nu sahasra naama stotram, Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram, 
Lalita sa=
hasra naama stotram, Aditya hridayam, Subrahmanyashtakam etc). At the 
end =
of each verse, add svaahaa and make an offering in fire. When the stotram 
=
ends, you can go back to the beginning and repeat.
 
Do this for as much ti=
me as you want to. But make 
sure that you do this step for atleast 10-15 m=
inutes.
 
(6) When you are done, pour ghee drops in fire 
while saying the =
following:
 
om bhuuH svaahaa
om bhuvaH svaahaa
om suvaH svaahaa
om bhuurbh=
uvassuvaH svaahaa
om shrii viShNave svaahaa
om namo rudraaya pashupataye sv=
aahaa
 
(7) Try to surrender your mind as completely to god 
as you can. Si=
t absolutely still and meditate for a few minutes with any 
mantra.
 
Done!=


if one can accept that mind may never be satisfied even with the most ela=
borate procedure with the finest materials, then it may be possible to expe=
rience the undiluted essence of this worship.

Best Regards

Ajaya
