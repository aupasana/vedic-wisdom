Thankyou Utpal sir, for all the very valuable suggestions . May I ask anoth=
er question in respect to Chandi path. I can read Sanskrit and know Hindi t=
oo but not fluently. While doing Nyasa few actions are mentioned which I fi=
nd hard to understand. Is it necessary to perform all those actions while c=
hanting the mantras or can one just keep reading the mantras and ignore the=
 actions. What role does these actions play?

I know asking to record the w=
hole of Chandi homam would be hard hence I would humbly request Narsimha Si=
r, to please video record only the nyasa part. I think of all the Homams Ch=
andi homam is a challenge. 

Also I live in a hot place where dangerous spi=
ders and scorpions are a problem. Most of the time I throw them outside but=
 occasionally when they pose danger we have to kill them. I feel very guilt=
y in doing so. I want to ask how much karma and what effect will one have w=
hen one kills them when one is practicing spirituality. But then how are we=
 supposed to tackle the situation. 

Best regards,



Sudha

      Namaste,



Solar eclipse is at Mi=
d-night for US means that it'll not be visible there. However It is still a=
 great idea to engage in a Spiritual practice.

It is believed that Eclipse=
 time is not conducive to do Rituals other than Japam, Meditation. Japam is=
 considered best during that time.

Another thing is that Eclipse time is c=
onducive for spiritual upliftment and not at all good for any worldly desir=
e so i guess any Sadhana done during that time must only for selfless reaso=
ns without having any other sankalpa. It is possible though that Sadhana do=
ne without any worldly desires may sometimes avert or reduce the evil effec=
ts (which may have been pre-indicated by astrology) of Grahana on one's wor=
ldly life.



I think Narasimha has earlier stated that Homam can be done d=
uring Eclipse time. So you can do either Japam or Homam but whatever you do=
, please forget about any other motive. Japam can be of any mantra and homa=
m can also be of any deity you prefer.



Best regards,



Utpal
