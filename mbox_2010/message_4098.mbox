Dear krishna Kanth Garu,

Good question.

I think there is no common soluti=
on for this as each man acts according to
his own nature according to bhaga=
vad gita.

Bg Gita Ch3 Text5

All men are forced to act helplessly accordin=
g to the impulses born of the
modes of material nature; therefore no one ca=
n refrain from doing something,
not even for a moment.
