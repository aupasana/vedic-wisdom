You have put this beautifully. This lat=
ter describes my position quite accurately. I meditate and read, but I some=
how feel as if there is more that I can do. As you put it earlier, using th=
e tools of duality to overcome duality. And I had no clue how to do this.

Th=
ank you (and Rajarshi) for this recommendation. Previously I had no real id=
ea what a homam even was. The links you provided below will be very helpful=
. It may be a few weeks before I can get what is needed, and my living arra=
ngements may make it a little difficult. Would it be appropriate to ask que=

Interesting! I live not relatively close to Rice, just oustide the southwes=
t corner of the 610 loop. There is now a Vedanta Society within a few minut=
es of where I live, but I see it was only started in 2002. Just after I cam=
e to town, interestingly enough.
