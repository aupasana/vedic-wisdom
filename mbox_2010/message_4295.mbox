 God=E2=80=99s creation does not bind; that which does so is the jiva=E2=80=
=99s creation
(101)

Being himself exactly the Supreme Being, but thinking =
himself to be separate
from Him, (man) strives to become united to Him; wha=
t is there stranger than
this? (96)

It is said: The self must be offered t=
o him as a gift=E2=80=99, what is the meaning
of this? Is the self separate=
 from the Supreme One, so as to be given to
Him? (109)

Since His name is =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, the seeker who constantly practices meditation of the
=
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 will be taken to the Source of Being, the world of God.=
 (108)

As the sky is untainted by the properties of air and the other mate=
rial
elements (in it), as the sun is unaffected by the actions of men, so H=
e,
being egoless, is unaffected (by whatever goes on in the world). (97)

K=
now that for those who abide within with dutiful love [for Self], bliss
wil=
l surgingly rise more and more. Bliss, love, Siva, Self, Grace,
knowledge, =
peace and liberation =E2=80=93 all these are [only names for] one=E2=80=99s=
 own
real nature (Guru Vachaka Kovai, 1077)

Shanti [i.e., Peace or Bliss],=
 which is desired by everyone, cannot at all
be attained by anyone, at any =
place, at any time, or by any means, unless
the mind is subdued by the Grac=
e of the Sadguru. Therefore, turn towards His
Grace with one-pointed devoti=
on (290)

Installing the Lord on the heart-throne and fixing the mind unint=
erruptedly
in Self in such a manner that it will become one with it, is the=
 true and
natural worship through Silence (maunopasana). (520)

Instead of =
abiding in the consciousness of one=E2=80=99s own Self by peacefully
scruti=
nizing thus, =E2=80=98Who am I, the form of consciousness?=E2=80=99, why to=
 suffer (by
going out) through the wicked senses, mistaking (oneself) to be=
 the
reflection of consciousness (chit-abhasa) which, being separated (from=
 the
true Self-consciousness), is the form of the mind (chittam)? (1064)

P=
erfect Jnanis have always and will always say, =E2=80=9CBy the mere Grace o=
f the
Sadguru, the Ture Thing =E2=80=93 the final Brahma-Jnana, which shine=
s in the pure
Silence, the rarely attainable Vedanta =E2=80=93 will dawn of=
 its own accord in the
heart as I =E2=80=98-I=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D (287)

Tho=
se who do not know through Self-enquiry what is the truth of their
natural =
state (Self) mistake the alien body to be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and see the w=
orld as
different from themselves and hence suffer in delusion. All other t=
hings
except that (=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99), which shines as the one undeluded
=
Existence-Consciousness-Bliss (Sat-chit-ananda), are seen on account of the=

deceitful play of Maya. (430)

Since the nature of Reality is non-dual (i.=
e, not two), true knowledge
cannot be the knowing of another. Therefore, wh=
en the mind is absolutely
free from delusion (i.e., does not know another) =
and abides unwavering in
beatitude =E2=80=93 that is the true Knowledge. (4=
37)

Bliss will surge forth in the heart which is soaked in the experience =
of the
love-suffused true knowledge (mey-jnana). Misery-creating, delusion-=
caused
desire will not exist there. The extremely pure natural like of Self=
 will be
full of peace. (1093)

On being asked by a devotee as to why He ac=
cepted their pranaam when all
were the one Siva, Bhagavan replied: But why =
shouldn=E2=80=99t I ? Before they
prostrate themselves in front of this bod=
y I prostrate myself before the
Siva in each of them.

Instead of keenly en=
quiring =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 within the Heart =E2=80=93 the rising p=
lace
of thought, where the divine Thing, Siva, shines devoid of thought =E2=
=80=93 and
knowing It (the divine Thing), merging into It and becoming one =
with It as
=E2=80=98I am That=E2=80=99, it is foolish to slip down from the=
 Self. (609)

All other knowledges are defective and petty; the experience =
of Silence
(i.e. Self-Knowledge) is alone Perfect Knowledge. The different =
objective
knowledges are merely superimposed on Self, the Pure Knowledge, a=
nd hence
they are not true. (422)

Those who do not know themselves to be t=
he one (non-dual) Self will perish
daily, vainly suffering in fear (because=
 of seeing the world as something
other than themselves). (Therefore) destr=
oying the notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99,
the root (of all misery),=
 by gaining the firm knowledge of your real Self,
attain the state of non-d=
uality (advaita). (955)

For those who say that He (God) does exist, He exi=
sts in (their) heart as
consciousness. (But) in the venomous mind (of those=
 who do not believe in
Him), He will never exist (that is, He will never sh=
ine or be known). If, by
purifying the venomous mind, one sees without delu=
sion, He will shine
triumphantly and unalloyed as Self. (1083)

Attention t=
o one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is ever shining as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, the=
 one undivided
and pure Reality, is the only raft with which the jive, who =
is deluded by
thinking =E2=80=9CI am the body=E2=80=9D, can cross the ocean=
 of unending births. (294)

The false delusion of the jiva can never be los=
t, unless Self =E2=80=93 the pure
Sat-Chit, which is the one Reality ever s=
hining within, without a second =E2=80=93
is realised. (295)

O mind, inste=
ad of looking at and thereby worrying about that which is
imagined (the wor=
ld), turn towards your source and enter the Heart. In that
supreme state of=
 consciousness, all (that you were seeking before) will
become the one non-=
dual Self, your real nature. (785)

Whoever meditates upon Self in whatever=
 bhava (i.e, in whatever form or with
whatever feeling of relationship), at=
tains It only in that bhava (i.e, in a
qualified or saguna manner). Those p=
eaceful ones who remain quiet without
any such bhava, attain the noble and =
unqualified state of Kaivalya (the
nirguna state of Self). (739)

Since agi=
tation (or confusion) will never rise without (the rising of) the
feeling =
=E2=80=98I am only the body=E2=80=99 (the ego) in the heart, one whose tend=
encies
(vasanas) =E2=80=93 (which are the form of) the ego or mind =E2=80=
=93 are dead will not be
mentally agitated (or confused) even in dream. (11=
31)

Such a True Seeing, which is devoid of illusion and deception, is the =
State
in which one shines as the Ocean of Bliss. Only in the Supreme Silenc=
e which
is thus achieved in Self-Abidance, will be soul never again have a =
downfall.
(350)

Only the truth of Self is worthy of being scrutinized and =
known. Taking It
alone as the aim, one should keenly attend to It and know =
It in the heart
(i.e. within). It can be known only by the silent and clear=
 mind which is
free from agitation and activity. (433)

When the delusive m=
ind which sees differences drowns and dies in the state
of Self, the one ex=
istence-consciousness (Sat-Chit), all the delusive
difference will also tur=
n out to be nothing but the consciousness (chit) of
Brahman (Self), the exi=
stence (sat). (580)

The consciousness of the extremely pure Self-experienc=
e =E2=80=93 which silently
exists devoid of both =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 in one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is the one
bright r=
eality, that which exists devoid of defects =E2=80=93 alone is that which
s=
hines above (all). (1068)

The One Supreme Bliss, =E2=80=98Sadhasivam=E2=80=
=99 (i.e, Self) is alone approved (by
Jnanis) to be the Whole Reality. This=
 world, seem as full of miseries and
defects, is known only by the mind whi=
ch is unreal and divided with
differences. (66)

He whose delusive ego (com=
pletely) subsides and becomes one with existence
consciousness, will cease =
from making the effort of starting (any action or
karma) and will shine in =
the Heart, having attained the natural and peaceful
state of bliss. (864)

=
Give up all attachments towards the petty sense-objects (vishayas), which
a=
re caused by the delusion =E2=80=98I am this fleshy body=E2=80=99. The sile=
nt mind (thus
stilled by renouncing sense-objects) is the pure mani-lingam =
(superior form
of Sivalingam). If this is adored (i.e, if this mental silen=
ce is carefully
preserved with great love, which is the real worship of it)=
, it will bestow
unending bliss. (517)

When the mind which wanders outside=
, knowing only other objects (2nd and 3rd
persons) =E2=80=93 beings to atte=
nd to its own nature, all other objects will
disappear, and then, by experi=
encing it=E2=80=99s own true nature (i.e. Self), the
pseudo =E2=80=93 =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 will also die. (193)

Do not make any real and firm effort=
 except to annihilate the feeling =E2=80=98I am
the body=E2=80=99 (the ego)=
. Know that the ego, =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the sole cause
of =
all samsara-dukha (the miseries of life). (846)

(By confronting it) no one=
 can destroy the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature (of rising and
jumping out through=
 the senses). (The only way to destroy it is to) ignore
it as something non=
-existent (i.e, as a mere false appearance). If you know
and consciously ab=
ide in Self, the base (for the rising and setting) of the
(mind=E2=80=99s) =
nature, the velocity of the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature (i.e, the velocity with=

which it rises and jumps out through the senses) will gradually come to an=

end (since there will be no one to attend to it). (921)

When the feeling =
=E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 (dehatma-buddhi) goes, the delusive
confusi=
on and anxieties will end. Aha! The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 shinning in the hea=
rt in
which enquiry is conducted, is the sans difference supreme consciousn=
ess
(nirvikalpa chit-param). (866)

He (i.e, Self) who exists as the form o=
f consciousness, will not become
non-existent. If one remains devoid of oth=
er knowledge, (that is) if the
deceptive, unreal and dual imaginations (sup=
erimposed) on consciousness are
removed, for oneself who (thus) exists as (=
mere) consciousness there will be
no destruction. (981)

That knowledge is =
not a quality (guna) of Self, because the nature of Self
is nirguna (devoid=
 of qualities). (moreover) Self-knowledge is not an act
(of knowing), becau=
se (Self is) without doership (akartritva. (Therefore)
knowledge is the ver=
y nature (of Self). (1038)

Reality is only one. Know that firm, whole perf=
ect reality alone is that
which is described in many ways by Brahma-jnanis,=
 who have known (it) by
quietly entering the heart with a very subtle intel=
lect. (1234)

The reality which is the mere consciousness (one one=E2=80=99=
s own existence) that
remains when ignorance (of objects) is destroyed alon=
g with knowledge (of
objects), alone is Self (atma). In that Brahma-swarupa=
, which is abundant
Self-awareness (prajnana), there is not the least ignor=
ance (ajnana). Know
thus. (1036)

The projected picture of this world of tr=
iads is a play of Chit-Para-Shakti
(i.e. the power or reflected light of Se=
lf-Consciousness) on the screen of
Supreme Consciousness. (43)

He who has =
attained the life of a Jnani in the heart, will not derive the
least pleasu=
re from the life of the fleshy body and the petty (five) senses.
Is not tha=
t life of Silence itself the unlimited and unbroken experience of
(the blis=
s of) the supreme Brahman? (1120)

There is One who governs the world, and =
it is His lookout to look after the
world. He who has given life to the wor=
ld knows how to look after it also.
He bears the burden of the world, not y=
ou.

This whole world of triads which deludes us, seeming to be an undisput=
able
reality, is only the form of the Supreme Power (Chit-Shakti), which ab=
ides
eternally as none other than the Supreme Self. (48)

To know the sense=
-objects as true instead of knowing the truth of the seer
is due to ignoran=
ce born of false delusion. The True Knowledge is not
learning all the arts =
which you want to know, the imaginary relative
knowledge in Self-Knowledge =
(420)

All kinds of knowledge (even the knowledge of all the arts and scien=
ces)
will completely merge into the Silence =E2=80=93 the pure knowledge of=
 Self. All
other states (as well as knowledges) appear to exist only becaus=
e of the
play of Chit-Sakti (the knowing power, i.e. the mind), which exist=
s in Self,
the supreme and natural state of Bliss. (434)

The true, love-su=
ffused life of abiding unobstructedly in the heart as one=E2=80=99s
own rea=
lity alone is the beauty if Jnana, the enjoyment of the nature of
(Siva swa=
rupa-bhoga), in which the unreal and delusive ego, which prevailed
(formerl=
y), has been destroyed. (1091)

For the Jnani, who, free from the =E2=80=98=
I-am-the-body=E2=80=99 idea, is established in
Self, this world shines as H=
is own Self-Knowledge; and therefore it is wrong
for us to see it as someth=
ing different (i.e, as multiple names and forms).
(59)

Know well that the =
experience of Bliss exists only in Self and never in this
life of delusion,=
 and hence achieve Self-Knowledge, which is the Space of
Grace and the fina=
l state of Supreme Silence. (238)

The true form (nature) of God (Self) can=
not be understood except by the mind
which stands firmly still in nishta (S=
elf-abidance or samadhi). Therefore,
without allowing the mind either to wa=
nder as a vagabond (i.e. to undergo
waking and dream =E2=80=93 sakala) or t=
o fall into laya (i.e, to fall into sleep =E2=80=93
kevala) due to tirednes=
s, train the mind to be conscious and still on one
target (Self). (516)

Wh=
en the ego, the feeling of being separate entity, is removed, chittam
remai=
ns as Shivam, the Supreme Chit, having merged within the Heart as =E2=80=9C=
I am
Consciousness Itself=E2=80=9D, and having thus destroyed all the false=
 and dense
mental conceptions. (198)
