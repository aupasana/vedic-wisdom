      Dear Acharyulu,
=C2=A0
Let me try again. Please understand tha=
t my understanding of these matters maybe entirely flawed. I have as much c=
lue about these things as probably you have. Remember, I am merely a cronic=
ler.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Then, who is the highest God?
=C2=A0
Often a=C2=A0deity =
may=C2=A0manifest in different cultures and people may look at it different=
ly. In ancient Egypt, Sekhmet was a warrior Goddess who rode a lion, the cu=
lt of Sekhmet worshippers were similar to the Shaktas of India. But that is=
 at the realm of deities. 
=C2=A0
A Yaksha or a Yakshni is much lower than =
a deity. It is not a self realized being though it has a far higher energy =
than an average human being.=C2=A0It has - I believe - its own conditioning=
s. 
=C2=A0
Did Manish Ji tell anything about not choosing that place and ch=
osen other end of the shamshan. 
=C2=A0
Firstly, by no means should one mis=
take these mails to be a comprehensive guide book of such sadhanas. It is m=
erely to show people that these are possible. 
=C2=A0
The fire where the bu=
ll was standing had some water puddle=C2=A0nearby. Also, its position was i=
nconvenient to sit at. Manish said as one does more of these sadhanas, when=
 one enters a samshan one gets some hint of which chita is the most suitabl=
e. 
=C2=A0
Just=C2=A0by reading=C2=A0these accounts, by itself no one can d=
o this sadhana. However what one can possibly do is to do some sadhana in w=
hatever condition he or she=C2=A0is in. As Narasimha says, do a homa, do ja=
pa, do kirtan, anything.=C2=A0THAT is the key.

Dear Rajarshi Ji,

=C2=A0 Thanks indeed for the reply. =
O.K. I understand that the Yakshas / Mokuls/ Angels are all different being=
s altogether as you have said.... that leads me to more confusion about one=
ness of God. Then, who is the highest God?

=C2=A0 Also, I have another que=
ry about the presence of the "Mighty Bull". Did Manish Ji tell anything abo=
ut not choosing that place and chosen other end of the shamshan. My query i=
s when Manikarnika was entirely protected by Shiva as it was revealed by Ma=
nish Ji , what was it causing this situation wherein you felt uncomfortable=
 and Manish Ji lead you to the other end of the Shamshan. 

=C2=A0 Thank yo=
u very much in advance for answering the query which lead me to more profou=
nd confusion. Thanks again,

Acharyulu

Namaste Acharyulu,
=C2=A0
I can only take a guess at replying=
 to this. What I say may or maynot be correct.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Generally, wha=
t is called a Yaksha/Yakshini, an Angel in Christianity and a Mokul in Isla=
m, are beings of similar potential.=C2=A0 In different religions, we will f=
ind that the descriptions of different planes like heaven and hell are prov=
ided differently, and it is not just people who reach=C2=A0there after deat=
h, but there are beings in different realms who are born in these planes an=
d exist their in totality. If they were all equal, why are descriptions pro=
vided of these places different in different cultures? Maybe because, in th=
e world of duality there is much more than what meets the five human senses=
. 
=C2=A0
The mind that we have, may not end when the body ends, similar at=
 the different realms there could well be a similar operating software (lik=
e our human mind) through which things are percieved and things appear as d=
iverse or more than what we experience in this realm. The world of duality =
is indeed complex. Often what happens in this plane has a precursor in the =
astral worlds, good or bad, it is said. Aurobindo mentions this in his writ=
ings clearly. So it is possible that there are ethereal beings in different=
 realms who self identify with different astral aspects of our world.=C2=A0=
Bottomline, the world of duality is immensely complex.=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I=
 am not sure if it answers your query apty, but I just gave it a honest sho=
t.

Dear Rajarshi=
,

=C2=A0 Namaste. What an inspiring recitation of the experiences. After r=
eading the third day's experience about the "MOKUL", I wonder, is there rel=
igion among SPIRITS also.....I mean there are spirits of all religions floa=

=C2=A0 Narasimhaji,=
 can you please enlighten on this...

=C2=A0 Thanks a lot for sharing these=
 experiences. .
