Pranaam,

Thank you all for this enlightening forum.
Different schools of t=
hought including Kapila's Saankhya, is attributed to the Vedas. Kapila's Sa=
ankhya - Enumeration and Analysis of the Universe, is primarily based on th=
e foundation that the 'world is full of miseries'. 

Enclosed below is a su=
ccint, blurb of Saankhya philosophy found on the Internet (Bless Raghav's s=
oul). The question being 'why did Sage Kapila atrribute the world to be ful=
l of miseries?' The concluding sentence from the author of the blurb, opens=
 up another question:

'Thus there in all 25 categories which are Prakriti =
and its 23 evolutes and purusha.': are the 23 evolutes 'our chromosomes'?

=
Tvameham!

With Punctuations, and paragraph editing for easier r=
eading.
****************************************************************
Th=
e Sankhya explanation of the world lies in Purusha and Prakriti. Through th=
e union of two the world evolves as we know it.

Purusha: Purusha is the se=
lf. In Sankhya philosophy the self is pure consciousness. Coming into touch=
 with it gives unity to to all the movements of the knowledge composites of=
 subtle stuff, which would otherwise have remained aimless and unintelligen=
t. 

It is coming into touch with this principle of intelligence that they =
are intrepreted as a systematic and coherent experience of a person and may=
 thus be said to be intelligized. 

Intelligizing means the expression and =
intrepretation of events or the happenings of knowledge in connection with =
a person, so as to make them a system of expression. 

This principle of in=
telligence is called Purusha. This was the epistemic significance of Purush=
a. Metaphysically these purushas are all pervading and are many. When they =
come into contact with prakriti, prakriti evolves into the world through 23=
 evolutes.

                      * * * * *

Prakriti: Prakriti is the pote=
ntial world. According to the Sankhya theory of causation the effect is pre=
 existent in the cause, and producing an effect means removal of obstructio=
ns of manifestation of the effect. With purusha in contact with prakriti th=
e world which was in its potential state evolves into its actual state. 

 =
                     * * * * *

It is also necessary to understand here the=
 Sankhya theory of Gunas. According to Sankhya what we call matter complexe=
s become at a certain stage feeling complexes and what we call feeling comp=
lexes become at a certain stage mere matter complexes with matter reaction.=
 

If we should analyze any percept into crude and undeveloped sensations o=
f which it is composed at the first moment of its appearance, it comes as a=
 shock than as an image. Even in our ordinary life; elements which precede =
an act of knowledge are probably mere feelings. 

As we go lower down in th=
e scale of evolution, the automatic actions and reactions of matter are con=
comitant with crude manifestations of feeling which never rise to the level=
 of knowledge. The lower the scale of evolution the less keeness of feeling=
, till at last comes a stage where matter complexes do not give rise to fee=
ling but to mere physical reactions. The feelings are therefore things in t=
hemselves, the ultimate substances of which consciousness, gross and matter=
 are made up of. 

                      * * * * *

Ordinarily, it may soun=
d crude to take feelings for ultimate substances; but in Sankhya analysis, =
thought and matter are but two modifications of certain subtle substances w=
hich are in essence but three type of feeling entities. 
There are three ty=
pes of feelings usually: pleasure, pain and dullness which are the manifest=
ations of three types of feeling substances regarded as ultimate entities c=
alled :sattva, rajas and tamas (gunas) respectively. 

Now, before this wor=
ld came into being there was a certain state in which the guna compounds ha=
d disintegrated into a state of disunion and had by their mutual opposition=
 produced a state of equilibrium called prakriti. Then due to proximity of =
purusha a disturbance occured in prakriti and as a result it brought forth =
a creation of manifold. Prakriti thus is a state of perfect homogeneity and=
 incoherence of the gunas, thus gradually evolved and become more and more =
determinate, differentaited, heterogenous and coherent. The gunas are alway=
s uniting, separating and uniting again.

In the phenomenal product whateve=
r energy there is; is product of rajas: all resistance, stability: is due t=
o tamas, and all conscious manifestation: due to sattva. When one guna is p=
reponderant in any particular collocation, the others are co operant. 

   =
                   * * * * *

Evolution: The gunas when once thrown off bal=
ance try to group themselves again togther in one form, then another and so=
 on, to restore equilibrium, when it is restored it is called pralaya. 

Wh=
en one evolute is produced from another; this second stage is the result of=
 some of the reals of the first stage. The defeciency of the first stage wh=
ich had gone forth to form new aggregate as the second stage is made good b=
y refilling from prakriti and so on in the third stage and by a succession =
of refillings the process of evolution proceeds till we come to a stage whe=
n no new substance can be evolved. 

The first evolute of prakriti is mahat=
. This is indeed the earliest state from which the world has sprung forth; =
and it is a state in which sattva predominates. It holds within itself the =
buddhi of all purushas which were lost in the prakriti during the pralaya. =
The very first work of prakriti is thus manifested by separating out of the=
 old buddhis or minds which hold within themselves specific avidya inhenren=
t in them with reference to each purusha. This state of evolution consistin=
g of all collected buddhis is called buddhitattva. 

                      =
* * * * * 
Looked at from this point of view; it is the widest and universa=
l existence comprising all creation and it is thus called mahat (the great =
one). 

The mahat tattva once being produced; further modifications take pl=
ace. Mahat is now disturbed by three parallel tendencies of a preponderence=
 of sattva, rajas and tamas and is called ahamkara and the latter mentioned=
 tendencies are called tamasika ahamkara (bhutadi), rajasika ahamkara (taij=
asa ahamkara) and vaikarika ahamkara.

The ego or ahamkara are specific exp=
ressions of general consciousness which takes experience as mine. The funct=
ion of ego is therefore called abimaana (self assertion). The sattvik ahamk=
ara produces manas or mind which is transclucent and gives rise to the spec=
ific notion of egohood. From bhutadi ahamkara through the help of rajas are=
 generated the tan matras, the immediately preceding causes of gross elemen=
ts. These tan matras are sabda tanmatra (the sound potential), Vayu tanmatr=
a (touch potential), rupa tanmatra (colour potential), rasa tanmatra (taste=
 potential) and gandha tanmatra (smell potential). The sound potential with=
 accretion of rudiment matter from bhutadi generates akasha or ether. Throu=
gh such constant co mingling the atoms and then the gross elements are prod=
uced.

                      * * * * *

Purusha and Prakriti: Purusha due t=
o his contact with prakriti falsely identifies himself with the evolutes of=
 prakriti. He thinks he is a limited being, conditioned by mind and body, u=
naware of his true nature. 

The knowledge that he is different from mind a=
nd body produces liberation. This knowledge is attained through continuous =
discrimination between purusha and prakriti. There is an inherent teleology=
 or blind purpose in the lifeless prakriti, that all its evolution and tran=
sformations take place for the sake of purusha, to produce various kinds of=
 experiences for him and finally leading him to liberation or mukti.

Thus =
there in all 25 categories which are Prakriti and its 23 evolutes and purus=
ha.
