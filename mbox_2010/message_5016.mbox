Dear Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,
Namaste.

At the begining of the "Pitr=
i Tarpana" section it say..
"First place the water pot in front of you, bow=
 to it and say the following. This means, "may my ancestors come here and a=
ccept my water oblations".

The above instructions suggested to me that we =
are inviting the ancestors in the water pot (since we bowed down to the wat=
er pot). 

However, Narashima Ji's today's post clarifies that we invite th=
e ancestors in the area and not the water pot. Is my understanding correct?=


If so what is the significance of bowing to the water pot?

My appoloiges=
, if there questions sound very basic. Please excuse my ignorance.

Reveren=
tly,
Mahesh
