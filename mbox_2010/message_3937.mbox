Narasimha Ji

I read Manish ji's mail with interest and the advice given on=
 the aashirwad by the unkilled sperm cells brought some more questions to m=
y mind. I remember quite clearly in the starting of book3 aghora Vimalanand=
a says Karma is nothing but the sum total of Aashirwad and Abhishaap.

1.Da=
ily many people curse us knowingly or Unknowingly...do all these curses aff=
ect us in a way even though we might not be knowingly causing any harm to t=
he other person. Is the curse still justified and is there a way this effec=
t can be reduced. For example : An employee might have an very troublesome =
colleague who might be cursing him for no fault of his .

2.Can pitri tarpa=
na and homa be performed one after the another . Would I be causing an offe=
nse to the deity invited into the fire by performing at the same place wher=
e an pitri tarpana was performed.


3.Also is it okay to peform Pitri tarpa=
na in the night if time is not available in the mornings. Somehow I am very=
 comfortable with the idea of homa at night...but Pitri tarpana at night se=
ems to make me uncomfortable . 

4.Mango sticks seem to available in the lo=
cal indian store in the place currenty am , Can these sticks be used for an=
 homa or is there any spiritual injunction against their use.


5.Could you=
 please suggest a good book with both sanskrit and english transliteration =
for the Devi Mahatyam/Chandi path .
