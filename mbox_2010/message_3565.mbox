Dear Narasimhaji,
    
    Thanks a lot for the explanation. I think i got =
it, By letter 'S'  i  guess is  the 'Sandhi' you described for joining word=
s. For eg in oage 24 ganapathi homam (sanskrit version)  in varshodhara me+=
abhayam is shown as meSbhayam cha me.. 

Thanks a lot.
With Warm Regards
Sh=
ashi
