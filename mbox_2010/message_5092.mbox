Dear Utpal,

To put it in simple words, anything and everything that you ex=
perience around 
you and what 99.99999 percent people experience=C2=A0(for =
example writing this 
mail,=C2=A0reading this mail, doing a homa, enjoying =
a movie, reading a scripture is 
all in the field of Shakti and duality). E=
xperiencing Shiva=C2=A0is probably perfect 
still and beyond. Stillness is=
=C2=A0always relative. The more still you become 
internally, the more mind=
 stops it's incessant movement from one thought to 
another,=C2=A0slowly an=
d slowly one comes=C2=A0closer to shiva-tattwa. The Shiva that 
Narasimha m=
entioned=C2=A0in the mail is the Ultimate Shiva where your mind just stops =

completely, becomes absolutely still or is completely negated. A still min=
d is 
nearly no-mind. 


This is a loose definition=C2=A0but the idea is si=
milar.=C2=A0Therefore, as in the Durga 
Saptasati pdf of=C2=A0Dr Satya Prak=
ash you can find, in essence all forms of worship 
of all cults happen in=
=C2=A0the realm of Shaktih. Even the slightest movement inside 
the realm o=
f=C2=A0 the mind is Shaktih!

- Regards
=C2=A0 Rajarshi

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>T=
o put it in simple words, anything and everything that you experience aroun=
d you and what 99.99999 percent people experience (for example writing=
 this mail, reading this mail, doing a homa, enjoying a movie, reading=
 a scripture is all in the field of Shakti and duality). Experiencing Shiva=
 is probably perfect still and beyond. Stillness is always relati=
ve. The more still you become internally, the more mind stops it's incessan=
t movement from one thought to another, slowly and slowly one comes&nb=
sp;closer to shiva-tattwa. The Shiva that Narasimha mentioned in the m=
ail is the Ultimate Shiva where your mind just stops completely, becomes ab=
solutely still or is completely negated. A still mind is nearly no-mind. </=
DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>This is a loose definition but the idea is=
 similar. Therefore, as in the Durga Saptasati pdf of Dr Satya Pr=
akash you can find, in essence all forms of worship of all cults happen in&=
nbsp;the realm of Shaktih. Even the slightest movement inside the realm of&=
nbsp; the mind is Shaktih!</DIV>

If one can be with Shiva *and* Shakti at the *same time*, then one is<BR>&g=

t; aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one ("this is I", "that is beautiful",<=
BR>> "that is ugly", "I like that" etc), one is unable to perceive the e=
ntire<BR>> field of Shakti. This is just like a person tied to a rock in=

 mastery over<BR>> Shakti. That comes only when one has zero attachment =
to anything in the<BR>> field of Shakti. That
 comes only when one is wi=
th Shiva enough and<BR>> eventually becomes like Shiva. If a yogi reache=

 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). Except=

t; Let me put this in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in<BR>> =
moolaadhaara, our self-awareness identifies with the physical body and<BR>&=

!),<BR>> one is aware of various realities that are out there in this un=
iverse.<BR>> For example, one world (realm of awareness) may be reverber=

 particular<BR>> light and every being in that world may be a small part=
icle in that<BR>> light reverberating with that sound. Like that, there =
are many worlds<BR>> out there
 (within us) and one can enter a samadhi =
through any of them,<BR>> when Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.<=
BR>> ><BR>> > When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one's self-awar=

objectification that is<BR>> the hallmark of Shakti. If shakti comes bac=

eluded by duality. However, if<BR>> shakti comes back from sahasrara to =
mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva,<BR>> then one is aware of duality and=
 non-dual Self at the same time. One<BR>> lives as a liberated sage, usi=
