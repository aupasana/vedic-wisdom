Indus Script Decipherment
by
Dr.Madhusudhan Mishra

www.indusscri=
pt.com


In my young age, on every occasion of the Sarasvati-Puja, I used t=
o 
wonder how the goddess Sarasvati came to be associated with learning. 
T=
here is no story of her birth as in case of Lakshmi and Parvati, for 
examp=
le. Therefore, the period of her appearing as goddess of learning 
cannot b=
e easily determined.

Sarasvati appears first of all as a mighty river in t=
he RV. She is said 
"to flow from the mountains upto the sea" (7,95,2), "to=
 swell by getting
waters from the rivers" (6,52,6), and "to be the seventh =
river, fed by  
(other) rivers" (7,36,6). All these facts from the family-b=
ooks of the 
RV attest the intimate relation of the RSis with the river Sar=
asvati, 
but elsewhere (e.g. in 10,17,7-10) she appears to be deified , as =
if 
those RSis had only heard about her. The other Vedic Samhitas and 
Brah=
manas do not refer to her physical form, but regard her as goddess. 
She is=
 not merely a river there.

At the isolating stage of the Aryan speech, not=
hing was known by its 
name. There were only clauses to mention a thing. If=
 there was a river, 
it could be refer to as "it flows". Though the river, =
later called 
Sarasvati, might have been flowing very mightily at that time=
, an Indus 
text simply says: Sa  (nipple) ra (speed) Sa (end), meaning 'fr=
om the 
mountain it flows and stops on the way'. There is also a clause  Sa=
 ra 
Sa gha which seems to say : the waters flowing from the mountain will =

stop. Though the river might have been flowing from the time immemorial,
i=
t was seen slowing down after the rainy season, and it was destined to 
sto=
p late

My own recent work and approach

Copyright Kedarnath 2=
010

I dont like mysteries or anything remotely connected with it in 
Hindu=
ism. What on earth are the seals and strange images and glyphs? 
There are =
pots, jars, horns and impossible quadrupedes. strange 
combinations of glyp=
hs. There has been work and more done on the subject
of the seals, I believ=
e for hundreds of years without anything 
conclusive.

There are two reason=
s why mysteries can remain "mysteries" - (1) 
Professionals ganging up to t=
ry and keep the truth under the carpet for
a  variety of reasons. This coul=
d be region, language, race, religion
and  political or simple and pure cus=
sedness. (2) People having better
things  to do. The seekers of truth and t=
hose that dont like dichotomies
have a  strange uneasiness when they have t=
o face it.

The only thing any Hindu can do when facing dichotomy is to do =
decide 
"doing it yourself". This is by definition, a matter of being alone=
 in a
crowd. And that is not a matter for discomfort to the Hindu, is it? A=
ny 
dichotomy there can be resolved by remembering the gurus of the world 
=
may give "prasad" but chew it you have to, alone. Neither the guru nor 
any=
 body can do it for you. Nor would you like it if they did.

Artefacts with=
 images of jars, fish signs, one horned heiffer (eka 
shru~ggi), sprouts se=
edlings, rimless wide pots are about 74% of the 
total and remaining have a=
n interesting  variety of images of crabs, 
scorpions, ligatured animals, l=
ions, boars etc. This, in toto is the 
finds of archeologists. Whether the =
above are any kind of language is 
the crux of the issue.. It is lso a matt=
er of debate and conferences and
politics and societal divides in Hindus an=
d foreign "scholars"  having a
hey day.

I would be the last person to go d=
elving into language and grammars of 
either Sanskrit or Tamizh or Telugu t=
o understand the artefacts and get 
bogged down. My simple question would b=
e , "If so much effort has gone 
into decipherment - how much would have go=
ne into cipherment". And why? 
Did the creators of the artefacts want their=
 children to go crazy in 
their own times looking at pots and fish and stra=
nge ligatures by any 
standards at any time? I dont think that civilization=
 however weird 
would do that. This is like teaching an innocent child that=
 a cat is 
actually a dog and dog is an alligator. And crabs are things to =
play 
with.

Yet they are there. So, there is message and sombody went thro=
ugh a lot 
up trouble. Forgetting that they gave a lot more trouble than th=
ey took 
in creating the artefacts, who in today's world does that? The ans=
wer is
the language teacher in any school and particularly grammar. They do=
 
that for gerunds, yowels, aorists, fricatives, sibiliants, oxymorons and
=
other tiring things for people of any age.

The paradox of language is that=
 it is so easy for a child to speak a non
native language but so difficut f=
or it to learn the grammar of  its own 
mother tongue. If I, as a child alo=
ng with all classmates and the 
student body as whole disliked the subject =
do I have any reason to 
expect that a child in the past or future to jump =
with joy for the 
grammar class to begin. Looking back, if I really had my =
way and not 
bribed in some way, it would have taken more than a pair of ox=
en to have
dragged me into the class.

In all likelihood, this has always b=
een the case. The job of the 
teacher, as always has been to teach. It is s=
tandard practice for 
teachers at all times to make difficult to teach subj=
ects with help of 
teaching aids.  And that becomes my master key for inves=
tigation.

Of all languages Sanskrit is the most researched from since earl=
iest 
times. vyAkarNa or grammar of Sanskrit is vedanga or part of the veda=
 
itself. And there is sacredness attached to it. This, in my mind is more
=
than enough reason for the creators of the artefacts to have taken the 
tro=
uble. And the trouble they have taken is for children of their own 
times, =
posterity and history. Since that makes me comfortable to think 
about, I c=
an proceed to go ahead with comfortable research. My current 
problem is to=
 dichotomy of trying to run with the hare and hound. This 
is just as impos=
sible as the images in the artefacts.  So, the approach 
is take up a Sansk=
rit Grammar book.  Whitneys ought to do fine. A PDF 
file of this now ancie=
nt and not in copyright domain had all its word by
word text extracted out =
and put into ordinary spreadsheets.

Whitney uses approximately, 17,00 sans=
krit words among about 70, ooo 
unique english words to exlain Sanskrit gra=
mmar and amon these are 
matches for "jar", "pot",  "fsh", "claw" etc. The =
grammar category where
it has been used is noted and synonyms for the Engli=
sh for synonyms in 
Sanskrit from Monier Williams dictionary are compiled.
