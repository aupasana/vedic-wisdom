Dear Sri NarasimhA, 

Last year, when it was the beginning of uttarAyaNam, =
our local temple priest organized an upAkarma ritual for us south Indian br=
ahmins over here in Michigan. Now, he has left our city - so I turn to you =
for help. I know just the mantras for changing the sacred thread and I chan=
t the savitru gayatri mantra for a thousand times. Last year, our priest ma=
de the brahmachAris do a homam with the same mantra a thousand times but sa=
id the householders should only do a japam, although at other times I do of=
fer gayatri mantra in almost every homam that I do. Now, I need guidance fr=
om you in some aspects, if you could help me. 

1. I have two sons, whose u=
panayanam is done. I want them make them do a homam with thousand times Gay=
atri mantra while I want to chant the mantra with them. Can I also join in =
the homam? 

2. Can you guide us how to recite the mahasankalpa, kAnDa rish=
i tarpaNas etc. (essentially the whole upAkarma procedure, if possible)

Al=
so, I was told that upakarma is done because vedas are not supposed to be s=
tudied in uttarAyana (as this time is earmarked for studying shad-angas and=
 other sastras/itihasas), but vedic schools do study anyway because they mu=
st finish the syllabus in time and hence as a prAyaschitta they do perform =
this upAkarma. But now a days, with no one studying vedas, (at least in our=
 family) is it still relevant to do this? In any case, I think it is a good=
 idea at least to change the sacred thread and chant the Gayatri mantra to =
the best of our ability on that day. Could you please advise us as to how t=
o carry out that project? 

Also, I have one trivial question, what is "dwi=
tIya parArthE" ? as it comes in dwitIya parArthE, swEtha varAha kalpE, vaiv=
aswata manvantarE .... and so on. I know the rest of them, but confused abo=
ut this phrase! 

Regards, 

Nagraj Kota
