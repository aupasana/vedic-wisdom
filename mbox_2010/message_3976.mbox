For Biswajit, I was serching for this message of Narasimha b=
ut could not find.

to Biswajit:

I think this is the best if there is a re=

Vijay's Modifications can also be tried.

Once more the=
 reminder cum request -once Agni has come in the form of Jaatvedas, one sho=
uld try to forget about any polar thoughts. 

Best Regards,

utpal
