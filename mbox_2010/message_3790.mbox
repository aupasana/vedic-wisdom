i Narasimharao garu,
> 
>               I am very much in awe after I learn=
t that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.2=
5 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that f=
eat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavan=
danam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 min=
utes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10=
 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes=
 do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours i=
n all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana differen=
t from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it =
is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is a=
ll about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musicia=
n also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshit=
ar recently.
