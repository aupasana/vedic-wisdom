Namaste Sindhu ji,
=C2=A0
Although this mail is addressed to Narasimha, I =
had a few points to make since the mail is in the forum.
=C2=A0
and do not =
violate the fundamental principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
What exactly is=
 the "fundamental principles" of a vedic ritual? In my little=C2=A0understa=
nding, it is the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-realization, which is the=C2=
=A0only=C2=A0"fundamental principle". Anything else is dispensable and ther=
efore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are abo=
ut eternal truths, nothing short. 
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to po=
int out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=
=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panih=
omam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " =
brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the r=
ight hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the r=
ight hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no de=
fect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa ca=
n be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arise=
s.
=C2=A0
Thank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very pe=
rtinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by say=
ing one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and=
 a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-real=
ization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire"=
 in his right hand? Never! 
=C2=A0
A real "srotriya" is one who has realize=
d the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may=
 have" spiritual abilities of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective=
 of whether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a b=
lind tradition without having experienced anything and thus violating the e=
ssence of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spi=
ritual consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0'vedic' rituals, if at all=
 they can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an e=
mpty shell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. 
=C2=
=A0
Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare =
palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Bot=
h, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.
=C2=A0
Homam is a ritualist=
ic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.
=
=C2=A0
This is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing=
 elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means the=
y did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas =
and yagyas?=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pin=
nacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas perfor=
med by him and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they did not "believe" in ad=
vaita? 
=C2=A0
Your above statement stems from an incorrect understanding o=
f what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely sayin=
g that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep b=
elieving that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won't make me Bill Gates. Rath=
er=C2=A0I shall remain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually=
 experiences the state of non-duality, theoritical talk of "All- is Brahman=
" is self-delusion. 
=C2=A0
Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sust=
ained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-=
realized beings - and had experienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to =
perform such long penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily bas=
is. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or =
less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question =
of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority.
=C2=A0
The ques=
tion is not about being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhan=
a bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which =
vedic 'authority' says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experianti=
al knowledge and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, th=
e only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! A=
nd this is why there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily=
 basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experien=
ce merely rivets one's mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in d=
eeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which canno=
t be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sad=
hana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genui=
ne sadhaka. 
=C2=A0

2. "What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not=
 know any."
=C2=A0
Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an ae=
roplane depending on what he knows and what he does ?
=C2=A0
The flying of =
the aeroplane is the same. The way one can learn is different based on the =
different models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!
=C2=A0
3. "K=
nowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It ev=
olves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about =
it."
=C2=A0
Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolvi=
ng around paatra it is a dangerous trend.
=C2=A0
Paatra is a product of the=
 desa and kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these three=
 are used in tandem. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
4. "The only knowledge that should (and=
 can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda=
, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge. Knowl=
edge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute".
=C2=A0
S=
ir, honestly, have you ever read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or=
 for that matter the Sayana bhashya. other than in the ritualistic context.=
 I am quoting the above mantras because they are commonly known.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
This is the precisely the reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly st=
ated that the available interpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to i=
t's essence. Selective words from here and there really do not prove that t=
he Vedas are merely a set of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads t=
o a fallacy where-in one celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believ=
es that the Purusha shukta in an example of human-scarfice practised in the=
 Vedas. I am sure you will disagree with this. 
=C2=A0
Can you kindly enlig=
hten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. Wh=
at is so big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to addre=
ss hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the=
 Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature=
 worshipping pagan's attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by=
 by word translations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to th=
e Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structu=
re between the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadi=
c period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority =
from the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two con=
texts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=
=C2=A0 the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths=
 and their later day derivatives?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Any path, vedic, agamic, y=
ogic, tantrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed exclusively and fully can l=
ead to the desired objective=C2=A0. But mixing up of paths could be disastr=
ous.
=C2=A0
No. Many self-realized people have 'mixed' these artifically cr=
eated boundaried and achived and experienced higher states. Anything that l=
eads to God is good, anything that devates is useless, including arguments =
on artifical constructs like tantra vs vedas etc etc.

Dear Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
Thanks for your reply.
=C2=A0
1. "There are man=
y standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than wh=
at we teach and some more brief. " - 
=C2=A0
Please clarify whether the hom=
a procedure taught by you belongs to the vedic system. If so, which authori=
tative text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping=
 the convenience factor in mind ?
=C2=A0
There are many procedures even wit=
hin the vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given=
 by acharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundam=
ental principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to po=

n be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arise=
s.
=C2=A0
As you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are =
so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you ca=

If you are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there i=
s no objection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authorit=
y for it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if do=
ubts are raised.
=C2=A0
The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,=

=C2=A0
"I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep g=
ratitude for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of en=
lightenment, 
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him=
"
=C2=A0
and now you say
=C2=A0
"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got =
some specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, =
like with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books an=
d formed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of=
 adulation for the "parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the =
adulation and started to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial =
run. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured "param=
para knowledge".
=C2=A0
Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophiza=
tion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His=
 theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay =
ji always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is co=
nvenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not ma=

=C2=A0
As he started =
exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in th=

=C2=A0
With basic concepts like houses, arudha =

=C2=A0 
Naraya=

Namaste,

Thanks for your views. There are many=
 standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than wha=
t we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one us=
es and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irresp=
ective of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those=
 who do not know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that =
you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That=
 will make us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done da=
ily, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.

Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to=
 one's parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, dr=
ink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various item=
s in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot d=
o it everyday and calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months.

I=
s that better or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it l=
ess formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?

* * *

The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corr=
uption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperisha=
ble Self, alone is absolute knowledge.

Knowledge of *external rituals* is =
relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. =
There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.

At the end of the day, the ke=
y is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, =
whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it=
 helps in one's spiritual progress or not.

* * *

Let me cut & paste a sec=
tion from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analog=
y given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.

------------ ---------=
 --------
Do Vedas Describe External Rituals

Some people believe that Veda=
 describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to=
 be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-ka=
ala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by=
 desa-kaala-paatra?

Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on=
 RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in =
his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about=
 absolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about externa=
l matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the i=
mmortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable an=
d purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, vario=
us offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning =
and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.

Metaphor: Ved=
ic Homam vs Aagamic Homam

Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctione=
d by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by V=
eda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.

Once there were many peopl=
e who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoye=
d the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. The=
y described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].

As people started l=
iving a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to=
 put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep wal=
king towards east" and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully f=
ollowed the instructions [rituals].

People started moving further and furt=
her inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea.=
 This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a se=
a. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did no=
t find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two =
miles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked t=
heir chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object=
 and even became satisfied that that was sea!

Then came some great person,=
 whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for=
 a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few mont=
hs. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included rid=
ing a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].

People performing the old rituals=
 objected to this and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the=
 book of sea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" =
[pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the crypti=
c poems of the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that t=
hose poems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They w=
ere blissfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someon=
e already close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who act=
ually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the=
 sea from there!

Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, ch=
ariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead =
of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra=
/ yantras].

One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and =
other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though=
 the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too =
dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=
l dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=
ak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =
the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=
 people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=
gh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.

As time progress=
ed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They we=
re foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either =
the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variatio=
ns, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instruct=
ions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know =
that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They onl=
y thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and ther=
e was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They=
 even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated =
directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.

In case the =
analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about =
realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, B=
rihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes vari=
ous aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered =
the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible w=
ays to reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be ma=
de on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements=
 can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based=
 on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current position!

Great m=
en in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came,=
 experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them=
 and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current=
 state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some inst=
ead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.

Stop Arguing and =
Do Sadhana

As the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various path=
s are irrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and f=
ollow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary=
 issue. The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused o=
ne is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transforme=
d internally.

Just as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months doe=
s not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another rit=
ual done once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiri=
tual or material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eat=
en everyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done every=
day gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Su=
ppose the president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 assoc=
iates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and s=
eat them in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one ca=
n exchange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.

Supp=
ose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all th=
e 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individually following =
the protocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch i=
n the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 asso=
ciates together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use th=
at time to let the President eat in peace?

Similarly, is it wise if one ex=
changes long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one =
cut short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?

In a fire ritual,=
 making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas =
done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preli=
minary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If =
one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scr=
iptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tr=
adeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.

ctions deleted>

Proof of the Pudding

At this time, more than hundred peop=
le are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time wo=
rshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of=
 surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute t=
ruths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=
=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can=
 try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself=
 if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of t=
hinking.

<DIV>Namaste Sindhu j=
i,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Although this mail is addressed to Narasimh=
a, I had a few points to make since the mail is in the forum.</DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic =
rituals.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>What exactly is the "fu=
ndamental principles" of a vedic ritual? In my little understanding, i=
t is the goal which is God-realization, which is the only&nb=
sp;"fundamental principle". Anything else is dispensable and therefore not =
eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eternal=
 truths, nothing short. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It will be intere=
sting here to point out that when some sections of samavedis when they perf=
orm sraadham do the hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It =
is called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a d=
ictum called " brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be per=
formed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever p=
resent in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin.=
 There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and s=
ay that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then th=
e problem arises.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for =
the interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent question regardi=
ng this.  And what exactly does it mean by saying one learned in the V=
edas? Can one, who has mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of t=
he same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be called a "sr=
otriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire" in his right hand? Neve=
r! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A real "srotriya" is one who has <EM>reali=
zed </EM>the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a bei=
ng "may have" spiritual abilities of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irres=
pective of whether he is born in brhamin family, is merely follow=
ing a blind tradition without having experienced anything and thus violatin=
g the essence of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have=
 no spiritual consequence. What use is such a 'vedic' rituals, if=
 at all they can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, =
is an empty shell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time.=
 </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the =
ritual is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a person who has neve=
r experienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.<=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and=
 if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></=
EM> </DIV>
<DIV>This is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were fa=
mous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic=
, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themse=
lves in homas and yagyas?  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Vasistha spok=
e the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramaya=
na speaks of different yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.  Does =
it mean they did not "believe" in advaita? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yo=
ur above statement stems from an incorrect understanding of what is Advaith=
a Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe =
in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that I a=
m Bill Gates, but that won't make me Bill Gates. Rather I shall r=
emain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences the =
state of non-duality, theoritical talk of "All- is Brahman" is self-delusio=
n. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs=
 sustained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all =
self-realized beings - and had experienced the state of Advaitha - use=
d to perform such long penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a dail=
y basis. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It is=
 not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which =
is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct=
 and based on what vedic authority.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<=
DIV>The question is not about being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, i=
s the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespecti=
ve of which vedic 'authority' says what, if a said sadhana is not leading t=
o experiantial knowledge and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. T=
herefore, the only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience fo=
r oneself! And this is why there are so many who are already doing the homa=
s on a daily basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And e=
ach experience merely rivets one's mind to the sadhana more and more thus p=
lunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That=
 which cannot be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective =
that any sadhana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judge=
d by a genuine sadhaka. </DIV>

<DIV>1. =
"There are many standard homam procedures in the world today, some more ela=
borate than what we teach and some more brief. " - </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>Please clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you belongs to th=
e vedic system. If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is=
 it one designed by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?</DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>There are many procedures even within the vedic sys=
tem for performing homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas =
; is complete in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles =
of vedic rituals.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It will be interesting here =
to point out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadha=
m do the hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called p=
anihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum calle=
d " brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on t=
he right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in t=
he right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is n=
o defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that hom=
a can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem a=
rises.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As you have said, any system of worship=
 is acceptable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world.=
 Nobody objects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conf=
orms to the vedic tenets.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Homam is a ritualist=
ic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.<=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It is not a question of whether it is more ela=
borate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a=
 question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If yo=
u are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no =
objection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for=
 it, please answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge if doubts =
are raised.</DIV>

<DIV>"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some speci=

and started to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial run. Slowl=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yes, his teachings contain fascinating =
philosophization, which is really superficial and does not stand any real s=

<DIV>As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked=

<DIV>Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of s=

<P align=3Dleft>Narayana dasa is based on the pro=
gression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends 
<P align=3Dleft>=
and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another r=
asi 
<P align=3Dleft>becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the prog=
ressed lagna as the reference, we 
<P align=3Dleft>find out the events that=
 happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each 
<P align=3Dleft>p=
erson, with each chart applicable in one dasa.

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Thanks for your views. There are many standard h=

and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I wi=

he exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not=
 know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do =
daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make =
us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please=
 consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.<BR><BR>* * *<B=

 do it everyday and calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months.<=

from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy giv=
en earlier and addresses some relevant issues.<BR><BR>------------ --------=
- --------<BR>Do Vedas Describe External Rituals<BR><BR>Some people believe=
 that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is s=
upposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound =
by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be =
unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?<BR><BR>Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrat=
ed commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a di=
fferent take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that =
Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative trut=
hs about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is=
 why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that =
is
 perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the d=
ivine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=
=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desir=
es.<BR><BR>Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam<BR><BR>Notions that so an=
d so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya=
 ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metapho=
r.<BR><BR>Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They=
 regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absor=
bed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice crypti=
c poems [Veda].<BR><BR>As people started living a little away from the sea =
[less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions o=
n how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the instru=
ctions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions
 [ritual=
s].<BR><BR>People started moving further and further inland and started liv=
ing in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never=
 seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perform=
ed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated e=
ndlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and f=
ormed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, foun=
d a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfied=
 that that was sea!<BR><BR>Then came some great person, whose instincts led=
 him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [us=
e of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together =
newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=
=A4gama and tantra].<BR><BR>People performing the old rituals objected to t=
his and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the
 book of sea.=
 This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic r=
itual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of th=
e original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems ta=
ught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfull=
y unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone already clo=
se to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the=
 sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from the=
re!<BR><BR>Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots =
etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just=
 instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantr=
as].<BR><BR>One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and o=
ther dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though =
the distance to sea was much shorter through that
 jungle, it was just too =
dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=
l dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=
ak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =
the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=
 people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=
gh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.<BR><BR>As time pr=
ogressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. T=
hey were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of e=
ither the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other va=
riations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the in=
structions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even=
 know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. Th=
ey only thought they were supposed to
 follow the instructions faithfully a=
nd there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and tim=
e. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave u=
pdated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.<BR><BR=
>In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. V=
eda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varu=
na, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda d=
escribes various aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it i=
s considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light =
on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and absolute stateme=
nts can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definiti=
ve statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can =
be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current posit=
ion!<BR><BR>Great men in many
 spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as =
outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current state o=
f people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reach that st=
ate from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced =
the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths=
.<BR><BR>Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana<BR><BR>As the metaphor above illustrat=
es, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is i=
mportant is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or=
 an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether one =
does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving=
 and how one is being transformed internally.<BR><BR>Just as a twenty cours=
e meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =E2=
=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or a =
year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or
 material pursuits. Just as =
a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to on=
e, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s =
