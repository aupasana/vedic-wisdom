Some extracts from Sri Aurobindo's writings on four aspects of the divine M=
other. 

"Four great Aspects of the Mother, four of her leading Powers and =
Personalities have stood in front in her guidance of this Universe and in h=
er dealings with the terrestrial play.- One is her personality of calm wide=
ness and comprehending wisdom and tranquil benignity, inexhaustible compass=
ion and sovereign and surpassing majesty and all ruling greatness.- Another=
 embodies her power of splendid strength and irresistible passion, her warr=
ior mood, her overwhelming will, her impetuous swiftness and world-shaking =
force.- A third is vivid and sweet and wonderful with her deep secret of be=
auty and harmony and fine rhythm, her intricate and subtle opulence, her co=
mpelling attraction and her captivating grace.- The fourth is equipped with=
 her close and profound capacity of intimate knowledge and careful flawless=
 work and quiet and exact perfection in all things.Wisdom, Strength, Harmon=
y, Perfection are the several attributes and it is these powers that they b=
ring with them to the world, manifest in a human disguise in their Vibhuthi=
s and shall found in the divine degree of their ascension in those who can =
open their earthly nature to the direct and living influence of the Mother.=


To the four we give the four great names, Maheshwari, Mahakali, Mahalaksh=
mi, Mahasaraswati.

Imperial Maheshwari is seated in the wideness above the=
 thinking mind and will and sublimates and greatens them into wisdom and la=
rgeness or floods with a splendour beyond them. For she is the mighty and w=
ise One who opens us to supramental infinities and the cosmic vastness, to =
the grandeur of the supreme Light, to a treasure-house of miraculous knowle=
dge, to the measureless movement of the Mother's eternal forces.

Nothing c=
an move her because all wisdom is in her; nothing is hidden from her that s=
he chooses to know; she comprehends all things and all beings and their nat=
ure and what moves them and the law of the world and its times and how all =
was and is and must be.A strength is in her that meets everything and maste=
rs and none can prevail in the end against her vast intangible wisdom and h=
igh tranquil power. Equal, patient, unalterable in her will she deals with =
men according to their nature and with things and happenings according to t=
heir Force and truth that is in them. Partiality she has none, but she foll=
ows the decrees of the Supreme and some she raises up and some she casts do=
wn or puts away into the darkness.

To the wise she gives a greater and mor=
e luminous wisdom; those that have vision she admits to her counsels; on th=
e hostile she imposes the consequence of their hostility; the ignorant and =
foolish she leads them according to their blindness. In each man she answer=
s and handles the different elements of his nature according to their need =
and their urge and the return they call for, puts on them the required pres=
sure or leaves them to their cherished liberty to prosper in the ways of th=
e Ignorance and perish.

For she is above all, bound by nothing, attached t=
o nothing in the universe. Yet she has more than any other the heart of the=
 universal Mother. For her compassion is endless and inexhaustible; all are=
 to her eyes her children and portions of the One, even the Asura and Raksh=
asa and Pisacha and those that are revolted and hostile. Even her rejection=
s are only a postponement, even her punishments are a grace.

But her compa=
ssion does not blind her wisdom or turn her action from the course decreed;=
 for the Truth of things is her one concern, knowledge her centre of power =
and to build our soul and our nature into the divine Truth her mission and =
her labour.

Mahakali is of another nature.

Not of wideness but of height,=
 not wisdom but force and strength are her peculiar power. There is in her =
a overwhelming intensity, a mighty passion of force to achieve, a divine vi=
olence rushing to shatter every limit and obstacle. All her divinity leaps =
out in a splendour of tempestuous action; she is therefore swiftness, for t=
he immediately effective process, the rapid and direct stroke, the frontal =
assault that carries everything, before it.

Terrible is her face to the As=
ura, dangerous and ruthless her mood against the haters of the Divine; for =
she is the Warrior of the Worlds who never shrinks from the battle. Intoler=
ant of imperfection, she deals roughly with all in man that is unwilling an=
d she is severe to all that is obstinately ignorant and obscure; her wrath =
is immediate and dire against treachery and falsehood and malignity, ill-wi=
ll is smitten at once by her scourage.

Indifference, negligence and sloth =
in the divine work she cannot bear and she smites awake at once with sharp =
pain, if need be, the untimely slumberer and the loiterer. The impulses tha=
t are swift and straight and frank, the movements that are unreserved and a=
bsolute, the aspiration that mounts in flame are the motion of Mahakali.

H=
er spirit is tameless, her vision and will are high and far-reaching like t=
he flight of an eagle, her feet are rapid on the upward way and her hands a=
re outstretched to strike and to succour. For she too is the Mother and her=
 love is as intense as her wrath and she has a deep and passionate kindness=
. 

When she is allowed to intervene in her strength, then in one moment ar=
e broken like things without consistence the obstacles that immobilise or t=
he enemies that assail the seeker.

If her anger is dreadful to the hostile=
 and the vehemence of her pressure painful to the weak and timid, she is lo=
ved and worshipped by the great, the strong and the noble; for they feel th=
at her blows beat what is rebellious in their material into strength and pe=
rfect truth, hammer straight what is wry and perverse and expel what is imp=
ure or defective.

But for her what is done in a day might have taken centu=
ries; without her Ananda might be wide and grave or soft and sweet and beau=
tiful but would lose the flaming joy of its most absolute intensities. 

To=
 knowledge she gives a conquering might, brings to beauty and harmony a hig=
h and mounting movement and imparts to the slow and difficult labour after =
perfection an impetus that multiplies the power and shortens the long way. =
Nothing can satisfy her that falls short of the supreme ecstasies, the high=
est heights, the noblest aims, the largest vistas.

Therefore with her is t=
he victorious force of the Divine and it is by grace of her fire and passio=
n and speed that great achievements can be done now than hereafter."
