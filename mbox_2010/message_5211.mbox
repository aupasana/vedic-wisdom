Namaste,
 
No written or spoken words can ever capture something perfectly. If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able to capture all of its details well. If you read thousands of books on an elephant without having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like some and dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.
 
Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.
 
My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar's take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara's commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada's commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.
 
Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.
 
My philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the starting point. In addition, search actively and try to actually see the elephant oneday.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

If you read the telugu version, can you please clarify if those points are covered in telugu also somewhere? The language is quite complex by today's standards (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading it enough and interpreting right? But I keep trying to read as I love that poetry by the great poet Potana.

When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.

One's aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.

Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.

If an astrologer's action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of "I am doing this", then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.

Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.
