Bhagavan taught that true renunciation was giving up interest in and
attach=
ment to anything that is not the Self:

Giving up the non-Self is renunciat=
ion. Inhering in the Self is jnana or
Self-realisation. One is the negative=
 and the other the positive aspect of
the same, single truth. (Day by Day w=
ith Bhagavan, 2nd January, 1946,
afternoon)

Renouncing the ego

Only those=
 who have renounced the ego-mind have truly renounced. What have
all the ot=
hers, who may have given up other things, really renounced?

By becoming th=
e source of all desires, the ego is the doorway to the sorrow
of samsara. T=
he extremely heroic and discriminating person first attains
through dispass=
ion the total renunciation of desires that arise in the form
of =E2=80=98I =
want=E2=80=99. Subsequently, through the Selfward enquiry =E2=80=98Who am I=
?=E2=80=99, he
renounces that ego, leaving no trace of it, and attains the =
bliss of peace,
free from anxieties. This is the supreme benefit of dharma.=



Renouncing desires

Question: What is the best way of dealing with desir=
es, with a view to
getting rid of them =E2=80=93 satisfying them or suppres=
sing them?

Bhagavan: If a desire can be got rid of by satisfying it, there=
 will be no
harm in satisfying such a desire. But desires generally are not=
 eradicated
by satisfaction. Trying to root them out that way is like pouri=
ng spirits to
quench fire. At the same time, the proper remedy is not forci=
ble
suppression, since such repression is bound to react sooner or later in=
to
forceful surging up with undesirable consequences. The proper way to get=
 rid
of a desire is to find out, =E2=80=98Who gets the desire? What is its =
source?=E2=80=99 When
this is found, the desire is rooted out and it will n=
ever again emerge or
grow. Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink a=
nd sleep and attend to
calls of nature, though these may also be classed am=
ong desires, you can
safely satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your =
mind, necessitating
further birth. Those activities are just necessary to c=
arry on life and are
not likely to develop or leave behind vasanas or tende=
ncies. As a general
rule, therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desir=
e where the
satisfaction will not lead to further desires by creating vasan=
as in the
mind. (Day by Day with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

Question: How=
 am I to deal with my passions? Am I to check them or satisfy
them? If I fo=
llow Bhagavan=E2=80=99s method and ask, =E2=80=98To whom are these passions=
?=E2=80=99
they do not seem to die but grow stronger.

Bhagavan: Satisfying=
 desires and thereby trying to root them out is like
trying to quench fire =
by pouring kerosene oil over it. The only way is to
find the root of desire=
 and thus remove it.(Day by Day with Bhagavan, 2nd
January, 1946)

Question=
: How can they [desires] be rendered weaker?

Bhagavan: By knowledge. You k=
now that you are not the mind. The desires are
in the mind. Such knowledge =
helps one to control them.

Question: But they are not controlled in our pr=
actical lives.

Bhagavan: Every time you attempt satisfaction of a desire t=
he knowledge
comes that it is better to desist. What is your true nature? H=
ow can you
ever forget it? Waking, dream and sleep are mere phases of the m=
ind. They
are not of the Self. You are the witness of these states. Your tr=
ue nature
is found in sleep. (Day by Day with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

=
Bhagavan: There is room for kama [desire] so long as there is an object
apa=
rt from the subject, i.e., duality. There can be no desire if there is no
o=
bject. The state of no-desire is moksha. There is no duality in sleep and
a=
lso no desire. Whereas there is duality in the waking state and desire also=

is there. Because of duality a desire arises from the acquisition of the
o=
bject. That is the outgoing mind, which is the basis of duality and of
desi=
re. If one knows that bliss is none other than the Self the mind becomes
in=
ward turned. If the Self is gained all the desires are fulfilled.(Talks
wit=
h Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 502)


Renunciation of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =
and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99


=E2=80=98Internal renunciation=E2=80=99 is ren=
unciation of the ego whereas =E2=80=98external
renunciation=E2=80=99 is giv=
ing up possessions. Together they are known as giving up
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99. It is the former that results in enlightenm=
ent.

If you attain perfect mastery of internal renunciation, external
renu=
nciation will have no importance. (Padamalai, p. 170, v. 102)

Bhagavan som=
etimes illustrated the superiority of inner over outer
renunciation by tell=
ing the story of King Sikhidhvaja who unnecessarily gave
up his kingdom and=
 retired to the forest to seek enlightenment:

He [the king] had vairagya [=
non-attachment] even while ruling his kingdom
and could have realised the S=
elf if he had only pushed his vairagya to the
point of killing the ego. He =
did not do it but came to the forest, had a
timetable of tapas and yet did =
not improve even after eighteen years of
tapas. He had made himself a victi=
m of his own creation. Chudala [his
enlightened wife] advised him to give u=
p the ego and realise the Self, which
he did and was liberated.

It is clea=
r from Chudala=E2=80=99s story that vairagya accompanied by ego is of no
va=
lue, whereas all possessions in the absence of ego do not matter. (Talks
wi=
th Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 404)

Abandon your mind unconditionally at=
 the feet of him [Siva] who shares his
form with the Lady [Uma]. Then, as t=
he =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that investigates the false dies
away, along with [t=
he concept of] =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, the powerful Supreme Self will
unfol=
d fully and flourish eternally. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, vv. 484, 487)


Renoun=
cing the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea

Question: Why cannot the Sel=
f be perceived directly?

Bhagavan: Only the Self is said to be directly pe=
rceived [pratyaksha].
Nothing else is said to be pratyaksha. Although we ar=
e having this
pratyaksha, the thought =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99 is v=
eiling it. If we give up this
thought, the Atma, which is always within the=
 direct experience of everyone,
will shine forth. (Living by the Words of B=
hagavan, 2nd ed., pp. 218-19)

Here is a sequence of verses from Guru Vacha=
ka Kovai that covers this
important aspect of renunciation:

34

The world =
that associates with us as an appearance of names and forms is as
transient=
 as a lightning flash. The faltering understanding =E2=80=98I am the body=
=E2=80=99
is the deceptive device that makes us desire the world as if it w=
ere real,
[thereby] entrapping us instantaneously in the powerful snare of =
bondage.


846

Be aware that the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 ego is tr=
uly the one unique cause of all
the sorrows of samsara. Therefore, make gen=
uine, firm and steady efforts to
destroy that ego, and desist from making a=
ny other kind of effort.


Renouncing the =E2=80=98I am the doer=E2=80=99 i=
dea

According to Bhagavan, it is not actions themselves that should be giv=
en up,
but the inner feeling that one is doing them:

If total cessation fr=
om activity is alone the determining criterion for
jnana, then even the ina=
bility to act because of leprosy will be a sure
indication of jnana! You sh=
ould know that the state of jnana is the exalted
state of remaining without=
 any sense of responsibility in the heart, having
renounced both the attrac=
tion to, and the revulsion from, the performance of
actions. (Guru Vachaka =
Kovai, verse 1160)

Unless one=E2=80=99s connection with individuality is d=
estroyed at its root, one
will not become a true jnani, free of the sense o=
f doership [kartrutva].
Even if one attains a supreme and eminent state of =
tapas that can be
marvelled at, one is still only a sadhaka who is qualifie=
d to realise the
truth. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 122)

Deeds [karma] are not=
 your enemy, only the sense of doership [kartrutva] is.
Therefore, live you=
r life, having completely renounced that enemy.
(Padamalai p. 171, vv. 106,=
 107)

A mind that has dissolved in the state of God, and ceased to exist, =
will not
be aware of any activity that needs to be performed because when t=
he ego,
which has the idea that it is the performer of actions, has been co=
mpletely
destroyed, the idea that something needs to be accomplished ends.
=

Prarabdha, like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind that=

has shrunk through the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea. However, it c=
annot stir, even
slightly, the limitation-free mind that shines as the extr=
emely clear space
of being-consciousness when that ego-impurity [the =E2=80=
=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea] is
destroyed by self-enquiry. (Guru Vachaka=
 Kovai, vv. 703, 698)

Sankalpa [thought] creates the world. The peace atta=
ined on the destruction
of sankalpas is the [permanent] destruction of the =
world. (Padamalai, p.
264, v. 6)

The world is seen distinctly only in the =
waking and dream states in which
sankalpas [thoughts] have emerged. Is it e=
ver seen during sleep, where
sankalpas do not emerge even slightly? Sankalp=
as alone are the material
substance of the world. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 2=
9)

Instead of ruining yourself by clinging, as your refuge, to the utterly=

false world that appears as a conjuring trick, it is wisdom to renounce it=

in the mind and remain still, forgetting it and remaining detached from it=
,
like the ripe tamarind fruit that, despite remaining inside its pod, stay=
s
separate from it. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, verse 825)

Question: Should not a=
 man renounce everything in order that he might get
liberation?

Bhagavan: =
Even better than the man who thinks =E2=80=98I have renounced everything=E2=
=80=99
is the one who does his duty but does not think =E2=80=98I do this=
=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98I am the
doer=E2=80=99. Even a sannyasi who thinks =
=E2=80=98I am a sannyasi=E2=80=99 cannot be a true
sannyasi, whereas a hous=
eholder who does not think =E2=80=98I am a householder=E2=80=99 is
truly a =
sannyasi. (Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 530)

Know that not reg=
arding oneself erroneously as being limited to the body and
trapped in fami=
ly bonds is a far superior renunciation to the state wherein
one thinks rep=
eatedly within one=E2=80=99s mind: =E2=80=98I have truly extricated myself =
by
renouncing all the ties of this world.=E2=80=99 (Guru Vachaka Kovai, ver=
se 840)

Muruganar made the following comments on this Guru Vachaka Kovai v=
erse:

Thinking, =E2=80=98I am a person who has renounced=E2=80=99 is only =
mental imagination. The
state of truth transcends such imagination. Only th=
e state of remaining
still, which is the natural state, is true sannyasa, t=
he nature of
liberation. It is not thinking repeatedly, =E2=80=98I am someo=
ne who has renounced
samsara=E2=80=99. Therefore, not thinking is a far sup=
erior renunciation to
thinking. Like the thought, =E2=80=98I am caught in b=
ondage=E2=80=99, the thought, =E2=80=98I am one
who is free from bondage=E2=
=80=99 indicates the delusion of regarding yourself as
being limited to the=
 body. When that delusion is destroyed, along with it,
both of these though=
ts will cease. Unless the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 belief is
present=
 to some extent, there can be no possibility of having the thought,
=E2=80=
=98I have renounced=E2=80=99.

<br>Unless one=E2=80=99s connecti=
on with individuality is destroyed at its root, one will not become a true =
jnani, free of the sense of doership [kartrutva]. Even if one attains a sup=
reme and eminent state of tapas that can be marvelled at, one is still only=
 a sadhaka who is qualified to realise the truth. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 1=
22)=C2=A0<br>

<br>Deeds [karma] are not your enemy, only the sense of doer=
ship [kartrutva] is. Therefore, live your life, having completely renounced=
 that enemy. (Padamalai p. 171, vv. 106, 107)<br><br>A mind that has dissol=
ved in the state of God, and ceased to exist, will not be aware of any acti=
vity that needs to be performed because when the ego, which has the idea th=
at it is the performer of actions, has been completely destroyed, the idea =
that something needs to be accomplished ends.<br>

ced=E2=80=99 is only mental imagination. The state of truth transcends such=

thinking is a far superior renunciation to thinking. Like the thought, =E2=
=80=98I am caught in bondage=E2=80=99, the thought, =E2=80=98I am one who i=
