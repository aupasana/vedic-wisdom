Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th

Ho=
wever, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using "Om" and
reach go=
d? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such
as the mah=
amantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with "Om",
because Krish=

Unlikely. One is more likely to reach sama=

external actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely f=

There are so many

d/purified
slowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Un=

then, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that ha=

of the homam, while sitting still

do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I have =
made it a point to insist that people do japam with their favorite mantra a=
t the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea is t=
hat homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reaching god=
, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, one's=
 internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking - so=
rry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at other=
 times.<br>> > <br>> > * * *<br>> > <br>> > Now ont=
o other questions:<br>> > <br>> > (1) It is unfruitful in the s=
ense that it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense t=
hat it stops you from going much further away from god. After all, if you w=

ly your mind will wander even more.<br>> > <br>> > I suggest lo=
oking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a heckler interrup=

orrying, simply take note of your thoughts, pause for a second and move on.=

mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in differe=
