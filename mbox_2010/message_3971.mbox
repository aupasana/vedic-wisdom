Thanks Utpal, I have got the point...so, there is no need worry a=
bout the super short procedure, whether it misses some MANTRA is not a fact=
or, the most important is the Dedication, Devotion, Complete Surrender to d=
eity, am I right? 

So, any trim down version, containing "Ahuti" and "Medi=
tation" are enough in a homam procedure.

let me know your opinion...
best =

Biswajit

In any Homam, Most Important parts are Specific Aahutis offered with Mantra=

 yes I know there is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sa=
nskrit-verse and sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum.
