Namaste,
 
Links to tarpana manuals with mantras given in various Indian languages were deleted from the main web page by accident. We don't know when this happened. Thanks to Utpal and Ravi for pointing it out.
 
I fixed the page so that people can download manuals with mantras given in various languages. Please go to
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana
 
or
