Hi,
For Ekadashi tithi in our part of India, concept followed is very simpl=
e. Take the local sunrise time. Subtract 1 house 36 minutes from it. If thi=
s new time happens to be Ekadashi Tithi than Vrata is observed that day. Th=
e purpose is to avoid any Dasami connection with Ekadashi. It is OK to obse=
rve in Dwadashi but not on Dasami.

Hope this helps. 

Regards,
Aashish

ubject: [vedic-wisdom] Ekadashi Vratam

  
Hi All,

I have been observing a=
 fast on Ekadashi for quite some time now. My mind has come up with followi=
ng queries regarding Vratam with Ekadashi Vratam in particular. Can someone=
 please answer the following: -

- I consider "Vratam" as "Sankalpam" (Mean=
s a Vow) and not mainly "Upwaas" (Which means bowls empty). And I observe E=
kadashi Vratam as Falaahar Vratam i.e. Vow to sustain myself on Fruits main=
ly. At the same time, I observe it as a Upwaas in the sense that I eat only=
 two times a day, thereby, keeping my bowls empty for most of the time. Is =
this the right way of doing Ekadashi Vratam?

- Also, there is an ambiguity=
 about Udaya Tithi. For Example, Ekadashi in India starts this noon and rem=
ains till tomorrow noon or so. But, since Ekadashi will be the Tithi per to=
morrow's sunrise, Tomorrow is recommended for Vratam by Panchangas. I am no=
t sure if this sampling (or synchronisation) by sunrise (clock) of the tith=
i (data) comes from ancient texts or some recent modifications have brought=
 this concept. This becomes specifically ambiguous when Ekadashi happens to=
 begin just after one sunrise (hold violation) and ends few minutes after t=
he next sunrise. Per Udaya Tithi, Ekadashi will be the next day, although a=
ll the conjuct (in degrees from 120 or 240 to 132 or 252 so) has lost its i=
mpact by that time.
Can someone please clarify?

- For me, Ekadashi is the =
day when Sun and Moon are in trines i.e. Our mind has close trinal conjunct=
 with our soul. That is how this is an auspicious day. Now, based on Udaya =
tithi, Ekadashi is celebrated on the day when at sunrise, Sun is in Lagna a=
nd Moon is in any of the trines. Thus, on the sunrise, it is auspicious wit=
h Sun, Moon and Lagna all being in auspicious positions. But, does that mak=
e that whole day auspicious enough for Vratam?

-  Any specific Homams that=
 can be done on Ekadashi to boost your spiritual progress?

- Any specific =
Mantras?

I have more questions which I will try ask as and when my underst=
anding of these things get better.

Best Regards,
Sriram
