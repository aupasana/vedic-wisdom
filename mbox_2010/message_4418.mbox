Suppose this small pot has a human mind. Being smaller than the others, it
=
has a very deep complex.

It comes to me and says, =E2=80=9CI am very sad.=
=E2=80=9D
I asked, =E2=80=9CWhy are you sad?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=
=99t like myself.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhy don=E2=80=99t you like yourself?=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWell, look at me. Everybody calls me =E2=80=98midget.=E2=80=
=99=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, you are a midget?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes, I am a m=
idget.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CDo you accept that?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYeah.=E2=80=
=9D

=E2=80=9CWhy don=E2=80=99t you enjoy being a midget? A midget can get =
in anywhere. Between
two people, you can just scoot in without a problem. I=
t=E2=80=99s wonderful. No
ceiling will hit your head.=E2=80=9D This is call=
ed positive thinking. Then I
convinced the pot how advantageous it is to be=
 a midget, and it was happy.
=E2=80=9CThank you, I feel good!=E2=80=9D The =
therapy session is over. Then it happened to
see a larger pot. And the bigg=
er pot said to it, =E2=80=9CMidget! Why did you come
here?=E2=80=9D All pos=
itive thinking disappears for the small pot. =E2=80=9CI am a midget!=E2=80=
=9D
Again he tells me, =E2=80=9CI am sad. I don=E2=80=99t like myself.=E2=
=80=9D I ask, =E2=80=9CFrom where did
you come?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CFrom Indi=
a.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhy did you come here?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI thought I =
could make it in America.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThen what did you do in America=
?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNothing.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CAre you not in America?=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes, I am in America. In the Gurukulam, under the table. Ar=
ound me are all
these big fellows who go on teasing me. I have no respect.=
=E2=80=9D Then I told this
pot, =E2=80=9CHey, you are not from India.=E2=80=
=9D
=E2=80=9COh, from where? I have an Indian passport with a photo.=E2=80=
=9D
=E2=80=9CYou are not from India.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThen from where?=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou are from clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhat?!=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=
=9CFrom clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CFrom clay I came? No, from India I came.=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNo, you are from clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, I came from a =
place called clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNo. When I say you came from clay, I m=
ean you came from clay, you are clay,
and are sustained by clay.=E2=80=9D
=
=E2=80=9CI am sustained by clay?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CYes. The weight of you =
is the weight of clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, I have a weight?=E2=80=9D
=E2=
=80=9CYes, you have a weight. The weight of clay is your weight.=E2=80=9D
=
=E2=80=9CSo that means I have no weight?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes, you have no=
 weight.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CMy God! I thought I was a midget, weighing a few=
 ounces, but you have taken
away those ounces also! So I am a weightless po=
t?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CIn fact, you are not a pot.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=
=99m not a pot? What are you talking about? I don=E2=80=99t understand you.=
=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou will understand better. Now, listen, what is this?=
=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s a big pot, a very proud pot.=E2=80=9D
=E2=
=80=9CWhere did it come from? From India?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNo.=E2=80=9D
=
=E2=80=9COh, from clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes, it came from clay. Sustained=
 by what?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CBy clay. Then you mean to say the weight of pot=
 is the weight of clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes. It is the weight of clay.=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CSo it=E2=80=99s not a big pot?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CIt is clay=
.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, it has more clay and I have less clay!=E2=80=9D

Th=
e complex doesn=E2=80=99t go. It is very difficult. My god, it is a job I h=
ave
here to make this fellow understand.
=E2=80=9CThere are two clays. One =
clay is big, more clay, and I am less clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CNo. There are=
 not two clays. There is only one clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThere is only one=
 clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CIf I count clay, I cannot c=
ount two?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou cannot.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhy not? There=E2=
=80=99s clay there and clay here.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CBut both are clay.=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, that seems to be true. There is one clay. Then I=E2=80=
=99m clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes, you are clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI am clay=
 and the other fellow, the big guy, is also clay? All are clay?=E2=80=9D
=
=E2=80=9CYes, all are clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CThen I won=E2=80=99t die?=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou won=E2=80=99t die.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CReally? I=E2=80=99=
m not a midget!!=E2=80=9D

Then he came back to me the next day, and said, =
=E2=80=9CI could understand it
yesterday, but today, I feel bad.=E2=80=9D
=
=E2=80=9CYou have to practice samadhi.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, what is that?=
=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou have to think, =E2=80=98I am clay.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D=

=E2=80=9CHow?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI will teach you how to do that, and you k=
eep doing it.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CIt looks very funny.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CWhy?=
=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CI am a little clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D
=E2=
=80=9CSo why should I think I am clay?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYou need not.=E2=
=80=9D
=E2=80=9CBut I don=E2=80=99t feel like I am clay.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9C=
Then you have to think.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9COh, that is what this meditation =
is about?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D
