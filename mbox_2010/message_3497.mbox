Dear Rajarshi,

=C2=A0 Namaste.=
 What an inspiring recitation of the experiences. After reading the third d=
ay's experience about the "MOKUL", I wonder, is there religion among SPIRIT=
S also.....I mean there are spirits of all religions floating around....I w=
as, in my limited knowledge, thinking that the religion is only to the body=
...Please shed some light on this...

=C2=A0 Narasimhaji, can you please en=
lighten on this...

=C2=A0 Thanks a lot for sharing these experiences. .
