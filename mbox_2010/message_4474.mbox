"In exception cases like suicide, do we say that it's a dest=
iny or it's a free will used by an individual to run away from suffering?"
=

It is just my feeling that  suicide is a strong case of free will. Many of=
 the scriptures specifically mention suicide as one of the greatest sins an=
d the atma wanders around as a pisacha for many thousands of lifetimes for =
this sin. It is a case of an Individual running away from suffering but sin=
ce the karmic accounts need to be paid it will have to suffer without a bod=
y .

Kanchi Paramcharya once explained the riddle of fate vs freewill very =
beautifully .I am attaching the link below as well as copying the matter fo=
r the benefit of rest of the members.

The Riddle of Fate and Free-Will Solv=
ed

(A dialogue between His Holiness Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati

Mahaswam=
i and a Disciple): [His Holiness was the Sringeri Mathadhipati

1912-1954.]=


 

H.H. : I hope you are pursuing your studies in the Vedanta as usual?

=
D. : Though not regularly, I do make some occasional study.

H.H. : In the =
course of your studies, you may have come across many doubts.

D. : Yes, on=
e doubt repeatedly comes up to my mind.

H.H. : What is it?

D. : It is the=
 problem of the eternal conflict between fate and free-will.

What are thei=
r respective provinces and how can the conflict be

avoided?

H.H. : If pre=
sented in the way you have done it, the problem would baffle

even the high=
est of thinkers.

D. : What is wrong with my presentation? I only stated th=
e problem and

did not even explain how I find it to be a difficult one.

H=
.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of the problem.

D. : Ho=
w?

H.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things. There can be no
=

conflict if there is only one thing.

D. : But here there are two things, =
fate and free-will.

H.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of yours that is =
responsible for your

problem.

D. : It is not my assumption at all. How ca=
n I ignore the fact that the

two things exist as independent factors, whet=
her I grant their

existence or not?

H.H. : That is where you are wrong ag=
ain.

D. : How?

H.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know=
 that fate is

nothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of th=
e

results of your past actions.

As God is but the dispenser of the fruits=
 of actions, fate,

representing those fruits, is not his creation but only=
 yours.

Fre-will is what you exercise when you act now.

D. : Still I do n=
ot see how they are not two distinct things.

H.H. : Have it this way. Fate=
 is past karma; free-will is present karma.

Both are really one, that is, =
karma, though they may differ in the

matter of time. There can be no confl=
ict when they are really one.

D. : But the difference in time is a vital d=
ifference which we cannot

possibly overlook.

H.H. : I do not want you to =
overlook it, but only to study it more deeply.

The present is before you a=
nd, by the exercise of free-will, you can

attempt to shape it.

The past i=
s past and is therefore beyond your vision and is

rightly called adrishta,=
 the unseen. You cannot reasonably attempt

to find out the relative streng=
th of two things unless both of them

are before you. But, by our very defi=
nition, free-will, the present

karma, alone is before you and fate, the pa=
st karma, is invisible.

Even if you see two wrestlers right in front of yo=
u, you cannot

decide about their relative strength. For, one may have weig=
ht, the

other agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit=
 of

practice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on

b=
uilding arguments on arguments to conclude that a particular

wrestler will=
 be the winner.

But experience shows that each of these qualifications may=
 fail

at any time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only practica=
l

method of determining their relative strength will be to make them

wres=
tle.

While this is so, how do you expect to find by means of

arguments a =
solution to the problem of the relative value of fate

and free-will when t=
he former by its very nature is unseen!

D. : Is there no way then of solvi=
ng this problem?

H.H. : There is this way. The wrestlers must fight with e=
ach other and prove

which of them is the stronger.

D. : In other words, t=
he problem of conflict will get solved only at the

end of the conflict. Bu=
t at that time the problem will have ceased to

have any practical signific=
ance.

H.H. : Not only so, it will cease to exist.

D. : That is, before th=
e conflict begins, the problem is incapable of

solution; and, after the co=
nflict ends, it is no longer necessary to

find a solution.

H.H. : Just so=
. In either case, it is profitless to embark on the enquiry

as to the rela=
tive stregth of fate and free-will.

 

A Guide

 

D. : Does Yor Holiness =
then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to

fate?

H.H. : Certainly =
not. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-

will.

D. : How =
can that be?

H.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exer=
cise of your

free-will. By exercising your free-will in the past, you brou=
ght on

the resultant fate.

By exercising your free-will in the present, I=
 want you to wipe

out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if=
 you find it

enjoyable.

I any case. whether for acquiring more happiness =
or for reducing

misery. you have to exercise your free-will in the present=
.

D. : But the exercise of free-will however well-directed, very often

fa=
ils to secure the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies

the actio=
n of free-will.

H.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It i=
s not an

extraneous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-wi=
ll.

On the other hand, it is already in yourself.

D. : It may be so, but =
its existence is felt only when it comes into

conflict with free-will. How=
 can we possibly wipe out the past

record when we do not know nor have the=
 means of knowing what it is?

H.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced =
souls, the past certainly

remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is=
 very often an

advantage to us.

For, if we happen to know all the results=
 we have accumulated

by our actions in this and our past lives, we will be=
 so much

shocked as to give up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitig=
ate

them. Even in this life, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful

Go=
d has been pleased to bestow on us, so that we may not be burdened

at any =
moment with a recollection of all that has happened in the

past.

Similarl=
y, the divine spark in us is ever bright with hope and

makes it possible f=
or us to confidently exercise our free-will. It

is not for us to belittle =
the significance of these two boons--

forgetfulness of the past and hope f=
or the future.

D. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterri=
ng the exercise

of the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. Al=
l the

same, it cannot be denied that fate very often does present a

formi=
dable obstacle in the way of such exercise.

H.H. : It is not quite correct=
 to say that fate places obstacles in the way

of free-will. On the other h=
and, by seeming to oppose our efforts,

it tells us what is the extent of f=
ree-will that is necessary now to

bear fruit.

Ordinarily for the purpose =
of securing a single benefit, a

particular activity is prescribed; but we =
do not know how

intensively or how repeatedly that activity has to be purs=
ued or

pesisted in.

If we do not succed at the very first attempt, we can=
 easily

deduce that in the past we have exercised our free-will just in th=
e

opposite direction, that the resultant of that past activity has

first =
to be eliminated and that our present effort must be

proportionate to that=
 past activity.

Thus, the obstacle which fate seems to offer is just the g=
auge

by which we have to guide our present activities.

H.H. : The obstacl=
e is seen only after the exercise of our free-will; how

can that help us t=
o guide our activities at the start?

H.H. : It need not guide us at the st=
art. At the start, you must not be

obsessed at all with the idea that ther=
e will be any obstacle in

your way.

Start with boundless hope and with th=
e rpesumption that there

is nothing in the way of your exercising the free=
-will.

If you do not succeed, tell yourself then that there has been

in t=
he past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by exercising

your free=
-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must now

exercise your fr=
ee-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to

achieve your object.

Tel=
l yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle is of your

own making, i=
t is certainly within your competence to overcome it.

If you do not succee=
d even after this renewed effort, there can

be absolutely no justification=
 for despair, for fate being but a

creature of your free-will can never be=
 stronger than your free-will.

Your failure only means that your present e=
xercise of free-will

is not sufficient to counteract the result of the pas=
t exercise of

it.

In other words, there is no question of a relative prop=
ortion

between fate and free-will as distinct factors in life. The relativ=
e

proportion is only as between the intensity of our past action and

the =
intensity of our present action.

D. : But even so, the relative intensity =
can be realised only at the end

of our present effort in a particular dire=
ction.

H.H. : It is always so in the case of everything which is adrishta =
or

unseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. When

yo=
u see it for the first time, you actually see, say, an inch of it

projecti=
ng out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into the wood

and you cannot=
 now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in

the wood. That lengt=
h, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as

you are concerned. Beautifu=
lly varnished as the pillar is, you do

not know what is the composition of=
 the wood in which the nail is

driven. That also is unseen or adrishta.

N=
ow, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell me

how many pulls=
 will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to

be?

D. : How can I? =
The number and the intensity of the pulls will depend

upon the length whic=
h has gone into the wood.

H.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has go=
ne into the wood is not

arbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes=
 which drove it in

and the intensity of each of such strokes and the resis=
tance which

the wood offered to them.

D. : It is so.

H.H. : The number a=
nd intensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail

depend therefore upo=
n the number and intensity of the strokes which

drove it in.

D. : Yes.

H=
.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.
=

They relate to the past and are adrishta.

D. : Yes.

H.H. : Do we stop fr=
om pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be

ignorant of the len=
gth of the nail in the wood or of the number and

intensity of the strokes =
which drove it in? Or, do we persist in

pulling it out by increasing our e=
ffort?

D. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.

H.H. =
: Adopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as

much a=
s you can. Your will must succeed in the end.

 

Function of Shastras:

 
=

D. : But there certainly are many things which are impossible to attain

e=
ven after the utmost exertion.

H.H. : There you are mistaken. There is not=
hing which is really

unattainable. A thing, however, may be unattainable t=
o us at the

particular stage at which we are, or with the qualifications t=
hat we

possess.

The attainability or otherwise of a particular thing is t=
hus

not an absolute characteristic of that thing but is relative and

prop=
ortionate to our capacity to attain it.

D. : The success or failure of an =
effort can be known definitely only at

the end. How are we then to know be=
forehand whether with our

present capacity we may or may not exert ourselv=
es to attain a

particular object, and whether it is the right kind of exer=
tion for

the attainment of that object?

H.H. : Your question is certainly=
 a pertinent one. The whole aim of our

Dharma Shastras is to give a detail=
ed answer to your question.

Religion does not fetter man's free-will. It l=
eaves him quite

free to act, but tells him at the same time what is good f=
or him and

what is not.

The resposibility is entirely and solely his. He =
cannot escape it by

blaming fate, for fate is of his own making, nor by bl=
aming God, for

he is but the dispenser of fruits in accordance with the me=
rits of

actions. You are the master of your own destiny. It is for you to
=

make it, to better it or to mar it. This is your privilege. This is

your =
responsibility.

D. : I quite realise this. But often it so happens that I =
am not really

master of myself. I know, for instance, quite well that a pa=
rticular

act is wrong; at the same time, I feel impelled to do it. Similar=
ly,

I know that another act is right; at the same time, however, I feel

p=
owerless to do it. It seems that there is some power which is able

to cont=
rol or defy my free-will. So long as that power is potent,

how can I be ca=
lled the master of my own destiny? Whatis that power

but fate?

H.H. : You=
 are evidently confusing together two distinct things. Fate is a

thing qui=
te different from the other one which you call a power.

Suppose you handle=
 an instrument for the first time. You will do it

very clumsily and with g=
reat effort.

The next time, however, you use it, you will do so less

clum=
sily and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will have

learnt to use=
 it easily and without any effort. That is, the facility

and ease with whi=
ch you use a particular thing increase with the

number of times you use it=
.

The first time a man steals, he does so with great effort and

much fear=
; the next time both his effort and fear are much less. As

opportunities i=
ncrease, stealing will become a normal habit with him

and will require no =
effort at all. This habit will generate in him a

tendency to steal even wh=
en there is no necessity to steal. It is

this tendency which goes by the n=
ame vasana. The power which makes

you act as if against your will is only =
the vasana which itself is of

your own making. This is not fate.

The puni=
shment or reward, in the shape of pain or pleasure,

which is the inevitabl=
e consequence of an act, good or bad, is alone

the province of fate or des=
tiny.

The vasana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind

in t=
he shape of a taste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for

doing th=
e same act once again, is quite a different thing. It may be

that the puni=
shment or the reward of the past act is, in ordinary

circumstances, unavoi=
dable, if there is no counter-effort; but the

vasana can be easily handled=
 if only we exercise our free-will

correctly.

D. : But the number of vasa=
nas or tendencies that rule our hearts are

endless. How can we possibly co=
ntrol them?

H.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression =
in outward

acts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and ba=
d.

The stream of vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two

curr=
ents, the good and the bad.

If you try to dam up the entire stream, there =
mey be danger.

The Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On=
 the

other hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good

va=
sana current and to resist being led away by the bad vasana

current.

When=
 you know that a particular vasana is rising up in your

mind, you cannot p=
ossibly say that you are at its mercy. You have

your wits about you and th=
e responsibility of deciding whether you

will encourage it or not is entir=
ely yours.

The Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and

have=
 to be encouraged and what vasanas are bad and have to be

overcome.

>When=
, by dint of practice, you have made all your vasanas

good and practically=
 eliminated the charge of any bad vasanas

leading you astray, the Shastras=
 take upon themselves the function

of teaching you how to free your free-w=
ill even from the need of

being led by good vasanas.

You will gradually b=
e led on to a stage when your free-will

be entirely free from any sort of =
coloring due to any vasanas.

At that stage, your mind will be pure as crys=
tal and all

motive for particular action will cease to be. Freedom from th=
e

results of particular actions is an inevitable consequence. Both

fate a=
nd vasana disappear. There is freedom for ever more and that

freedom is ca=
lled Moksha.
