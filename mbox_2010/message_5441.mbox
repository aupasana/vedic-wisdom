Namaste,
 
If one's sense of dharma tells one that one has a responsibility=
 towards a person and the person is following a wrong path, then one may ha=
ve to do what is in one's hands to change the situation. If talking to the =
person has a chance of helping, one can try that. Sometimes, it may be coun=
ter-productive. If so, one can just wait till the person runs through that =
phase. When (if) the phase is over and the person is ready to disentangle, =
one can help.
 
One of Rammakrishna Paramahamsa's highly learned disciples,=
 Swami Abhedananda, was interested in Raja yoga and hot pursuit of Kundalin=
i rise through physical activity such as breathing. He heard about a guru w=
ith some siddhis and went to him once, though Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had e=
xplicitly told him to stay away from such people. The guru lived on a mount=
ain with disciples and disciples could not leave him once accepted into his=
 fold. Swami Abhedananda accepted the conditions, joined them, spent some t=
ime with them, realized his folly and the wisdom of Ramakrishna's words. He=
 decided to escape. He was found out and the other disciples of that guru k=
ept pelting stones at Swami Abhedananda as he was climbing down the hill. O=
f course, he made it down, came back to Dakshineshwar and fell at Ramakrish=
na's feet. When even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could not stop a disciple from=
 having to go through an experience with a wrong guru, what can people like=
 us do? Karma is powerful and some rinas cannot be avoided. The only way to=
 avoid the results of certain karmas is to not perform them in the first pl=
ace!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
