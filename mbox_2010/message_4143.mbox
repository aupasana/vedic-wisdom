Namaste Ashutosh and Rajarshi,

T=
here are several technicalities like this, which apply when one does a ritu=
al to ensure a specific material result. Some of them are meaningful to an =
extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millennia by i=
ntellectuals.

However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the ple=
asure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.

There ar=
e some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam everyday =
as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these technicalit=
ies.

* * *

If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens=
 (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on earth.=
 You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow of sig=
nals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all times. =
Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainly capa=
ble of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and making th=
em reach various deities.

* * *

If you want to get your father (or mother=
) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may want t=
o pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not tired =
after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course, even =
when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your father=
 may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agendas an=
d only want to tell your father "I love you" and take whatever he gives, yo=
u can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favored by p=
arents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to give.

S=
imilarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are several =
technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you may no=
t get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many corrupti=
ons in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting speci=
fic material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best approach i=
s to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your love =
and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. Such a=
 person will be favored by deities over the long run.

* * *

Namaste Ramak=
ishore,

Different points of space and different points of time have a diff=
erent quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girn=
ar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as sa=
dhana on Pournima.

If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g. a=
 monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Krishn=
a homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned with the =
energy of that deity.

However, one can only make so much progress with occ=
asional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, more int=
ense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/deity,=
 one can do it every day and at all times.

* * *

A lot of beggars may be =
standing at the gate of a king's palace, waiting for the king to see them w=
hen leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king may be =
known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so and so=
 day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate on th=
at day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many beggars=
, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the other h=
and, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king's eyes may fall on you =
someday!

Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep doing=
 your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity's grace. Tha=
t is a sureshot formula for success.

* * *

The issue of auspicious days a=
nd times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more auspic=
ious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For example, if a=
 particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to go ther=
e and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir =
and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you may stil=
l get out cheaply.

Instead of helping, sadhana done on a particularly good=
 day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I remember=
 one incident.

A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted t=
o spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whol=
e day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything like =
tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Ma=
nish and he said, "excellent, go ahead". I meditated with Gayatri mantra fr=
om 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks and h=
aving a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. When I=
 finished in the night, I was in a nice state.

Next morning, I realized th=
at the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday o=
f Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said that spir=
itual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a =
normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to be an=
 auspicious day.

I mentioned it to Manish. He said, "I knew it was Akshaya=
 Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me". I asked him why he d=
id not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, "knowing you were doing th=
is sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have instead =
distracted you."

He was right. As such, I was a little "proud" of the sadh=
ana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement and ex=
pectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted my foc=
us on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadhana is =
supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of useless exc=
itement would've been higher and distracted me even more!

Bottomline: Thum=
brules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of your min=
d. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excitement an=
d expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and patientl=
y waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof =
strategy. My 2 cents..

Best regards,
Narasimha
