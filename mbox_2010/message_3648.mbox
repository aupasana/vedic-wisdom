Namaste Rajarshi,
Thanks for responding to my query. I have some follow up =
quesitons.
1) If I do Chandi homam with only specific chapters do I need to=
 modify the sankalpam in any way. If Yes please let me know what is the cor=
rect method.
2) Do I have to say just a normal swaha or swahah (with intona=
tion) after each verse. 
3) I dont have any idol for Chandi but I do have a=
 photo of my kuladevi (Said to be a Durga manifestation). Can I use this ph=
oto instead of the Idol in the homam. Whats the correct translation of the =
word "Photo" in Sanskrit and how do I use it while doing avahanam and udhva=
sanam.

It would be really great and useful to many beginner sadhakas like =
me if there is a chandi homam video similar to the one that Narasimhaji has=
 uploaded for ganapathi homam. Maybe not for the entire Chandi recitation b=
ut the introductory parts along with nyasa would be really helpful. Request=
 you and Narasimhaji to kindly consider this request.

Thanks and Regards,
=
Girish Sundaram

Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Query on Chandi Homam

=C2=
=A0 
Dear Girish,

Let me try to answer from my perspective. 

While I have=
 been doing the Ganapathi homam for the past few months as regularly as I c=
an , I have always been very drawn to bhagawati / Devi upasanas. I get very=
 emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi or see an endeari=
ng image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with great effort in such s=
ituiations. This does not happen with any other God /deity .
=C2=A0
It coul=
d be that you have a connection with Devi from some life time. 

Does this =
mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it just my mind at work=
ing overtime. 
=C2=A0
Even if it is your mind, the feeling gives you intens=
e happiness. You can't reject the happiness. Can you? If you feel that you =
can and should do worship of Devi, then do it. Don't worry about the pros a=
nd cons of whether it is suitable or not suitable. Just do it.


That seems=
 to be some time away considering that its an exhaustive script. While I co=
ntinue to work on this path, I wanted to do some kind of homam for the devi=
 in the mean time.
=C2=A0
Keep trying to get familiar with the text as much=
 as you can. This may take time. Different people depending on their samska=
ras may take different amount of time to be comfortable with the text. One =
person I know (Narayan Iyer)=C2=A0who was not fluent in devnagri script too=
k more than 10 hours to do the first Chandi homa. He had fantastic determin=
ation. Before I had started with my first homa or even read the Chandi once=
, I had the good fortune of meeting him.=C2=A0Manish had told me that I nee=
ded to do Chandi homa, but I was too scared of the text. It looked complex.=
 Then when I met Manish, he showed me one Chandi homa. At that time I also =
met Narayan and heard from him how he did his first homa. That inspired me =
and=C2=A0that is when I decided, come hail or storm, I have to do it. My fi=
rst homa took me a good 6 and half hours.=C2=A0My advise is that=C2=A0use y=
our=C2=A0will power to tell your mind, that you WILL do it. Set a timeframe=
, that you will keep practising the Chandi
 path for say 3 months or whatev=
er is comfortable with you and stick to it. Where there is a will, there is=
 a way.
=C2=A0
Is it possible to recite only specific portions from the Cha=
ndi for the Chandi homam instead of going through the entore 700 verses?
=
=C2=A0
A good strategy would be to start with the 11th Chapter homa or 4th =
Chapter homa. The Devi Stutis. Narasimha had mentioned this once in this fo=
rum. While trying to familiarize yourself with the text, start with chapter=
 2/3/4. Once you are comfortable with it, then read 2/3/4 and 1. Once you a=
re comfortable with that, then read 2/3/4/1/5. If you can do the first five=
 chapter, the rest will follow. 


Can I use some other mantras like only t=
he Chandi Beeja mantra "om ai=C3=A0 hr=C3=A9=C3=A0 kl=C3=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=
=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce" .
=C2=A0
Sure. However understand that a Chand=
i homa is homa of the 13 chapters. In parts of West Bengal many people ofte=
n claim to do Chandi homas but all they end up doing is ahutis of only the =
Navarna Mantra. That - in my opinion - is NOT=C2=A0a Chandi homa. 

Alterna=
tively can I perform the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know =
the procedure if I am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.=

=C2=A0
The Durga Suktam is a Vedic Suktam. The pronunciation is a key here=
. But why not start with a Chapter from teh actual Shaptasati for homa. Tha=
t would be the best strategy, I feel.

-Regards
