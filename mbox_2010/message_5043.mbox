Namaste learned members,

Durga Suktam which I thought was in praise of God=
dess Durga seems to be more in praise of Fire god asking to help us overcom=
e the obstacles (pls see http://www.celextel.org/vedichymns/durgasuktam.htm=
l).  If it is addressed toward Fire God, why do we meditate on Kanyakumari =
as the main diety of this vedamantra?  What does the last line "Katyanaya v=
idmahe kanyakumari dheemahi tanno durgi prachodayaat" truly mean?  

I appr=
eciate if someone can help me understand it.  

Thanks,
-Sunitha
