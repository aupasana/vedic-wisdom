Namaste,
I chant Atharva shirsha thrice everyday. I was advised by an astro=
loger to perform Chandi Patha once every month as my son has Rahu in 9th ho=
use.But each month something or other prevents me from doing it. I have bee=
n trying this from last couple of months. When I mentioned this to a Pandit=
 he said why don't do recite Durga Saptasloki everyday.Is it correct?

Then=
 I thought what's wrong in reciting mothers name. So I started reciting onc=
e everyday. First 3 days when reciting I was sweating as if I am running in=
 hot sun. Then nothing happens now. Is somthing wrong or it's normal?

Plea=
se share your thoughts.

With Regards,
Aashish
