 Krishnaswami was a native of Srirangam, Tamil Nadu. He came to Sri Ramana
=
in 1936 and was his attendant till Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Mahanirvana.

My =
native town is Srirangam near Tiruchi,situated in Tamil Nadu. I came to
Bha=
gavan in 1936. Till the end I was his attendant. First there was Madhava
Sw=
ami with me. Later on Sathyanandha Swami, Salem Rajagopala Iyer,
Venkatarat=
hnam and others served as attendants to Bhagavan. As I was strict
they call=
ed me =E2=80=9CHall Sarvadhikari.=E2=80=9D Bhagavan jocularly would remark,=
=E2=80=9CYou are
very abrupt and speak sharply to others that=E2=80=99s why=
 people mistake you.=E2=80=9D

There was a lame puppy, which would wag its =
tail whenever Bhagavan went up
the Hill. That puppy was fed with idlies. On=
e day after having idlies the
pup went and urinated in front of Sarvadhikar=
i=E2=80=99s office. Sarvadhikari got
wild and ordered that no more idlies s=
hould be given to the puppy. When
Bhagavan asked why the puppy was not fed,=
 I told him that as it urinated in
front of Chinnaswamy=E2=80=99s office I =
didn=E2=80=99t feed it. Bhagavan got very angry with
me and told me, =E2=80=
=9CBefore so many have come, ruled and gone, one day you too
have to go.=E2=
=80=9D

Immediately I went and reported to Chinnaswamy what Bhagavan had to=
ld and
thus feeding of the puppy resumed.The same mongrel would come in fro=
nt of
Bhagavan with the mouth full of excreta. Bhagavan used to wipe her mo=
uth
clean with his own towel and say, =E2=80=9Csome great soul has come in =
this garb.=E2=80=9D
He never gave me the towel for washing.

Bhagavan used =
to say with a laugh, =E2=80=9CA person performs namaskaram to the
Swami or =
an idol, and expects all his prayers fulfilled and boons
granted.Who wants =
this namaskaram? Even before they prostrate physically, I
prostrate to them=
 mentally.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan would add, =E2=80=9CWho wants all this namask=
aram? Try to know who you are.
That is the import of the namaskaram. I woul=
d not be taken in by all this
gymnastics.=E2=80=9D

One day he told me =E2=
=80=9COne could produce God through alchemy. But even if that
God tells you=
 something don=E2=80=99t believe it. If I come in front of you don=E2=80=99=
t
believe it. The Seer is most important. YOU ARE! That=E2=80=99s most impo=
rtant.
Concentrate on the seer, not the seen. All that you see is false and=
 the
seer alone is true. All that you read, all knowledge you gather is use=
less,
until you hold on to your Self. YOU ARE THE TRUTH, not what=E2=80=99s=
 being told to
you, not what you see. What you read in books may be knowled=
ge, but not the
truth.=E2=80=9D

Sri Krishnaswami was over ninety years of =
age when he was absorbed at the
Lotus Feet of the Master in the early hours=
 of March 6, 1996. Sri
Krishnaswami left the Ashram after the Maha Nirvana =
of Sri Bhagavan and
lived in Pala Kothu. Subsequently he returned to the As=
hram and remained as
a regular inmate till the last.
