 20. The Lord whose home is the interior of the Heart-Lotus is extolled as
=
Lord of the Cave. If by force of practice the feeling =E2=80=98I am He, I a=
m the
Lord of the Cave=E2=80=99 becomes firmly established,as firmly as you=
r present
notion that you are the ego is established in the body, and thus =
you stand
forth as that Lord of the Cave, the illusion that you are the per=
ishable
body will vanish like darkness before the rising sun. (composed by
=
Bhagavan,employing the ideas of two verses found in the Prabhulinga Leela,
=
v. 45, 46, Kannada)

21. When Rama asked, =E2=80=98Which is the great mirro=
r in which we see these images
of things? What is it that is called the Hea=
rt of all the beings in the
world?=E2=80=99 Vasishta answered, =E2=80=98Whe=
n we reflect we see that all the beings in
the world have two different hea=
rts.=E2=80=99 (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v. 32, 33)

22. One of these is wort=
h acceptance, the other worth rejection. Listen how
they differ. The organ =
called the heart placed somewhere in the chest of the
physical body is wort=
h rejection. The Heart which is of the form of Pure
Awareness is worth acce=
ptance; it is both within and without =E2=80=94 it has no
inside or out. (Y=
oga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v. 34, 35)

23. That indeed is the essential Heart a=
nd in it all this world abides. It
is the mirror in which all things are se=
en. It is the source of all wealth.
Hence Awareness may be termed the Heart=
 of all beings. The Heart is not a
part of the perishable body inert like a=
 stone. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - 36,
37)

24. Therefore by the practice of =
merging the ego in the pure Heart which is
all-Awareness, the tendencies of=
 the mind as well as the breath will be
subdued. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v=
. 38)

25. By constantly meditating in the Heart, =E2=80=98That pure uncond=
itioned
Awareness that is Siva, That am I,=E2=80=99 remove all attachment o=
f the ego.
(Devikalottara, v. 47)

26. Having investigated the various stat=
es of being, and seizing firmly by
the mind that State of Supreme Reality, =
play your part, O hero, ever in the
world. You have known the Truth which i=
s at the Heart of all kinds of
appearances. Without ever turning away from =
that Reality, play in the world,
O hero,as if in love with it. (Yoga Vasish=
ta, 5 - 18 - v. 20 to 23)

27. Seeming to have enthusiasm and delight, seem=
ing to have excitement and
aversion, seeming to exercise initiative and per=
severance, and yet without
attachment, play, O hero,in the world. Released =
from all bonds of attachment
and with equanimity of mind, acting outwardly =
in all situations in
accordance with the part you have assumed, play as you=
 please,O hero, in the
world. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 18 - v. 24 to 26)

28. He=
 who by Knowledge of the Atman is established in the Truth, he who has
vanq=
uished the five senses =E2=80=94 call him the fire of knowledge, the wielde=
r of
the thunderbolt of Knowledge, the Conqueror of Time and the Hero who h=
as
slain death. (a verse from the Yoga Vasishta)

29. Just as on the earth =
with the coming of spring the tree shines in fresh
beauty of foliage, even =
so he who has seen the Truth will shine with growing
lustre, intelligence a=
nd power.(Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 76 - v. 20)

30. Like one to whom a tale is to=
ld while his thoughts are wandering far
away, the mind which is free from a=
ttachment is inactive while it acts. But
the mind immersed in attachments i=
s active, though it does not act, like the
sleeper lying motionless
here, w=
ho in his dream climbs a hill and tumbles down. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 -
56 - v.=
 13, 14)

31. As the movement of the cart, its standing still and its being=
 unyoked
are to the passenger asleep in the cart, even so are action, conte=
mplation
and sleep to the Sage asleep in the cart of his body.

32. For one=
 who seeks waking, dreaming or sleep there is a state beyond
these three, a=
 wakeful sleep, a fourth state called the turiya. But because
this turiya s=
tate alone is real and the three apparent states are illusory,
the =E2=80=
=98fourth=E2=80=99 state is indeed the transcendental state.

33. The state=
ment that the jnani retains prarabdha while free from sanchita
and agami is=
 only a formal answer to the questions of the ignorant. Of
several wives no=
ne escapes widowhood when the husband dies; even so, when
the doer goes, al=
l three karmas vanish.

34. For unlearned folk there is only one family con=
sisting of wife, children
and dependants. But in the mind of those with muc=
h learning there are many
families of books, theories and opinions as obsta=
cles to yoga. (Subhashita
Ratna Bhandagara, Prakarana VI, Shanta Rasa Nirde=
sha, v. 13)

35. What is the use of letters to those lettered folk who do n=
ot seek to
wipe out the letters of fate by inquiring, =E2=80=98Whence are w=
e born?=E2=80=99 What else
are they but gramaphones, O Lord of Arunachala? =
They learn and repeat words
without realizing
their meaning.

36. The unlet=
tered are easier saved than those who are learned but
unsubdued. The unlett=
ered are free from the clutches of the demon Pride,
they are free from the =
malady of many whirling thoughts and words; they are
free from the mad purs=
uit of wealth; they are free from many, many ills.

37. Though a man looks =
on the world as a wisp of straw and holds all sacred
lore in his hand, it i=
s hard for him to escape from thralldom if he has
yielded to vile Flattery,=
the harlot. (from Sadhaka Avasta, by Sri Sadasiva
Brahmendra)

38. Without =
thinking of oneself as apart from others,without swerving from
one=E2=80=99=
s true state, if one abides always in one=E2=80=99s Self, who is there alie=
n to
one? What matters it
what people say of one? What matters it if one pr=
aises or blames oneself?

39. Keep advaita within the Heart. Do not ever ca=
rry it into action. Even if
you apply it to all the three worlds, O Son, it=
 is not to be applied to the
Guru. (Tattvopadesa, v. 87,by Shankaracharya)
=

40. I shall declare truly the essence of the final doctrine of the
Vedanta=
: when
the ego dies and becomes That, the Self of Pure Awareness, That alon=
e
abides.

(Translated by Prof. K. Swaminathan)
