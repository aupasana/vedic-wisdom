It =
was a summer evening, and we were all sitting outside in the open space by =
the well. Suddenly one of the visitors started weeping bitterly.

'I am a h=
orrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming to you, but there is no =
change in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am I to wait? When I am h=
ere near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave this place, I become a=
 beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be -- hardly a human being. =
Am I to remain a sinner forever?'

'Why do you come to me? What have I to d=
o with you?' demanded Bhagavan. 'What is there between us that you should c=
ome here and weep and cry in front of me?'

The man started moaning and cry=
ing even more, as if his heart were breaking.

'All my hopes of salvation a=
re gone. You were my last refuge and you say you have nothing to do with me=
! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To whom am I to go?'

Bhagavan=
 watched him for some time and said, 'Am I your Guru that I should be respo=
nsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I am your Master?'

'If yo=
u are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, if not my Master? You ar=
e my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take pity me and release me =
from my sins!'

He started sobbing and crying again.

We all sat silent, ov=
ercome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and matter-of-fact.

'If I am =
your Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay me for my services.'

'B=
ut you won't take anything,' cried the visitor. 'What can I give you?'

'Di=
d I ever say that I don't take anything? And did you ever ask me what you c=
an give me?'

'If you would take, then ask me. There is nothing I would not=
 give you.'

'All right. Now I am asking. Give me. What will you give me?'
=

'Take anything. Everything I have is yours.'

'Then give me all the good y=
ou have done in this world.'

'What good could I have done? I have not a si=
ngle virtue to my credit.'

'You have promised to give. Now give. Don't tal=
k of your credit. Just give away all the good you have done in your past.'
=

'Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell me how the giving is done =
and I shall give.'

'Say like this: "All the good I have done in the past I=
 am giving away entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I have no merit from it nor=
 have I any concern with it." Say it with your whole heart.'

'All right, S=
wami. "I am giving away to you all the good I have done so far, if I have d=
one any, and all its good effects. I am giving it to you gladly, for you ar=
e my Master and you are asking me to give it all away to you.'

'But this i=
s not enough,' said Bhagavan sternly.

'I gave you all I have and all you a=
sked me to give. I have nothing more to give.'

'No, you have. Give me all =
your sins.'

The man looked wildly at Bhagavan, terror stricken.=C2=A0

'Yo=
u do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If you knew, you would not a=
sk me. If you take over my sins, your body will rot and burn. You do not kn=
ow me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask me for my sins.'=C2=A0

H=
e wept bitterly.

'I shall look after myself. Don't you worry about me,' sa=
id Bhagavan. 'All I want from you is your sins.'

For a long time the barga=
in would not go through. The man refused to part with his sins. But Bhagava=
n was adamant.

'Either give me your sins along with your merits, or keep b=
oth and don't think of me as your Master."

In the end the visitor's scrupl=
es broke down and he declared, 'Whatever sins I have done, they are no long=
er mine. All of them and their results, too, belong to Ramana.'

Bhagavan s=
eemed to be satisfied. 'From now on there is no good nor bad in you. You ar=
e just pure. Go and do nothing, either good or bad. Remain yourself. Remain=
 what you are.'

A great peace fell over the man and over us all. No one kn=
ows what happened to the fortunate visitor, for he was never seen in the as=
hram again. He might have had no further need to come.
