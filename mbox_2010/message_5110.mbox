Dear Shri Utpalji, 

Thank you. I meant "kleem". I did not realize that I t=
yped "Srim" until you pointed out. Thanks for that. 

Apparently Shri Naras=
imha is very busy, which is understandable. Could you or Rajarshi respond t=
o my questions on this thread? In my interpretation Ma is telling us that i=
t is okay to do the Chandi Homam by anyone, as long as they do it with a si=
ncere mind, as per the 11th sloka of 12th chapter. I just want to make sure=
 that I am not mis-interpreting the same. 

Nagaraj

Chandi is also Mother and though she may be Ugraatiugra, she is also Sumyaa=
