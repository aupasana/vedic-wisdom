Namaskaram Narsimhagaru and learned members,

When I do vishnu Homam I say =
Lord Vishnu I surrender to you, later I read Durga Saptashati I say mother =
I surrender to you, then I visit Shiva temple I say I surrender to you. Wha=
t I am trying to ask is..should one surrender to any God we come across or =
loyalty towards one God is important? If loyalty is important then can I re=
ad Durga Saptashati and say although I am praying to you mother I surrender=
 to Lord vishnu only? 

During navratri is it ok to read devi mahatmyam whe=
n a women has her periods? If no then what can she do to acheive the maximu=
m benefit?

My homam fire is small so just wondering if it is ok to put cho=
pped basil leaves,chopped betel leaves or should one put whole leaf only. I=
 always see you use the words whole turmeric, whole lemon etc hence this do=
ubt. 

Kindly guide,
Thanks and regards,

Priya
