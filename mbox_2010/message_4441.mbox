NAMASKAR P.V.R Ji,

Excellent teaching indeed, however in the same context,=
 humbly I would like to ask you, what is your opinion about wearing Gemston=
e, Rudraksha, Metal, Yantra etc. Is there any supportive authentic verse fo=
und in classics? (Curious mind always ask)

Pranam Again

homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish m=

 horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara a=
