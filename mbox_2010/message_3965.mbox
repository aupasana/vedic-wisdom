 Well, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But =
you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that r=
eference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you =
can engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to t=
hose actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very impo=
rtant and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performe=
d an action or skipped an action only because god had already decided so. B=
ut you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don't y=
ou? In the previous example where one lost a job, won't one look for a new =
job?

ichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahe=

ant to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your refer=
ence frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical a=

esired outcome. However, given that you don't know what god willed and what=
 will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL h=
