Dear Rajarshi,
=A0
Thanks for the beautiful account. You are lucky to have =
spent time with Manish in the blessed city of Kashi and that too at the ble=
ssed Manikarnika ghat.
=A0
There is something about Manish and dogs. Even w=
hen we two were doing a Chandi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008=
, a similar thing happened. A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and=
 sat around the homam to watch. They were calm for the entire homam (a coup=
le of hours) and watched it. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was o=
ffered at the end, they all got up together and ran in one direction barkin=
g and jumping up. It was as though they were trying to chase someone.
=A0
S=
ome say that several animals, especially dogs, have subtle extra-sensory pe=
rception that is superior to that of humans.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=

=A0
That homam is still fresh in my mind. When we w=
ere climbing that hill in the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me=
, "we have a strong connection with this place. Something will happen here =
today." When we discovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorak=
shanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa=
 kundam there and asked, "we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in yo=
ur homa kundam tonight?" The person said, "we are worshippers of Narayana a=
nd do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any taamasik practices =
resorted to." We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there would=
 be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.
=A0
We left and reached the h=
ill with materials around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings were pitch=
 dark and silent. There was no electricity in that area. We climbed the hil=
l using Manish's cell phone backlight to show the way. There were several d=
ogs there and they started barking when they saw us climbing. But when we s=
tarted the homam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An o=
ld sadhu also came out of the hut and sat near the fire.
=A0
The moment The=
 Mother was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent till then exce=
pt for our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a=
 valley in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from thei=
r trees in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole area resound=
ed with the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this=
 huge commotion felt quite eerie.

=A0
While on the topic of that trip, I can mention something pe=
rsonal that demonstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakris=
hna in the story sent by Prasanth today.
=A0
During that trip in the Indian=
 summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies =
in front of several people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Mah=
araj was talking about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topi=
c and mention great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of peo=
ple, I was first unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to fee=
l special.
=A0
On the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manis=
h relaxed his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire wh=
en doing homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam=
 and Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last =
minute and said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was=
 ready and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an "ack=
nowledgment" of my "spiritual progress". My already provoked pride peaked w=
ith this.
=A0
My mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra=
 and deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night's homam. Ma=
nish said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he sco=
lded me with a very stern and serious tone, "what were you thinking? We cal=
led the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great oppor=
tunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of th=
e universe. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presen=
ce? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you=
 would've been killed today." He was in that serious mood for an hour or so=
 and then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, "are you st=
ill thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything =
happens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to come for a=
nything. Don't worry and keep doing sadhana."
=A0
I realized that day that =
Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irres=
pective of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a split second=
. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is not really=
 one's. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks=
 "I, so-and-so individual, exist" and attributes those "experiences" and "p=
rogress" to that "I", one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, ha=
ppiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the =
supreme power running the universe, while performing the duties that one is=
 inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY=
 attention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticism, is th=
e only solution.
=A0
This experience taught me a very valuable lesson. What=
 Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of testi=
ng me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does not =
matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temporar=
y* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one's dharma. Attributes of that p=
ersona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The momen=
t one looks at that persona as "I" and forms an attachment to the attribute=
s of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that person=
a to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a perso=
na brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespective of=
 how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything that is=
 temporary perishes.
=A0
Also, note that pride can strike anytime anywhere,=
 as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Keep doing sadhana, while=
 constantly contemplating and guarding against such an attachment. Pride is=
 suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppressed again, comes back =
again and so on. This cycle goes on until one's attachment to the persona i=
s killed completely. This is a long process. Don't worry too much and just =
keep doing sadhana.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0=

The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of something. When Manish and I =
were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that was walking on =
3 legs started following us. It came with us a long way. At one point, it r=
an ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather stair-side) stall =
that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought some biscuit packets and =
fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us then. In a couple of min=
utes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He was weeping. Manish s=
topped and asked him what happened. He said he lost all his money at a hote=
l in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He decided to just climb t=
he hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave it to him to =
help him out. He was climbing up, while we were climbing down. It was getti=
ng nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the biscuit packet=
s that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave back a few
 biscu=
it pieces to me and said, "you guys keep this."
=A0
Later Manish told me th=
e same thing he told you, "you never know when and in what form god comes t=
o test you. Kindness and compassion towards needy people is an important dh=
arma."
=A0
One does not need to do something beyond one's means. But, one c=
an have compassion, feel the other person's pain and help within one's mean=
s.
=A0
I considered the biscuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattat=
reya's prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, please note that Vat=
uka Bhairava is depicted as a child.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
BTW, the Girnar trip happenened unplanned. We were suppo=
sed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for the Krishna movie. But w=
e basically finished what we had intended. So I was thinking in my mind wit=
h dissatisfaction, "why does Manish want to prolong things here and shoot m=
ore? We are done here. Why can't we just leave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Gi=
rnar for a day?" I kept my thoughts to myself. It was late in the evening a=
nd we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish=
 told the driver to stop and turn back to the hotel. He announced that we w=
ere leaving for Girnar. He said, "bulawa aa gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge" (inv=
itation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rushed to the hotel, packed =
and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around midnight and spent the nex=
t day there. For those who do not know, Girnar is considered the abode of L=
ord Dattatreya.
=A0
Sometimes, Manish has the uncanny ability to respond to=
 one's thoughts. However, he says it is not his ability, but it is Nature l=
istening to one's wish and fulfilling through another.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Imagine chess pieces being moved by an =
expert player thinking "I am an powerful king. I am great", "I am a beautif=
ul queen. I am great", "I am a strong knight. I am great", "I killed a grea=
t bishop despite being a pawn. I am great", "I am just a pawn, but I sacrif=
iced myself to trap the queen. I am great" etc.
=A0
It may sound weird, but=
 this is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people a=
re pieces in another kind of chess game. Not realizing that a player is mov=
ing us, we engage in egoistic thoughts, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake =
pride, fake shame etc. One is free from all those fake feelings if one real=
izes this. Of course, that does not mean inaction. The inspiration that com=
es in us to engage in various actions in the world is like the hand of the =
player moving the piece. We should respect that engage in actions, but not =
see them as our actions.

Narasimha

      =
Dear Narasimha and others,
=A0
Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Vara=
nasi with Manish. I see that your signature changed after the trip.
=A0
We =
had a remarkable time at Varanasi. 
=A0
The moment our flight landed at the=
 Kashi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Mani=
sh said there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpab=
le throughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming =
around the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.
=A0
By 9 P=
M Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan,=
 on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many grea=
t sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to pe=
rform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=
=A0spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The =
effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for =
those who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire=
 of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike t=
he fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and man=
y in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not=
 to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a fune=
ral pyre is "unholy", he or she would be better off not trying anything in =
such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are
 Mahakala and Mahakal=
i. 
=A0
=A0We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=
=A0full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samag=
ri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath =
temple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There =
was a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop aski=
ng for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the chil=
d. The child was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we =
were buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child=
, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was=
 no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very cl=
early. Manish smiled and said, " The deity of this place wanted to see whet=
her we=A0had become so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry c=
hild=A0. That is how God comes to test people.=A0Kya
 pata Narayan kab, kah=
a aur=A0kis roop me mil jaye."
=A0
At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed=
 in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the =
samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people=
 who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at l=
east 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges,=
 pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease ou=
t a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to=
 react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=
 curiosity=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=
 and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=
ergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=
. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=
rned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=
n the
 samshan went running=A0to that direction.
=A0
After waiting like thi=
s for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major=
 portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some=
 time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offer=
ing was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sy=
nc with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to =
the ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were up=
to. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre =
to light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, takin=
g pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to h=
im not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb =
that pyre again. 
=A0
Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =
of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=
 being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=
rom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=
 tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =
us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=
y nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=
 and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=
way to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=
ccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=
ck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=
. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it's head pointed in an an=
gular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is
 not an an=
imal but a human being watching. Just staring and observing every action. M=
anish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.
=A0
The hom=
a finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as in be=
tween, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notches abo=
ve the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.
=A0
Simply being in a samshan=
 and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=
 In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=
th the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=
ind of a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart" which has a very=
 sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=
 of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=
l and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =
as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.
=A0
Manish said if yo=
ur intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through =
sadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pe=
tty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to =
harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb y=
ou because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. I=
t is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. There =
are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they bo=
ther you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitude to have. And=
 finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is being done, =
is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.
=A0
Thus ended my firs=
t experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Sapt=
ami. The next two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik.

nd deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night's homam. Mani=
sh said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he scold=
ed me with a very stern and serious tone, "what were you thinking? We calle=
d the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great opportu=
nity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of the =
universe. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence=
? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you w=
ould've been killed today." He was in that serious mood for an hour or so a=
nd then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, "are you stil=
l thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything ha=
ppens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome.
 Time has to come for an=
ything. Don't worry and keep doing sadhana."<br> <br>I realized that d=
ay that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience a=
nd irrespective of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a spli=
t second. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is no=
t really one's. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment on=
e thinks "I, so-and-so individual, exist" and attributes those "experiences=
" and "progress" to that "I", one is instantly bound - there is scope for p=
ride, happiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender=
 to the supreme power running the universe, while performing the duties tha=
t one is inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without pa=
ying ANY attention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticis=
m, is the only solution.<br> <br>This experience taught me a very valu=
able lesson. What Manish said about me to
 others in my presence may have b=
een a way of testing me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either =
case, it does not matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on ea=
rth is a *temporary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one's dharma. At=
tributes of that persona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant=
 to one. The moment one looks at that persona as "I" and forms an attachmen=
t to the attributes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should ju=
st use that persona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An att=
achment to a persona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds on=
e, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, =
everything that is temporary perishes.<br> <br>Also, note that pride c=
an strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona=
. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding against s=
uch an attachment. Pride is
 suppressed for a while, comes back again, is s=
uppressed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on until one's=
 attachment to the persona is killed completely. This is a long process. Do=
n't worry too much and just keep doing sadhana.<br> <br>*  &=

<br> <br>The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of something. When =
Manish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that wa=
s walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a long way. At on=
e point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather stair=
-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought some biscuit=
 packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us then. In a =
couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He was weep=
ing. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he lost all his mo=
ney at a hotel in
 Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He decided t=
o just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave=
 it to him to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were climbing down=
. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the =
biscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave bac=
k a few biscuit pieces to me and said, "you guys keep this."<br> <br>L=
ater Manish told me the same thing he told you, "you never know when and in=
 what form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards needy peo=
ple is an important dharma."<br> <br>One does not need to do something=
 beyond one's means. But, one can have compassion, feel the other person's =
pain and help within one's means.<br> <br>I considered the biscuit pie=
ces given back by that old man as Dattatreya's prasad and ate it. Regarding=

bsp;     *<br> <br>BTW, the Girnar trip happenened=
 unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for=
 the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended. So I wa=
s thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, "why does Manish want to prolon=
g things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can't we just leave Dwa=
raka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?" I kept my thoughts to myself. It =
was late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka=
. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the hote=
l. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, "bulawa aa gaya. =
hum Girnar jaayenge" (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rus=
hed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around m=
idnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not
 know, Girnar is=
 considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.<br> <br>Sometimes, Manish ha=

not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one's wish and fulfilling th=

 One is free from all t=

<div>We had a remarkable time at Varanasi. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>T=
he moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite ou=
tside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which =
is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at the h=
otel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the evening Ga=
nga Arati and shooting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By 9 PM Manish decided=
 on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral py=
re. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in Hi=
nduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sa=
dhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha - spent most o=
f his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana. The effect that =
a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who ha=
ve such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funera=
l pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a=
 standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in number,=
 who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a d=
istinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is =
"unholy", he or she would be better off not trying anything in such a fire.=
 The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are
 Mahakala and Mahakali. </div>
<d=
iv> </div>
<div> We went to buy some samagri - til (black and whi=
te), couple of full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti),  =
;kismis, havan samagri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane =
near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept ask=
ing for food. There was a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he poin=
ted to the shop asking for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and=
 gave it to the child. The child was eating when we turned back towards the=
 shop from where we were buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to=
 check for the child, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in th=
e lane and there was no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still rememb=
er the child very clearly. Manish smiled and said, " The deity of this plac=
e wanted to see whether we had become so big sadhakas that we are=
 unable to feed a hungry child . That is how God comes to test people.=
 Kya
 pata Narayan kab, kaha aur kis roop me mil jaye."</div>
<di=
v> </div>
<div>At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a combinati=
on of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the samshan at arou=
nd eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with domes (people who work th=
ere to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at least 8 to 10=
 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pitch black=
 at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a bit, not=
 sure when that will happen, not sure how people are going to react. A=
s we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of curiosit=
y and possible apprehension. Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=
 and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=
ergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=
. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=
rned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=
n the
 samshan went running to that direction.</div>
<div> </div>=

<div>After waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the =
relatives had left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there was =
enough left to last for some time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish=
 started the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him doing the Cha=
ndi path, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part of my mind was also=
 trying to adjust itself to the ambience. There were quite a few people aro=
und watching what we were upto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come =
and take wood from the pyre to light other pyres. He did it in the most cau=
tious manner possible, taking pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After som=
e time Manish indicated to him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded h=
is head and did not disturb that pyre again. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>=
Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come a=
nd were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was being done. As I=
 read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, from all sides. A=
s if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it tight. The conc=
entration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching us or anything e=
lse around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Very nice meditatio=
n happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron and there =
was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind away to some d=
istant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally accustomed =
to. While the homa was on, suddenly one black dog from the pack w=
hich was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish. Fo=
r I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it's head pointed in an angula=
r fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is
 not an animal=
 but a human being watching. Just staring and observing every action. Manis=
h said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.</div>
<div>&nbs=
p;</div>
<div>The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the=
 end as well as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pul=
led a few notches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.</div>
<d=
iv> </div>
<div>Simply being in a samshan and observing the human body=
 burning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the =
femur bones of a female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible an=
d spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a w=
oman with "legs spread apart" which has a very sexual connotation. In Manik=
arnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the body i=
s merely a covering for something far more real and powerful that resides i=
nside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to perish. O=
nly Rama naam satya hai.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Manish said if your i=
ntentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through sadh=
anas - i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pet=
ty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to h=
arm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb yo=
u because no one wants to mess with someone who is worshipping Chandi.=
 It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. Ther=
e are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they =
bother you.  Surrendering to the deity is very good attitude to h=
ave. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is bein=
g done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.</div>
<div>&nb=
sp;</div>
<div>Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning=
 pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homa=
s at Manikarnik. </div>
