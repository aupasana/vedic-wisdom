Veneet Ji

1.The verse is true.In Andhra pradesh we had the good fortune of=
 listening to an Vedic scholar Malladi Chandrashekara Sastry aged about 90 =
yrs who is also associated with the Shringeri math. Sastry ji has written m=
any wonderful books clarifying dharma from the Mahabharata and other common=
 dharmic dilemas faced by the common man.

2.Often he has referred to the b=
eginning of Kali yuga as the time when the great war took place or to be mo=
re specific when Parikshit dies.

3.Most of the Sages meet in Naimisharanya=
 to discuss strategies to guide the people about the imminent dawn of Kali =
yuga.

The Wikipedia entry is biased by Western historians who have bandied=
 about this date of Mahabharata as being 3000 B.C to fit their bibilical vi=
ew of the world and to distort the timeline of the SIndhu Saraswati Civiliz=
ation ( I will not for the life of me call it the Indus valley civilization=
 because it distorts the reality ) 

In the past twenty years many noted In=
dian historians have effectively questioned this date. Notable among them b=
eing S venkataraman , Prof Subash Kak and other independent authors like Da=
vid Frawley .Frawley also wrote the famous book " In search of the cradle o=
f Civilization ". The book is available on Amazon.

4.Recently one of the I=
ISC researchers has used a star map to tally the positions of the stars per=
taining to the time of eclipses mentioned in the Mahabharata to come up wit=
h a date similar to 5000 B.C which was also mentioned in Saraswati Films do=
cumentary .

I am personally not sold on the date being close to 3000 B.C .=
It would be more close to 5000/6000 B.C

Vemparla Ram Kishore
