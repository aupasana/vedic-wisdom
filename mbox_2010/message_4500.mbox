Namaste Sindhu ji,

 a chance. It is a description in great detail how a yajna is conducted.

=C2=A0
I have not read his book, but I have seen a DVD=C2=A0based on the "A=
gni" which he had released and how he sponsered a Yaga in South India=C2=A0=
and gathered his information from there. Frankly, I found it unimpressive. =
Your first mail had mentioned about getting=C2=A0a "insight" into the impor=
tance of these steps. There is hardly any "insight", merely a documentation=
 of what the priests do and have been doing for ages regarding a certain ya=
gya. And it was here, in this specific ritual, while recording it, that he =
asked a couple of the priests about meanings of certain mantra that they ch=
ant, and those priests mere shook their heads saying they have no clue what=
 it means=C2=A0but since their father and grandfather and so on had been do=
ing it, therefore they too do the same. Therefore, Sri Staal came to the un=
enviable conclusion that mantras and about birds and bees! 

=C2=A0
2."Swam=
i Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During his last days, he once called=
 one of his disciples and mentioned that the interpretation of Vedas done b=
y Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his opinion, not upto the mark. I=
t missed out on the essence of what the Vedas really are."

ound in The Complete Works Of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 8.
MAN MAKER OF HIS=

There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern=
 India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men =
living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this =
way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwa=
rds with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until=
 they found certain agreements; these were generalized, recorded, and made =
into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers lived=
 and had this book in their possession. It seems possible that this is how =
astrology came into existence. Excessive attention to the minutiae of astro=
logy is one of the superstitious which has hurt the HINDUS very much. 
=C2=

Do you also agree to this ?
=C2=A0
Swami Vivekanada's opini=
on on astrology, or for that matter the infamous Aryan Invasion THeory whic=

s nothing away from the fact that Vivekananda was a self-realized man with =
the necessary authority to pass a comment on the Vedas or their interpretat=
ion. 
=C2=A0
It is like this, a surgeon is well qualified to pass an educat=
ed comment on a surgical procedure of medical science, but his opinions on =
say the efficacy of the Austrain School of Economics "maybe" of zero value.=

I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the Hindus =
the science of astronomy and carried it back with them to Europe. Because i=
n India you will find old altars, made according to a certain geometrical p=
lan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in when certain =
positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the =
Hindus gave them astronomy.

Namaste,
=C2=A0

Welcome to this forum. I would like to make a few =
brief points regarding some of your ideas as mentioned below.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0=
I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get a insi=
ght into the importance of these steps.
=C2=A0
Pardon me for being rude, bu=
t Frits Staals understanding of the vedic=C2=A0ritual is naive at best and =
criminally incorrect at worst. He had written a huge, lengthy article on wh=
y and how mantras are nothing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped =
by ancient people, and they are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense!=
 A person with such a shallow understanding of the spiritual essence of San=
atana Dharma, cannot be expected to=C2=A0recognize=C2=A0the spiritual essen=
ce=C2=A0and depth of "Agni". Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book o=
f rituals/history/ or even dharma, but probably a testimony of the various =
spiritual realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/all=
egorical verses. A
=C2=A0
Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During=
 his last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the =
interpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his=
 opinion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas=
 really are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses an=
d in future, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a more holistic and =
deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence t=
hat Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed=
 him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up=
 with a=C2=A0new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.
=
=C2=A0
21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own p=
urity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to pres=
erve knowledge uncorrupted.
=C2=A0
There are different homam proceudures fo=
llowed by different paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none =
of them is incorrect. The final=C2=A0judge of the success of any sustained =
sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. =
If the sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=A0etc etc,the s=
adhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0It is not the num=
ber of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the internal tran=
sformations that you experience which are crucial. There are people who fol=
low a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals and yet nev=
er experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations=
. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. =
Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In=
 this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable s=
adhanas, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to
 transform an individual. =
Many have experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0future. And all =
this has been possible only because the Divine Mother wants it so.

Dear =
Members,

At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into =
this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from J=
yotishwritings on "efficacy of remedies". I humbly agree that jHora is not =
the right forum for discussing these topics.

I have gone through the homam=
 manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performe=
d and have the following observations to make.

1. As per rules laid out by=
 srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various ritual=
s, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is=
 the prakruti of all yajnas).

2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be th=
ere in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but i=
t has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which ar=
e not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by achary=
as.

3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as =
apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.

=
4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worth=
y of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. T=
hen only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "fire ritual=
" as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal t=
o get a insight into the importance of these steps.

5. The procedure in th=
e manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviation=
s and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. 

6. =
In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular =
manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom =
of the prceeding ones.

7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra paris=
hkekam) with the mantra "deva savita prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be from S=
E corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas=
. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaad=
i eeshaantam).

8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in t=
he vessel above darbha is missing.

9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam f=
or purification of the utensils is missing.

10. Patra samskaram or purifyi=
ng the utensils is missing.

11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on pra=
neeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) i=
s missing.

12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.

13=
. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the hom=
a dravya used for havan is missing.

14. Darvee samskaram or purification o=
f ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sru=
ksruvou) .

15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.

16. Idhm=
a pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing=
.

17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the g=
hee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to=
 be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.

and many mo=
re ............

18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is=
 not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carri=
er for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronou=
nced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If =
at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)

18. In t=
he tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts=
 either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into=
 the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.=


19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastr=
a (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don't invol=
ve veda mantras so that you don't have to struggle to get the right pronunc=
iation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who pe=
rform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for a=
ny devata.

20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out=
 that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru a=
nd practice with devotion, precision and perfection.

21. I suggest that we=
 preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not alway=
s yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.

<DIV>Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals understand=
ing of the vedic ritual is naive at best and criminally incorrect at w=
orst. He had written a huge, lengthy article on why and how mantras are not=
hing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancient people, and th=
ey are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A person with such a sha=
llow understanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be e=
xpected to recognize the spiritual essence and depth of "Agn=
i". Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of rituals/history/ or eve=
n dharma, but probably a testimony of the various spiritual realities on th=
e path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical verses. A</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During hi=
s last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the int=
erpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his op=
inion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas re=
ally are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses and i=
n future, and that someone has to come up with a more holistic and dee=
per interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence that=
 Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed hi=
m on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up wi=
th a new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.</DI=

<DIV>There are different homam proceudures followed by differ=
ent paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none of them is incor=
rect. The final judge of the success of any sustained sadhana like a h=
oma is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. If the sadhana i=
s making the sadhaka more detached, etc etc,the sadhana is workin=
g. If not, more hard work is needed. It is not the number of rules tha=
t you add or substract, but it is finally the internal transformations that=
 you experience which are crucial. There are people who follow a million ru=
les of procedure for performing various rituals and yet never experienced e=
ven a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations. What use is su=
ch rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whatever helps a=
 sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this light, the=
 homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas, which w=
hen
 done regularly helps to transform an individual. Many have experi=
enced the same, many more will in the future. And all this has been po=
ssible only because the Divine Mother wants it so. </DIV>

<DIV>Dear Members,<BR><BR>At the outset,=
 thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted=
 a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on "effic=
acy of remedies". I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for disc=
ussing these topics.<BR><BR>I have gone through the homam manual provided b=
y Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the fol=
lowing observations to make.<BR><BR>1. As per rules laid out by srouta and =
gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna=
 (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakrut=
i of all yajnas).<BR><BR>2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in=
 the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has =
to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not =
essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.<BR=
><BR>3. There are variations
 in procedures in the different sutras such as=
 apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.<=
BR><BR>4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. becom=
e worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right proce=
dure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "fire=
 ritual" as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits =
Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.<BR><BR>5. The pr=
ocedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are la=
rge deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proc=
edures. <BR><BR>6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda the=
re is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucke=
d under the bottom of the prceeding ones.<BR><BR>7. The direction for sprin=
kling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra "deva savita prasuva" ie:-=
 #4 is shown to be
 from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because ap=
asavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and e=
nding at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).<BR><BR>8 Patraasadanam or keeping =
the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.<BR><BR>9=
.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is mi=
ssing.<BR><BR>10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.<BR>=
<BR>11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam an=
d aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.<BR><BR>12. Bra=
hma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.<BR><BR>13. Ajya samska=
ram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used=
 for havan is missing.<BR><BR>14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladle=
s used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou=
) .<BR><BR>15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.<BR><BR>16.=
 Idhma
 pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=
issing.<BR><BR>17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the la=
dle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantit=
y of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.<=
BR><BR>and many more ............<BR><BR>18. Strictly speaking, in the vedi=
c procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the ku=
nda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on =
the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to t=
he particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or =
not necessary)<BR><BR>18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked in=
to the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the=
 agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the speci=
fied agni devata aikya ahutis.<BR><BR>19. Very good alternate homa
 procedu=
res are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example)=
 ideal for sadhakas. They don't involve veda mantras so that you don't have=
 to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures ar=
e designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be =
easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.<BR><BR>20. Homam should not=
 be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a vide=
o. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, preci=
sion and perfection.<BR><BR>21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of k=
nowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let =
almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.<BR><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><=
