Namaste,
I downloaded the Pitri Tarpan Manual 2 days ago and am planning to=
 start it from tomorrow for whole of this Pitri Paksha beginning with super=
-short procedure.
I could not arrange for the seasame seeds altogether. The=
 manual says, go with Akshats in that case. But, while I am offering the wa=
ter with akshats (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in second last section, =
the mantras use the word "Tilodakam". If I am right, this refers to the sea=
same seeds being offered. Is it fine to continue with these mantras only ti=
ll I find the seasame seeds, or shall I modify it mysylf with say "Akshatod=
akam".
For today, I will go with as suggested, but it would be nice if you =
can guide the right way in absence of such things.
Also, is it OK to to put=
 a paper sheet and a vessel in front of one, and to leave the akshats and w=
ater after the offerings into them, than on tiled floors? And then later pu=
t these water and akshats in some garden (or soil), from where they are abs=
orbed into the five elements easily. From fllor it will either be wiped off=
 or will get dried up there to be mopped off later. I think that is not goo=
d thing to do.
Again for today I will do the same way. Please correct me fo=
r the rest of Pitri Paksha.
Thanks and Regards,Sriram
