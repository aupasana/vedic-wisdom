Please find below some l=

 13. In addition, Narasimha has written a elaborate note on this in the sam=

best regards

|Om Gurave =
Namah|
|Om Saraswataye Namah|
 
A very good account and explanation of Sapt=
ashati has been presented by Sri Narasimha. The deeper meaning is something=
 very thought provoking. While I agree to all that is given, I wish to add =
a few things which were taught and told to me by my late father Pandita Sha=
stri Gita Ram, who was an ardent believer in the shakti of Chandi and was a=
 learned man in vedas, shastras and puranas (he studied at Lahore). 
 
1. H=
e always addressed the saptashati as Bhagavati which as per the Vaikritika =
Rahasyam (1st shloka) is the satvika rupa of the Goddess. The other rupas a=
re triguni (chandi rupa) and tamasi (Durga rupa). 
 
2. For general well be=
ing, it is always better to concentrate on satvika rupa. However other rupa=
s have their own significance.
 
3. Chandi patha is chanting of triguni rup=
a and must be done with due procedure as given below, particularly for shan=
ti karma:
          (a) Shapodhara - Beeja mantra 7 times
          (b) Utk=
eelna - 21 times
          (c) Kavach patha
          (d) Argala stotram
  =
        (e) Keelkam
          (f) Tantrokte Ratri Suklam
          (g) Nava=
rna (Dhyana, nyasa, japa (108))
          (h) Patha (1st to 13th chapter)
 =
         (i) Navarna (Dhyana, nyasa, japa (108))
          (j) Devi suklam
=
          (k) Rahasya trayam - Pradhamtrau Rahasyam, Vaikritika Rahasyam, M=
urty Rahasyam
          (l) Shapdhara - 7 times
          (m) Utkeelna - 21=
 times
 
4. The above procedure is one chandipatha.
 
5. Done 9 times, it i=
s Nav chandi; done 100 times, it is shat chandi; done 1000 times it is saha=
srara chandi.
 
6. On completion of the patha (9, 100 or 1000 times as the =
case may be), the following be performed
       (a) Homam 1/10th of patha (=
1, 10, 100 patha with every shatoka)
       (b) Tarpana 1/10th of homam
   =
    (c) Marjanam 1/10th of tarpana
      (d) Brahmana bhoga 1/10th of marja=
na
 
7. A a regular routine (without elaborate procedure), saptashati may b=
e chanted as under:
    
   (a) if sufficient time (1.5 - 2 hours) - full p=
atha (1 to 13 chapters)
   (b) if less time ( < 1 hour) - 1st adhyaya & 3rd=
 adhyaya
   (c) if very less time (1/2 hour) - Madhyama adhyaya (2nd chapte=
r)
 
8. Every shloka of saptashati is to be treated as mantra
 
9. Chandipa=
tha is the ultimate remedy in shanti karma

Dear Members,

I would appreciate any guidance on the recitat=

In addition to reciting on Ashtami, Navami and Chat=

Thank you very much.
