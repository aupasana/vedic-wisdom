Fundamentals of the battle for Sri Ram templeBy Dr Subramanian SwamyThan=

ge&pid=3D369&page=3D12In fact, Baqi was a Shia Muslim, and hence he intende=
d it to be a place for Shias to read namaz. Today, interestingly, the Shia =
clerics have made it clear to Hindu organisations that they would agree to =
have the site restored as Ramjanmabhoomi. It is the Sunni Wakf Board, which=
 entered the legal dispute as late as 1961, that has been litigating in the=
 court claiming the title to the land on which the structure once stood.It =
is now well established by GPRS-directed excavations done under the Allahab=
ad High Court monitoring and verification in 2002-03, that a large temple d=
id exist below where that Babri Masjid structure once stood. Inscriptions f=
ound during excavations describe it as a temple of Vishnu Hari who had kill=
ed the demon king Dasanan (Ravana).TRUE and devout Hindus believe that Bhag=
wan Sri Ram was born in Ayodhya, the then capital of a flourishing kingdom =
of the Suryavamsa dynasty. Ram is venerated as Maryada Purushottam and wors=
hipped by Hindus of the north. As an avatar of Vishnu, while it was first p=
ropagated by the Tamil saints known as Nayanmars and Alwars who composed ma=
ny hymns and songs dedicated to his divinity, the North which later came to=
 accept Ram as one, especially thanks to the saint Tulsidas, the fervor for=
 Ram worship is much more. In that sense, Sri Ram was the first truly natio=
nal king of India, supra region, supra varna or jati. That is why poet Iqba=
l called him =91Imam-e-Hind=92.The exact spot of the palace where Ram was b=
orn has been and remains firmly identified in the Hindu mind and is held as=
 sacred. This is the very area where stood from 1528 till December 6, 1992 =
a structure that came to be known as Babri Masjid, put up in 1528 by Babar=
=92s commander Mir Baqi.In fact, Baqi was a Shia Muslim, and hence he inten=
ded it to be a place for Shias to read namaz. Today, interestingly, the Shi=
a clerics have made it clear to Hindu organisations that they would agree t=
o have the site restored as a Ramjanmabhoomi. It is the Sunni Wakf Board, w=
hich entered the legal dispute as late as 1961, that has been litigating in=
 the court claiming the title to the land on which the structure once stood=
.I call it a "structure" since it cannot be strictly called a mosque by Sun=
ni edicts- because it did not have the mandatory minarets and wazu (water p=
ool). That a Ram temple existed and or that there is a sacred spot known as=
 Ramjanmabhoomi is attested by many sources.In Skanda Purana (Chapter X, Va=
ishnav Khand) the site is vivdly described. Valmiki Ramayana also describes=
 beautifully. Less than two decades before Mir Baqi carried out the horribl=
e demolition of the Ram Temple, Guru Nanak had visited the Ramjanmabhoomi a=
nd had darshan of Ramlala in the Mandir at the spot. There are many comment=
aries on this visit which are a part of the Sikh scriptures. Guru Nanak him=
self records in 1521 the barbarity of Babar=92s invasions (in Guru Granth S=
ahib at p.418). In Akbar=92s time, Abul Fazal wrote the Ain-i-Akbari in whi=
ch he describes Ayodhya fame as the place of "Ram Chandra=92s residence who=
 in Treta age combined spiritual supremacy and Kingship" (Tranlated by Col.=
 H.S. Jarrett and published in Kolkata in 1891).In Chapter X of the Report =
of Archeological Survey of India, NW., and Oudh (1889) it is mentioned (p.6=
7) that Babri Mosque "was built in AD 1528 by Mir Khan on the very spot whe=
re the old temple of Janmasthan of Ram Chandra was standing."Hindus have th=
roughout foreign occupation of India deeply held as sacred that exact spot =
where the Babri Masjid once stood, as is recorded in many official and judi=
cial proceedings. In 1885, for example, Mahant Raghubar Das in a Suit No 61=
/280 of 1885 filed in the Court of Faizabad Sub-Judge against the Secretary=
 of State for India (who was based in London), prayed for permission to bui=
ld a temple on the Chabutra outside the mosque. His suit was dismissed on M=
arch 18, 1886.However, in his Order the Sub-Judge, an Englishman, stated: "=
It is most unfortunate that a Masjid was built on land specially held sacre=
d by the Hindus. But as the event occurred 358 years ago, it is too late no=
w to remedy the grievance." Since the English as policy never sought to dis=
turb the social status quo in India as evidenced, for example, on the =91Sa=
ti=92 question, the Judge took the easy way out and dismissed the Suit.It i=
s now well established by GPRS-directed excavations done under the Allahaba=
d High Court monitoring and verification in 2002-03, that a large temple di=
d exist below where that Babri Masjid structure once stood. Inscriptions fo=
und during excavations describe it as a temple of Vishnu Hari who had kille=
d the demon king Dasanan (Ravana).The Sunni Wakf Board does not accept thes=
e findings as meaning anything. It does not however matter if all this was =
indeed so or not, since under Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) it=
 is prescribed that "whoever destroys, damages or defiles any place of wors=
hip, or any object held sacred by any class of persons, with the intention =
of thereby insulting the religion of any class of persons or with the knowl=
edge that any class of persons is likely to consider such destruction, dama=
ge or defilement as an insult to their religion, shall be punishable with i=
mprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years,=
 or with fine, or with both."That is, an offence under criminal law is comm=
itted if a body of persons hold something as sacred. It does not matter if =
the majority does or does not hold so. Nor can a court decide what is sacre=
d and what is not. Only a body of persons can identify what is sacred. The =
offence under Section 295 IPC is cognizable and non-bailable, as well as no=
n-compoundable.The fundamental question before us is thus this: Can a templ=
e and a masjid be considered at par as far as sacredness is concerned? Rely=
ing on two important court judgements that hold the field today, the answer=
 is no! A masjid is not an essential part of Islam, according to a majority=
 judgement of a Constitution Bench of India=92s Supreme Court.In the famous=
 Ismail Farooqui vs Union of India case (reported in (1994) 6 SCC 376), the=
 Supreme Court had observed: "It has been contended that a mosque enjoys a =
particular position in Muslim law and once a mosque is established and pray=
ers are offered in such a mosque, the same remains for all time to come a p=
roperty of Allah...and any person professing Islamic faith can offer prayer=
 in such a mosque, and even if the structure is demolished, the place remai=
ns the same where namaz can be offered." (para 80).The Constitution Bench r=
ebutted this contention. The Bench stated: "The correct position may be sum=
marised thus. Under Mohammed law applicable in India, title to a mosque can=
 be lost by adverse possession...A mosque is not an essential part of the p=
ractice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) can be offered anywhere=
, even in the open. Accordingly, its acquisition is not prohibited by the p=
rovisions in the Constitution of India." (para 82).Thus what was wrong in t=
he demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 was that it was unaut=
horised by law and hence a criminal offence. Otherwise any Government depri=
ving the Muslims of the Babri Masjid is within law, if the government decid=
es to do so in the interest of public order, public health and morality (Ar=
ticle 25 of the Constitution). This is the position in Islamic law as well =
since in Saudi Arabia the authorities demolish mosque to lay roads. Even th=
e mosque where Islam=92s Prophet Mohammed used to pray was demolished for a=
 road to pass through!But then what of a temple? Is it in the same category=
 as the mosque in our jurisprudence? When I was Union Law and Justice Minis=
ter, this question of the status of a temple-even if in ruins or without wo=
rship-had come up before me in November 1990 in a case of a smuggled out br=
onze Nataraja statue which was up for sale in London.The Government of Indi=
a when Rajiv Gandhi was PM had decided to file a case in the London trial c=
ourt in 1986 for recovery. The Nataraja statue had by then traced to a temp=
le in ruins in Pathur, Thanjavur district. A farmer named Ramamoorthi had u=
nearthed it in 1976 while digging mud with a spade near his hut.When the ne=
ws spread, touts of an antique dealer by name Ahmed Hussein reached him and=
 paid a small sum and smuggled it out to London, where in 1982 they sold it=
 to Bumper Development Corporation Private Limited. In turn the said Corpor=
ation sent it to the British Museum for appraisal and possible purchase. By=
 then the Government of India was onto it and asked the UK government to ta=
ke action.The Nataraja idol was seized by London Metropolitan Police, and t=
hus the Corporation sued the Police in court for recovery but lost the case=
. An appeal was filed in the Queens Bench (our High Court level) which was =
dismissed on April 17, 1989. So, the Bumper Corporation went to the House o=
f Lords (our Supreme Court level). On February 13, 1991 when I was Law Mini=
ster, the judgement came which is truly landmark dismissing Bumper=92s fina=
l appeal (see (1991) 4 All ER 638).The UK Apex Court upheld the Indian gove=
rnment=92s position that because of the prana prathista puja a temple is ow=
ned by the deity, in this case Lord Shiva, and any Hindu can litigate on be=
half of the deity as a defacto trustee. The Bench consisting of Justices Pu=
rchas, Nourse and Leggatt concluded: "We therefore hold that the temple is =
acceptable as party to these proceedings and that it is as such entitled to=
 sue for the recovery of the Nataraja." (page 648 para g).Thus even if a te=
mple is in ruins as the ASI had found, or destroyed as Ram Temple was, any =
Hindu can sue on behalf of Lord Ram in court for recovery! No such ruling e=
xists for a mosque for the simple reason that a mosque is just a facilitati=
on centre for reading namaz, and has no essentiality for Islam religion. It=
 can be demolished and/or shifted as any building can and are being so in A=
rab countries and Pakistan. That is, the Ram Temple on Ramjanmabhoomi has a=
 superior claim to the site than any mosque. This the fundamental truth in =
the Ayodhya dispute. This truth will apply to Kashi Vishvanath and Brindava=
n temple sites as well.The only compromise we Hindus can accept is that Mus=
lims agree to shift the building of a new masjid to some other site beyond =
the Saryu River. It is important to note that as of now there are eight mos=
ques in Ayodhya which the ASI has taken over since these had no one coming =
to read namaz. Hence what use will another mosque be? If however the Muslim=
 hardline organisations want to re-build the Babri Masjid in the Ramjanmabh=
oomi area, then the Hindus will launch a struggle.Hence what should be the =
patriots=92 response to the judgement of Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Co=
urt allotting one-third of the Ramjanmabhoomi to the Sunni Wakf Board to bu=
ild a mosque in the area near the Ramlala temple? The response should be a =
resounding No! A temple cannot be equated to a mosque. Nor can we Hindus by=
 the back door allow aggression and atrocity of demolishing temples be rewa=
rded in any manner. Therefore, as with the Shah Bano case precedent, Govern=
ment should be forced by agitation if necessary to bring an amendment to th=
e Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act of 1993 to bar constructing a=
ny structure other than those connected with a temple for Sri Ram.That will=
 be in keeping with the assurance contained in the affidavit filed in 1993 =
by the Solicitor General of India in the Supreme Court: "..namely, that (if=
) a Hindu temple/structure did exist prior to the construction of the demol=
ished (mosque) structure, government action will be in support of the wishe=
s of the Hindu community."That will be the fit atonement of the entire peop=
le of our nation for tacitly tolerating for so long the demolition of Ram T=
emple on the orders of Babar of Afghanistan. Babri, after whom the mosque i=
s named incidentally was a 9 year boy in Kabul who was a "special" intimate=
 of Babar.If such an amendment is not brought forth, Hindus should wage a f=
ierce democratic struggle for the next 3=BD years to force the government t=
o do so or weld a solid Hindu vote so that in the next General Election a H=
indu Front supported by the Hindu Dharmacharyas, VHP and RSS can obtain an =
absolute majority in the Lok Sabha.(The author is a former Union Law Minist=
er and also the Convenor of the Legal and Parliamentary Cells of the Hindu =

uggled it out to London, where in 1982 they sold it to Bumper Development C=
orporation Private Limited. In turn the said Corporation sent it to the Bri=

India was onto it and asked the UK government to take action.<br style=3D"l=

 seized by London Metropolitan Police, and thus the Corporation sued the Po=

eens Bench (our High Court level) which was dismissed on April 17, 1989. So=
, the Bumper Corporation went to the House of Lords (our Supreme Court leve=

 UK Apex Court upheld the Indian government=92s position that because of th=
e prana prathista puja a temple is owned by the deity, in this case Lord Sh=
iva, and any Hindu can litigate on behalf of the deity as a defacto trustee=
. The Bench consisting of Justices Purchas, Nourse and Leggatt concluded: "=
We therefore hold that the temple is acceptable as party to these proceedin=

for recovery! No such ruling exists for a mosque for the simple reason that=
 a mosque is just a facilitation centre for reading namaz, and has no essen=
tiality for Islam religion. It can be demolished and/or shifted as any buil=
ding can and are being so in Arab countries and Pakistan. That is, the Ram =
Temple on Ramjanmabhoomi has a superior claim to the site than any mosque. =
This the fundamental truth in the Ayodhya dispute. This truth will apply to=
 Kashi Vishvanath and Brindavan temple sites as well.<br style=3D"line-heig=

 can accept is that Muslims agree to shift the building of a new masjid to =
some other site beyond the Saryu River. It is important to note that as of =
now there are eight mosques in Ayodhya which the ASI has taken over since t=
hese had no one coming to read namaz. Hence what use will another mosque be=
? If however the Muslim hardline organisations want to re-build the Babri M=
asjid in the Ramjanmabhoomi area, then the Hindus will launch a struggle.<b=

llahabad High Court allotting one-third of the Ramjanmabhoomi to the Sunni =
Wakf Board to build a mosque in the area near the Ramlala temple? The respo=
nse should be a resounding No! A temple cannot be equated to a mosque. Nor =
can we Hindus by the back door allow aggression and atrocity of demolishing=
 temples be rewarded in any manner. Therefore, as with the Shah Bano case p=
