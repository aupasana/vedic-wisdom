Namaste Narasimha,

[[[one gets the result of Durgapath with just Kunjika".=
..Please note that the saptashati itself was not mentioned.]]]

I still fee=
l that the mention of Durgapath means Saptashati here. what else could it m=
ean?

IMHO, there is no ambiguity in this half-verse.

"Kunjika paathmatren=
 Durgapaathphalam labhet"

I am sorry but first time i am not convinced wit=
h your answer. may be i lack required intensity of saadhana.

Best Regards,=


Utpal
