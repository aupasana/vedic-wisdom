 become alright but=C2=A0 I didn't say it.=C2=A0Soon after the homam got ov=
er I got the news that the girl recovered and is discharged. Not only that =
but a few surprising good things also happened to me at the same time.=C2=
=A0What does this indicate? Have I already inflicted some of her karma upon=
 myself? Kindly give me your opinion as I will know what to look for in the=
 future.
Now she is critically ill again. I thought without saying anything=
 god helped me why not perform homam for her maybe she will recover complet=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: homam question

Namaste,

Some qucik points:

(1) If you think of your wish in your mind i=
n your mother tongue when taking sankalpa formally, I am sure gods will und=
erstand and respond.

(2) If you want to formally add it to sankalpa given =
in homam manuals, please add the following after "prasaada siddhyartham" : =
"G gotrodbhavaayaaH N nakShatre R raashau L lagne jaataayaaH X naamnyaaH aa=
yurvR^iddhyartham aarogyatA siddhyartham" (in iTrans notation). Here G is h=
er gotra, N is nakshatra, R is janma raashi, L is lagna and X is the name.
=

(3) Homam to Shiva using the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra is ideal for this pur=
pose, though you can really do any homam you want. One specific offering is=
 mentioned. Make paayasam (cook rice in milk and ghee, i.e. clarified butte=
r, and add jaggery). Offer darbhas (sacred dry grass) dipped in paayasam wi=
th each repetition of the mantra, if possible.

(4) The instinct to help so=
meone else and reduce someone else's suffering is a very noble and useful o=
ne.

However, it is not without its costs. Basically remember that the worl=
d runs based on actions and reactions. Any suffering someone is experiencin=
g is a reaction to a previous action committed by that person. If you want =
to take it on yourself, you will either have to experience the reaction or =
burn the karma (action) though sadhana, i.e. convert the reaction into some=
thing else using some energy.

Of course, taking on someone else's sufferin=
g and suffering oneself is not easy. So what you are really trying to do is=
 to burn the karma using the energy created by a focused sadhana such as ho=
mam or japam. This is akin to someone throwing a ball at a wall and the bal=
l coming at that person fast later and you trying to burn it on the way (us=
ing some energy such as heat).

The problem is that your sadhana may not su=
cceed in perfectly avoiding the reaction. In other words, the ball that bou=
nced back may not be reduced to ashes fully and some small pieces of the ba=
ll may still come and hit that person (or you on his/her behalf). Not being=
 rishis, we cannot perfectly control the dynamics. Think for a moment if yo=
u are fine with taking a bit of suffering if needed, as a result of avoidin=
g a major catastrophe for that person.

(5) Some learned Adwaitis may corre=
ctly say, "all is Brahman. Life and death is the same. Aatman is neither bo=
rn nor does it die. What is there to worry if someone is suffering or close=
 to death?"

However, that is a wrong approach. Both duality and non-dualit=
y are valid and true. It is easy to sit on the bank and tell someone drowni=
ng in the ocean, "you are ocean are the same. Do not worry". If one is real=
ly at a stage where one can think like that even when one is drowning in oc=
ean and not worry, THEN one is a true adwaita jnaani. Otherwise, it is just=
 bookish knowledge and means nothing.

Because the world has so many people=
 stuck in the duality (good vs bad, happy vs sad, beautiful vs ugly etc pol=
arities), rishis have given knowledge that helps one swim the ocean of pola=
rities and ultimately realize Self. Merely stating that all is Brahman may =
not help anybody realize that. Until one realizes that, one needs tools to =
navigate the ocean of duality.

Let me put it this way: When YOU find yours=
elf in various situations that cause pleasure and pain, try to think like a=
n Adwaiti and remind yourself that all is Brahman. When you are dealing wit=
h someone else who is in great pain, forget adwaita and try to identify wit=
h that person and feel the person's pain. That will not do any harm to your=
 spiritual progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
