Dear Sir,
God never says to praise him or remember him. U may abuse him or =
doubt his existence.
U r a soul which is nothing but God in itself. Lord Bu=
ddha never agreed with traditional concept of God. But he attained 'Nirvana=
'
by observing certain principles.
Kaliyug has such power which disuades on=
e from following right path at slightest of discomfort.
U might have seen s=
ome atheists enjoying. Please do more research u will find them also suffer=
ing equally either earlier or later. Taking birth in this world itself mean=
s that one will suffer in this world. Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, or any other=
 avatar of god, suffered a great deal which we human can not even imagine, =
just to show humankind that human birth is full of misery.
Swami Ramakrishn=
a Paramhansa suffered throat cancer and he could not even drink water durin=
g last days. But he never waiverd from chosen path. 
U can find countless p=
ersons who suffered. So do not consider suffering a reason for deviating fr=
om spritual path.
Urs wavering from the path shows that u had skin deep lov=
e for God. One jolt and it is out of urs system. Love God unconditionally. =
Loving God must not be linked with any material outcome. God will alter "Ka=
rma Theory" for u but definitely with deeper love and devotion will strengh=
then ur soul which will make u firmer to face adversities in life more easi=
ly

That's what I think.  I have personally suffered a lot physically. Suff=
ered two dreaded diseases, one of which crippled me six months.

Regards
