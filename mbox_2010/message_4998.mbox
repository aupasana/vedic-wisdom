 Hi,

"Regarding the 'test' by the Parasakthi one goes through, if it is s=
ome 
temporary sufferings one go through, according to me, does not the 'te=
st' by 
Sakthi as one perceive because, she is the Mother of all and no Mot=
her will 
'test' their children.  SHE Loves all and bestow all that one nee=
d 
irrespectively.  It is to be perceived that the sufferings one undergoes=
 during 
the Sadhana is only to cross our limitations and hurdles and with =
devotion and 
pure bhakthi and Sadhana one can overcome all these."

I tend=
 to agree with this explanation...in my view..testing a is a very over 
rat=
ed activity..i guess since the ultimate goal is to reach the 
mother/shakti=
/narayana/shiva/ whatever that highest form that one 
can visualize..and if=
 the deity is responding and trying to take us there..it is 
our own weakne=
sses that is pulling us from reaching the ultimate..and this we 
perceive i=
t as test.....

test is what we have it in our mind....we need to overcome =
our weaknesses to 
really reach the ultimate and its a process... we should=
 not be worried if its a 
test or something else... honestly..how many of u=
s can really withstand if the 
deity really wishes to test us...its our our=
 own innate fears of loosing our 
valued/loved things makes us think that i=
ts a test..



Bottomline: probably as what i have understood from Narasimh=
a's guidance through 
this forum is  Forget all those fears of test etc..tr=
y to develop an attitude to 
surrender to god as mush as possible...everyth=
ing will be inline...

i'm not sure if i could put across this in an approp=
riate way..but i have 
attempted.. please correct me if my understanding is=
 not accurate..

Cheers
KK

ot Testing as she is all knowing !

  
Dear All

According to me, Shakthi w=
orship is the most appropriate for the present day.  
Our legends say that =
Devi Parasakthi gives powers to the trinity to perform 
their duties and sh=
e is absolute Power.  Hence Shakthi worship is the most 
purest form of wor=
ship and this sadhana elevates one both spiritually and 
materially.  


Re=
garding the 'test' by the Parasakthi one goes through, if it is some tempor=
ary 
sufferings one go through, according to me, does not the 'test' by Sak=
thi as one 
perceive because, she is the Mother of all and no Mother will '=
test' their 
children.  SHE Loves all and bestow all that one need irrespec=
tively.  It is to 
be perceived that the sufferings one undergoes during th=
e Sadhana is only to 
cross our limitations and hurdles and with devotion a=
nd pure bhakthi and Sadhana 
one can overcome all  these.

This is only my =
personal opinion and is not intended to hurt anybody

With love
