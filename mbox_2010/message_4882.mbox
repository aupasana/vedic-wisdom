Dear friends

While going through Parashara Pancharatra Samhita, I encounte=
red the following interesting shlokas related to fire of the Homa. These li=
nes are from Chapter 21 of the text in case someone wants to look at them d=
irectly. The translation is mine and I can't guarantee its correctness sinc=
e I am not an expert in this language. Hope someone will find it useful.

I shall now tell in sequence the objects with which to perform Homa as wel=
l as the kinds of the tongues (of fire). The Head of fire is in the Vaayavy=
a Kona (north-west), thighs in east and south-west, the two hands in the Is=
hana Kona (north-east), the Homa Kunda is called the stomach. Ears are wher=
e the wood for burning is, nose is where the smoke is, eyes are where there=
 is less burning (or less flames), head is where the ashes are.

Different results of performing homa in different tongues of fire
Th=
e tongue of fire named Kaali is used in Vashya (controlling someone), Karal=
i in Vidvesha (hatred), Lohita in Stambhana (paralyzing), Manojava in Saumy=
a (benefic or non-cruel) activities, Dhumraka in ucchatana (destroying oppo=
nent), Visphulingini in Krura (cruel activities), Vishwarupi in Aishwarya (=
opulence) etc. Thus are mentioned the distinctions with respect to the tong=
ues of fire.
