 Sri Bhagavan was in the Virupaksha Cave on the Hill. One evening after 7
p=
.m. they were all coming down the Hill to go round Arunachala. The other
de=
votees had all gone in advance; only Sri Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was in
th=
e company of Sri Maharshi, and they were slowly climbing down the steps
fro=
m the cave.

Whey they had walked a few steps, all of a sudden Sri Maharshi=
 stopped, and
with Him Sri Kavyakanta as well. The full moon was shining br=
ight in the
East in the starry sky.Pointing to the moon and the beautiful s=
ky, Sri
Bhagavan said: "Nayana! If the sun, the moon, and all the stars hav=
e their
being in ME, and the Sun himself goes round my hip with his satelli=
tes, who
am I? who am I?''

This remark of Sri Maharshi made His blessed di=
sciple envisage the Master as
the Great Person of the Vedas, as described i=
n 'Sri Rudra,' the 'Purusha
Sukta,' and the 'Skamba Sukta,' of the Atharva =
Veda. He is verily all these,
and That beyond; there is nothing that is not=
 He. Sri Kavyakanta later made
this revelation known to all the devotees.
