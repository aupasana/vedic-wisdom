Namaste Sir,
 
I can see that you are carrying a lot of baggage and it is s=
pilling over into everything you wrote. Please stick to spiritual matters a=
s this list is for spirituality and not for discussing the baggage you carr=
y, which makes you dislike a saint and his lineage. Please don't think that=
 you are so important that one thousand people should spend their time read=
ing your baggage.
 
Please stick to the charter of this list. This is my la=
st warning to you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
