Namaste,
 
Both are fine. "om gaNapataye swaahaa" means "I make this offering to Ganapati". "om gaNapataye namaH swaahaa" means "I bow to Ganapathi and make this offering". Both versions are fine in homam.
 
Especially if you are actually using a mantra that has namaH as a part of the mantra (e.g. om gaM gaNapataye namaH, OM namo naaraayaNaaya, OM namo bhagavate vaasudevaaya), there is no need to remove namaH/namo from the mantra when adding swaahaa to it!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
