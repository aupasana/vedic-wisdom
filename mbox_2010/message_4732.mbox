 Chapter III - GOD

1. Who is God? God is He who has transcended all that i=
s seen by us. If
transcending this world, is there no relation between Him =
and this world?
Not a particle here is unrelated to Him. Then what is meant=
 by transcending
the world? The world comprises us and the objects seen by =
us. In other
words, the animate and inanimate together form the world. What=
 shall we say
of Him who created the beings and things? Of these two, we sa=
y the conscious
beings to be superior. All that we can apprehend is that He=
 belongs to the
highest order of beings known to us. Our intellect cannot p=
roceed further.
Thus, our Creator is superior to us; He cannot be apprehend=
ed by our
intellect; therefore His Name, Transcended Being, "Kadawul," mean=
s that He
surpasses our intellect. Hence His Name is "Kadawul" - Transcende=
d Being.

2. Can God then not be made known to us? Not quite so. In a way, =
He is known
to us. This much of His Grace is enough for us. We have no need=
 for all His
Greatness. He has made known so much of His Greatness as will =
suffice to
eradicate our misery. There is no reason for Him to reveal a jot=
 more of His
Power than is necessary to remedy our defects in the present s=
tate. Thus He
is known according to our needs. Nay, He is in our grasp. How=
ever limitless,
He is within reach of our knowledge to some extent.

3. Wha=
t is it which brings Him within reach of our knowledge? That He is
known as=
 Being-Consciousness-Bliss.

Being denotes that which is imperishable, that=
 which exists forever. Should
He become nonexistent at any time, who is His=
 Destroyer? Who created Him?
Since the perishable nature of all leads to th=
e inference that they are
lorded over by One who is imperishable, this immo=
rtal Overlord is God. His
imperishable nature is Being (Sat).

Now, what is=
 Consciousness (Chit)? By Consciousness we mean knowledge. This
is absolute=
 Knowledge, and not like our erring intellectual knowledge.
Irregularity or=
 mistake cannot stain its actions. It is Knowledge, pure and
simple. Freque=
ntly He teaches us saying, "Your knowledge is irregular and
erring." How or=
derly are even the insentient objects of His creation! It is
known to many =
how an atheist was taught a good lesson when he derided the
scheme of thing=
s saying, "Why did He make the seed so small for the banyan
tree which is s=
o big?" That an insentient thing is found in good order and
later becomes u=
seful, implies a conscious agency at work. Can a simple,
insentient thing d=
o something which is possible for unfailing knowledge
only? Or, can't it be=
 done by our inadequate knowledge? No, it can never be.
Therefore God is sa=
id to be Consciousness (Chit) also.

Now, what is Bliss? It is the state of=
 being free from desire for anything.
It is Peace which is ever full. Were =
He to desire anything, how could He be
better than ourselves? How could we =
gain Bliss from Him? He Himself would
require another being to fulfil His d=
esires. But who would think Him to be
so? The state of self-contentment is =
that of Bliss also. Therefore He is
called Bliss (Ananda).

The three-Being=
, Consciousness and Bliss-are inseparable; otherwise, they
would become nau=
ght individually. Hence, He is known as
Being-Consciousness-Bliss (Satchita=
nanda). Thus God remains not only
transcendent but also falls within the re=
ach of our knowledge as
Being-Consciousness-Bliss.

4. He who has gained th=
e fourth state and sees all as one, only he knows God
truly as Being-Consci=
ousness-Bliss. Words cannot express nor the ears hear
how such a one is uni=
ted with God; it is a matter of realization. But there
are ways and means f=
or such realization. They can be spoken of, learned and
acted upon.

5. He =
who can be realized thus, is God. He has no name; we give Him a name.
He ha=
s no form; we give Him a form. Where is the harm in doing so? What name
is =
not His, or what form is not His? Where is the sound or form in which He
is=
 not? Therefore, in the absence of true knowledge of Him you can name Him
a=
s you please or imagine Him as of any form so to remember Him. Your hope
fo=
r His Grace without any effort on your part is utterly fruitless. Should
it=
 be possible to have His Grace without any effort on your side, all would
b=
e alike; there would be no reason for any difference. He has shown us the
w=
ays and means. Make effort, reach the goal, be happy. Your idleness and
sel=
fishness make you expect His Grace without your effort. The rule for all
is=
 for you too. Do not relax your efforts. God can be realized by your
effort=
 only.

6. There is an effort which excels all others. This may, however, a=
ppear to
be less effective than devotion to God with name and form. Neverth=
eless,
this is the more efficient. It is simply the love which you extend t=
o all
beings, whether good or bad. In the absence of such love to all, your=

devotion to God amounts to a mere parody. Of what use are you to God? That=

you seek fulfilment of your desires from God without doing your duty towar=
ds
the needy in the world must be attributed to your selfishness. In God's
=
presence, there is no use for such. The workings that take place in His
pre=
sence are all unselfish. Therefore, think that all the Centers are His
and =
He is in all the Centers and thus be devoted to Him. God is truly bound
by =
such high devotion.

7. As you go on ascribing names and forms to God and s=
howing love to all
because you have understood all names and forms to be Hi=
s, your mind will
gradually mature. Just as the taste improves with the rip=
ening of a fruit,
so also you will recognize the waxing of good and the wan=
ing of evil in you.
As your mind matures, there will come a time when you s=
hould meet your
Master. This is not to say that you go in search of him or =
he comes in
search of you. At the right time the meeting will happen. All a=
re moving in
their own ways. Your fitness brings you together, makes you tr=
ust him, makes
him teach you the right way, also makes you follow the his i=
nstructions.
That is the straight way to reach God, which is to gain the fo=
urth state.
You will follow the way and reach your goal which is
Being-Cons=
ciousness-Bliss, which is God.

8. The way shown by the Master is final, st=
raight and making for unity. It
is well-tried, natural, and free from pain.=
 When you are following the way
shown by the master, doubts will not arise;=
 there will be no fear. Are not
fear and doubt the characteristics of the w=
ays of darkness? How can they
meet you in the way of Truth shown by the Mas=
ter? In this manner, the way
will itself speak to you and say that it is th=
e right one. In that way,
there will be nothing more for you to do but to m=
eet your Master and learn
from him. That way will be familiar to you, as th=
e Master and God have made
it so. Before you, he had treaded the way. He ha=
s shown you the way and you
are following him. To how many will you show th=
e same way? And how many more
will follow the same way later? Obviously fea=
r and doubt have no place in
the way of truth. When once you have taken a s=
tep forward you will step
back. The master's help is only for the first ste=
p forward. You need not do
anything for your master in order to have the wa=
y shown to you. Know him to
be the messenger of God sent down to disclose t=
he way to the fit who have
become ripe by their own efforts in either or bo=
th the directions mentioned
earlier. It is God who sends this godly messeng=
er just when you are ripe.

9. Practice with faith in the period of ignoran=
ce is called Bhakti; the
same, with knowledge, is called Jnana. Of the two =
divisions of Bhakti, the
one is devotion to God with name and form, and the=
 other is karma which is
love for all. Of the two divisions of Jnana, the p=
ractice of the true way
shown by the Master is called yoga and the resultin=
g state is called Jnana.
It is natural for all to believe in something whic=
h is not seen and then to
find it. Those who do not believe can never find.=
 Therefore, the believers
will gain something sometime or other and the unb=
elievers never gain
anything. You can believe even for the simple reason th=
at faith in God is
not harmful. Thereby you can share the good effects. Thi=
s world is meant
only for creating faith in you. This is the purpose of cre=
ation. Have faith
and you can reach God.

10. Though you may not believe al=
l that is said of God, believe at least
"There is God." This seed is very p=
otent in its growth. It is so mighty as
to negate all else and fill all by =
itself. It is so almighty that you will
not see anything besides God, not e=
ven yourself. Truly, God is all.

Chapter IV - Peace

1. What is peace? Alt=
hough the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,
does he have any care=
s concerning it? His mind is tranquil and
refreshed. Should
his mind be in =
the same degree calm and refreshed even when he is face to
face with the wo=
rld and is active therein, then there is peace.

2. Can the mind remain so =
even when the world confronts us? It depends upon
our estimate of the world=
. The mind is more excited when one's own property
is plundered than when a=
nother's property is similarly plundered. Of one's
own things, the loss of =
one thing causes greater concern than those of
another. Why? Because our es=
timate of the things is the cause of the degree
of the delight or anxiety c=
oncerning them. Therefore, should one learn to
regard all equally, the mind=
 will be extremely peaceful. Or should all
things be considered as our own =
and highly prized, then too there is no
cause for pain. Why? What will a ma=
n regret? The mind which knows that
universal concern is beyond its capacit=
y, must needs become tranquil. Also
when one feels that one has no claim on=
 anything or that everything is
perishable, the mind will remain cool. Thus=
 there will be lasting peace if
one looks on all as of the same value. Peac=
e is dependent upon one's
intellectual appraisals.

3. I shall now illustra=
te this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is
happy or troubled accordi=
ng to his opinion of the things seen in the dream.
But on waking, his mind =
remains unaffected by all the happenings in the
dream; it remains the same.=
 Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to
value all the matters of th=
e dream equally. He is not sorry for the
cessation of the dream. Why? He is=
 convinced that the dream is not
everlasting and must end on waking. In the=
 same manner, should a man be
convinced that he cannot but wake up sometime=
 from the long dream of the
world, his mind will be unchanging. It is the s=
tate of freshness. This is
the state of Peace.

4. This is not to say that =
his relation with the world will cease. Now only
peace and freshness of the=
 mind are his. His actions cannot but vary
according to circumstances. The =
only change in him after the mind has become
peaceful is this: his mind has=
 known the truth and become unattached;
therefore, it rests in peace. His a=
ctions though changeful will always be
impartial. But the actions of others=
 are changing and cannot be impartial.
Thus, the coolness of the mind produ=
ces enormous good not only to himself
but also to the world at large. Peace=
 shows the way to right conduct.

5. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his=
 hand. Can there be any hostility
between the light and the ups and downs o=
n the way? There cannot be. But
light and darkness cannot be together. The =
light chases away darkness, it
discloses the ups and downs on the way and m=
akes the man walk carefully,
whether he moves up, down, or sideways. It rem=
oves the cause of vain
complaints, such as, "That snag hurt my foot" or "Th=
is hollow made me slip."
Similarly, after peace is gained, the state of pea=
ce makes the man neither
hate nor antagonize the world. Rather it dispels t=
he darkness which conceals
from our view the true nature of the world and i=
ts snags. In the absence of
the light of Peace which enables people to adju=
st themselves to varying
circumstances, they condemn the world as full of m=
isery, as they would
complain of the snags on the road.Therefore a man who =
has gained the utmost
peace after knowing the whole world as a complicated =
dream, should not be
considered either unrelated to the world or unconcerne=
d with its activities;
he alone stands in effective concord with it; only h=
e is competent to be a
man of action. Thus Peace is that which regulates on=
e's duties.

6. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world l=
ies in
rectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of=

reformation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to
=
possess it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To
=
guide the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one's eyesigh=
t
must itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has=

already discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the
w=
orld and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can
any=
one be so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls?
S=
o also for the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world=

and help the people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the min=
d
and body the sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the wor=
ld,
just as the life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass =
over
the corpse it has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from wor=
k or
trouble. Only truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolnes=
s.

7. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But in effe=
ct,
it beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After all, suc=
cess
depends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple over, the=

incident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or it wil=
l
leave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spiritual
m=
atters. True happiness in the world is his, and that happiness comes out of=

release from bondage. Peace means doing good to any one in any manner.

8.=
 The obstacles to peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When
=
they confront us we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of th=
e
mind distant from even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushe=
d,
it will lose its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be usef=
ul
to you, nor can it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that=

your mind is more delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful min=
d,
all your duties to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Le=
t it
release the same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are
=
contained in Peace.

9. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the=
 flower of your mind.
Let the children of the mental modes watch this worsh=
ip. Gradually they will
learn to cast away their childish pranks and desire=
 to delight like
yourself. As they watch your Peace, they will themselves r=
ecoil from their
vagaries. Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away =
by the vagaries of
the mind. On the contrary, they should become peaceful b=
y your peace. All
must get peace.

10. I shall finish in one word: The esse=
nce of all the Vedas is "Peace."

period of ignorance is called Bhakti; the same, with knowledge, is called J=
nana. Of the two divisions of Bhakti, the one is devotion to God with name =
and form, and the other is karma which is love for all. Of the two division=
s of Jnana, the practice of the true way shown by the Master is called yoga=
 and the resulting state is called Jnana. It is natural for all to believe =
in something which is not seen and then to find it. Those who do not believ=
e can never find. Therefore, the believers will gain something sometime or =
other and the unbelievers never gain anything. You can believe even for the=
 simple reason that faith in God is not harmful. Thereby you can share the =
good effects.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">This world is meant onl=
y for creating faith in you. This is the purpose of creation. Have faith an=
d you can reach God.</span><br>

<br>10. Though you may not believe all tha=
t is said of God, believe at least "There is God." This seed is v=
ery potent in its growth. It is so mighty as to negate all else and fill al=
l by itself. It is so almighty that you will not see anything besides God, =
not even yourself. Truly, God is all.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:b=
old">Chapter IV - Peace</span><br><br>1.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bo=
ld">What is peace? Although the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,=
 does he have any cares concerning it? His mind is tranquil and refreshed.<=
/span>=C2=A0Should his mind be in the same degree calm and refreshed even w=
hen he is face to face with the world and is active therein, then there is =
peace.<br>

<br>2. Can the mind remain so even when the world confronts us?=
 It depends upon our estimate of the world. The mind is more excited when o=
ne's own property is plundered than when another's property is simi=
larly plundered. Of one's own things, the loss of one thing causes grea=
ter concern than those of another. Why? Because our estimate of the things =
is the cause of the degree of the delight or anxiety concerning them. There=
fore, should one learn to regard all equally, the mind will be extremely pe=
aceful. Or should all things be considered as our own and highly prized, th=
en too there is no cause for pain. Why? What will a man regret?=C2=A0<span =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">The mind which knows that universal concern is b=
eyond its capacity, must needs become tranquil. Also when one feels that on=
e has no claim on anything or that everything is perishable, the mind will =
remain cool.</span>=C2=A0Thus there will be lasting peace if one looks on a=
ll as of the same value. Peace is dependent upon one's intellectual app=
raisals.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">3. I shall now illustra=
te this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is happy or troubled accordi=
ng to his opinion of the things seen in the dream. But on waking, his mind =
remains unaffected by all the happenings in the dream; it remains the same.=
 Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to value all the matters of th=
e dream equally. He is not sorry for the cessation of the dream. Why? He is=
 convinced that the dream is not everlasting and must end on waking. In the=
 same manner, should a man be convinced that he cannot but wake up sometime=
 from the long dream of the world, his mind will be unchanging. It is the s=
tate of freshness. This is the state of Peace.</span><br>

<br>4. This is n=
ot to say that his relation with the world will cease. Now only peace and f=
reshness of the mind are his. His actions cannot but vary according to circ=
umstances.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">The only change in him aft=
er the mind has become peaceful is this: his mind has known the truth and b=
ecome unattached; therefore, it rests in peace. His actions though changefu=
l will always be impartial.</span>=C2=A0But the actions of others are chang=
ing and cannot be impartial. Thus, the coolness of the mind produces enormo=
us good not only to himself but also to the world at large. Peace shows the=
 way to right conduct.<br>

<br>5. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his h=
and. Can there be any hostility between the light and the ups and downs on =
the way? There cannot be. But light and darkness cannot be together. The li=
ght chases away darkness, it discloses the ups and downs on the way and mak=
es the man walk carefully, whether he moves up, down, or sideways. It remov=
es the cause of vain complaints, such as, "That snag hurt my foot"=
; or "This hollow made me slip." Similarly, after peace is gained=
, the state of peace makes the man neither hate nor antagonize the world. R=
ather it dispels the darkness which conceals from our view the true nature =
of the world and its snags. In the absence of the light of Peace which enab=
les people to adjust themselves to varying circumstances, they condemn the =
world as full of misery, as they would complain of the snags on the road.<s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">Therefore a man who has gained the utmost pe=
ace after knowing the whole world as a complicated dream, should not be con=
sidered either unrelated to the world or unconcerned with its activities; h=
e alone stands in effective concord with it; only he is competent to be a m=
an of action. Thus Peace is that which regulates one's duties.</span><b=
r>

<br>6. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world lies i=
n rectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of refo=
rmation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to posse=
ss it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To guide=
 the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one's eyesight=
 must itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has =
already discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the wo=
rld and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can anyo=
ne be so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls? So=
 also for the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world =
and help the people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the mind=
 and body the sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the worl=
d, just as the life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass o=
ver the corpse it has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from work=
 or trouble. Only truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolness=
.<br>

<br>7. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But =
in effect, it beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After a=
ll, success depends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple ov=
er, the incident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or=
 it will leave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spir=
itual matters.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">True happiness in the =
world is his, and that happiness comes out of release from bondage. Peace m=
eans doing good to any one in any manner.</span><br>

<br>8. The obstacles =
to peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When they confront u=
s we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of the mind distant =
from even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushed, it will lose=
 its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be useful to you, nor =
can it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that your mind is m=
ore delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful mind, all your dut=
ies to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Let it release th=
e same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are contained in Pe=
ace.<br>

<br>9. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the flower=
 of your mind. Let the children of the mental modes watch this worship. Gra=
dually they will learn to cast away their childish pranks and desire to del=
ight like yourself. As they watch your Peace, they will themselves recoil f=
rom their vagaries. Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away by the =
vagaries of the mind. On the contrary, they should become peaceful by your =
peace. All must get peace.<br>
