Dear Elderly Scholors.
Namaste. Just now , only I got the opportunity of =
joining the Group by God'd grace.  Since very long I have been guided by on=
e article which I have collected  and kept with me. The author of the artic=
le is not known. I feel ashamed even to say so. Still I feel I should bring=
 the same to the notice of all and if possible collect the information on t=
he article which is as below.

"                              TOLERANCE

Sp=
iritual progress requires systematic efforts on the part of the aspirant to=
 be imbued with various positive qualities. Tolerance however is one essent=
ial quality the momentary feeling of which can destroy all the good work th=
e aspirant has done for years. Tolerance therefore needs to be cultivated i=
n all earnestness.

   The path of spiritual progress is full of pitfalls. =
 Every now and then a sadhaka is tempted and tested. Sometimes he is subjec=
ted to ridicule and insults.  Apparently unreasonable demands are made on h=
im.  He is proved "guilty "for no fault of his own. In such testing times T=
olerance is weapon to shield one shelf with. The movement it fleets, anger =
takes over, a sadhaka does or says things which he should not have. Later o=
n he repents. But the damage  is done. The test proves its point. To be tol=
erant is to be ever watch full of one's thoughts and actions. One should no=
t allow one self to be excited by the way events.  Instead  all happenings =
in one's life should be viewed with a sense of contentment and calmness. Th=
is attitude wins over anger and ego =96 the two main culprits who ensure sp=
iritual downfall. A tolerant person is an alert person. He conducts himself=
 with forbearance in his day to day activities.

In tolerance alone are var=
ious virtues like forgiveness , mercy, peace, humility, love, contentment  =
e. t. c. Tolerance leads to control of mind and hence progress on the spiri=
tual path."
I would like to share the above contents on this forum and requ=
est everyone be benefited by the same.

I would be grteful if any body know=
s the author of the article you may please supplement the same.   asmurthy =
