A letter written to someone seeking a spiritual =
"home."

Dear Friend,

"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and=
 the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay =
his head" (Matthew 8:20). There are many interpretation of these words, all=
 viable since the words spoken by a person of infinite consciousness can ha=
ve infinite meanings. But one I feel is legitimate is the idea that those o=
f lesser evolution ("foxes" and "birds") can find a home on earth, but a tr=
ue, awakened, human being cannot.

Please do not look for a spiritual home,=
 or a place where you belong, on this earth=96and that includes churches, s=
piritual groups, or ashrams. You are not even a human being=96you are a god=
 within God. And only God is your home. Disappointment and frustration, not=
 to mention pain and grief, can only result from trying to find a resting p=
lace anywhere but in Infinity. That is a tough thing to face, but if we are=
 to be spiritual adults the bullet must be faced and bitten.

Many people's=
 lives are a chain of "home at lasts," none of which really are home at all=
, as they eventually discover. They were spiritually beneficial and worthy =
of gratitude and respect, necessary steps=96but that is just it: steps lead=
ing to something higher. If we come to rest on any of them we will stagnate=
 and die.

Growth is change=96keep on changing! The spiritual stick-in-the-=
muds will look at you and cluck and shake their heads and talk about instab=
ility and being "out of tune with Master" and other tripe. They like stagna=
ncy and, as Jesus said, they have their reward. But you be different.

Go f=
orward!

Sri Ramakrishna told the parable of a woodcutter who met a sadhu i=
n the forest that told him: "Go further." He did, and discovered a sandalwo=
od grove. He started to cut it but remembered he had been told Go Further, =
so he went on. He found an iron deposit, then a copper deposit, then a silv=
er deposit, then a gold deposit, and finally a diamond field=96all because =
he kept on going further.

All teachings and teachers are finite and limite=
d by human boundaries. Eventually they must all be grown beyond. Truth is a=
nother matter altogether. Discovery of Truth should be the purpose of teach=
ings and teachers, but is it? Aren't most of them meant to "answer all ques=
tions," "give comfort," or "bring peace"? Are there any real answers, comfo=
rt, or peace in this world? I don't think so. However, all rungs of the lad=
der are worthy of regard. Without the rungs of a ladder or the steps of a s=
tair we do not ascend, but we ascend by leaving them behind, not stopping o=
n them and calling all the world to come stand still with us. It is the wil=
lingness to keep moving onward, leaving everything behind, that is the high=
est renunciation. Years ago I came to realize that the journey was never go=
ing to end as long as I was moving from point to point rather than stepping=
 off into eternity.

Someone asked Shankara: "What is truth [satya]?" Shank=
ara replied: "There is no `truth.' There is only The True [Sat]." As Sister=
 Gyanamata said: God Alone. Like the egoic children we are, we hate admitti=
ng that we were wrong in thinking we had "found it." The ego keeps people "=
loyal" from life to life. "God and Guru" my foot. In God there is no "and."=
 Remember: Sri Ramakrishna did not attain liberation until he mentally cut =
the living image of Kali in half with the sword of discrimination.

Does th=
is all sound like I am one of those cynical, warped, and dried up souls lik=
e Krishnamurti that denounce everyone but themselves and all ideas but thei=
rs? I hope not, for you cannot progress without any of these things I have =
mentioned, but you must also get (grow) beyond them. Every time you sit to =
do math, do you call up your first math teacher and ask her to come do it f=
or you? Or when you get the right answer, do you say: "I have done nothing.=
 It is all my first grade arithmetic teacher. All credit goes to her"? Of c=
ourse not, because you aren't nuts. So why be spiritually crazy?

Walking t=
he Path

People talk about "walking the Path," but the whole idea of the pa=
th is to come to its end and leave it behind. All books, however wise, have=
 an ending, as do the discourses of even avatars. And then the Real Thing b=
egins. We will not reach the Real without the paths, the books, or the disc=
ourses, but we must use them, not idolatrize them. A few years ago I figure=
d out the universal motto of all religions: Adore The Messenger And Ignore =
The Message. The message is always: Move on until you reach the place where=
 there is no more "on."

The problem is not with the Masters but with the i=
gnorant and deluded "disciples." The Masters liberate, the groupies bind. D=
o you have the recording: Self-Realization: the Inner and the Outer Path? D=
r. Lewis's talk presents the right perspective: it is not an organization b=
ut an attainment.

I say all this because I know how a seeker can suffer fr=
om continual disillusionment if he keeps conscious and keeps his eyes open.=
 But you will not suffer, only benefit, if you understand the way things ar=
e. Learn. Apply. Move on. It is all between you and God. And since when doe=
s God need any vows or promises? Either you seek Him or you don't. And He c=
an tell the difference.

Break all dependencies

My chief interest for some=
 years has been how people can break all dependencies and find God on their=
 own. Nearly all religious and "spiritual" situations involve manipulation =
and dependence. Religion is the number one field for Victimizers and Victim=
s, though with sacred labels instead of the true ones. Coercion and submiss=
ion is the order of the day. It is evil.

There are many things that people=
 need at a certain level of development, but a time comes when external inp=
ut no longer is what we need. Rather, we must open up the inner life and li=
ve on that alone. "Man shall not live by bread alone" implies this. The "wo=
rd that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" is purely internal. God speaks =
in the depths of our spirit, the core of our consciousness. No, He does not=
 speak as a cosmic rumble as we sit with our thumbs stuck in our ears. That=
, too, is outward-turned. Rather, He speaks as "a still small voice" in the=
 inner silence.

The absolute essential is the procedure by which our entir=
e being is transmuted into the Life Divine. Just this morning I was reading=
 Dr. I. K. Taimni's statement that the purpose of following and seeking the=
 Truth is to be the Truth. Ultimately, though not prematurely, we must come=
 to say with Jesus: "I am the way, the truth, and the life." We need to pas=
s from feeding on the Bread of Life to becoming the Bread of Life. This is =
real Yoga=96nothing else.

I have declaimed enough. Thank you for your lett=
ers. I hope you find something of what I have written useful=96if only to d=
isagree with it!
