Sharad ji

Thank you for the very sincere and uplifting experience descript=
ion you sent to the group. I am pretty sure the learned members can better =
answer your questions. 

Just sharing my opinion.

1.Vipassana is a very go=
od technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda often says Vipassana and Upasana are =
two sides of the same coin. Buddhism and Hinduism had a common origin and s=
hare many meditation practises.

2.It was simply beautiful to look at your =
description of your inner conversation with your mental imagery. 

3.Pranic=
 healing and Reiki are both powerful methods. I can draw the parallel to th=
e Twin hearts meditation practised in pranic healing with the way you sough=
t permission and the whole visualization.Also sending pranic healing/reiki =
in the direction of a departed soul will help it find its way to a better w=
omb .So I beleive you are doing good.

4.The hen sacrifice you mentioned in=
 hyd is usually done for grama devatas...hyd before the boom being witnesse=
d now was mostly rural atleast at its periphery. Orissa and Andhra used to =
have a vibrant tantric tradition ( Temple of the sixty four yoginis in oris=
sa is an example ) .The concept of an protector goddess for the village or =
grama devata comes from this....though the worship is not sattvic in nature=
.  Black hen does have an prominent place atleast in tantra  left handed ta=
ntra ( not implying the left is inferior to the right..both have their uses=
).

I am not sure of the spiritual meaning of the hen appearing there, the =
divine probably chooses the most convienient body nearby to appear.


Thank=
 you for sharing your experience once again.

Vemparla Ram Kishore

 do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started=
 experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially in/=
around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensat=
ions as equanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would chan=

the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my =
mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I a=
sked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now=
 when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and =
he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the a=
bove 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee.

> It was my first ti=
me at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/=
dead body at such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me=
, but soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at su=
nset time), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all =
the friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in suk=
haasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them t=
hat I would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'somethi=
ng' happens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivi=
d description in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform,=
 so I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly =
me!!):). 
> 
> I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my gran=
dparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings i=
n my very first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator=
, I am used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fas=
t. I continued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred e=
nough. I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with=
 the purest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind=
 and found the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father ac=
cumulates some 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'ma=
ngalmayee'. I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitem=
ent too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not =
want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the tru=
th Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have do=
ne homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have be=
lieved and still believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/null=
ification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same =
speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind t=
hat I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and =
his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, s=
o please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Pl=
ease pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". 
> 
> After =
this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =
though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=
LY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=
 mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =
not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=
alise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=
 fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=
 to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=
eet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=
ind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skelet=
al jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=
e form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=
ted mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance=
. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the=
 context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I to=
ld Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to b=
e fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.

d a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what =
I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. =

> 
> And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visual=
ising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visua=
lise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at t=
he end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam witho=
ut the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation=
 of Maa Chandi standing on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise h=
er lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few =
minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw i=
t at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think=
 about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see =
if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and=
 did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was si=
lly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I =
continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and op=
ened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it ha=
d a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land n=
ext to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) af=
ter descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funer=
al and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the h=
en wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perha=
ps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles=
 (which looked like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a result of the=
 funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched th=
e bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instea=
d of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for u=
s to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued t=
he mental chanting. 
> 
> And then my cousin signalled me that it was time =
for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the e=
xit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet i=
tself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my i=
mpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three tim=
es, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonderi=
ng how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? =
Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry =
up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen ex=
actly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyo=
ne to know that I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied =
the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again =
for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw =
it at the funeral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and reques=
ted her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the y=
ahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group=
.

ack home and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I =
would'nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of wha=
t happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I th=
inking about 'it'. There was a certian stillness within my existence that e=
vening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions,=
 just a sense of 'wonder'. The visualisations could have been a product of =
my own imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silen=
ce was the most beautiful thing.

 incident, I have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is=
? Why was it jumping 'madly' around the fire? Is there a connection between=
 the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/M=
aa temples? Did Shakti really grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then=
 why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two =
feet) a half-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some r=
eiki to him?
