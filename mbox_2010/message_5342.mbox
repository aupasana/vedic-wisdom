Dr Bhatla 
=C2=A0
Per USDA research it takes 8 pounds to generate=C2=A01 po=
und of meat. This information goes against the fact that it takes lot of en=
ergy to produce vegetarian foods which basically contradicts 100%. I always=
 found its your choice in life in what you like to do spiritually and envir=
onmentally. I was told that if USDS shows how animals are treated and kille=
d enmase (of course painlessly and humanly!.. contradiction again) to the g=
eneral public more than 50% would stop eating meat!. It boils down to choic=
e without being too strong about any views

Dear Dr Bhatla,

"Practically it is im=
possible to shift all the population to vegetarian sources without triggeri=
ng riots for food."

Nothing could be farther from the truth! This is about=
 the most common argument used by people who want to justify eating animals=
.

For a very well researched and written book on this subject, I would sug=
gest reading Jonathan Safran Foer=E2=80=99s book, =E2=80=9CEating Animals=
=E2=80=9D 

Here is a link to it's website: http://www.eatinganimals.com/

=
BTW, this is not the first time this topic has come up for discussion on th=

I do agre=
e with your view about eating based on your "goal in life".

sincerely,

=C2=A0 

Hello,

I agree with Ra=
jarshi Ji.

In total about 60% of world's total protein need is fulfilled b=
y non-vegetarian sources that too very cheap as compared to vegetarian sour=
ces. Practically it is impossible to shift all the population to vegetarian=
 sources without triggering riots for food.

I believe that a person should=
 choose his dietary habits based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and m=
ore specifically, on his Goal in life.

Atul
