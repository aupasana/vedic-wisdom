ppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a re=

 wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start cryin=

 emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up family and their=
 welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma you are doing now,=
 but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachment to a result =
does not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety regarding whethe=
r the desired result will happen or not will decrease one's focus and stop =
one from operating at one's best. Decide your actions based on a desired ou=
tcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may not be achieved=
 even though your actions seem at this point of time to be the best possibl=
e actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.

w is in god's hands and is decided based on what you gave earlier. What you=
 give now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual progress essential=

giving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you focus your mind on =

 you have no control over it now. This is true irrespective of whether you =
