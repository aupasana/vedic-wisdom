 A.Devaraja Mudaliar had a unique, innate ability to associate with the
Mah=
arshi in an entirely natural manner, while yet maintaining complete faith
a=
nd devotion to him. This resulted in an intimate relationship and frank
dia=
logues on many subjects, including the practical application of the
Maharsh=
i's teachings.

The rare devotion Devaraja Mudaliar developed for the Mahar=
shi eventually
compelled him to leave his home and profession and settle do=
wn in Sri
Ramanasramam in 1942. His four years of tenancy at the Ashrama se=
cured for
posterity invaluable records in the form of a diary, subsequently=
 published
as Day By Day with Bhagavan. Later, his written reminiscences fo=
rmed the
book entitled My Recollections, which was the source for the follo=
wing
article.

Devaraja Mudaliar, at the ripe age of 85, was absorbed in hi=
s Master in
1972.

THE EARLIEST recollection I have of Bhagavan dates back =
to 1900. Along with
some of my relations, I went to Tiruvannamalai for the =
Deepam festival. Even
as early as that, the crowds that came for Deepa dars=
han used to visit our
Bhagavan, then popularly known as Brahmana Swami.

I =
did not visit him again until 1914, two years after I came to Chittoor and
=
settled down there to practise as a lawyer. Kuppuswami Mudaliar accompanied=

me on my visit. We arrived at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and found
B=
hagavan sitting on the parapet wall outside Virupakshi Cave. So far I can
r=
emember there was no one else there at that time. There were only a few
mon=
keys near Bhagavan, and he started telling me about them, their ways,
their=
 government, kings, queens, etc. I stayed nearly two hours and the
whole ti=
me was spent in listening to these stories about monkeys. I was
still a you=
ng man and did not take seriously to the spiritual side of life,
so I did n=
ot ask Bhagavan for any spiritual guidance. I was satisfied with
having see=
n him and talked to him.

It was made possible for me to visit Bhagavan aga=
in about the end of 1922.
By this time Bhagavan's mother had attained Mahas=
amadhi and Bhagavan had
come to live near the mother's samadhi (grave) at t=
he foot of the hill where
Sri Ramanasramam now stands. There was a small th=
atched shed housing the
samadhi, where the temple now stands, and to the no=
rth of the samadhi was a
narrow pial, or raised floor, on which Bhagavan us=
ed to sit or lie down.

I told Bhagavan that, though I went to temples like=
 other people, they did
not much appeal to me and asked Bhagavan what he wo=
uld advise me to do. He
replied: "That does not matter. Think of God as bei=
ng in your heart and
meditate on God that way. That will be enough."

The e=
nd of 1933 saw my first long stay of nearly a week at Bhagavan's feet
and h=
is presence was such a balm to my stricken heart that from that visit
dates=
 my intimate and close association with him.

It is said that man's adversi=
ty is God's opportunity. Bhagavan proved a
great solace to me when I lost m=
y wife in 1933 (I was then 47). So
naturally, when the next misfortune came=
, in 1935, I threw myself even more
completely on Bhagavan, going to him as=
 often as possible and basking in his
presence.

I lost my job as Governmen=
t Pleader and Public Prosecutor which I had held
for fifteen years (that is=
 for five successive terms). In my then
circumstances, this was a great mis=
fortune, and it was a serious problem
with me how I was going to make both =
ends meet after losing a steady,
assured income of about Rs. 6,000 a year t=
o which I had been accustomed for
fifteen years. I mention the gravity of t=
his crisis only to indicate that it
drove me to lean more and more upon Bha=
gavan.

I decided about 1939, that I would give up practice completely in 1=
941, wind
up my establishment at Chittoor and go and live with Bhagavan at =
the Ashrama
for the rest of my life. I asked and received permission to bui=
ld a one-room
cottage inside the Ashrama premises. Such permission was rare=
ly given, in
fact it was given only to two others, namely, Major Chadwick a=
nd Yogi
Ramiah. The room was ready for me by June 1940.

It was about the e=
nd of August 1942, I think, that I went to live at Sri
Ramanasramam as a pe=
rmanent inmate. However, for some little time more, I
had to go to Chittoor=
 now and then in connection with remaining professional
work or my private =
affairs.

When I had resided in the Ashrama I gradually made a routine to s=
ing for
about half an hour between 10 and 11 in the morning, that is for th=
e last
twenty minutes or half hour between when Bhagavan had finished going=
 through
the second mail and when the gong went for lunch. Bhagavan saw tha=
t this was
my line of approach and was doing me good. Therefore he took car=
e, by the
silent working of his grace, that nobody interfered with it.

In =
the early days Bhagavan encouraged me whenever I was singing with deep
feel=
ing. He would have such a look on his face, with his radiant eyes
directed =
towards me, that I would be held spellbound, and not infrequently,
at some =
especially moving words in the songs, tears would come and I would
be oblig=
ed to stop reciting for one or two minutes. Bhagavan told me that
such weep=
ing is good, quoting from Thiruvachakam: "By crying for You (God),
one can =
get you."

This seems an appropriate place for referring to another well kn=
own
characteristic of Bhagavan. To those who have only a very superficial
k=
nowledge of him or his works, it might seem that he was a cold,
relentlessl=
y logical, unemotional Jnani, far removed from the Bhakta who
melts into te=
ars in contemplation of God's grace and love. But to those who
had any real=
 experience of Bhagavan and his ways, and works, it was clear
that he was a=
s much a Bhakta as a Jnani. Often he has told us that only a
true Bhakta ca=
n be a true Jnani and that only a true Jnani can be a true
Bhakta. The comp=
lete extinction of the ego is the end attained either in
jnana or bhakti.

=
When touching songs were recited or read out before him, or when he himself=

was reading out to us poems or passages from the lives or works of famous
=
saints, he would be moved to tears and would find it impossible to restrain=

them. He would be reading out and explaining some passage and when he came=

to a very moving part he would get so choked with emotion that he could no=
t
continue but would lay aside the book.

Before taking leave of this topic=
, I must remark that it was not only any
moving song about God that had thi=
s effect on him but anything grand,
magnanimous, noble or generous moved hi=
m as few people could be moved. I was
often reminded of the sentence, "The =
finest minds, like the finest metals,
dissolve the easiest."

Many times I =
complained to Bhagavan that I was not making any appreciable
progress, bemo=
aning the persistence of desires. Bhagavan replied making
light of my troub=
le: "It will all go, all in time. You need not worry. The
more dhyana (medi=
tation) one performs the more will these desires fall off."

On other occas=
ions when I complained that I was not improving, Bhagavan
simply replied, "=
How do you know?"

Bhagavan, from what little I know of him, was not one wh=
o believed in
forcing the pace. On the contrary, he gave me the impression =
that he felt it
was not proper and was not for our real good, that he shoul=
d interfere and
do violence to our nature or Prakriti by hurrying us at a f=
aster pace than
we are built for, even towards realisation.

Once I had pla=
nned to carry out something in conjunction with someone else
who was then s=
taying permanently near the Ashrama. Neither at the time, nor
even now acco=
rding to my lights, was there anything so very objectionable
about what we =
had planned. But suddenly one afternoon, out of a trivial and
altogether in=
adequate circumstance, a quarrel arose between us and what we
intended was =
called off. The next morning I happened to be sitting very near
Bhagavan's =
couch, at his feet, and Bhagavan, apropos of nothing in
particular and with=
 an expression of love and pity, turned to me and said in
a low voice: "We =
should not make elaborate plans to get anything. I don't
object to your enj=
oying what comes your way of its own accord."

Then I knew beyond all doubt=
 that it was Bhagavan who, foreseeing some harm
for me in what I had planne=
d, brought about the sudden and unexpected
quarrel the previous afternoon a=
nd aborted our plans. When Bhagavan told me
this, I asked him, "Does that m=
ean that if a thing comes to me without any
planning or working for it and =
I enjoy it, there will be no bad consequences
from it?"

Bhagavan then hast=
ened to add: "It is not so," and explained: "Every act
must have its conseq=
uences. If anything comes your way, by reason of
prarabdha (destiny based o=
n the balance sheet of past lives) you can't help
it. If you take what come=
s, without any special attachment and without any
desire for more of it or =
for a repetition of it, it will not harm you by
leading to further births. =
On the other hand, if you enjoy it with great
attachment and naturally desi=
re for more of it, that is bound to lead to
more and more births."

About w=
ork, Bhagavan used to say: "No sort of work is a hindrance on the
spiritual=
 path. It is the notion 'I am the doer' that is the hindrance. If
you get r=
id of that by enquiring and finding out who is this 'I', then work
will be =
no hindrance since you will be doing it without the ego sense that
you are =
the doer and without any attachment to the fruits of your work. Work
will g=
o on even more efficiently than before; but you can always be in your
own, =
natural, permanent state of peace and bliss. Further, one should not
worry =
about whether one should engage in work or give it up. If work is what
is o=
rdained for one, one will not escape it, however much one may try. On
the o=
ther hand, if no work is ordained for one, one will not obtain work
however=
 much one wishes to strive for it."

One summer afternoon I was sitting opp=
osite Bhagavan in the old hall, with a
fan in my hand and said to him: "I c=
an understand that the outstanding
events in a man's life, such as his coun=
try, nationality, family, career or
profession, marriage, death, etc., are =
all predestined by his karma, but can
it be that all the details of his lif=
e, down to the minutest, have already
been determined? Now, for instance, I=
 put this fan that is in my hand down
on the floor here. Can it be that it =
was already decided that on such and
such a day, at such and a such an hour=
, I shall move the fan like this and
put it down here?"

Bhagavan replied, =
"Certainly." He continued: "Whatever this body is to do
and whatever experi=
ences it is to pass through was already decided when it
came into existence=
."

Thereupon I naturally exclaimed: "What becomes then of man's freedom an=
d
responsibility for his actions?"

Bhagavan explained: "The only freedom m=
an has is to strive for and acquire
the jnana which will enable him not to =
identify himself with the body. The
body will go through the actions render=
ed inevitable by prarabdha and a man
is free either to identify himself wit=
h the body and be attached to the
fruits of its actions, or to be detached =
from it and be a mere witness of
its activities."

This may not be acceptab=
le to many learned people or philosophers. I recall
in this connection the =
following lines that Bhagavan once quoted to me from
Thayumanavar on anothe=
r occasion: "This is not to be taught to all. Even if
we tell them, it will=
 only lead to endless discussion."

It may be well to remind readers that B=
hagavan has given his classic answer
to the age-old question "Can free will=
 conquer fate?" as follows in his
Forty Verses: "Such questions worry only =
those who have not found the source
of both free will and fate. Those who h=
ave found this source have left all
such discussions behind."

A lady Princ=
ipal asked Bhagavan whether it was not better for people to work
and do som=
ething for the betterment of the world than to sit in
contemplation, aloof =
from the world, seeking for their own salvation. This
was not by any means =
a new question and Bhagavan had given a very clear
answer to it which has a=
lready been published in the Maharshi's Gospel. In
brief, it is that one Jn=
ani by his Self-realisation is doing much more for
the world than all socia=
l workers put together and that his silence is more
eloquent and effective =
than the words of orators and writers advocating any
courses for man. On th=
is occasion, however, Bhagavan remained silent. When
the lady found that Bh=
agavan did not answer, she went on speaking for some
ten minutes. Even then=
 Bhagavan remained silent. The lady and her sister
then left in chagrin.

A=
fter they had left Bhagavan said to me: "It is no use telling them
anything=
. The only result would be that it would be published in the papers
that su=
ch and such are the views of so and so and there will be endless
dispute. T=
he best thing is to keep quiet."

His view on the attempts, however well in=
tentioned, by idealistic reformers,
whether socialist or communist or whate=
ver label they may wear, to make all
people equally well-placed in life can=
 be epitomized as follows: "There
never was and never will be a time when a=
ll are equally happy or rich or
wise or healthy. In fact none of these term=
s has any meaning except in so
far as the opposite to it exists. But that d=
oes not mean that when you come
across anyone who is less happy or more mis=
erable than yourself, you are not
to be moved to compassion or to seek to r=
elieve him as best you can. On the
contrary, you must love all and help all=
, since only in that way can you
help yourself. When you seek to reduce the=
 suffering of any fellow-man or
fellow-creature, whether your efforts do su=
cceed or not, you are yourself
evolving spiritually thereby, especially if =
such service is rendered
disinterestedly, not with the egoistic feeling 'I =
am doing this', but in the
spirit 'God is making me the channel of this ser=
vice; He is the doer and I
the instrument'." On two successive days, in ans=
wer to questions from
visitors, Bhagavan said in effect what I have summari=
sed above.

Most of the time I lived with Bhagavan, I used to feel peaceful=
 and
absolutely free from care. That, as many can testify, was the outstand=
ing
effect of his presence. Nevertheless, it did occasionally happen that
s=
omething disturbed the peace and happiness for a while. On one such
occasio=
n I asked Bhagavan: "Why do such interruptions come? Does it mean
that we h=
ave ceased to have Bhagavan's grace then?"

With what graciousness did Bhag=
avan reply: "You crazy fellow! The trouble or
want of peace comes only beca=
use of grace."

On other occasions also Bhagavan has similarly told me: "Yo=
u people are glad
and grateful to God when things you regard as good come t=
o you. That is
right, but you should be equally grateful when things you re=
gard as bad come
to you. That is where you fail."

Here I must say the only=
 method I have adopted to achieve liberation or
Self-realisation is simply =
to throw myself on Bhagavan, to surrender to him
as completely as lies in m=
y power, and to leave everything else to him. And
Bhagavan's teaching, the =
last I ever got from him before he attained
Mahasamadhi, was just this: "Yo=
ur business is simply to surrender and leave
everything to me. If one reall=
y surrenders completely, there is no room for
him to complain that the Guru=
 has not done this or that."

To me and a number of other devotees of Bhaga=
van, he was God and all in all.
We felt as Saint Arunagirinathar felt when =
he declared to Lord Muruga:

"I rely on none except you and will follow non=
e except you." I have often
sung this song before Bhagavan, altering the la=
st two lines in such a way
that they would refer to Bhagavan, instead of to=
 Muruga. But about
whomsoever we sang, whichever temple we visited, or what=
ever image we
worshipped our homage always went to Bhagavan.

ence, "The finest minds, like the finest metals, dissolve the easiest.=
"<br>

<br>Many times I complained to Bhagavan that I was not making a=
ny appreciable progress, bemoaning the persistence of desires. Bhagavan rep=
lied making light of my trouble: "It will all go, all in time. You nee=
d not worry. The more dhyana (meditation) one performs the more will these =
desires fall off."<br>

<br>On other occasions when I complained that =
I was not improving, Bhagavan simply replied, "How do you know?"<=
br><br>Bhagavan, from what little I know of him, was not one who believed i=
n forcing the pace. On the contrary, he gave me the impression that he felt=
 it was not proper and was not for our real good, that he should interfere =
and do violence to our nature or Prakriti by hurrying us at a faster pace t=
han we are built for, even towards realisation.<br>

<br>Once I had planned=
 to carry out something in conjunction with someone else who was then stayi=
ng permanently near the Ashrama. Neither at the time, nor even now accordin=
g to my lights, was there anything so very objectionable about what we had =
planned. But suddenly one afternoon, out of a trivial and altogether inadeq=
uate circumstance, a quarrel arose between us and what we intended was call=
ed off. The next morning I happened to be sitting very near Bhagavan's =
couch, at his feet, and Bhagavan, apropos of nothing in particular and with=
 an expression of love and pity, turned to me and said in a low voice: &quo=
t;We should not make elaborate plans to get anything. I don't object to=
 your enjoying what comes your way of its own accord."<br>

<br>Then I=
 knew beyond all doubt that it was Bhagavan who, foreseeing some harm for m=
e in what I had planned, brought about the sudden and unexpected quarrel th=
e previous afternoon and aborted our plans. When Bhagavan told me this, I a=
sked him, "Does that mean that if a thing comes to me without any plan=
ning or working for it and I enjoy it, there will be no bad consequences fr=
om it?"<br>

<br>Bhagavan then hastened to add: "It is not so,&qu=
ot; and explained: "Every act must have its consequences. If anything =
comes your way, by reason of prarabdha (destiny based on the balance sheet =
of past lives) you can't help it.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold"=
>If you take what comes, without any special attachment and without any des=
ire for more of it or for a repetition of it, it will not harm you by leadi=
ng to further births. On the other hand, if you enjoy it with great attachm=
ent and naturally desire for more of it, that is bound to lead to more and =
more births."</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">About w=
ork, Bhagavan used to say: "No sort of work is a hindrance on the spir=
itual path. It is the notion 'I am the doer' that is the hindrance.=
 If you get rid of that by enquiring and finding out who is this 'I'=
;, then work will be no hindrance since you will be doing it without the eg=
o sense that you are the doer and without any attachment to the fruits of y=
our work.</span>=C2=A0Work will go on even more efficiently than before; bu=
t you can always be in your own, natural, permanent state of peace and blis=
s. Further, one should not worry about whether one should engage in work or=
 give it up. If work is what is ordained for one, one will not escape it, h=
owever much one may try. On the other hand, if no work is ordained for one,=
 one will not obtain work however much one wishes to strive for it."<b=
r>

<br>One summer afternoon I was sitting opposite Bhagavan in the old hal=
l, with a fan in my hand and said to him: "I can understand that the o=
utstanding events in a man's life, such as his country, nationality, fa=
mily, career or profession, marriage, death, etc., are all predestined by h=
is karma, but can it be that all the details of his life, down to the minut=
est, have already been determined? Now, for instance, I put this fan that i=
s in my hand down on the floor here. Can it be that it was already decided =
that on such and such a day, at such and a such an hour, I shall move the f=
an like this and put it down here?"<br>

<br>Bhagavan replied, "C=
ertainly." He continued: "Whatever this body is to do and whateve=
r experiences it is to pass through was already decided when it came into e=
xistence."<br><br>Thereupon I naturally exclaimed: "What becomes =
then of man's freedom and responsibility for his actions?"<br>

<b=
r><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan explained: "The only freed=
om man has is to strive for and acquire the jnana which will enable him not=
 to identify himself with the body. The body will go through the actions re=
ndered inevitable by prarabdha and a man is free either to identify himself=
 with the body and be attached to the fruits of its actions, or to be detac=
hed from it and be a mere witness of its activities."</span><br>

<br>=
This may not be acceptable to many learned people or philosophers. I recall=
 in this connection the following lines that Bhagavan once quoted to me fro=
m Thayumanavar on another occasion: "This is not to be taught to all. =
Even if we tell them, it will only lead to endless discussion."<br>

<=
br>It may be well to remind readers that=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-style:ita=
lic">Bhagavan has given his classic answer to the age-old question "Ca=
n free will conquer fate?" as follows in his Forty Verses: "Such =
questions worry only those who have not found the source of both free will =
and fate.</span>=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Those who have found=
 this source have left all such discussions behind."</span><br>

<br>A=
 lady Principal asked Bhagavan whether it was not better for people to work=
 and do something for the betterment of the world than to sit in contemplat=
ion, aloof from the world, seeking for their own salvation. This was not by=
 any means a new question and Bhagavan had given a very clear answer to it =
which has already been published in the Maharshi's Gospel. In brief, it=
 is that one Jnani by his Self-realisation is doing much more for the world=
 than all social workers put together and that his silence is more eloquent=
 and effective than the words of orators and writers advocating any courses=
 for man. On this occasion, however, Bhagavan remained silent. When the lad=
y found that Bhagavan did not answer, she went on speaking for some ten min=
utes. Even then Bhagavan remained silent. The lady and her sister then left=
 in chagrin.<br>

<br>After they had left Bhagavan said to me: "It is =
no use telling them anything. The only result would be that it would be pub=
lished in the papers that such and such are the views of so and so and ther=
e will be endless dispute. The best thing is to keep quiet."<br>

<br>=
His view on the attempts, however well intentioned, by idealistic reformers=
, whether socialist or communist or whatever label they may wear, to make a=
ll people equally well-placed in life can be epitomized as follows: "T=
here never was and never will be a time when all are equally happy or rich =
or wise or healthy. In fact none of these terms has any meaning except in s=
o far as the opposite to it exists. But that does not mean that when you co=
me across anyone who is less happy or more miserable than yourself, you are=
 not to be moved to compassion or to seek to relieve him as best you can. O=
n the contrary, you must love all and help all, since only in that way can =
you help yourself. When you seek to reduce the suffering of any fellow-man =
or fellow-creature, whether your efforts do succeed or not, you are yoursel=
f evolving spiritually thereby, especially if such service is rendered disi=
nterestedly, not with the egoistic feeling 'I am doing this', but i=
n the spirit 'God is making me the channel of this service; He is the d=
oer and I the instrument'." On two successive days, in answer to q=
uestions from visitors, Bhagavan said in effect what I have summarised abov=
e.<br>

<br>Most of the time I lived with Bhagavan, I used to feel peaceful=
 and absolutely free from care. That, as many can testify, was the outstand=
ing effect of his presence. Nevertheless, it did occasionally happen that s=
omething disturbed the peace and happiness for a while. On one such occasio=
n I asked Bhagavan: "Why do such interruptions come? Does it mean that=
 we have ceased to have Bhagavan's grace then?"<br>

<br>With what=
 graciousness did Bhagavan reply: "You crazy fellow! The trouble or wa=
nt of peace comes only because of grace."<br><br><span style=3D"font-w=
eight:bold">On other occasions also Bhagavan has similarly told me: "Y=
ou people are glad and grateful to God when things you regard as good come =
to you. That is right, but you should be equally grateful when things you r=
egard as bad come to you. That is where you fail."</span><br>

<br>Her=
e I must say the only method I have adopted to achieve liberation or Self-r=
ealisation is simply to throw myself on Bhagavan, to surrender to him as co=
mpletely as lies in my power, and to leave everything else to him. And Bhag=
avan's teaching, the last I ever got from him before he attained Mahasa=
madhi, was just this: "Your business is simply to surrender and leave =
everything to me. If one really surrenders completely, there is no room for=
 him to complain that the Guru has not done this or that."<br>

<br>To=
 me and a number of other devotees of Bhagavan, he was God and all in all. =
We felt as Saint Arunagirinathar felt when he declared to Lord Muruga:<br><=
br>"I rely on none except you and will follow none except you." I=
 have often sung this song before Bhagavan, altering the last two lines in =
such a way that they would refer to Bhagavan, instead of to Muruga. But abo=
ut whomsoever we sang, whichever temple we visited, or whatever image we wo=
rshipped our homage always went to Bhagavan.<div style=3D"clear:both;margin=
