Ego! How this small yet powerful part of man can be completely blind! It is=
 like a destructive drug, for whoever falls victim to ego loses everything.=
 It is like a wild animal that destroys everything in its path without cons=
ideration. Destruction of others and of one's self, is the result of an unc=
ontrolled ego. 

Nourishment for the powerful ego is found in the intellect=
. Intellect is both wonderful and dangerous. Trained, developed and properl=
y used, the intellect is one of the highest faculties. However if used impr=
operly, the intellect only gathers impressions and passes judgement. Nothin=
g is integrated, nothing is experienced and Reality is disregarded. The int=
ellect then believes itself to be Omniscient and Master of the world.

Ther=
e is a wise Indian saying. There are eight manifestations of mental alcohol=
 which blind the intellect: pride of race, of youth, of beauty, of physical=
 strength, of family, of position, of money and of knowledge. Vanity blinds=
 like the strutting arrogance of a drunkard who considers himself superhuma=
n. In reality he has lost control. Many people suffer from the illness of p=
ride, which brings symptoms of jealousy, being argumentative, hate and dist=
rust.

It's not difficult to carry a full water pot on the top of your head=
, as they do in India, but you will not get far before a half-filled one sl=
oshes and spills. In the same way, the mind is always subject to disturbanc=
e as long as knowledge is imperfect and incomplete.

This is how it was wit=
h one group of men who had retired from their profession. Formerly railway =
officials, professors, military men and Sanskrit scholars, each of them pos=
sessed a certain amount of knowledge and skill,  but were terribly conceite=
d about them. Having nothing to do, they passed their time travelling aroun=
d, humiliating people by challenging debates. They especially liked to emba=
rrass other learned men or swamis with their practiced questioning.

One da=
y, this group came to Mahaprabhuji's ashram as he was holding satsang.

"We=
 have heard you are a great scholar and we have come to be convinced it is =
so," one of them provocatively asked. "Tell us what you know!"

Mahaprabhuj=
i had no chance to reply before another interrupted, who had some poetic ab=
ility.

"Recite one of your poems, we want to assess your skill!"

Remainin=
g peaceful, Mahaprabhuji welcomed the men with a loving heart, just as he w=
elcomed all visitors and graciously invited them to sit down. He looked at =
them and as nothing was hidden from him, he knew their thoughts and charact=
eristics. In a bhajan he began to reveal their negative attributes, so as t=
o instruct them in better behaviour.

Dear readers, it is difficult to tran=
slate Mahaprabhuji's beautiful poetry into English, as it has quite a diffe=
rent feeling in Hindi. Therefore I can only attempt to convey the general e=
ssence of that bhajan here.

 

KAHA VED PATHI TRIPATHI KAHAVE

Those who s=
tudy and call themselves scholars,

Those who consider themselves poets,

T=
hose who dress themselves like holy men,

Those who prize external cleanlin=
ess,

What do they gain if they have not studied the Supreme

Or purified t=
heir mind?

If they have not realized God,

What's the use of poetry or a s=
plendid gown?

Those who study law yet still don't know the law of God,

Th=
ose who think only of their body

Which will one day be ash spread by the w=
ind,

What can they gain from this?

Only God can stop the fallacy of such =
thoughts,

Without Him, all is just pretence.

 

In further verses the bha=
jan refers to the true aim of life: to behave well and not only to `appear'=
 well.

Suddenly it seemed to these retired men, that they had accomplished=
 absolutely nothing in their entire lives. They were seized with sorrow as =
they realized that they were growing old and might not have much time to ma=
ke amends.

"O Master," they cried, "is it really too late for us? We surre=
nder ourselves to you and humbly beg your guidance and protection. Gracious=
 Lord, can you forgive us?"

Mahaprabhuji's heart is full of love for all c=
reatures and there was no question of anger or annoyance within him. He den=
ied no one, forgave all and corrected and removed the negative qualities of=
 those who put their trust in him. Lovingly he looked at them and sang agai=
n:

 

SANTO SE KOI SIROMANI MANUSYA

The Saint is the crown of humanity!

=
The Gita, Ramayana, Bible and Koran all praise the glory of Saints,

Their =
words shower all mankind in Blessing.

The Saint selflessly gives, he gives=
 everything to everyone,

He lives not for himself, he lives only for other=
s,

As a messenger of God, he comes in love and compassion

To purify the w=
orld of sins!

God's mercy we experience through the blessing of the Saint,=


The Saint is unsurpassed

In love, devotion, humility, kindness and mercy=
.

 

When Mahaprabhuji had finished the bhajan, he said, "With the blessin=
g of a Saint it is possible to realize everything, but don't be deceived, d=
ear brothers! As you well know, the ego surrounds itself with the appearanc=
e of wisdom and many call themselves holy or pretend to be wise. Go where y=
our thirst will be quenched. If your heart is really seeking then you will =
find your Master. My dears, your prayers for forgiveness are heard, it is n=
ever too late to do good, every second is valuable."

The men begged Gurude=
va, "Lord, please initiate us and take us as your disciples."

"I will give=
 you a mantra which you shall practise every day," Mahaprabhuji answered. "=
>From now on learn to be as kind and humble to all as much you were unkind b=
efore. Never forget there is something you can learn from everyone and only=
 God the Almighty is perfect."

Grateful for his words, they left Mahaprabh=
uji and praised him with all their hearts. For these men the following word=
s from The Ramayana proved true: "Only by God's mercy is it possible to mee=
t a realized Master."
