Namaste friends,
 
Swami Sathasivom who sent this mail is the priest I ment=
ioned earlier. If many people are doing homam by themselves today, he playe=
d an important role in it.
 
When Manish wanted to do Shata Chandi Homam, S=
wami Sathasivom invited us to do it at the Kaalikaambaal temple in Chennai =
where he is the head priest. When I asked how much it will cost, he said "I=
 will arrange everything. You and Manish just come and sit for sankalpam". =
It was during the Shata Chandi homam that Manish had a darshan of the Mothe=
r, who commanded to spread homam and said She will arrange all the resource=
s needed. Swami Sathasivom had several books on homam gifted to us by a fri=
end of his on the next day, without Manish telling anything about the Mothe=
r's command to anyone. He also gifted a homa kundam to me enabling me to ex=
periment with homam and prepare myself for creating the manuals.
 
He is a =
priest in the Sivacharya tradition of Tamil Nadu and his father Sri Sambamu=
rthi Sivacharya was a very respected Sivacharya who trained a lot of priest=
s and consecrated many temples. Swami Sathasivom is one of the rare priests=
 we find today, who is not only a priest but also a yogi and a sadhaka. He =
has childlike innocence, simplicty, rare humility and love for all. He cond=
ucts himself with detachment by seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He co=
nducted some of the best homams and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on=
 mouna vratam (vow of silence) for more than a year and communicates by wri=
ting (saying mantras in pooja/homam is an exception).
 
*        *        *=

 
I can give an analogy for the last point regarding an aghora's way to ov=
ercome any weakness for sex that may be left in the mind (which may make se=
xual thoughts arise in the mind now and then).
 
Suppose you are trying to =
read a book and a friend is distracting you and irritating you by talking a=
bout something else. You can try to ignore him and focus on the book. Alter=
natively, you can also try to get him interested in the book and call him t=
o read the book along with you. In the beginning, he may still distract you=
 and make it more difficult to read. But, it is possible that he also likes=
 the book and starts enjoying the book along with you and stops distracting=
 you.
 
If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the =
friend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distractions=
 caused by the friend, then aghora's sadhana I mentioned is like getting th=
e friend to read the book along with you.
 
However, as I said, there are n=
o guarantees. This friend may get interested in the book and stop distracti=
ng you, or he may continue to distract you and make it worse by being right=
 next to you through the reading. It is tricky to know how long one should =
try before deciding that it is not working. That is why we say that aghora =
is not for everyone.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

nd Sri Vidya)


    

  Namaste,

  It is perfectly fine to combine the sad=
hanas of different aspects of the Mother, including Lalita and Chandi.

  S=
ri Vidya consists of symbolic practices that eventually enable one to under=
stand various layers of Maayaa surrounding true Self. The idea is that one =
is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it.

  =
Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother foug=
ht, which explain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses that ty=
pically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will =
promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these weaknesses.

  The=
re is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it=
 at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of t=
he Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of t=
he Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mot=
her makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irr=
espective of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects of=
 a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.

  >=
 Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.
  > Perhaps I=
 need to read more! 

  Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora=
 is not everyone's cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.

  Ghor=
a means terrible. Aghora means "not terrible". One of the names of Lord Shi=
va is Aghora. A true Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or b=
ad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to=
 focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead =
of impermanent manifestations of god.

  When someone dies, north Indians c=
hant "Raama naam satya hai" while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It=
 means "only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusi=
on". The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a temporary=
 illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we rem=
ind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone p=
raises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to fee=
l proud and happy, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thin=
g we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Le=
t the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"? When we feel attracted to som=
ething beautiful and want to get it, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam sa=
tya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not so =
beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not =
dwell on temporary illusions"? When someone attacks and abuses us and we ar=
e about to feel sad or angry, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai=
. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind=
 not dwell on temporary illusions"?"

  A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama =
naam satya hai" always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* o=
f Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impur=
e, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion) and t=
ries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.

=
  *        *        *

  Vedanta says "all is Self. The variety we perceive=
 is an illusion". An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are =
both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is th=
e Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ri=
tual where feces is eaten. But, please remember that eating feces is not th=
e main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving=
 an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point=
. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a pers=
on's mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self ("feces") wh=
ile eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will n=
ot be dwelling on the fact that he is eating "feces" with certain propertie=
s and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Sel=
f and he is eating Self.

  Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions=
 really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean "I=
 am Self and I am consuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may merely b=
e a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, his min=
d may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a =
badly cooked brinjal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver from t=
he focus on the permanent (Self).

  Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are tel=
ling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every t=
hought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation w=
here failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work a=
s an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person=
 who chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and=
 eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb=
 the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the ni=
ce (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big de=
al? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on th=
e taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure res=
ults in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding qu=
ickly.

  However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by ev=
eryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas =
succeeds.

  *        *        *

  Take another simple example. Suppose so=
meone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a wea=
kness for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thou=
ghts in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's =
sadhana.

  A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind=
 away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such t=
houghts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if =
one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination=
 in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome t=
he fascination some minds may have for sex?

  An aghora will take it to an=
 extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the=
 mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one =
pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such disti=
nctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner si=
tting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may =
titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made im=
pure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/yea=
rs. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is =
doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association =
in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pict=
ures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke =
thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly ris=
e in the head may not lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex an=
d distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation=
. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately,=
 the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be b=
roken down. Overall, the person's fascination and weakness for sex may be g=
one largely.

  Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences a=
nd the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down som=
e of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those=
 structures.

  However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is als=
o possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex=
 and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of=
 meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincer=
e/ready to start with.

  *        *        *

  Bottomline is that an agho=
ra takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight wi=
th them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and=
 fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable =
to all.

  *        *        *

  Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what=
 is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to unders=
tand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high stak=
es war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may fee=
l aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based =
on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings. Aghor=
a stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some p=
eople pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Ve=
danta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one abso=
rbs the truth into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant.

  BTW=
, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and e=
xplains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of =
aghora.

          Dear Narasimhagaru,

          Thank you for your reply. 

      =
    I understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Univ=
ersal Mother. But what I am trying to understand is that how to worship bot=
h forms simultaneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gr=
eat composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyaga=
raja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamal=
amba Navavarna Krithis mention great details about all the nine avaranas an=
d different forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana. In=
 the Dhyana Krithi of those, in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambike, =
AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'. That line tells me that even through Sri Vidy=
a one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form. 

          So my question was i=
n that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mention=
ed how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in thos=
e terms. 

          I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get p=
ractise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I =
plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortabl=
e reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my ta=
rget. 

          Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by D=
r. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perh=
aps I need to read more!

            Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performi=

ing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-insp=
iring.

            Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that=
 needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or tw=
o sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the ti=
me between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig=
 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wan=
ts to find water.

            One possibility is to do a homam and then me=
ditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to=
.

            I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from t=
he little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation o=
f the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel t=
he layer of duality and realize Self.

            Lalita means gentle one =
and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gentl=
y, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you=
 will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid pat=

            I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi hom=

do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in s=

20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abh=
ishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to a=

try a 
  ritual where feces is eaten. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=

 and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will 
  be thinking that he is S=

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
</FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Of course, a vedanti=

  Self and I am consuming Self". Neverth=

  ritual and not be fully absorbed in=
 one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may 
  dwell on the impermanant manif=

  incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a=
 person who 
  chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming=
 Self" and eats 
  tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from fail=

 what is the big deal? On the

  <DIV>Take another simple example. Supp=
ose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, 
  like japam and homam, and yet hav=
ing a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is 
  dwelling on sex or getting=
 sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that 
  is causing guilt and =
blocking one's sadhana.</DIV>
  <DIV> </DIV>
  <DIV>A regular person w=
ill try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from 
  sexual thoughts.=
 But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After 
  all, such=
 thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy 
  fo=
r 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not=
 
  return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination som=
e minds 
  may have for sex?</DIV>
  <DIV> </DIV>
  <DIV>An aghora wil=
l take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause 
  and remove fa=
scination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as 
  two diffe=
rent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them 
  int=
o one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits 
=
  naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. =
In 
  the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think tha=
t his 
  sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam=
 like that 
  for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogramme=
d. He may no 
  longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no lo=
nger feel 
  titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and=
 sex may be 
  broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally ma=
y no longer evoke 
  thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any=
 small thoughts related 
  to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not le=
ad to denser and denser 
  thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadh=
ana, but they may now take the 
  mind back to meditation. After spending s=
o much time in meditation while 
  sitting naked intimately, the attraction=
 and thrill mind may feel for 
  nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. =
Overall, the person's fascination 
  and weakness for sex may be gone large=
ly.</DIV>
  <DIV> </DIV>
  <DIV>Mind has a lot of conditioning based o=
n prior experiences and the 
  thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes=
 tries to break down some of these 
  structures by engaging in certain pra=
ctices that undermine those 
  structures.</DIV>
  <DIV> </DIV>
  <DIV=
>However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible 
  t=
hat the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks =

  <DIV> </DIV>Bottom=
line is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses

 a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may

  <DIV> </DIV>Like Manish said in a mail earli=
er, "what is Vedanta and what 
  is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical w=
ay to understand and absorb Vedanta 
  in one's thought process, by setting=
 up a high stakes war plan. However, it is 
  certainly not suitable for al=
l and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, 
  some people may feel att=
raction for it based on a wrong understanding and the 
  thrill such an und=
erstanding brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills 
  nor perversion=
, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or 
  perversion=
. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, 
  but Ag=
hora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking 
  =
by making failure very unpleasant.</DIV>

       <DIV>I understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of =

          the Universal Mother. But what I am trying to understand&nb=
sp;is 
          that how to worship both forms simultaneously. For in=
stance, Sri 
          Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one o=
f the Divine 
          Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and=
 Shyama Sastry), 
          who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Ka=
malamba Navavarna 
          Krithis mention great details about =
all the nine 
          avaranas and different forms of the divine mot=
her as one goes through 
          each avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi&=
nbsp;of those, in the 
          very first line he says, 'Kamalambike=
, AsRta kalpalatike, 
          ChanDike'. That line tells me that&nbs=
p;even through Sri Vidya 
          one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form=
. </DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>

   <DIV>So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a 
 =
         great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by lay=
ers 
          of duality! I never thought in those terms. </DIV>
         =
 <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
          <DIV>I have started =
reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of 
          reading it flu=
ently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan 
          to do dur=

          <DIV>Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. =

            PM<BR><BR>Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,<BR><BR>=
I am very much in awe 
            after I learnt that you do chandi homam =
everyday. You also wrote 
            that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5=
 hours to do your chandi homam. 
            How can you accomplish that fe=
at with 700 ahutis in such a short 
            time? Also, in my case, I d=
o sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 
            minutes)+ganapathi mant=
ra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra 
            Abhishekam with =
pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) 
            totalling to a=
bout 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do 
            special=
 rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 
            hours=
 in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri 
            vidyo=
pasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain 
            w=
hat is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to 
      =
      learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen 
   =
         interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all=
 
            the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar
