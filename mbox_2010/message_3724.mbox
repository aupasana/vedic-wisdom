Namaste,
 
Some qucik points:
 
(1) If you think of your wish in your mind in your mother tongue when taking sankalpa formally, I am sure gods will understand and respond.
 
(2) If you want to formally add it to sankalpa given in homam manuals, please add the following after "prasaada siddhyartham": "G gotrodbhavaayaaH N nakShatre R raashau L lagne jaataayaaH X naamnyaaH aayurvR^iddhyartham aarogyatA siddhyartham" (in iTrans notation). Here G is her gotra, N is nakshatra, R is janma raashi, L is lagna and X is the name.
 
(3) Homam to Shiva using the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra is ideal for this purpose, though you can really do any homam you want. One specific offering is mentioned. Make paayasam (cook rice in milk and ghee, i.e. clarified butter, and add jaggery). Offer darbhas (sacred dry grass) dipped in paayasam with each repetition of the mantra, if possible.
 
(4) The instinct to help someone else and reduce someone else's suffering is a very noble and useful one.
 
However, it is not without its costs. Basically remember that the world runs based on actions and reactions. Any suffering someone is experiencing is a reaction to a previous action committed by that person. If you want to take it on yourself, you will either have to experience the reaction or burn the karma (action) though sadhana, i.e. convert the reaction into something else using some energy.
 
Of course, taking on someone else's suffering and suffering oneself is not easy. So what you are really trying to do is to burn the karma using the energy created by a focused sadhana such as homam or japam. This is akin to someone throwing a ball at a wall and the ball coming at that person fast later and you trying to burn it on the way (using some energy such as heat).
 
The problem is that your sadhana may not succeed in perfectly avoiding the reaction. In other words, the ball that bounced back may not be reduced to ashes fully and some small pieces of the ball may still come and hit that person (or you on his/her behalf). Not being rishis, we cannot perfectly control the dynamics. Think for a moment if you are fine with taking a bit of suffering if needed, as a result of avoiding a major catastrophe for that person.
 
(5) Some learned Adwaitis may correctly say, "all is Brahman. Life and death is the same. Aatman is neither born nor does it die. What is there to worry if someone is suffering or close to death?"
 
However, that is a wrong approach. Both duality and non-duality are valid and true. It is easy to sit on the bank and tell someone drowning in the ocean, "you are ocean are the same. Do not worry". If one is really at a stage where one can think like that even when one is drowning in ocean and not worry, THEN one is a true adwaita jnaani. Otherwise, it is just bookish knowledge and means nothing.
 
Because the world has so many people stuck in the duality (good vs bad, happy vs sad, beautiful vs ugly etc polarities), rishis have given knowledge that helps one swim the ocean of polarities and ultimately realize Self. Merely stating that all is Brahman may not help anybody realize that. Until one realizes that, one needs tools to navigate the ocean of duality.
 
Let me put it this way: When YOU find yourself in various situations that cause pleasure and pain, try to think like an Adwaiti and remind yourself that all is Brahman. When you are dealing with someone else who is in great pain, forget adwaita and try to identify with that person and feel the person's pain. That will not do any harm to your spiritual progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Her mother has been crying a lot ever since.The least I can do is perform homam for her. While mentally I will request god to help her but formally what changes need to be done in the homam manual so that my prayers get directed  towards her.Kindly suggest.
