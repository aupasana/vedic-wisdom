Namaste all,


Can someone please help me on how to overcome the following =
weakness of mine?

How much importance should we give to the cleanliness of=
 the holy places like Haridwar, Varanasi etc? When I visited those places I=
 find it very hard to concentrate on God especially while taking bath in th=
e sacred Ganges. I couldn't bear the scenes of dead bodies floating in the =
river. I am not a yogi to be able to see God even in the trash and garbage =
and my mind is still attached to this physical world. I know how holy those=
 places are but for me cleanliness is very important. How can I change my t=
hinking and get benefited from pilgrimages?


Regards,
Padmaja
