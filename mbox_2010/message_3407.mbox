 ONCE, a tigress attacked a flock of goats. As she sprang on her prey, she
gave birth to a cub and died. The cub grew up in the company of the goats.
The goats ate grass and the cub followed their example. They bleated: the
cub bleated too.

Gradually it grew to be a big tiger. One day another tiger attacked the same
flock. It was amazed to see the grass-eating tiger. Running after it, the
wild tiger at last seized it, whereupon the grass-eating tiger began to
bleat.

The wild tiger dragged it to the water and said: "Look at your face in the
water. It is just like mine. Here is a little meat. Eat it." Saying this, it
thrust some meat into its mouth.

But the grass-eating tiger would not swallow it and began to bleat again.
Gradually, however, it got the taste for blood and came to relish the meat.

Then the wild tiger said: "Now you see, there is no difference between you
and me. Come along and follow me into the forest."

So there can be no fear if the guru's grace descends on one. He will let you
know who you are and what your real nature is.
