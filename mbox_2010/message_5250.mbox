Namaste Sir,
 
You say that "Killing Ravana was not a great deed" and yet l=
ook at "binding the physical body of both Ram and Lakshman" as a "great dee=
d". I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and sympathetic attitu=
tde towards Ravana and his kin. Anyway, I will just make a couple of specif=
ic points on shakti, which is a subtle topic and not easy to understand.
 
=
> On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory.
 
If memory is extended the longest=
, the most fundamental and first memory should say that one is Brahman. If =
one's memory extends that far, that creates the highest Shakti! In other wo=
rds, self-realization brings the highest shakti.
 
> What does the "highest=
 shakti" do ? Compete with lower shakti ?
 
Great question!
 
Any lower sha=
kti is an ability to perform actions with objects in the field of duality. =
Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the field of dua=
lity? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other. But the =
happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field of duality is n=
ot permanent.
 
The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-a=
nanda, which is permanent.
 
When one is pursuing an individual will, one m=
ay be swimming with or against the divine will. One will have some successe=
s and some failures, some pleasures and some pains. When one's individual w=
ill has dropped off and one is flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, =
one is in bliss no matter what one does. One *can* do anything, but one doe=
s only what divine rhythm wills done by one!
 
Only the fully detached Shiv=
a can beget Shakti in totality and demons like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha=
 can only get some trappings of Shakti but can never beget Shakti in totali=
ty.
 
A demon like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a self-rea=
lized rishi. It may seem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi is i=
n bliss whether he is alive or being killed, whether he is at his hermitage=
 or in prison. The happiness demons got from their successes were short-liv=
ed and ended later. But the rishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi's sha=
kti was superior.
 
> Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal =
allies ?
> Instead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones' enemie=
s ?
 
This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in =
the field of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresponsib=
le people, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to =
handle that level of shakti.
 
Yes, if a rishi wanted, he could've summoned=
 Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a rishi is in bliss no =
matter what and does not break divine rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman hav=
e to come to earth and establish certain lessons for future and take care o=
f Ravana, a rishi will let that happen and not do anything hasty.
 
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha

Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was reminded o=
f it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because of the c=
urse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to remember the serie=
s of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of the doe=
r. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by the association w=
ith Rama. Ravana didn't have perfect memory, else he would have attempted t=
