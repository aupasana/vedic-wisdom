Dear KK and All

Thank you very much for agreeing with my small explanation=
 about "test" by Shakthi.
To put more more clearly, one performs the spirit=
ual sadhana keeping in mind=C2=A0 one's
"ishta devata" to enhance one's sou=
l to the higher self.=C2=A0 It is only fringe benefits if one
come across m=
aterialistic benefits in the process.=C2=A0 The main aim and success is onl=
y to enhance one's soul to the higher plane.=C2=A0 Any test or sufferings b=
y the physical body in no way affect the enhancement of the soul.=C2=A0 The=
 physical body suffers because the Karma
one has done.=C2=A0 But it is to b=
e understood, any spritual sadhana has got great potential
not only to enha=
nce the soul; but also bestow the materialistic benefits, just like that.

=
Hence it is absolutely necessary to continue the spiritual process instead =
of diverting the 
energies by thinking about 'test' and 'problems which wil=
l automatically grant the material
benefits also.

With love
SS

I tend to=
 agree with this explanation...in my view..testing a is a very over rated a=
ctivity..i guess since the ultimate goal is to reach the mother/shakti/nara=

the=C2=A0deity=C2=A0is responding and trying to take us there..it is our ow=

many of us can really withstand
 if the deity really wishes to test us...it=
s our our own innate fears of loosing our valued/loved things makes us thin=

Bottomline: probably as what i have understood from N=
arasimha's guidance through this forum is =C2=A0Forget all those fears of t=
est etc..try to develop an attitude to surrender to god as mush as possible=
...everything will be inline...
i'm not sure if i could put across this in =
an appropriate way..but i have attempted.. please correct me if my understa=

      Dear All

According=
 to me, Shakthi worship is the most appropriate for the present day.=C2=A0 =
Our legends say that Devi Parasakthi gives powers to the trinity to perform=
 their duties and she is absolute Power.=C2=A0 Hence Shakthi worship is the=

does not the 'test' by Sakthi as one perceive because, she is the Mother of=
 all and no Mother will 'test' their children.=C2=A0 SHE Loves all and best=

 all
 these.
