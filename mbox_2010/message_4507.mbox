Devotee: According to the Vaishnavite teaching one must do kainka=
ryam or
service to God.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan replied rather sarcastically: =
=E2=80=9CSo God can=E2=80=99t get on without their
services? On the contrar=
y, God asks: =E2=80=98Who are you to do service to Me?=E2=80=99 He
is alway=
s saying: =E2=80=98I am within you; who are you?=E2=80=99 One must try to r=
ealize
that and not speak of service.

Submission or surrender is the basic=
 teaching of Vaishnavism, but it does
not consist in paying a Guru a fee fo=
r initiation and telling him that you
have surrendered. As often as one tri=
es to surrender, the ego raises its
head and one has to try to suppress it.=
Surrender is not an easy thing.

Killing the ego is not an easy thing. It i=
s only when God Himself by His
grace draws the mind inwards that complete s=
urrender can be achieved. But
such grace comes only to those who have alrea=
dy, in this or previous lives,
gone through all the struggles and sadhanas =
preparatory to the extinction of
the mind and killing of the ego.=E2=80=9D
=

Bhagavan added, =E2=80=9CIn the old days these Vaishnavites used to come a=
nd advise
me to undergo a samasanam but I used to keep silent.=E2=80=9D

Bh=
agavan continued to speak of the Dvaitism of the Vaishnavites and quoted
th=
e Nammalvar song the gist of which is: =E2=80=9Cnot knowing myself,I went a=
bout
saying =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99. Then I discover=
ed that =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 was =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=
=80=99 was
=E2=80=98Yours=E2=80=99, oh God.=E2=80=9D

He said: =E2=80=9CThi=
s is clear Advaita, but these Vaishnavites would give it some
interpretatio=
n to make it accord with their feeling of duality.They hold
that they must =
exist and God must exist, but how is that possible? It seems
that they must=
 all remain for ever doing service in Vaikunta, but how many
of them are to=
 do service and where would there be room for all these
Vaishnavites?=E2=80=
=9D

Bhagavan said this laughing, and then, after a pause, he added, =E2=80=
=9COn the
other hand, Advaita does not mean that a man must always sit in s=
amadhi and
never engage in action. Many things are necessary to keep up the=
 life of the
body, and action can never be avoided. Nor is bhakti ruled out=
 in Advaita.

Shankara is rightly regarded as the foremost exponent of Adva=
ita, and yet
look at the number of shrines he visited (action), and the dev=
otional songs
he wrote.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan then gave further quotations fro=
m the eighth decad of Tiruvoimozhi
to show that some of Vaishnavite Alwars =
had clearly endorsed Advaita. He
particularly emphasised the third stanza w=
here it says: =E2=80=9CI was lost in Him
or in That=E2=80=9D and
the fifth,=
 which is very like the Thiruvachagam stanza that says the ego got
attenuat=
ed more and more and was extinguished in the Self.
