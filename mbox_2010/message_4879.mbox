My take is that i agree with narasimha when he says it is a coded stotra co=
ntaining various sadna of various shakti it is not only for normal siddhis =
but also the ultimate samadi and other things what i like to add is practis=
ing kunjika as a sadna will give the sum total of all results got by practi=
sing different parts of saptashati and much more. Further i feel it contain=
s some key without which the mere sadna of saptashati cannot be able to ful=
ly get the  results that saptashati contains :-) so i trust fully on words =
of shiva when he says kunjika on its own gives the full results of saptasha=
ti and also saptashati without kunjika cannot give complete results :-)

 point of view, one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without K=
