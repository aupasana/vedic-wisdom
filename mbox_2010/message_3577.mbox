Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
Thank you for your clarification. I am not too conce=
rned what Joseph is upto...what i was most concerned was what actually was =
the truth. 
=C2=A0
But I am now concerned about one more thing. People like=
 Joseph and those priests who advocate 'conversion' in sanatana dharma - ma=
y be even by a small ritual, a formal 'feel-good' ritual etc...are saying t=
hat these are conversion rituals and Josephs are believing and feeling-good=
 about the same.
=C2=A0
If such things happen without clarity from both the=
 actors to the world at large...then sanatana dharma would be also accused =
of conversion like islam and christainity of conversion (it is immaterial h=
ere how they do it). Every priest who is probably contacted or every 'hindu=
 friend' who probably helps and guides in the proceedings should make it am=
ply clear that first of all there is nothing like conversion in Sanatana Dh=
arma. What the "interested" non-hindus are doing is a simple ritual that ma=
kes him "feel-good" as the end objective is nothing more than that. People =
like Joseph who are already steeped in the religion may not need that as yo=
u have amply made clear.
=C2=A0
Coming to the part of people who have bad q=
ualities or rather...I would put it as one who is so steeped in materialism=
 that even a small bit of spiritual pursuit is out of qusetion or is probab=
ly confused about what to do in terms of that...- shouldn't they be iniitia=
ted first? Or should they be "converted"? - the state that they are in will=
 make them attached more to the symbolic gesture of "conversion" and make t=
hem first a fanatic and then real spiritual...if at all OR such a symbolic =
gesture may just lead to more confusion and they in turn confuse more and m=
ore. The way I perceive...I feel that there would be wrong messaging going =
on, in this case to the world.
=C2=A0
The solution to this problem is that =
the priests can do small formal gestures which are symbolic...without termi=
ng them as "conversion" rituals...because that is what is happening today.=
=C2=A0Only then=C2=A0it is a win-win situation.
=C2=A0

Dear Arunisha,

Let me clarify my thin=
king.

In my view, there is no need for a conversion ceremony. However, if =
a ceremony makes one feel good, I am not against it.

If someone who has be=
en reading scriptures and trying to follow Sanatana dharma for 15 years and=
 doing a mantra 1008 times everyday (like Joseph said below) asks me what c=
eremony he should do to "convert", I will tell him "you are already a Hindu=
, i.e. adherent of Sanatana dharma, and a good one at that. There is no nee=
d to do any ceremony." Even if his name is Joseph and not a Sanskrit name, =
it does not change anything.

However, if the same person has already decid=
ed to do some ceremony and tells me that he is doing so and so ceremony to =
convert, I will only wish him good luck and not admonish him for doing thos=
e ceremonies.

Bottomline is that shastras do not teach any procedures for =
"converting" someone into Hinduism. After all, the question of "conversion"=
 does not arise in "vasudhaiva kutumbakam" philosophy that says that the wh=
ole world is one family! However, some priests may come up with some proced=
ures. Let them do so. Why should we stop them? We do so many things in life=
 that are not really needed. What is the harm in a nice ceremony where a Sa=
nskrit name is formally given and various childhood, teenage and adult sams=
karas are done to an adult symbolically?

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If anybody is t=
hinking of "converting" non-Hindus to sanatana dharma or converting passive=
 Hindus into active Hindus or better Hindus, I can suggest a simple approac=
h. Give a Vaidik/Pouranik mantra (any) to the person, ask him/her to chant =
it everyday and give a nice spiritual book to read. When you find a suitabl=
e person, you can also give a sacred thread, teach Mahaganapathi homam and =
ask the person to do it every day or week.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Please remember=
 one important thing. Supose there is a good Christian or Muslim or Zoroast=
rian or Buddhist who is dedicated to one's religion, who is calm at heart, =
who sees the whole world as a sacred creation of an almighty god (whatever =
the name may be), who sees all beings as embodiments of god and deals with =
them with love and respect, who is very thoughtful and responsible in decid=
ing his own actions and very considerate and forgiving in responding to oth=
er people's actions. Such a person is dhaarmik and a good follower of sanat=
ana dharma despite the name of the religion he follows and the name of the =
god he worships. There is no need to "convert" such a person.

If someone i=
s not as described above and has bad qualities, one can try to convert such=
 a person into one who follows dharma better by either introducing him to t=
he teachings of rishis and well-known practices of "Hinduism" OR simply by =
directing him to the true meaning of the teachings of the messiahs in his o=
wn *formal* religion.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste,

Well, our shastras do not define a religion called "=
Hinduism". Our shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righ=
teous duty. Sanatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to =
"Hindu" parents. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasse=
s every human being whether or not one realizes it!

Some people who consid=
er themselves Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.

There may no=
t be much difference between somebody from another religion with a strong i=
nterest in "Hinduism" and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either =
passive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis.=
 In fact, the former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the l=
atter in some cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to "Hinduism=
", there is no need to convert the former either!

Several ceremonies like =
naamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik matters=
.

In my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by=
 a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of time, and if=
 he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked =
to read it, understand it and let it affect one's thinking, I think one is =
then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. =
There is no need for any ceremonies.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In fact, now there ar=
e some "foreigners" who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishn=
a etc. If anybody thinks they are not "Hindus", one is not thinking straigh=
t. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India who have forgotten their =
dharma.

A braahmana's dharma is to pursue spiritual progress and engage th=
e mind in the god for the benefit of the world. One who does not spend time=
 in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a braahmana. If a fo=
reigner is passionately interested in spiritual progress and does japam or =
homam every day or week for the benefit of the world and one's own spiritua=
l upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.

e,<BR><BR>Well, our shastras do not define a religion called "Hinduism". Ou=
r shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. S=
anatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to "Hindu" paren=
ts. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human=
 being whether or not one realizes it!<BR><BR>Some people who consider them=
selves Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.<BR><BR>There may not=
 be much difference between somebody from another religion with a strong in=
terest in "Hinduism" and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either p=
assive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. =
In fact, the former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the la=
tter in some cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to "Hinduism"=
, there is no need to convert the former
 either!<BR><BR>Several ceremonies=
 like naamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik m=
atters.<BR><BR>In my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik man=
tra (any) by a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of =
time, and if he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc=
) and asked to read it, understand it and let it affect one's thinking, I t=
hink one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanat=
ana dharma. There is no need for any ceremonies.<BR><BR>*   =

BR>In fact, now there are some "foreigners" who perform a homam every weeke=
nd, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they are not "Hindus", one=
 is not thinking straight. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India w=
ho have forgotten their dharma.<BR><BR>A braahmana's dharma is to pursue sp=
iritual progress and engage the
 mind in the god for the benefit of the wor=
ld. One who does not spend time in japam or homam for the benefit of the wo=
rld is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is passionately interested in spirit=
ual progress and does japam or homam every day or week for the benefit of t=
he world and one's own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a=
 Hindu, but also a braahmana.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>--------=
