Namaste everyone,

The current soli-lunar month is Adhika Vaisakha. Now gen=
erally, religious festivals etc. are not observed on adhika months but kept=
 for suddha months.
However, as far as I know, the significance of Akshaya =
Tritiyaa is that the Sun and Moon are both exalted on this day.
Now, would =
the festival be observed today because of the exaltation of the Sun and Moo=
n or would it be observed next month to keep it at the right time in the so=
li-lunar calendar, regardless of the planetary positions?

I have seen the =
latter in calendars but I feel there is something amiss.

Kindly share your=
 views. Thanks.

Warm regards,
Paawan.
