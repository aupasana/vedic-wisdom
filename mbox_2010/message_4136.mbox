For spiritual sadhana, Amavasya is also very good!

Moon is the mana: karak=
a and influences the mood and mind. Normally, the mind is active and jubili=
ant when Moon is strong! So, we can perform activities involving creativity=
 and focus when Moon is strong, i.e. on Full moon days.

if a person enjoys=
 doing sadhana, since Mind is already in joyfull state, it would perhaps co=
operate easily.

No moon day on the other hand is very conducive to severe =
sadhana where sadhaka may experiance situations akin to death of mind. A jo=
yful person is unlikely to submit self to death where as a person in sorry =
state may renounce the world more easily.

Conjuction of Moon with Rahu, Ke=
thu, Mandi, etc. are also good for sadhana.

How ever, the time of the sadh=
ana matters only after we achieve a state where we deserve some experiances=
. As long as we long for them, we won't be ready for them!

Best regards,
V=
ijay
