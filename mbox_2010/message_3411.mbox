Namaste,

Solar eclipse is at Mid-night for US means that it'll not be visi=
ble there. However It is still a great idea to engage in a Spiritual practi=
ce.
It is believed that Eclipse time is not conducive to do Rituals other t=
han Japam, Meditation. Japam is considered best during that time.
Another t=
hing is that Eclipse time is conducive for spiritual upliftment and not at =
all good for any worldly desire so i guess any Sadhana done during that tim=
e must only for selfless reasons without having any other sankalpa. It is p=
ossible though that Sadhana done without any worldly desires may sometimes =
avert or reduce the evil effects (which may have been pre-indicated by astr=
ology) of Grahana on one's worldly life.

I think Narasimha has earlier sta=
ted that Homam can be done during Eclipse time. So you can do either Japam =
or Homam but whatever you do, please forget about any other motive. Japam c=
an be of any mantra and homam can also be of any deity you prefer.

Best re=
gards,

Utpal
