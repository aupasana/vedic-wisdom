Namaste Narasimha, 

1. When the dharma of Rama and Krishna is to eliminate=
 bad weeds and establish dharma, why did they send peace proposals to Ravan=
a and Dritarashtra? 
=A0
Why did Rama and Krishna try to bring about transf=
ormation in Ravana/Dritarashtra=A0by peaceful means rather than waging a wa=
r? The reason for asking this questions is, India is culturally influenced =
by these deeds. We try to make peace even when the right solution is otherw=
ise..example Prithviraj freeing Gori and then inturn getting killed by him =
and many more. 
=A0
2. After Vibishana is crowned King (before the death of=
 Ravana)=A0by Rama, Sugriva asks Rama, "what if Ravana surrenders to you no=
w"? Since you have already given the Lanka kingdom to Vibishana, what would=
 you do? To which Rama replies, he would crown Ravana the king of Ayodhya!
=
Hypothetically, if this had happened, would this have been a right dharma o=
n Rama's part?=A0This is quite contradictory=A0as=A0honour and word=A0more =
important here=A0than dharma, negating dharma sansthapana verse.
=A0
3. Whe=
n kaikeyi requests Dasaratha to order Rama into exile, from Rama's perspect=
ive, it's correct because his dharma is to to go forest and bring peace and=
 integrate but from Dasaratha's perspective, it's the word that he has give=
n to wife that is given due importance than an eligible son ruling the king=
dom of Ayodhya. Again here, the importance of sticking to one's word that i=
s "Said" (giving a=A0promise to Kaikeyi)=A0is given priority over the impor=
tance of the word/thought that is '"unsaid" (making Rama the king)
In vedan=
tic paradigm, even a thought that is in the mind is said to have caused a K=
arma to one (provided one associates sense of agency "I" to the action, whi=
ch is here a thought). If so, eventhough he has kept up the promise (extern=
al), he has failed to keep up the promise that is unsaid. 
So, how is it th=
at Dasaratha has honored on his word?
=A0
May be these questions show that =
I am not=A0maintaining my discipline in=A0my spiritual sadhana but since th=
ese questions are causing lot of confusion to me, I had to post it on this =
forum, which has been a source of inspiration to me. 

Thanks & Regards,

Namaste friends,

People normal=
ly start doing rituals like homam/japam hoping for relief from specific per=
sonal problems. As their thinking evolves, they think of the world instead =
of their own problems.

Just a word on "peace around the world"..

Peace is=
 a great ideal, but sometimes long-lasting peace requires chaos and destruc=
tion in the short-term. Rama did not make peace with Ravana, but killed him=
 in a war and that brought peace in the world.

We should pray for "dharma"=
 in the world instead of "peace". If dharma is not there, peace will be sho=
rt-lived.

Best regards,
Narasimha
