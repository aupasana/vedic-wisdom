Dear Sri Narasimha garu,
While going through the PDF files regarding the pi=
tri tarpana, 
its mentioned about poorva janma mother,father,brothers,gurus=
,wife,sons,etc.tarpana also.
Does it lead to doing tarpana for all or a few=
 of them if needed in case of pitru shrapa dosha,matru shrapa dosha and sim=
ilarly bhatru shrapa,stree shrapa, Guru shrapa dosha and so on.
Can these t=
arpanas be done collectively or singularly according to the shrapa dosha pr=
esent in a horroscope.Like if some one having matru shrapa or bhatru shrapa=
 or stree shrapa ......in their jatakam can they choose a particular mantra=
 from those tarpanas and get relief.
IF YES then can you please guide about=
 the procedure and for how many days to be done so that the particular tarp=
ana for the concerned soul/souls in the present life or previous life accor=
ding to the shrapa dosha present in the jatakam.
Please advise.

Regards,
R=
aghunath
