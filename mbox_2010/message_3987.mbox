Just wanted to share a link I posted: www.ambahouse.org 

This is an excell=
ent website hosted by Vasanti Jayaswal (http://en.allexperts.com/e/v/va/vas=
anthi_jayaswal.htm)

The site offers detailed lessons on Ganapati Atharvash=
irsha , Shri Suktam, Shri Rudram, etc...It is especially helpful for us who=
 are struggling with Samskrit and knowing the deep meanings of the mantras.=


Vastantiji humbly hosts the site and you can freely write questions about=
 courses or upasana to her. 

Regards,
Puneet
