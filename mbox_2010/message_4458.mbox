WHENEVER Sri Bhagavan was asked about the problem of suffering, he suggeste=
d
a method to eliminate it. Most others trim the branches. Sri Bhagavan
tac=
kled the root of the problem. He said that whatever be the gravity of the
s=
uffering, we are not aware of it in deep sleep. When we have a terrible
too=
thache, we can.t think of anything except the pain. But the pain is not
fel=
t in deep sleep. In deep sleep, we are not conscious of the body and
hence =
there is no pain. When the mind merges in the Self, there is no
body-consci=
ousness and therefore there is no pain.Sri Bhagavan says:
.Physical pain on=
ly follows body-consciousness. It cannot be in the absence
of body-consciou=
sness and pleasures.Pains are dependent on the ego; they
cannot be without =
the .I. but the .I. can remain without them.

Even ordinarily, we notice th=
at our pain is related to the attitude of our
mind. When we have some acute=
 pain, and a person we like walks in, our pain
is relieved to some extent. =
When a person we dislike walks in, our pain
becomes worse. In other words, =
our pain increases or decreases according to
the state of our mind at a par=
ticular moment. Sri Bhagavan asks us to remove
the mind altogether so that =
we won.t feel the pain at all. He says:
.Therefore turn inwards and seek th=
e Self and there will be an end both of
the world and its miseries.. When b=
ody-consciousness goes, suffering
goes. Prayer
is good in that it makes us =
lose ourselves in the contemplation of the
Supreme Being. When the mind is =
lost in contemplation, there is considerable
reduction in pain. But prayer =
will not remove suffering totally. The
individual will feel the suffering w=
hen his mind is not at prayer. Puja,
japa, and prayer are all good in that =
they take our mind off our suffering
for a while.

While they are all good =
as a temporary measure, removal of suffering is
possible only through elimi=
nation of body-consciousness. Sri Bhagavan says:
.If one remains free from =
pain thus, there won.t be any pain anywhere. The
trouble now is due to your=
 seeing the world outside yourself and thinking
there is pain in it. But bo=
th the world and the pain are within you; if you
turn inward, there will be=
 no pain...

To the charge that those who eliminate suffering thus are self=
ish and do not
worry about others, Sri Bhagavan says: .The world is not ext=
ernal to you.
Because you wrongly identify yourself with the body, you see =
the world
outside you and its suffering becomes apparent to you; but the wo=
rld and its
sufferings are not real. Seek the reality and get rid of this u=
nreal
feeling.. The understanding of oneself is the ending of suffering.The=

question of selfishness doesn.t arise as in that state, only the Self will=

be seen in everybody and everything.

But Sri Bhagavan doesn.t say we shou=
ld be indifferent to the sufferings of
others. So long as we have body-cons=
ciousness, we shall be conscious of our
sufferings and those of others and =
would be interested in removing them.
Compassion is really .your pain in my=
 heart.. When we remove the sufferings
of others, we become less .me.-cente=
red. But in this way, we cannot remove
all the pain in the world. As pain i=
s dependent on the ego, Sri Bhagavan
suggests the removal of the ego; pain =
will also disappear.

This is not just theory. Sri Bhagavan exemplified wha=
t he said. When he had
cancer, he behaved as if it belonged to another. He =
was as serene as ever
and gave darshan to all till the very end. There wasn=
.t a trace of pain on
his face. His detachment from the body was total.
