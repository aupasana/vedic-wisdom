Dear Satya Prakash Ji,

I have read this several times in Siva Purana and e=
ven in the Aghora series of 
books that a mantra might not have any effect =
until siddhi is attained of the 
same which happens as a result of initiati=
on or by following disciplines 
required for siddhi for the specific mantra=
. Every mantra it seems may have a 
different requirement for attaining sid=
dhi.If you could share your insight=C2=A0on 
that as well.

Thanks,
Bhupend=
ra

=C2=A0 

Namaste,

Thanks for the feedback=
. I have just now finished typing a long post on another 
thread. However I=
 will address both your questions in another post hopefully 
within a week =
or so at the earliest that I can. I will also elaborate a little 
more on t=
he role of intiation in mantramarga. Except for mantra sadhana, 
initiation=
 is not a mandatory requirement in any other form of sadhana. It is a 
diff=
erent matter though that the idea has been appropriated by practitioners 
s=
tudying even predominantly secular disciplines such as music, dance, astrol=
ogy 
etc, causing a lot of unwanted and unhealthy confusion. No doubt, spir=
itualising 
these secular subjects makes them more wonderful and inspiring.=
 It is the false 
pretense of certain unscrupulous self-proclaimed gurus of=
 material vidyas that I 
am cautioning against. It is mantra sadhana alone =
as enjoined by the Tantras 
that requires initiation. Nowhere else is it a =
requirement. I will deal with the 
rest in my next post.

Regards,
Satya Pr=

>Namaste,<BR><BR>Thanks for the feedback. I have just now finished typing a=
 long post on another thread. However I will address both your questions in=
 another post hopefully within a week or so at the earliest that I can. I w=
ill also elaborate a little more on the role of intiation in mantramarga. E=
xcept for mantra sadhana, initiation is not a mandatory requirement in any =
other form of sadhana. It is a different matter though that the idea has be=
en appropriated by practitioners studying even predominantly secular discip=
lines such as music, dance, astrology etc, causing a lot of unwanted and un=
healthy confusion. No doubt, spiritualising these secular subjects makes th=
em more wonderful and inspiring. It is the false pretense of certain unscru=
pulous self-proclaimed gurus of material vidyas that I am cautioning agains=
t. It is mantra sadhana alone as enjoined by the Tantras that requires init=
iation. Nowhere else is it a requirement. I will deal with the
 rest in my =
next post.<BR><BR>Regards,<BR>Satya Prakash <BR><BR>--- In <A href=3D"mailt=

 of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various par=

 <BR>> required for not only the parayana but also (mostly?)
 because of=
 the main <BR>> mantra. Normally we are accustomed with only the navarna=
 mantra, but there are <BR>> various other mantras of the different aspe=
cts of the Universal Chandi, of which <BR>> the navarna we know of, is p=

there are many paths for <BR>> >sadhana. But in the current context o=
f this question I will restrict myself to <BR>> >only the five that a=
re relevant to the discussion.<BR>> > <BR>> >
 a. Gnana marga (=
Advaitic/Vedantic)<BR>> > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)<BR>> &g=

 paths EMPHASISES particular methods and <BR>> >techniques in its att=

vel. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by=
 <BR>> >each of these paths.<BR>> > For those who are predomina=
ntly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking <BR>> >even the ext=

ta <BR>> >emphasises the methods of Viveka
 (Discernment) and Vichara=
 (self-reflection). <BR>> >Advaita being essentially a culmination of=
 the Vaidik system it has retained the <BR>> >vaidik practice of 'Swa=
dhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important <BR>> >prac=
tice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a margina=
l <BR>> >role for external practices.<BR>> > <BR>> > Yoga=
 marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and <BR>&g=
t; >Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga a=
dditionally <BR>> >emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself to=

f Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they <BR>> >subscribe to =

hasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's <BR>> >will through tota=

 contrary the emphasis in <BR>> >K=
arma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in acti=
ons <BR>> >without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma=

antric path of mantra sadhana where alone the <BR>> >inevitable neces=
sity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. <BR>> >=
;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths via =
the <BR>> >energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It pres=
upposes certain <BR>> >dangers inherent to any lab experiment and the=
reby certain regulations and safe <BR>> >practices. It should be reme=
mbered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke <BR>> >Fire or Agni=
 at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the <BR>> &=
gt;reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that =
invoke <BR>> >Agni,
 one path invokes/employs the fire of the intelle=

 and yet another the physical fire of the <BR>> >Yagnya and so on.<BR=

re of Vak through the <BR>> >lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since T=

 about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to <=

riment too. However the lab is one's own consciousness <BR>> >whilst =
the experiment is
 awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness =
<BR>> >(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic =
for mere <BR>> >intellectualisation, I will refrain from further disc=

too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the <BR>> >Tantric conte=
xt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas <BR>> >comp=
rehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are <BR>&g=
t; >full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, =
Srikula and <BR>> >Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kaliku=
la whilst Sri Vidya sadhana <BR>> >belongs to Srikula. Just to make t=
he picture
 more complete the Vajrayanas among <BR>> >the Buddhists (=
!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan <BR>> =
>Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Va=
jrayana <BR>> >shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta =
sadhanas in its approach <BR>> >to sadhana.<BR>> > <BR>> >=
; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at a=
ll) <BR>> >while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the=
 major milestones in <BR>> >the internal spiritual journey. The yantr=
a, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all <BR>> >consistently of a particu=
lar set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these <BR>> >three l=
ineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a <B=

para can be <BR>> >compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at =
the
 root from where the trunk <BR>> >arises. Each branch and sub-bra=

ividual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. <BR>&g=
t; >Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It =
is held by <BR>> >the Tantric advocate that initiation not only compl=

also prevents short circuit. Imagine many <BR>> >beautiful bulbs/ligh=
ts at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where <BR>> >th=
ere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =

 that =

 its central me=

reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional =
<BR>> >language is because understanding the meaning and constant ref=

writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic <BR>> >and Yogic text t=
oo apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri <BR>> &=
gt;Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as
 the Veda Samhita, espe=
cially <BR>> >the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of =
Veda mantras or the Veda <BR>> >Samhita are equally possible with Sri=
 Sri Chandi and hence the practice of <BR>> >Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone w=
ho is acquainted with the original Vedic method will <BR>> >straighta=

the Hindu temple.<BR>> > <BR>> > Just as some practitioners do =
the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi <BR>> >sadhana in acc=
ordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the <BR>>=

 mandatory if one adopts the Vedant=
