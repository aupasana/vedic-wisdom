Narasimhagaru,

Thanks for the reply. By saying homams for Gayatri and Kart=
ikeya, what I meant is with separate invocatory mantras etc. I do usually o=
ffer Gayatri mantra in other homas that I do anyway.=C2=A0

   =
   
      
      Namaste,

 

(1) If a mantra already has swaahaa at the en=
d, there is no need to add another swaahaa in homam.

 

(2) Yes, one can d=
o Gayatri homam using Gayatri mantra. Homam can also be done with several m=
antras of Kartikeya. A simple pournaanika mantra that is quite powerful is =
Subrahmanyashtakam. Homam can done by offering 8 aahutis with 8 verses and =
repeating as many times as one wants. The simple shadakshari mantra (OM sha=
ravaNa bhava) can used or the corresponding naama mantra (OM sharavaNa bhav=
aaya namaH) can be used. Another variation is "OM shaM raM vaM NaM bhaM vaM=
 sharavaNa bhavaaya namaH".

 

(3) I have not seen the videos.

 

Best re=
gards,

Narasimha
