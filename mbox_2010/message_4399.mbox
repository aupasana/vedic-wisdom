Pranam Narsimha ji,

if someone is doing a Maha Ganapati Homam in the na=
tural setting like in outdoors or some temples do we need to do Kilana? if =
not then when is the requirement to do Kilana before doing the homam?
Do we=
 have different mantras for Kilanas for different deities?

Although speaki=
ng from practical experiences and not just out of emotions ... at anytime j=
ust chanting or even praying : saying * Jai Manish *  helps me to face any =
critical situations which i come across almost daily .. yet i am eager to k=
now in details about Kilana !

regards, 

Sayantan


Jai Shree Ram...
