Subject: How to Remove Self Identification??

Namaskaram Narasimhaji and others,
I have a question which has been troubli=
ng my mind for some time now. I tried to do self introspection but have bee=
n unable to get an answer.
Let me give you an incident to serve as a starti=
ng point.

I was driving my car through a congested lane in Pune during one=
 of my trips to the local market and a rickshaw driver suddenly took a wron=
g turn and we almost collided. Now I just ignored the incident but this dri=
ver stopped the vehicle at a traffic junction and got into a verbal duel wi=
th me and not to be held back I too responded and was almost ready to excha=
nge physical blows with him. But we later went our ways once the traffic si=
gnal turned green.

After this incident I remained angry till late evening.=
 Thinking of the incident and replaying the events again and again in my mi=
nd and also imagining giving a few punches on the rickshaw drivers face :) =
:).

When I did introspection of the incident a few days later with a calm =
mind , I questioned the need for me to become angry ? What a waster of time=
 and energy has this been?
Why did "I" get angry when the driver abused me =
verbally ??
Why should "I" get offended by anything that any one says to "m=
e"?
Has the driver really offended the real "ME"?

If NOT then what is that=
 which makes me or any other human being angry??
I was reminded of Shankara=
's Manishaa Panchakam and his encounter with a chandala in KAshi.
The chand=
ala asked shankara 
"O great ascetic! Tell me . Do you want me to keep a di=
stance from you, by uttering 'go away' 'go away' taking me to be an outcast=
e ?
Is it addressed from one body made of food to another body made of food=
,or is it consciousness from consciousness | which, O, the
best among ascet=
ics, you wish should go away, by saying
"Go away, go away"? Do tell me."

W=
hat can we do to remove this self identification that every person has with=
 his mortal body?
I think this self identification is the root cause which =
prevents a person from moving ahead.
Please tell me how I can dissolve this=
 "Self" so that I no longer identify with it?
I know sadhana is the key and=
 I have been doing it . But the shackles are strong. The Ego of "I" has to =
die for us to move ahead. But how??

Regards,
Girish Sundaram
