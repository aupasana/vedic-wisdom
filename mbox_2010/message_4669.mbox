 My father Srinivasa Iyer was a lawyer in the High Court. My mother passed
=
away when I was very young. My father left my younger sister, Shantabai,
wi=
th his sister-in-law Azhagulakshmi who was settled in Tiruvannamalai. When
=
my sister was four years old she was afflicted with polio. My father took
h=
er to Madras and put her under the care of an expert Ayurvedic doctor who
t=
reated her for six months. After this she was able to walk aided by a
speci=
ally designed brace.

My aunt and my father took Shantabai to Bhagavan and =
tearfully told Bhagavan
that thereafter the child was his and that he shoul=
d look after her. At that
time she was just four. Bhagavan blessed her and =
told my father not to worry
about her future, that she would marry at the a=
ge of eighteen and prosper in
life. Although these comforting words of Bhag=
avan soothed my father yet he
had his doubts.

My sister was again left wit=
h my aunt at Tiruvannamalai. She would visit
Bhagavan daily and play there.=


Once there was a cry from the garden and Bhagavan said, "It is Shantabai'=
s
voice," and sent someone to fetch her. My sister was reeling with pain. S=
he
came to Bhagavan crying and said that a bee had stung her hand. Bhagavan=

took her hand and caressed it. Immediately the pain of the sting vanished.=


Being innocent the child told Bhagavan, "Why did you make me cry so long?=
 If
you had wanted it you could have stopped it then and there." My Aunt wh=
o was
there at the time was shocked at the audacity of my sister's complain=
t.
However, Bhagavan smilingly asked what she had done to the bee before it=

stung her? She said that she was pelting stones at the mangoes and one of
=
the stones disturbed the bee. Bhagavan smilingly said to her, "You see, the=

stone you threw hurt the bee and so it stung you. So hereafter never harm
=
anyone." Young as she was she understood what Bhagavan meant and thereafter=

never hurt any living being. Later, whenever she recalled this incident, s=
he
felt grateful to Bhagavan for giving her this lesson on non-violence.

L=
ater on, as Bhagavan predicted, when Shantabai turned eighteen a boy came
f=
rom Trichy and after seeing her insisted that he would marry only this
girl=
. The marriage went off well and her husband was very kind to her. She
felt=
 that it was all due to Bhagavan's blessing.

Once when my sister was about=
 nine she was in Madras. Suddenly she started
crying and came and told my f=
ather, "Father! Bhagavan appeared to me and
took leave of me, saying, `Chil=
d! I am leaving the world but I will always
be with you. So do not worry'."=
 Hearing this my father slapped her for
uttering these inauspicious words. =
But my sister kept on sobbing and refused
to have her dinner at night.

Ear=
ly in the morning my father opened the newspaper and there the
Mahasamadhi =
of Bhagavan was reported. Only then did my father realise the
purport of my=
 sister's words and realising that she had the blessings of
Bhagavan he nev=
er scolded her again.
