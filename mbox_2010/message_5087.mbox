Namaste Narasimha,

Dr. Satya Prakash has stressed on following Lines lines=
:
[
Those who are not initiated
but still wish to benefit from Chandi sadha=
na can follow the same procedure except that they
may read the translated s=
tory in English or any other language as a spiritual practice. Even
the myt=
h itself is very powerful and therapeutic. Those who are not initiated can =
devoutly
read the myth and chant the Saptashloki. The Goddess will shower H=
er grace on those who
do this with faith.
]

Would you please explain, why =
Non-initiated aspirants Must read Translation and not Sanskrit verses (If I=
 understood the above correctly). What is this Initiation in the first plac=
e. I really wish to know this "Initiation" thing.
