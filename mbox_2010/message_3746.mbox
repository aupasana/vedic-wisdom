NAMASKAR

Dear Gurujis,

Beautiful story to read, he is blessed by the divi=
ne force as well as guided by the god too(with my limited knowledge as I kn=
ow!), everything as well as astrology works here, guided by god, so why not=
 we try to use such fruits of astrology for ourselves? 

well this is not a=
 astrology forum, however sometimes interrelated with spirituality...so we =
can use astrology for our spiritual progress too...gurujis should consider =
this, allow natives at some points atleast for spiritual progress(if possib=
le!)

If possible, we should cultivate astrology in limited scale (just lik=
e examples of great saints) only for spiritual progress (if P.V.R add some =
clause for violation overrule:) 

P.V.R, Please think seriously...

best re=
gards,
Biswajit
