So=
me pseudo-vedantins may indeed say that the physical body is an illusion an=
d that it should be ignored. But you are going to the other extreme when su=
ggesting that physical immortality is the highest ideal. Neither viewpoint =
is correct.
 
*        *        *
 
Ignoring the views of a stereotypical p=
sudo-vedantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physic=
al body is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical=
 body and we are something else residing in a shell called the physical bod=
y. What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physi=
cal body may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physica=
l body, one cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the ph=
ysical body to eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere=
 intellectual statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that =
action (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird of =
individualized consciousness flies into the sky of self-realization. Physic=
al body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to pe=
rform the *right actions* that can free one.
 
As I said earlier, one perfo=
rming actions without correct knowledge (that god is the doer of all action=
s!) is like a person who is walking around a mountain not realizing that th=
e goal of walking is to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking fore=
ver and not reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowle=
dge but not performing actions is like someone who knows that reaching the =
top of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top, without walki=
ng. Such a person will remain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and=
 karma alone are not able to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares th=
em to two wings of a bird. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge i=
s what takes us towards liberation.
 
*        *        *
 
Physical bodies=
 of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries o=
r millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. Someone m=
entioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn't he?
 
Actually, to =
a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortality will soun=
d silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modifications such a=
s physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A siddha, as =
long as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in an individu=
alized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical b=
ody. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the et=
hereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So, wh=
at is the whole point of physical immortality?
 
Trilinga Swami (aka Telang=
 Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda.=
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varanasi that Trilinga=
 Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dakshineshwar and t=
aught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a =
grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big container=
 full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his imprisonment by the Br=
itish (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some guards to be in his=
 cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the same time. Even w=
hen he finally decided to give up his body and his disciples put his body i=
n a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after a few minutes to =
walk on the other side.
 
To a realized being with a high enough command ov=
er duality, creation and destruction of physical body is not a big deal.
 
=
One who thinks that a gold coin is special and needs to be preserved foreve=
r will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold coin, a gold chain, =
a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically the same (gold) can melt =
the coin and recreate it again. Preserving the coin forever is an irrelevan=
t goal.
 
*        *        *
 
The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did n=
ot get those abilities because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them spe=
cifically.
 
The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non-du=
al Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the same. But, if o=
ne retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with the field of dua=
lity, different possibilities are there. One may engage in various actions =
using a physical body and at the end drop the ego-consciousness and merge i=
n Brahman. Or, one may engage in various actions using a physical body, the=
n give it up and tie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and remain i=
n a higher realm for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physical body f=
rom time to time. But, all this is governed by one's caliber and evolution =
in the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual level, di=
fferent beings have different caliber in the field of duality. A rishi or V=
ishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the same as somebody else.
 
*     =
   *        *
 
I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerabl=
e to misinterpretation when it comes to divinization of matter. I say quite=
 emphatically that physical immortality as an ideal and as the end goal of =
one's sadhana is a dangerous idea.
 
The only worthy goal is to efface indi=
vidual ego, realize Self and, if needed, engage with the world with a subtl=
e ego and do whatever comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is ove=
rcome, Nature starts to show one the role one has to play. One should just =
play the role given to one well, instead of asking for this role or that ro=
le.
