<p>Namaste,=
<br><br>Two points:<br><br>(1) A mother may sense that a child is about to =
catch cold and she may prepare a bitter medicine for the child to suppess c=
old in the early stage. Unaware of Mother's thinking, child may ask for=
 Kaju katli and may suffer with cold and cough for several days.<br>
<br>In=
stead of trying to get specific results, the best approach is to leave it t=
o Him/Her and do homam/japam without any specific desires. Instead of being=
 an older child who knows a lot of things and has to fend for himself, be a=
 small child who does not know much and who depends on parents.<br>
<br>Thi=
s simple approach will optimize the results you get from your sadhana. Some=
times (many times) what you want may not be the right thing for you. God is=
 the Director with the full script of the movie in hand, while we are two c=
ent actors who act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of =
the movie. Why not leave it to the Director, instead of taking charge and t=
rying to dictate how a particular scene should be handled, when we know not=
hing about the whole movie and how our character fits in the whole script?<=
br>
<br>(2) Shastras do prescribe specific materials for specific results. =
However, I suggest that it is not so simple as offering a specific material=
. Offering a specific material is only one aspect in getting a result.<br><=
br>
Just for reference, I will mention a few things given in shastras.<br><=
br>* * *<br><br>For getting money, use the leaves of bilva (bel) tree. To e=
xtend longevity, use darbhas (sacred grass). For getting physical strength,=
 use the canes of vetas (rattan palm or Calamus rotang) tree. For getting m=
arried and marital bliss, use parched rice. For getting a child, use the se=
eds of shaali tree (also known as kaalonji or krishna jeera or black cumene=
 seeds). For cattle and well-being, use ghee. For knowledge, use the wood o=
f Palaasha tree (palash/modugu/Butea monosperma). For success in agricultur=
e, use barley grains. For overcoming enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti=
-cholesterol properties in ayurveda). For good health, use sesame seeds - w=
hite for mental (and spiritual) health and black for physical. For general =
happiness and prosperity, use various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc.=
 For good relations and attracting others, use the flowers or seeds of daad=
imi (anaar/daanimma/pomegranate).<br>
<br>Similarly, Shiva taught Parvati s=
pecific materials for the six activities: shaanti (peace-making), stambhana=
 (paralyzing), maarana (killing), uchchaatana (explusion), vashikarana (cre=
ating attraction between people) and vidveshana (creating hatred between pe=
ople). For example, one can use darbha (sacred grass) dipped in ghee made w=
ith cow's milk for shanti (peace-making). These activities (other than =
peace-making) entail bad karma and not for normal sadhakas. These activitie=
s are justified only when a highly elevated sadhaka performs them for the g=
reater good of the world. So I will not even mention those specific materia=
ls.<br>
<br>* * *<br><br>The art of getting specific results through ritual=
s has almost disappeared and will become more extinct as time passes. Withi=
n Kali yuga, we are entering a renewal/redefinition phase where knowledge w=
ill be re-established for the upcoming phase of further decay of dharma. Th=
ere will be re-establishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, but with =
focus on setting rules and procedures that will be the guiding light for th=
e next 1-2 thousand years when dharma will decay more. In that upcoming pha=
se of decay, this art will become even more extinct and the ground will be =
(is being) set. <br>
