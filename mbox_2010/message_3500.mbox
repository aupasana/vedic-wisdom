Dear Acharyulu,
=C2=A0
Let me try again. Please understand that my understa=
nding of these matters maybe entirely flawed. I have as much clue about the=
se things as probably you have. Remember, I am merely a cronicler.
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
Then, who is the highest God?
=C2=A0
Often a=C2=A0deity may=C2=A0man=
ifest in different cultures and people may look at it differently. In ancie=
nt Egypt, Sekhmet was a warrior Goddess who rode a lion, the cult of Sekhme=
t worshippers were similar to the Shaktas of India. But that is at the real=
m of deities. 
=C2=A0
A Yaksha or a Yakshni is much lower than a deity. It =
is not a self realized being though it has a far higher energy than an aver=
age human being.=C2=A0It has - I believe - its own conditionings. 
=C2=A0
D=
id Manish Ji tell anything about not choosing that place and chosen other e=
nd of the shamshan. 
=C2=A0
Firstly, by no means should one mistake these m=
ails to be a comprehensive guide book of such sadhanas. It is merely to sho=
w people that these are possible. 
=C2=A0
The fire where the bull was stand=
ing had some water puddle=C2=A0nearby. Also, its position was inconvenient =
to sit at. Manish said as one does more of these sadhanas, when one enters =
a samshan one gets some hint of which chita is the most suitable. 
=C2=A0
J=
ust=C2=A0by reading=C2=A0these accounts, by itself no one can do this sadha=
na. However what one can possibly do is to do some sadhana in whatever cond=
ition he or she=C2=A0is in. As Narasimha says, do a homa, do japa, do kirta=
n, anything.=C2=A0THAT is the key.

Dear Rajarshi Ji,

=C2=A0 Thanks indeed for the reply. O.K. I unders=
tand that the Yakshas / Mokuls/ Angels are all different beings altogether =
as you have said.... that leads me to more confusion about oneness of God. =
Then, who is the highest God?

=C2=A0 Also, I have another query about the =
presence of the "Mighty Bull". Did Manish Ji tell anything about not choosi=
ng that place and chosen other end of the shamshan. My query is when Manika=
rnika was entirely protected by Shiva as it was revealed by Manish Ji , wha=
t was it causing this situation wherein you felt uncomfortable and Manish J=
i lead you to the other end of the Shamshan. 

=C2=A0 Thank you very much i=
n advance for answering the query which lead me to more profound confusion.=
 Thanks again,

Acharyulu

N=
amaste Acharyulu,
=C2=A0
I can only take a guess at replying to this. What =
I say may or maynot be correct.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Generally, what is called a Y=
aksha/Yakshini, an Angel in Christianity and a Mokul in Islam, are beings o=
f similar potential.=C2=A0 In different religions, we will find that the de=
scriptions of different planes like heaven and hell are provided differentl=
y, and it is not just people who reach=C2=A0there after death, but there ar=
e beings in different realms who are born in these planes and exist their i=
n totality. If they were all equal, why are descriptions provided of these =
places different in different cultures? Maybe because, in the world of dual=
ity there is much more than what meets the five human senses. 
=C2=A0
The m=
ind that we have, may not end when the body ends, similar at the different =
realms there could well be a similar operating software (like our human min=
d) through which things are percieved and things appear as diverse or more =
than what we experience in this realm. The world of duality is indeed compl=
ex. Often what happens in this plane has a precursor in the astral worlds, =
good or bad, it is said. Aurobindo mentions this in his writings clearly. S=
o it is possible that there are ethereal beings in different realms who sel=
f identify with different astral aspects of our world.=C2=A0Bottomline, the=
 world of duality is immensely complex.=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I am not sure if=
 it answers your query apty, but I just gave it a honest shot.
