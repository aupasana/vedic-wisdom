Namaste =
narasimha Rao ji=C2=A0


What you have mentioned about not needing to under=
stand Sanskrit text is interesting. I would like to narrate my experience a=
nd hopefully you can help me out regarding what happened.


For nearly 2 yr=
s, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning, because I was not very fluen=
t, I would pay attention to the pages I was reading. As months passed by, I=
 could chant without reading, I remembered it all in my head. What happened=
 as a result was that Rudram chanting no longer required any focus on my pa=
rt, I could be doing anything while chanting this and as a result, my chant=
ing began to lose focus. While chanting, my eyes would be paying attention =
to other things...the view outside the window, the clock, ghee left in the =
diya etc. My attention was everywhere else except on my chanting. I would t=
ry to chant with my eyes closed but because I was chanting aloud, doing tha=
t was proving difficult...my eyes would keep opening and rover. I also noti=
ced that because I didn't understand what I was chanting, concentrating bec=
ame even more difficult.


Today, I am no longer doing that chanting. I sto=
pped doing that several months ago and Iam afraid that the skill I had mast=
ered in chanting is slowly getting lost....


I repeated the same with Durg=
a suktam. While I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chanting.=
 As I became fluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue what=
 I was chanting.


My sadhana is more simple now, consisting of mental mant=
ra recitation but to me, it feels much more better doing that than chanting=
 something I do not understand.


After reading your message, I am wonderin=
g why the words of rishis, the Rudram or the Suktam did not translate into =
energy for me. Please do not misunderstand, I am not trying to question you=
, I am just trying to find an answer to something that keeps troubling me.

Thanks,
Bhupendra

Namaste friends,

I wil=
l give my 2 cents on a few points.

* * *

I once wanted to translate Devi =
Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in poetic form, so that Telugu peop=
le who find Saptashati too complicated to read or feel uncomfortable becaus=
e they do not know the meaning, can read the Telugu version instead. When I=
 floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, "who do you think yo=
u are?" He said that it could be considered later, but firmly told me to dr=
op the idea for then.

Please note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam,=
 meditation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual unde=
rstanding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel=
 its energy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and =
sadhakas, who used them in the past.

An intellectual understanding may hel=
p facilitate the right mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, ev=
en without it, a mantra that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis h=
olds power.

In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually u=
nderstand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a=
 normal person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I=
 suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sans=
krit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.

* * *

If I were to =
give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of sc=
holarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of=
 the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to pl=
ay it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back fo=
ot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one pract=
ices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding =
of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more important than b=
ookish knowledge.

Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in=
 spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more important.

The essence=
 of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. It=
 is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing things and realiz=
e that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each bein=
g based on one's conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes t=
hrough the cycle until one overcomes the notions of "I am doing", "this is =
mine", "I like this and I dislike that" etc. Though this is the essence of =
all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There =
is no magic formula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome th=
e instincts of "I am doing", "this is mine" etc.

So, even if one practices=
 a mantra that one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. As long =
as the basic essence of scriptures is at the back of one's mind, one is con=
stantly contemplating and watching over one's own thoughts and instincts, t=
o root out undesirable thoughts, one's sadhana will yield results.

* * *

=
This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read script=
ures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or vi=
rtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a th=
eoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of one=
's instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.

One doing sad=
hana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and what we =
want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of climbing=
 it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical understanfi=
ng, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but kee=
ps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.

* * *

Regarding the st=
atement that initiation is important in tantric path but not in Vedic path,=
 I want to add my 2 cents.

Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distin=
ct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccura=
te notions today.

The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is o=
ne's attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material resul=
ts needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karm=
as to affect a particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a =
good guru and not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT lo=
oking for specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, =
the constraints are fewer and options more.

Some may sub-consciously have =
a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and V=
edic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the=
 Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya so=
oktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat =
a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that "all =
is Brahman" and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.

* * *=


My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, =
you need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of givi=
ng today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of your s=
urrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or guidance. J=
ust keep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.

After all, if=
 you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise directions and some=
 supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you can keep walking to=
wards north. Of course, having supervision helps there too, but you can do =
without it!

Best regards,
Narasimha

 the answer is =C3=82?YES.

tained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too=
 as an important practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a b=
ig way with a marginal role for external practices.
> > > 
> > > Yoga marga=
 emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (No=
n-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasi=
se 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too wh=
ile Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as t=
hey subscribe to nirishwaravada.

r to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action =

o the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.
> > > 
> > > Fina=
lly I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevi=
table necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. M=
antra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths via th=
e energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain=
 dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and=
 safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti marga most path=
s invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes=
 Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the pat=
hs that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, an=
other the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another th=
e physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.
> > > 
> > > Tantra's method of in=
voking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantr=
asastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bring results=
 more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about aut=
hority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment =
with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and =
training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training and experien=
ce are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tan=
tric lab experiment too. However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst =
the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (=
also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intel=
lectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Wi=
thout going into other needless details here, I will just elaborate on init=
iation and Guru parampara.
> > > 
> > > Since we are talking about Sri Sri =
Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. =
Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha=
 Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are =
actually three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among =
the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana=
 belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to m=
ake the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have t=
aken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will dr=
aw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both th=
e Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana=
.
> > > 
> > > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not=
 invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the=
 major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bi=
ja, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic f=
requencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged=
 entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path=
 (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA h=
imself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branche=
s and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. =
It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor=
 that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocat=
e that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit =
of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful
 bul=
bs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is=
 a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till S=
iva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). No=
w back to Sri Sri Chandi.
> > > 
> > > As already stated Sakta sadhana seek=
s to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated=
 approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Man=
tra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and i=
ntegrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri =
Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also =
a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simul=
taneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of ini=
tiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employ=
ing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yog=
asastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensi=
vely in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic pat=
h, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections t=
hrough its central message
 of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory=
 in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fl=
edged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alone=
 exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it =
with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central trut=
h of Advaita.
> > > 
> > > The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in=
 English or any other regional language is because understanding the meanin=
g and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the t=
ext in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup =
is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obv=
ious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded=
 as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that rega=
rd all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally pos=
sible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone =
who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify=
 that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the=
 Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on on=
e mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.
> > > 
> > > Just as=
 some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadh=
ana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to th=
e Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this p=
articular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiat=
ion is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara,=
 or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach o=
f reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not requi=
red if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Y=
agnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chand=
i. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions=
 of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various par=
ts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and henc=
e the importance of initiation for those paths, be it
 Sri Sri Chandi or Sr=
i Vidya.
> > >

ny of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vicha=

st word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are t=

 texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is=
 best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGH=

As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a bank account in =
a son's name with a starting balance of one million dollars. Similarly, a g=
uru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple=
. However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank acc=
ount with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one's own hard work=
. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantra=
s and build one's own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you=
 (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, ju=
st go ahead and do it.

<DIV>What you have mentioned about not needing to =
understand Sanskrit text is interesting. I would like to narrate my experie=
nce and hopefully you can help me out regarding what happened.</DIV>
<DIV><=
BR></DIV>
<DIV>For nearly 2 yrs, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning=
, because I was not very fluent, I would pay attention to the pages I was r=
eading. As months passed by, I could chant without reading, I remembered it=
 all in my head. What happened as a result was that Rudram chanting no long=
er required any focus on my part, I could be doing anything while chanting =
this and as a result, my chanting began to lose focus. While chanting, my e=
yes would be paying attention to other things...the view outside the window=
, the clock, ghee left in the diya etc. My attention was everywhere else ex=
cept on my chanting. I would try to chant with my eyes closed but because I=
 was chanting aloud, doing that was proving difficult...my eyes would keep =
opening and rover. I also noticed that because I didn't understand what I w=
as chanting, concentrating became even more difficult.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV=
>
<DIV>Today, I am no longer doing that chanting. I stopped doing that seve=
ral months ago and Iam afraid that the skill I had mastered in chanting is =
slowly getting lost....</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I repeated the same with=
 Durga suktam. While I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chan=
ting. As I became fluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue=
 what I was chanting.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>My sadhana is more simple =
now, consisting of mental mantra recitation but to me, it feels much more b=
etter doing that than chanting something I do not understand.</DIV>
<DIV><B=
R></DIV>
<DIV>After reading your message, I am wondering why the words of r=
ishis, the Rudram or the Suktam did not translate into energy for me. Pleas=
e do not misunderstand, I am not trying to question you, I am just trying t=
o find an answer to something that keeps troubling me.</DIV>

<DIV>Namaste f=
riends,<BR><BR>I will give my 2 cents on a few points.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>=
I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in =
poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to r=
ead or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can read th=
e Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. H=
e asked me, "who do you think you are?" He said that it could be considered=
 later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.<BR><BR>Please note th=
at the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and pra=
yers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They are=
 tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses of =
some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the past.<=
BR><BR>An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, ri=
ght frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without
 it, a mantra that w=
as used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.<BR><BR>In fact, th=
e words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be more ef=
fective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person that one =
can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not worrying ab=
out whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras coming from=
 great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>If I were to give an anal=
ogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of scholarly anal=
ysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of the bowler,=
 how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to play it with a=
 straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back foot etc. But =
that does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one practices, THAT c=
an make one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding of principle=
s is needed. But, above that, practice is more
 important than bookish know=
ledge.<BR><BR>Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spir=
ituality also, but above that, sadhana is more important.<BR><BR>The essenc=
e of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. I=
t is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing things and reali=
ze that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each bei=
ng based on one's conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes =
through the cycle until one overcomes the notions of "I am doing", "this is=
 mine", "I like this and I dislike that" etc. Though this is the essence of=
 all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There=
 is no magic formula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome t=
he instincts of "I am doing", "this is mine" etc.<BR><BR>So, even if one pr=
actices a mantra that one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. A=
s long as the basic essence of
 scriptures is at the back of one's mind, on=
e is constantly contemplating and watching over one's own thoughts and inst=
incts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one's sadhana will yield results.<=
BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is=
 fine to read scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual peop=
le (physically or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that w=
ill only create a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and =
to govern all of one's instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sad=
hana.<BR><BR>One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of=
 what is what and what we want, is like a blind person running around a mou=
ntain, instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excelle=
nt theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to c=
limb the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it=
.<BR><BR>* *
 *<BR><BR>Regarding the statement that initiation is important=
 in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.<BR><BR>Wh=
ether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a contin=
uum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.<BR><BR>The i=
ssue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one's attitude and what o=
ne wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be careful r=
egarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a particula=
r result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not many a=
re left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specific mater=
ial results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints are fewe=
r and options more.<BR><BR>Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tant=
rik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic path is for s=
elf-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may ch=
ant
 Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevi=
ty, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance=
 in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that "all is Brahman" and t=
o remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>My =
thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, you n=
eed clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of giving to=
day! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of your surren=
der, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or guidance. Just k=
eep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.<BR><BR>After all, i=
f you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise directions and som=
e supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you can keep walking t=
owards north. Of course, having supervision helps there too, but you can do=
 without it!<BR><BR>Best

 the ONE question and the MANY answers po=

ritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is abou=
t the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantr=

unde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity f=
or multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of=
 multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for =
sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself=
 to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.<BR>> > > <B=

ga marga (Psycho-spiritual)<BR>> > > c. Mantra marga (Tantric)<BR>=

gt; > > Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the gre=
at abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES partic=

ths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant method=
s/ techniques employed by each of these paths.<BR>> > > For those =
who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the=
 external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wi=
sdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphas=

aita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained t=

mportant practice. All
 of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way =
with a marginal role for external practices.<BR>> > > <BR>> >=

 address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable nece=

 initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sad=

Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (th=
e reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that i=
nvoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the=
 fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physica=
l fire of the Yagnya and so on.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > Tantra=

practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques tha=
t bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara i=

 not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a chil=
d to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need=
 experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper train=
ing and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety meas=
ures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one's own consc=
iousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual=
 consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topi=
c for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on t=
he Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just e=
laborate on initiation and Guru parampara.<BR>> > > <BR>> > =
> Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it=
 within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river wi=
thin the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta
 sad=
hanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that =
are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Sri=
kula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vi=
dya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the =
Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are=
 familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms o=
f Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the =
Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.<BR>> > > <BR>> > =
> Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked a=
t all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major mil=
estones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata=
, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies=
 for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the
 full-fledged entry of=
 the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). =
The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at=
 the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twi=
gs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a b=
eautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one=
 can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that in=
itiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electr=
icity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights =
at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long se=
ries of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himsel=
f. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to =
Sri Sri Chandi.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > As already stated Sakt=
a sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the
 individual consciousness throug=
h an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhav=
a, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comp=
rehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many i=
n the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. Howe=
ver it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. I=
t is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The =
question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga =
and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore th=
e text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have =
covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to t=
he Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerfu=
l reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the =
crowning glory in the text is the
 Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself procl=
aims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, =
saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.=
5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on t=
he central truth of Advaita.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > The reaso=
n I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional langu=
age is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possib=
le only when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can full=
y follow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaiti=
c and Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However =
Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, =
especially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mant=
ras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence =
the practice of Chandi
 *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original=
 Vedic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic p=
ractice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is ful=
ly based on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala wit=
h the Hindu temple.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > Just as some pract=
itioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in acco=
rdance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric a=
pproach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular a=
pproach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not =
mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yog=
ic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading t=
he text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one =
is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One =
may benefit from
 any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However=
 one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both K=
alikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the =
subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the impo=
rtance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<BR=
>> > > <BR>> > > In summary, one can make spiritual progr=
ess through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, =
Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi=
 bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending on the individual tem=

 the answer to the question has to be contextualised.<BR>> > =

us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the =

fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice amo=

where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that e=
nables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attain=
