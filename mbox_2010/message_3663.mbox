Dear Narasimha,

>if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfec=
ted beings >and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it

=
*Blind Faith* on a Single book and a single prophet has created so much of =
fanaticism and resultant chaos, bloodshed as well as conversion (Thinking t=
hat it is a holy duty of every follower to propogate) by force, persuation,=
 or by money, education and facility (Missionaries) in the past and going o=

Yours,

Utpal
