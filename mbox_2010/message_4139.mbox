Hi Jacques 

You bring up an interesting point on time itself not being a s=
teady state. I do agree on that but should it not be possible to measure so=
mething tangible like admission rates in a mental asylum if the full moon/n=
ew moon/amavasya was having a effect.

I generally agree on the fact that m=
odern scientific journals have an pre-existing bias against anything relate=
d to traditions or spirituality but so many other studies have also come up=
 empty handed.


I was wondering aloud in the group that truly what has bee=
n said in the group previously is absolutely correct. Instead of worrying a=
bout intonation of mantras, so and so rituals...so and so timing ,maybe it =
is best to perform homa with the attitude of a child at the footsteps of th=
e mother.

I am inclined to beleive no other rule/timing of the ritual  mat=
ters and was just wondering aloud on that.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
