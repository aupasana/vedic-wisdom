 SRI V. S. RAMANAN'S TALK At Arunachala Ashrama on April 13, 1997

WHEN dea=
r Dennis asked me the other day to talk on "Sri Maharshi, My
Grandfather," =
I readily agreed. Yes, I do belong to His lineage, being the
eldest grandso=
n of Swami Niranjanananda, His younger brother, whom I
remember very well. =
Swami Niranjanananda's Ekabhakti to Bhagavan never once
demonstrated his fa=
mily link with Him. He always exhorted others to worship
and cling to Bhaga=
van as the one and only Master.

Ladies and gentlemen, I feel proud to call=
 myself the grandson of Swami
Niranjanananda because he was one of the grea=
test devotees of our Master. I
distinctly recollect what he once told a rel=
ative who prostrated before him.
This relative, according to custom, was ta=
king her child to Lord
Venkateswara in Tirupati to have the baby's hair cut=
 for the first time. The
Swami advised her that "When Lord Venkateswara is =
right HERE, why go to
Tirupati at all!." Such was his unshakeable faith in =
Bhagavan, his Guru.

To me, also, Bhagavan is not just the grandfather, but=
 the Guru. If He is my
grandfather, He is the grandfather for all of us her=
e. To Bhagavatji, of
course, He is the father!

Until I left for higher stu=
dies at a university, I lived with my family in
the then sleepy town of Tir=
uvannamalai. My first recollection of Bhagavan is
when I was about seven. O=
n all Sundays, school holidays and festivals our
entire family was in the A=
shram from early morning until about 6 p.m. At
that time the Vedic chanting=
 in front of Sri Bhagavan would be concluding
with the chanting of Bhagavan=
's Upadesa Saram. In those days I never failed
to rush to the Old Hall and =
recite Upadesa Saram along with the Veda
Patasala boys. It is the only comp=
osition of His I knew since my childhood.

Sri T. K. Sundaresa Iyer, my rev=
ered teacher, once dictated a story to me
and I wrote it down. He showed it=
 to Bhagavan and told Him that it was my
handwriting. I was very happy to h=
ear that Bhagavan said that my handwriting
was good. I may say here that it=
 is not bad even now!

I also remember Bhagavan grinding chutney for the br=
eakfast in the long
verandah east of the Ashram kitchen, and His offering a=
 small quantity of it
with His own hand to me to taste!I can't claim I was =
aware of His exalted
state in those early years of my youth, but I was cert=
ainly aware that He
was always natural, and most of the first-time visitors=
 also felt that they
somehow had always known Him. As Major Chadwick observ=
ed, "He was like a
mirror which seemed to reflect back your own feelings." =
If you responded
quite naturally to the all-embracing love of His presence,=
 he treated you as
one of His own.

Once a pair of pigeons were brought to =
the Ashram as an offering. Although
Bhagavan was at first reluctant to add =
to the Ashram duties the care of the
pigeons, He accepted them. He took the=
m in His hands, patted them
affectionately and then became silent, absorbed=
 in samadhi. In the meantime
it took the attendants nearly an hour to find =
a cage for the pigeons and
bring it to the hall. All that time the pigeons =
quietly sat on the
Maharshi's lap without moving, as if they were themselve=
s a pair of yogis
similarly absorbed in samadhi. Bhagavan said, "They came.=
 They refuse to go
back. Another family has joined me - as if I have not en=
ough family
already."

Similar is the story of my own family. In 1938, when=
 some devotees proposed
to Bhagavan that Venkatoo (my father) and his famil=
y could come to
Tiruvannamalai and work in the Ashram office, Bhagavan agre=
ed. Then from the
year 1938 onwards, our family has been under the care of =
the Ashram.

We all know He gave moksha to His mother while in Skandashram.=
 My daily
prayer to Him ever since I came permanently to the Ashram in 1992=
, is:
"Bhagavan, make me serve your devotees as the first servant of the As=
hram
and when my end comes, liberate me as You liberated Your mother."

I h=
ave often wondered about the great event which formed a turning point in
Bh=
agavan's life, the dramatisation of the act of death he conducted about
six=
 weeks before he left Madurai for good.Was it this dramatisation alone
that=
 transformed the school boy into a sage? Was he not purna (complete)
even f=
rom the instant of His birth on December 30th, 1879? Did not the blind
lady=
 who delivered Him see a bright light as he was born? Was there not a
link =
between this light and the meteor that cut a golden path across the sky
and=
 faded over Arunachala at the moment of His passing? Did He not at the
age =
of ten contemplate on death when His father died? Was it not a fact that
in=
 His youth nobody could wake Him up from sleep, even by severely beating
Hi=
m? I sincerely feel that out of compassion for us, and so we may not
swerve=
 from His teachings, he chose to hide the Supreme State He was
experiencing=
 from the very day of His birth. His decision to wear only a
kaupina (loin =
cloth) after throwing away all his possessions on September
1st, 1896 was n=
ot for His own edification. It was for us He did this. He
Himself later obs=
erved "Some power acts through the body of a Jivanmukta and
uses his body t=
o get the work done."

When Paramahansa Yogananda asked Bhagavan why God pe=
rmitted suffering in the
world. Bhagavan replied, "Suffering was the way fo=
r realization of God." And
when further questioned why should there be suff=
ering, His characteristic
reply was "Who suffers? What is suffering?" Bhaga=
van always takes us back to
the single question "Who am I?" - to cultivate =
Self-knowledge at all
times. Self-knowledge
serves the practical purpose of=
 destroying pain and suffering caused by
ignorance.

There is a poem compos=
ed by Bhagavan entitled Atma Vidya which begins: "Lo,
very easy is Self-kno=
wledge, Lo very easy indeed - even for the most
infirm..." After hearing th=
is poem, Prof. G. V Subbaramayya asked Bhagavan
why he was not getting it i=
f it was that easy. Also, Sri Balarama Reddy
endorsed G. V. S.'s doubt by q=
uoting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita.
Bhagavan looked at them with compass=
ion and confirmed "What is written in
Atma Vidya is true. Why do you doubt =
it? So real is the Self that compared
with it even the gooseberry in the pa=
lm of one's hand appears a mere
illusion." This categorical assertion is no=
t only meant for those two great
devotees, but for all of us who have been =
attracted to Him and have
experienced His Grace. Yes, He continues to live =
in our midst as Awareness,
as the Person in all persons; He lives in all an=
d as all life!

Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya!
