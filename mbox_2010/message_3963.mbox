Pranam,

Let us consider that each day when we are sincerely doing our Sad=
hana ..may it be homams ,meditations , japams etc. We gain some *Bonus Poin=
ts* along with burning of karmas.. 
Now its on *I* to decide how to use tha=
t ...
Some might use it for money and other materialistic things or sansari=
c needs....and some might prefer to Bank all those Bonus points ....(which =
is needed in plenty ..) to perceive GOD in every breathe... 
so its on *I* =
..to decide how to spend it .... 

plz note the use of *I* .... in all the =
lines.. 
Although we are trying to kill this *I* and make it *Thy* yet most=
 of us have a long way to go to achieve that .. if the *I* /ego wouldn't ha=
ve existed then *I* couldn't have been in the physical form typing this mai=
l .. 

And i see it to be pointless.. to ask from God about things...
Reaso=
n:- whether we ask for it or not we will get exactly what we have in store =
...  

Unconditional Love to God is the best key :- Lord Anonymous 

"We al=
l like to eat, but none likes to pay the bills"

Therefore consistent and u=
nconditional love .. for God will certainly take one to God and then the  *=
I*  would certainly be *thy* .. 
as Vimalananda has said ..*IT TAKES A BIT =
OF TIME"...

i beg of pardon if at any point i have said something wrong..a=
nd i do seek correction for my farther improvement..

regards Sayantan,

JA=
I MAA !
