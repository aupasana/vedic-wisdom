Namaste Narsimha,
Thanks for clarifying all doubts. Will it be possible for=
 you to record the complete video in the same manner as the homam.
Also, I =
was thinking about the underlying reason for making offerings to Pitris tow=
ards south. Also, the way offerings are made, it actually ends up being off=
ered in west direction.In case, you know the reason, please share.
Sriram

Hari, in general, r=

of a liberating experience and not meant for stopping one from a sadhana th=
at one is well-motivated to do! Moreover, the liberating experience may com=
e after a lot of sadhana.

  

Go ahead and do it. Happy birthday!

Yes, pitri tarpana can be=
 done after lighting the lamp or doing a homam.

It is ok. However, it is better to do pitri tarpana in a=
nother place. People's minds are quite vulnerable when they are asleep, to =
various influences. When you do a pitri tarpana or otherwise contemplate on=
 the ancestors who are blocked from higher realms of being, you may be leav=

The name of your g=
otra rishi then is Koundinya. :-)

 

The rishi tarpana section in the Pitr=
i tarpana manual only includes the Saptarshis. You can add your gotra rishi=
s if you want. At the end of of "rishi tarpana", you can add "OM kauNDinyaH=
 tR^ipyataaM".

You can use the same pot/vessel/kalasham.

> Also, if the water has reduced in the pot after offerings to Devas and=
