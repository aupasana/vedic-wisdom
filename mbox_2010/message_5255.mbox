Namaste Chandraprakash Ji,

>The other interesting thing about the various =
births of Jaya and >Vijaya is that they chose to be born as enemies of Vish=
nu so that >they could return to Vaikuntha sooner....it took them three yug=
as

A very interesting coincidence! I was just thinking exactly the same th=
ing, to the exact words you used above but i was vary whether i should righ=
t on the list or Not.

My father on few occasions told me that Ravana was a=
 Mahan Gnyani and he knew exactly who was Sita and Rama. In his mind he alw=
ays regarded Sita as Mother but to just create a situation, he abducted Sit=
a so that Rama would come and kill him so that he along with KumbhaKarna ca=
n go back to their orginal abode of Vishnu as Jay & Vijay.

If that is trut=
h then all the discussions of discussing and judging Ravana's characters ar=
e pointless.

However one utility is there even if we presume that above is=
 indeed true- Ravana showed the world and future generations that one falls=
 for sure, however mighty one may be, if there are uncontrolled Shadripus (=
Even one ripu of the Shadripu is enough). and The inevitable trigger point =
for final doom is: "Parastri Haranam Ravan Maranam".

It is NOT prudent to =
say that if one wants liberation then Just do all such things as per your c=
apacity, as Ravana did. simply because Ravana was a very high level soul (D=
irect associates of Shri Vishnu)and he also knew the whole game.

A differe=
nt perspective!

Best Regards,

Utpal
