Namaste,
 
I am sorry, but I have to strike a discordant note.
 
Swamiji at Shree Maa's ashram may be a learned and sincere man and may give nice lectures on Chandipath. However, his pronunciation is unbelievably terrible. I have seen several westerners who do a far far better job with the pronunciation of Chandipath as well as other Sanskrit hymns. His pronunciation is particularly bad.
 
Of course, pronunciation may not matter to some and, if so, please ignore my mail. But, in case it matters, I must say that his pronunciation is unbelievably terrible and not a good starting point for learners.
 
*        *        *
 
I am basing my judgment on listening to the first few verses of "Chapter 4" at
 
http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/shree_maa_chandi_path_audio_classes
 
After listening to two verses, I simply could not continue listening.

They seem to have done a Sahasra (1000) Chandi homa over a period of 1000 days and they seem to be still doing Chandi homam on every Sunday. That is excellent.
 
However, it is not possible to know where most Chandi homas were done in USA.
 
At my house, we do 3 Chandi homas per day (one by myself and two by two other sadhakas). I myself have done about 1200 Chandi homas here. In a neighboring town 10 miles from here, a priest from India has been doing 10 Chandi homas per day for the last 2 months and plans to finish 1000 Chandi homas in August. He is doing it as a private sadhana, but without a private sankalpa and for peace and dharma in the world.
 
Like this, there may be several sadhakas doing intense sadhana with Chandi homam that we may not know about.
 
*        *        *
 
In any case, numbers do not matter. Manish once told me, "Narasimha, numbers do not matter. What one needs is one homam where one experiences Her in oneself and not twenty homas where nothing happens. These days, I cannot properly finish even one Chandi homam. Once I am in the 4th or 5th chapter, I go into a trance and I cannot continue anymore. I stay like that for many hours and cannot finish the homam."
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
