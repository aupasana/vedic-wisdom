Swamiji

Very well put and I agree whole heartedly with you ,  though the m=
essage might not ring well with the politically correct crowd . History is =
proof to the fact and many links can be provided of the collosal purposeful=
 mistakes done by Nehru and his ilk.Neither is this a conspiracy theory nor=
 fringe arguements. For those interested please read Nehru's role 

1.Passi=
ng the Endowments act of 1951 which taxes on Hindu temples and gives a free=
 reign to others. Till to this day tax is collected on many poor temples wh=
ich is directly resulting in dharma being squashed. The then President Raje=
ndra Prasad refused to sign the bill.

2.His stubborn insistence on being b=
lind to Chinese aggression beleiving in the Panchashila agreement. Indian g=
enerals have written tomes on it how he got front divisions killed ...many =
brave young men killed due to his foolishness.

3.Turning over 2/3rds of Ka=
shmir which was already taken by General Manikshaw and Turning over the Iss=
ue to the UN which has caused this bloodshed for so many years...

There is=
 proof for each one of this along with Independent Internationally reviewed=
 books written by generals and observers and Including the Internationally =
Renowned Time magazine articles and links.


However bringing this up  will=
 deviate the spiritual discussions and I will not attempt that.Nature proba=
bly had its own reasons for sending a person like Nehru.


History is alway=
s written by the victors ...this is one small example of how false legends =
when repeated for 50 yrs become gospel truth. 

Shri K N Rao that is why al=
ways criticized nehru on the basis of his horoscope. Shri K N Rao also had =
personal exprience with the Nehru family .

Anywaz it is a laughing matter =
that one so called astrology school claims the other way round and justifie=
s it various contorted logics...


All is her divine play...Her divine maya=
 covering the eyes of humans.
