Subject: which homam to choose?

Which homam works best for getting rid of black magic?  I wish to call a te=
mple priest but I am confused between Maha sudarshan,Chandi and Mahakali.  =
Within a span of two months if I ask the priest to perform homam 3 times th=
en are they more fruitful than the one done on a regular basis. 
 I am doin=
g Ganpati homam with great devotion but still I see very little difference =
in life. Obviously my path to sprituality is much tougher than others. So w=
hat rules shall I specially need to follow for results to show up. 
As I ha=
ve chronic health issues my meditation is not efficient. Though I keep tryi=
ng if a healthy body can give 70% I give only 30%. Hence the question alway=
s comes in my mind are my prayers working?

I can try getting answers from =
outside but once I say I have black magic priests only think of minting mon=
ey. People coming in this forum are genuine and hence am looking for help h=
ere. Kindly suggest as life is going tough for me. I am willing to work har=
d but don't know the right approach. 

Thanks and regards,

Om shanti, shan=
