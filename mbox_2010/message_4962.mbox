 The manual says, go with Akshats in that case. But, while I am offering th=
e water with akshats (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in second last secti=
on, the mantras use the word "Tilodakam". If I am right, this refers to the=
 seasame seeds being offered. Is it fine to continue with these mantras onl=

atodakam".
