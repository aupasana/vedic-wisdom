Hello,

I think this confusion is due to multiple meanings of words. the me=
anings are supportive of each other but yet they are technically different.=
 I will try to give some here

Prana Vaayu: 

1) oxygen - This is given in =
modern context.

2) The energy causing Respiration: All the movements in bo=
dy are caused by Vaayu. there are five different types of vaayu in Body whi=
ch cause different functions. These are Prana, Udana, samana, vyana, apana.=
 Out of these 'Prana vaayu' helps in respiration. 

3) The air flowing in a=
nd out of lungs during the process of repiration (Inhalation and exhalation=
) is also called Prana vaayu. As this air is essential for life maintainanc=
e

4) Cool, clean and dustfree air which flows in morning. This is dustfree=
, pollution free and is moist. Due to this, this is considered good for hea=
lth. 

Prana:

1) Life

2) Some times it is also used for Prana-shakti. The=
 Physical and mental energy stored in our body. A type of this is termed as=
 spiritual energy.

3) The Inhalation and exhalation process. 

It is advis=
ed to wakeup in Brahmmuhurta ( roughly around 4:30 am, or about 30-45 minut=
es before sunrise) Because of following reasons

1) This time is believed t=
o be ruled by Devatas. So one gets the blessings of devatas in this time.

=
2) This time is believed to have saatvik energy. This purifies the mind.

3=
) This time air is dust free, clean and without pollution. This purifies th=
e body.

4) During this time All the doshas (Vaata-pitta and kapha) are in =
balanced proportion. So our body is healthy and free from diseases. Waking =
too late will increase kapha in body and waking too early will increase vaa=
ta in body. very common problems like constipation, insomnia, depression, l=
aziness, low immunity, cold can be avoided and infact cured just by waking =
up in this time

further, During this time, the concentration of Oxygen is =
not so High that it will cause oxidation. For oxidation of cells, much high=
er concentration is needed. 

And, the concentration of CO2 and O2 never fl=
uctuate too much so that we have to worry about their concentration until a=
nd unless the difference is more than 10% in case of CO2 and 20% in case of=
 O2. (These are approx figures). With in this range we will not even notice=
 any difference in our surroundings or any type of discomfort.

I hope it h=
elps.

Sorry for mistakes. 
Regards
Atul
