 May 19, 1922 (Dundubhi year and Vaisakha month) was her last day; everyone=

could sense the impending end that day. Yet they had to do whatever was
po=
ssible in a spirit of detachment leaving the result to the Lord. As long
as=
 she was conscious, Bhagavan gave her spiritual instructions. When she
lost=
 consciousness Ganapati Muni
and others commenced vedic chants, some others=
 chanted the Rama-nama.

After the violent gasps (urdhva-swasa) began, Bhag=
avan placed his right hand
on her heaving heart and the left one on her hea=
d. He looked at her
intently. The day passed that way. Subsequently Bhagava=
n himself narrated
what had happened thus:

The latent tendencies and thoug=
hts which are the cause of future births
flared up. She had just then lost =
consciousness of the external world. Hence
in the subtle world her subtle b=
ody was witnessing scene after scene of what
was to happen. By this sequenc=
e of experiences, the soul went through the
future births and travelled tow=
ards the highest.

How could she experience this? It was because of the cur=
rent of Bhagavan's
spiritual power transmitted by touch that she experience=
d all within
herself, without having to be born over and over again. There =
was a battle
between her soul forces and Bhagavan's spiritual power in whic=
h her latent
tendencies gradually weakened and ultimately got vanquished. B=
hagavan
actually described the scenes she witnessed in the subtle state inc=
luding
their intensity.

The end came peacefully by eight in the night. Amo=
ng those present, Ganapati
and Niranjanananda Swami heard a sound indicativ=
e of the mother's death.

In this manner, the mother's individuality submer=
ged in Atma, God. She
attained mahanirvana. She had no more births. Due to =
her son, who was
Arunachala in human form, she attained mukti or became est=
ablished in the
Atma.

Mother's body acquired a new brilliance which persis=
ted till the abhisheka
on the following day As the mother's end was nearing=
 nobody in the ashram
ate anything that day. After her end, the Maharshi go=
t up, and with no trace
of grief said, "We may now eat. There is no polluti=
on." How could there be
any pollution when they were in the presence of the=
 Lord in whom the holy
lady merged? Such a body was a holy shrine in itself=
. The ashramites had a
quiet meal.


The entire night passed in the singing=
 of devotional songs. According to
Manavasi Ramaswamy Iyer, "Bhagavan had n=
o grief whatever. On the other hand,
he appeared to be relieved like a bird=
 released from a cage." These words
were recorded in his diary. True, why d=
id he have to grieve?

The mother attained the supreme state. Some days aft=
er the event somebody
remarked to the Maharshi, "Mother has passed away." I=
mmediately Bhagavan
corrected him saying "No, mother has merged, she has be=
come one."

On another occasion, when the matter of his according mukti to =
the mother
came up, Bhagavan said, "Yes my attempt in her case was successf=
ul. Earlier,
in the case of Palaniswami I attempted the same. Thinking that=
 he had
attained the ultimate I removed my hand, thereupon he opened his ey=
es. The
prana passed through the eyes. That is how my attempt at that time =
failed."
On still another occasion, Bhagavan said, "Where has mother gone? =
She is
here." Hence there need be no doubt as to where Alagammal had depart=
ed. The
Maharashi meant that she merged in Easwara and was with him (as he =
also was
abiding in the atma).

Mother has not passed away. She has merged.=
 She has become one.

The question as to whether the body was to be cremate=
d or buried came up on
the very night of mother's expiry.

Bhagavan pointed=
 out that according to chapter 13 of Ramana Gita the body of
one who attain=
ed mukti was to be buried and not cremated. The disciples
decided to bury t=
he body. Early next dawn, they carried the body from
Skandasramam down the =
hill to a spot near Paliteertham.

Meanwhile, some relatives from other pla=
ces came and though they argued in
favour of a cremation, they were overrul=
ed. The news of the mother's death
passed round the town, in spite of every=
 effort to keep it private. As a
result, numerous people turned up at the b=
urial ground.Your text goes here.

A pit was dug below an aswatha tree. The=
 body was lowered into it. The pit
was filled with camphor, vibhuti, salt a=
nd other aromatic materials and
later covered. The disciples erected a bric=
k samadhi and by some
coincidence, a Siva linga from Kasi arrived just then=
. It was placed atop
the samadhi and named, Matrubhuteswara (Mother who was=
 Easwara).

The Swami was watching the proceedings as a mere witness.With t=
he samadhi of
the mother the son's filial duty ended.

As Swami had entreat=
ed Arunachala in 1914, the mother was consumed not by
the fire of cremation=
 but by the fire of Jnana .

For the Mahapooja day, Ganapati Muni wrote six=
 verses entitled Soundaryamba
shatkam (Six verses on Soundaryamba) ? (Sound=
aryamba has the same meaning as
Alagamma). This is the substance of the ver=
ses:

1. In the first quarter of the night of Friday, the ninth day of the =
dark
fortnight of Vaisakha month, Dundubhi year

2. Wife of Sundaram born i=
n the exalted lineage of Bharadwaja, Parasara and
mother of Ramana Maharshi=
 born as an avatara of Guruguha (Subrahmanya), the
blessed lady,

3. One de=
void of any attachment, one cleansed by bhakti to Siva, one whose
prana was=
 arrested by the touch of Guha (Ramana Maharshi), one whose
tendencies were=
 all destroyed that very moment

4. She, Soundaryamba, became that Light wh=
ich can be known only by the
Vedantic Vakyas, which is all-pervasive, and w=
hich was known by her son.

5. At that samadhi of Soundaryamba the stream w=
hich poured out of the lotus
palms of Ramana Maharshi became a new teertha,=
 the Aghasamana teertha (the
teertha which removes all sins).

6. Glory to =
the holy mother of sacred Ramana!
Glory to the samadhi!
Glory to the linga =
consecrated by the Maharshi!
Glory to the new Aghasamana teertha!

The Maha=
rshi later said something interesting. After her passing away,
Alagammal's =
body acquired a new brilliance which persisted till the
abhisheka on the fo=
llowing
day at the time of samadhi; it disappeared soon after water was pou=
red.
Further, at the last breath in all cases a faint sound emanates. In th=
e
mother's case, Bhagavan did not notice it but others present did.

Every =
year, to commemorate the anniversary, pooja is performed to
Matrubhuteswara=
. Thousands of devotees from various parts of the world
assemble to join th=
e observance.
