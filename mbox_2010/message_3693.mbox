 thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). Wh=

 any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they =
are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realizatio=
n. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their indi=
vidual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short the=
y *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'.

r topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or =
chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. The=
re would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of their=
s because as I said, they know complete background behind their each action=
 and moreover their self identification is missing from the action and henc=
e it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose w=
ithout binding them in any cause-effect chain.

has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything =
and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything w=

s extremely important.

habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possibl=
e at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with th=
e `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have shower=
ed his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's po=
ssible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inco=
nsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Natu=

ile attributing it to them.<BR>> <BR>> (2) Eating the meat of an anim=
al that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is always a much stron=
ger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have much subtler self-ide=
ntification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which=
 spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.<BR>> <BR>> A=
ll of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them balance =
out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many austeriti=
es and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset
 any bad karma ac=
cumulated by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully realized (=
after full realization, there are no karmas).<BR>> <BR>> (3) In the o=
ld days - even a century back - people did much more sadhana than now and l=
ived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of dee=
p pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded w=
ith so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and=
 turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexu=
al innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There=
 are images of half-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There a=
re too many temptations for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and=
 commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world of today is more cha=
llenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.<BR>> <BR>> Ho=

 walking on a normal road i=
n summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy pav=

a, he taught non-violence.<BR>> <BR>> When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vi=

want to eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that=
 is bad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected =
beings and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Oppor=

 days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is th=

e=C3=82 life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a=
 man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrish=

R>> Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state i=
s multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely impo=
rtant statement to answer our queries.<BR>> <BR>> Important informati=
on about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a b=
ig time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he di=
dn't do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body=
. He used to
 as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally<BR>> at=
e meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agr=
ee) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our mi=
nds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say v=
ery frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do wha=
t he does.<BR>> <BR>> Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to =
answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you=
, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to n=
othing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or =
Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget=
 that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual=
 realization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe.=
 Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. I=
n
 short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'.<BR>&=
gt; Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat =
or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what t=
hey are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and eve=
ry action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind=
 their each action and moreover their self identification is missing from t=
he action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a=
 special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.<BR>> Ra=
makrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very di=
fferent from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him whi=
ch can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind hi=
m. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others,=
 a kind of food intake is extremely important.<BR>> If Vivekananda
 ate =
meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which i=
s not<BR>> possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by=
 a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seek=
ers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them an=
d then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other u=
ndesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifyi=
ng some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is al=
so possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal'=
s soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent rea=
sons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only =
Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved =
a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did no=
t even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years
 actually met S=
wami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away fro=
m water<BR>> and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, =
swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his gur=
u will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later be=
came disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually g=
iven a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami=
 Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.<BR>> <BR>> Swami Vivekananda was=
 all knowing and most of us are NOT.<BR>> <BR>> So moral of my whole =
writings is that it's unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of th=
e unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda,=
 Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justi=
fy our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.=
