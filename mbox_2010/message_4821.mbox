Dear all

Happy Janmastami to one and all :)

Pleas find article on " How s=
cience discovered the historical Krishna" by
Rakesh Krishnan.

*The sea, wh=
ich had been beating against the shores, suddenly broke the
boundary that w=
as imposed on it by nature. The sea rushed into the city. It
coursed throug=
h the streets of the beautiful city. The sea covered up
everything in the c=
ity. Arjuna saw the beautiful buildings becoming
submerged one by one. He t=
ook a last look at the mansion of Krishna. In a
matter of a few moments it =
was all over. The sea had now become as placid as
a lake. There was no trac=
e of the beautiful city, which had been the
favourite haunt of all the Pand=
avas. Dwarka was just a name; just a memory."
=96 Mausala Parva, Mahabharat=
a.*

Does this account from the ancient Indian epic have a true historical =
core?
Did Lord Krishna, indeed the favourite Indian deity, walk the streets=
 of
ancient Dwarka? Did Krishna, considered the Lord of the universe by a
b=
illion Hindus, rule the Yaduvanshi clan thousands of years ago?

Using arch=
aeological, scriptural, literary and astronomical data, scholars
and scient=
ists are coming round to the view that Krishna was definitely a
historical =
character.

*ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE*

The Rosetta stone, or the key, to th=
e Krishna story is Dwarka. The strongest
archaeological support comes from =
the structures discovered in the late
1980s under the seabed off the coast =
of modern Dwarka in Gujarat by a team
of archaeologists and divers led by D=
r S.R. Rao, one of India's most
respected archaeologists. An emeritus scien=
tist at the marine archaeology
unit of the National Institute of Oceanograp=
hy, Goa, Rao has excavated a
large number of Harappan sites, including the =
port city of Lothal in
Gujarat.

In his book The Lost City of Dwarka, publi=
shed in 1999, he writes about his
undersea finds: =93The discovery is an im=
portant landmark in the history of
India. It has set to rest the doubts exp=
ressed by historians about the
historicity of Mahabharata and the very exis=
tence of Dwarka city.=94

Conducting 12 expeditions during 1983-1990, Rao i=
dentified two underwater
settlements, one near the present-day Dwarka and t=
he other in the nearby
island of Bet Dwarka. This tallies with the two Dwar=
kas mentioned in the
epic. The underwater expeditions won Rao the first Wor=
ld Ship Trust Award
for Individual Achievement.

Another important find by =
our divers was a seal that establishes the
submerged township's connection =
with the Dwarka of the Mahabharata. The seal
corroborates the reference mad=
e in the ancient text, the Harivamsa, that
every citizen of Dwarka should c=
arry such a seal for identification
purposes. Krishna had ruled that none w=
ithout the seal should enter it. A
similar seal has been found onshore as w=
ell.
