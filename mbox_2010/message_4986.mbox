Namaste Narsimhaji,
=C2=A0
Thanks for replying to my queries. As per your s=
uggestion, i should wait till sopari(purnahuti) burns totally to start pitr=
u tarpan. I donot have much time in the morning. I had to rush towards offi=
ce too. Normally sopari(purnahiti) takes much time. Sometimes i had to rush=
 leaving sopari burns half the way. I check it on second day whether the pr=
evious day sopari is burnt fully or not? if it does not, then i burn it on=
=C2=A0next day. This is how i manage burning the stuff of=C2=A0homam comple=
tely. =C2=A0
=C2=A0
Considering this, is it ok if i do=C2=A0pitru tarpan fi=
rst and then would start with vishnu homam? 
of i would do vishnu homam in =
the morning asusal and then doing pitru tarpan ( super short procedure) in =
the evening after office?
=C2=A0
I am sorry for encroaching upon your valua=
ble time. 
=C2=A0
Regards
=C2=A0
Rajesh

Namaste Hari,

Hari, in genera=
l, restrictions and technical guidelines are meant for maximizing the *chan=
ce* of a liberating experience and not meant for stopping one from a sadhan=
a that one is well-motivated to do! Moreover, the liberating experience may=
 come after a lot of sadhana.

Go ahead and do it. Happy birthday!

Yes, pitri tarpana can be done af=
ter lighting the lamp or doing a homam.

Namaste Rajesh,

at the same place of havankund?

Yes.

intaining fire so that=C3=82 sopari ( which is used=C3=82 for purnahuti)=C3=

Wait till the homam is completely finished and =
everything burns. Then start the other ritual.

> 3. I am normally doing vi=
shnu homam and tarpan vidhi both in my bedroom. In pitru tarpan manual it i=
s written that during shraddha paksha ( this fortnight) there is no harm in=
 doing tarpan vidhi in house also..is this ok?

It is ok. However, it is be=
tter to do pitri tarpana in another place. People's minds are quite vulnera=
ble when they are asleep, to various influences. When you do a pitri tarpan=
a or otherwise contemplate on the ancestors who are blocked from higher rea=
lms of being, you may be leaving some thoughts related to them and their we=
aknesses in that place. That is normally harmless, but a very sensitive per=
son sleeping there may be somewhat disturbed by it.

the time comes. Knowledge and ability to act on it come in stages. Grab wha=
tever comes to you..

The name of your gotra rishi then is Koundinya. :-)

The rishi tarpana se=
ction in the Pitri tarpana manual only includes the Saptarshis. You can add=
 your gotra rishis if you want. At the end of of "rishi tarpana", you can a=
dd "OM kauNDinyaH tR^ipyataaM".

You can use the same pot/vessel/kalasham.

> Also, if=
 the water has reduced in the pot after offerings to Devas and Rishis, is i=

Yes, you can add more water.
