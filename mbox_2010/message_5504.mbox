history teaches us that people who made idiots of themselves by critic=
izing noblest of the souls will be forgotten and/or not even acknowledged i=
n their own times! 
=C2=A0
please evaluate who you are before you go ahead =
and state that ".....Should Adishankara manifest himself before a MERE you.=
........................" ! Just shut up!!!
=C2=A0
If Vyaakarana is giving =
you a high! Well, good for you. There are other people to whom Scotch gives=
 them more high than your Vyaakarana. Adi Sankaracharya's message tells you=
 that God's name, Govinda's name gives you more high than the mundane vyaak=
arana or anything else. If you are unable to receive that, please remain re=
peating your Dukrnkarani sootras but don't comment. People who are happy to=
 receive just mere scotch will not even pay attention to you Dukrnkarani su=
tras and people to whom Devaranama is giving them the required high will no=
t pay attention to you the same way! So,no point in bringing about this com=
parison. So, please ignore all this but try to look for the truth within.
