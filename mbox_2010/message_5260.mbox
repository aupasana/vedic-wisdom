Utpalji
Wether with whom he was associated is another question but simplest=
 thing which we need to observe is this,
One can only reach to Shri=C2=A0Vi=
shnu via Shri Shiva which Ravana did.
Same is applicable for Shri Shiva vic=
e versa.
All this discusison ends here.

Namaste Chandraprakash Ji,

k them three yugas

A very interesting coincidence! I was just thinking exa=
ctly the same thing, to the exact words you used above but i was vary wheth=
er i should right on the list or Not.

My father on few occasions told me t=
hat Ravana was a Mahan Gnyani and he knew exactly who was Sita and Rama. In=
 his mind he always regarded Sita as Mother but to just create a situation,=
 he abducted Sita so that Rama would come and kill him so that he along wit=
h KumbhaKarna can go back to their orginal abode of Vishnu as Jay & Vijay.
=

If that is truth then all the discussions of discussing and judging Ravana=
's characters are pointless.

However one utility is there even if we presu=
me that above is indeed true- Ravana showed the world and future generation=
s that one falls for sure, however mighty one may be, if there are uncontro=
lled Shadripus (Even one ripu of the Shadripu is enough). and The inevitabl=
e trigger point for final doom is: "Parastri Haranam Ravan Maranam".

It is=
 NOT prudent to say that if one wants liberation then Just do all such thin=
gs as per your capacity, as Ravana did. simply because Ravana was a very hi=
gh level soul (Direct associates of Shri Vishnu)and he also knew the whole =
game.

A different perspective!

Best Regards,

Utpal
