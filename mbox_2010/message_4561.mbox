While, I am not as learned as others, I wanted to add my view on top of wha=
t Utpal has written.

If my understanding of God is correct, God is happy w=
hen an offering is pure. Whether the priest has accumulated spiritual sakth=
i or not, if he is sincere and has the correct attitude it may be worthwhil=
e.

When I do my homam, some times, my son joins and does abhishekam to Shi=
v linga. One day, we went to attend house warming function of my sister and=
 I carried my basic stuff for my homam but did not carry Shiv ling. My son =
felt like joining and he asked if I have the Shiv ling. He was not happy wh=
en I answered in negative and kept argueing that I should have brought it t=
oo. I told him, God is every where and he can even treat a stone as Shiv li=
ng. I told him, if you are sincere and pure at hearth and assume Shiv is in=
front of you, Shiv will accept your offering.l Well, I know this is true. I=
s there any place where Shiv is not there? Whether or not, I invoked him or=
 not, Shiv or any God for that matter is just by our side. My son, went out=
, found a round shaped stone and did mRtyunjaya mantra japa along with abhi=
shekam. As far he is concerned, he believed me and there are no questions i=
n his mind. When such believe is bestored in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME PU=
RE momentarily and what ever you offer in full trust that god is accepting =
it, is accepted by God. There is no doubt in it.

As per the impact it crea=
te, what impact you want? If you wanted an impact, they you attempted busin=
ess with God. When you do not want any thing in return, then you are alread=
y getting the impact. Otherwise, how, living in this material world, you di=
d not expect any thing for what you do?

The result, you will get is to imp=
rove your attitude. That WILL happen if you offered sincerely.

The mytholo=
gy is full of stories that suggest, in complete surrender or otherwise, if =
the call to God is sincere, God will always answer the same. It is another =
thing if we realized that God has already answered us!

The very fact, that=
 we are finding time to read/write message like this shows that we are tryi=
ng to correct our attitude and seek god. This itself is the result of what =
ever little sadhana we are doing.

Best regards,
Vijay
