Namaste,
         I remember reading somewhere( some book on homa vidhi) th=
at the proper way to do this is to use a bamboo tube. In  the old days, thi=
s was the way it was done even in the kitchen. The agni used to cook food i=
s also holy and some of the same rules apply.If you dont have a bamboo tube=
, then you can get it from one of the people who make and sell ladders and =
the like( if you are in India). Not to disparage others, but some of the pr=
iests themselves are ignorant of all the things which needs to be observed =
in a homa. As an example, for long homas one is allowed to drink water and =
milk in between- but no stimulants(coffee/tea being the most common).

Dear=
 Narasimha,
            Namaste! What do the sastras say about what we shou=
ld do when we have to answer the call of nature during a homa ? For japa, t=
he rules are clear to me- do the same rules apply for homa ? If for example=
 we must get up and go for a 'long call' and hence have to take bath- the f=
ire could go off- do we add more wood/cow dung/samit and go ? 

Regards,

S=


p.s. My apologies-this question may seem trivial, but is very real..
