Dear Narasimha, namaste

> ...During that time, he should never say Gayatri=
 mantra out loud...

Recently I attended a Srimad Bhagavatam discourse. The=
 pandit doing the
parayanam was of the opinion that the mantras should be c=
hanted in a loud
voice with correct intonation so that the energy of the ma=
ntra benefits all
around.

best regards
Hari

<br>When I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in open air in=
