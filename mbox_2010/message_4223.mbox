 8-9-45 Morning

Another Visitor: It is said that our waking life is also a=
 dream, similar to
our dream during sleep. But in our dreams we make no con=
scious effort to get
rid of the dream and to awake, but the dream itself co=
mes to an end without
any effort on our part and we become awake. Similarly=
 why should not the
waking state, which is in reality only another sort of =
dream, come to an end
of its own accord, and without any effort on our part=
, and land us in jnana
or real awakening?

Bhagavan: Your thinking that you=
 have to make an effort to get rid of this
dream of the waking state and yo=
ur making efforts to attain jnana or real
awakening are all parts of the dr=
eam. When you attain jnana you will see
there was neither the dream during =
sleep, nor the waking state, but only
yourself and your real state.

Devote=
e pressed Bhagavan, =E2=80=9CBut what is the answer to the question? Why
sh=
ould not the waking state also pass like our dreams without any effort on
o=
ur part and land us in jnana, as a dream passes off and leaves us awake?=E2=
=80=9D

Bhagavan: Who can say that the dream passed off of its own accord? =
If the
dream came on, as is generally supposed, as the result of our past t=
houghts
or karma, probably the same karma also decides how long it should l=
ast and
how after that time it should cease.

Devotee was still unsatisfied=
 and, as the result of further talk with
Bhagavan,and he feels that the wak=
ing state, though a sort of dream,is
clearly distinct from the dream during=
 sleep in this, namely that during
dream it never occurs to us that it is a=
 dream, whereas in the waking state
we are able to argue and understand fro=
m books and gurus and from some
phenomena that it may be only dream after a=
ll. Because of this, it may be
our duty to make an effort to wake into jnan=
a.

Bhagavan says that we don=E2=80=99t deem a dream, a dream till we wake =
up, that the
dream looks quite real while it lasts; and that similarly this=
 waking state
will not appear a dream till we wake up into jnana.Because of=
 the above
difference between the dream and the waking states, our effort i=
s called
for.
