 D: As some sacred texts say that the supreme state is that in which the
se=
nse organs and the mind are completely destroyed, how can that state be
com=
patible with the experience of the body and the senses?

Bhagavan: If that =
were so there would not be any difference between that
state and the state =
of deep sleep. Further, how can it be said to be the
natural state when it =
exists at one time and not at another? This happens,
as stated before, to s=
ome persons according to their karma (prarabdha) for
some time or till deat=
h. It cannot properly be regarded as the final state.

If it could it would=
 mean that all great souls and the Lord, who were the
authors of the Vedant=
ic works (jnana granthas) and the Vedas, were
unenlightened persons.If the =
supreme state is that in which neither the
senses nor the mind exist and no=
t the state in which they exist, how can it
be the perfect state (paripurna=
m)?

As karma alone is responsible for the activity or inactivity of the sa=
ges,
great souls have declared the state of sahaja nirvikalpa (the natural =
state
without concepts) alone to be the ultimate state.
