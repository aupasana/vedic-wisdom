Namaste

Akshaya Tritiya is celebrated on the 3rd tithi of the bright half=
 of the
month of Vaishakha.  On April 17th we have shukla paksh tritiya of
=
Adhika Vaishakha month and on May 16th we have shukla paksha tritiya of
Nij=
a Vishakha month.  However, since Moon is in Taurus and Sun is in
Aries on =
April 17th, which makes the day eternal, my inclination would
be that it sh=
ould be April 17th but would wait to hear what Narasimhaji
has to say.
