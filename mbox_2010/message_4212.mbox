Namaste,

I have been relieved of black magic problems through homam.=C2=A0=
Keep doing it regularly. Chandi homam is faster and excellent to ward off e=
vil. Even reading Chandi Path regularly soon after doing homam works.=C2=A0=
If you read Chandi=C2=A0path daily no one can harm you. It is sad to see pe=
ople resorting to evil acts and not fearing God anymore. 

Regards,
Priya

Thanks Vijay,

There is no question of destroying her(wife) but to =

but not the material benefit...

Another thing, I am suspecting that some b=
lack tantric/magic may be applied to harm my family, marital peace. How cou=

nt to counter those black magic? Though I know the word "counter" is not ap=
propriate, all of we are children of our supreme god, so he/she will take c=
are of his/her children as decided by him/her...we can only to beg to live =
with our desired way in our version...

gurujis please reply...
Biswajit

N=
B: I am performing the ganapati homam with not a single pray of material be=

 without harming others, please suggest...

Now, I want to ask you a follow-up question, whether I could add some extra=
