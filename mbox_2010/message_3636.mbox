Dear Jitender,
=C2=A0
If these things shape our visulaisations then what is=
 the difference between this sort of visualisation/ hallucination and the D=
ARSHAN of deity.
=C2=A0
Suppose you have a friend named X. When you meet hi=
m, you know it for sure that that IS X standing infront of you. At home if =
by chance you are thinking about X, you form a mental image of the him but =
you know for sure that this is just your mental image. What is the differen=
ce between the mental image of X and the real X? Think along these lines. S=
imilar maybe the difference between having a full darshan of a detiy and im=
agining a deity mentally. The "energy" would be different. The interaction =
would be different. The "feeling" would be different. Also there maybe othe=
r phenomenon outside of your body that may happen when you meet your friend=
 X or have darshan of a deity, which you make you think that it is not some=
thing you have mentally created.
=C2=A0
-Regards

 a homam on my dad's funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as =
per the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a s=
imilar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kiddin=
g to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the=
 smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all ove=

rsion of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a ta=
ngible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black s=
esame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even b=
affled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try and returned b=
ack in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought some gh=

 her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes la=

oved the dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never considered =
the possibility of changing into a different dress. The idea of removing th=
at dress was unbearable to that person. He thought he should wear that dres=
s forever.<BR>> <BR>> The dress became so dirty and torn that it was =
time to change it. A person looking extremely scary came up to the person o=
neday to remove the dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated w=
ith him and tore it apart violently if one fought back. After this scary pe=
rson removed the old dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some =
people became so afraid and
 ashamed when they lost old clothes that they r=
an away and roamed around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, =
they would've soon gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as w=
ell.<BR>> <BR>> The clothes in this parable are akin to the physical =
body we occupy. The person looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personif=
ication of Death. Creator is the person giving new clothes. New body taken =
in the next birth is the new clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame=
 before new clothese are given are like different kinds of spirits.<BR>>=

gt; <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Dear Mem=
bers,<BR>> <BR>> After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this=
 note to share an experience with
 the members on this forum - hoping that =
doing so would elicit some feedback in the form of further guidance. <BR>&g=
t; <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I am a student of Vipassana and have been doi=
ng homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a simple version of Du=
rga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And I have been reading the p=
osts on this forum with much awe and interest. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <=
BR>> On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggl=
ing with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. W=
hen we were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites,=
 my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai =
- 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Ho=
mam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if =
I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how=
 wonderful it would be, if
 an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral =
- so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immed=
iately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I=
 quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do=
 such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started ex=
periencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially<BR>>=
; in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the s=
ensations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would=
 change'. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the leve=
l of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam i=
n my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, s=
o I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery=
 (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) -=
 and he went away
 saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with=
 the above 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. <BR>> <BR>> =
<BR>> <BR>> It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the ve=
ry first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It wa=
s a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (=
by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in =
the direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and=
 sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephe=
w to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and reque=
sted them to let me know if 'something' happens. I had already observed a b=
rown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi's notes) as w=
e reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to=
 behave a little differently (silly me!!):). <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR=
>> I
 closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents=
, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my ver=
y first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am u=
sed to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I con=
tinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I=
 remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pur=
est intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and fou=
nd the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulate=
s some 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmaye=
e' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too=
 in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to=
 give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa,=
 I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have
 done<BR>=
> homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have =
believed and still believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/ n=
ullification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the sa=
me speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure min=
d that I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya a=
nd his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa=
, so please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam.=
 Please pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". <BR>> =
<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> After this mental dialogue, I though of invoking=
 Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Ka=
li etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comforta=
ble with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and th=
e same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which
 Devi form I invo=
ke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-l=
ike pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I tho=
ught of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gan=
grene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was different, and im=
mediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colour with the colo=
ur of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) an=
d I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did me=
ntal Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desir=
e and surrendering of<BR>> my ignorance. I sought permission from the de=
ity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remember clearly=
, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT giv=
e me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT puni=
sh me in any way for doing this.<BR>> <BR>>
 <BR>> <BR>> I had =
a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I =
was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. <B=
R>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> And then I started my mantra chanting (wi=
th swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre=
. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still c=
ontinued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then swit=
ched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was full=
y aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad's funeral. So=
metimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she wa=
s crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet o=
r a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which w=
as opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a littl=
e curious and wanted to see if the dog had
 come and was sitting somewhere =
around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed,=
 but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite t=
he deity, but nevertheless I<BR>> continued. Few minutes later, I heard =
some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black he=
n (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown).=
 It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a gr=
aveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wal=
l. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving arou=
nd the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral a=
nd die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because =
it was amused with the fire particles (which looked like 'jugnus') falling =
down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof =
of the funeral platform. I watched
 the bird for few minutes, laughed at my=
self, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I=
 would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he =
said 30 more minutes. So I<BR>> continued the mental chanting. <BR>> =
<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> And then my cousin signalled me that it was time=
 for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the =
exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet =
itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my =
impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three ti=
mes, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonder=
ing how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire?=
 Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry=
 up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen e=
xactly what was happening, I
 was a little scared because I did not want an=
yone to know that I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptie=
d the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi agai=
n for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and thre=
w it at the funeral<BR>> pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again =
and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (inclu=
ding the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joine=
d the group. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> When I was washing my hand=
s and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tin=
ge to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesam=
e seeds or jaggery??). <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> On the way back =
home and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I woul=
d'nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what ha=
ppened was not strong
 in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I think=
ing about 'it'. There was a certian stillness within my existence that even=
ing. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, ju=
st a sense of 'wonder'. The visualisations could have been a product of my =
own imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence =
was the most beautiful thing. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> The next =
day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but=
 the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my br=
other was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.<BR>> <BR>=
> <BR>> <BR>> Now that it is few days since that incident, I have =
questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumpi=
ng 'madly' around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the f=
act that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Sh=
akti really
 grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visual=
ise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-cons=
tructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? <BR>=
> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I am not sure if these questions can be ans=
wered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the above experien=
ce, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most a=
ppreciative.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Thank you PVR/Manish and Ra=
jarshi for the continued inspiration. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> A=
lso, apologies for the length of the note.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>&g=
