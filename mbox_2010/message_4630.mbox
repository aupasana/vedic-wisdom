 Sundarammal By Swami Abhishiktananda

One day, towards the end of her retr=
eat, she invited me and some other
sadhus to share a meal at her cell. It w=
as the Telugu New Year's Day. It was
then, before the meal began, that she =
told me her story.

She belonged to a wealthy Telugu family of Madras. She =
married young but
very soon lost her husband. As a widow, she continued to =
live at home,
surrounded by the love of her parents and brothers. She rarel=
y went out, and
when she did, it was always with her father. One day he too=
k her to the
neighboring temple to hear a talk given by a sadhu. This sadhu=
 was a devotee
of the Maharshi. He told his audience about the sage's `conv=
ersion,' his
disappearance from the world [leaving Madurai], his resort to =
the mountain
of Arunachala, and the rest.

Sundarammal was deeply moved. Sh=
e begged her father to allow her to
accompany some pilgrims to Arunachala. =
He refused, but promised that he
would soon take her there himself.

Some w=
eeks later, she was alone one night in her room, weeping and calling
on the=
 Maharshi. Then, quite worn out, she fell asleep. Suddenly she felt a
blow =
on her side and awoke with a start. It was about three o' clock in the
morn=
ing. There was the Maharshi standing by the head of her cot. "Come," was
al=
l he said.

She followed him downstairs, crossed the hall and came out on t=
he verandah.
Hardly had she reached it when to her alarm she found herself =
alone. The
Maharshi had disappeared. She sat down uneasily.

Soon a ricksha=
w appeared and the rickshaw puller said: "Is this Number 12,
and are you Su=
ndarammal? An old sadhu told me to come here and take you to
the bus. Get i=
n." Sundarammal thought quite simply, "It is Bhagavan, the
Maharshi," and g=
ot into the rickshaw.

At the bus stand she and the rickshaw puller were bo=
th surprised not to find
the old sadhu. However, she asked for the Tiruvann=
amalai bus and got in.

Somewhere on the way her bus passed another one fro=
m which someone alighted
and then entered the Tiruvannamalai bus. "Are you =
Sundarammal?" he asked.
"Yes, I am," she replied. "Good. Bhagavan has sent =
me to look for you."

In the evening she reached Tiruvannamalai and retired=
 for the night in one
of the large halls kept for pilgrims. She prepared a =
cake to offer to
Bhagavan and fell asleep full of joy.

The next morning sh=
e went to the Ashram and fell at the feet of Bhagavan.
"Here you are at las=
t," he said to her.

Some days later her brothers arrived, unable to unders=
tand how this child,
who by herself had never set foot outside her home, co=
uld have managed to
reach Tiruvannamalai. But Sundarammal was so deeply abs=
orbed that she never
even saw her brothers, either in the hall or at midday=
 in the dining hall.
Only in the evening were they able to approach her. Th=
ey told her how upset
everyone was at home and begged her to return. If she=
 wanted, they would
build her a hermitage in the garden. But nothing moved =
her and the brothers
even spoke of taking her home by force. "If you do, I =
will throw myself into
a well," she said. Her brothers had to yield, but th=
ey soon returned with
their father. They found her in a cottage near the As=
hram and arranged for
her continued stay there as well as they could.

Duri=
ng the fifteen years that remained of the Maharshi's life, she never
left T=
iruvannamalai even for a day.

This was the story that Sundarammal told me =
that morning=E2=80=94Sundarammal who
could never speak of God without her v=
oice breaking with emotion and her
eyes filling with tears.
