 *Talk 25.*

On a former occasion B. V. Narasimha Swami, author of Self-Rea=
lization,
asked: *Who am I? How is it to be found?*

M.: Ask yourself the q=
uestion. *The body (annamaya kosa) and its functions
are not =E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99.*

Going deeper, *the mind (manomaya kosa) and its functions are not=
 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.*

T*he next step takes on to the question. =E2=80=9CW=
herefrom do these thoughts
arise?=E2=80=9D* The thoughts are spontaneous, s=
uperficial or analytical. They
operate in intellect. Then, who is aware of =
them?*The analysis leads to the
conclusion that the individuality of the pe=
rson is operative as the
perceiver of the existence of thoughts and of thei=
r sequence.This
individuality is the ego, or as people say =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99. Vijnanamaya kosa (intellect)
is only the sheath of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=
 and not the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 itself.*

*Enquiring further the questions=
 arise, =E2=80=9CWho is this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99? Wherefrom does it
come?=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 was not aware in sleep. Simultaneously with i=
ts rise sleep
changes to dream or wakefulness. If I originated from sleep, =
then the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99
was covered up with ignorance. Such an ignoran=
t =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 cannot be what the
scriptures say or the wise ones af=
firm.=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 am beyond even =E2=80=98Sleep=E2=80=99; *=E2=80=98=
I=E2=80=99 must
be now and here and what I was all along in sleep and dream=
s also, without
the qualities of such
states. *=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 must the=
refore be the unqualified substratum underlying these
three states (anandam=
aya kosa transcended).*

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is, in brief, beyond the five =
sheaths. Next, the residuum left over
after discarding all that is not-self=
 is the Self, Sat-Chit-Ananda.

*D.: How is that Self to be known or realis=
ed?*

M.: Transcend the present plane of relativity. *A separate being (Sel=
f)
appears to know something apart from itself (non-Self). That is, the sub=
ject
is aware of the object. The seer is drik; the seen is drisya.*

There =
must be a unity underlying these two, which arises as =E2=80=98ego=E2=80=99=
.This ego
is of the nature of chit (intelligence); achit (insentient object=
) is only
negation of chit. Therefore the underlying essence is akin to the=
 subject
and not the object. *Seeking the drik, until all
drisya disappears=
, the drik will become subtler and subtler until the
absolute drik alone su=
rvives. This process is called drisya vilaya (the
disappearance of the obje=
ctive world).*

*D.: Why should the objects drisya be eliminated? Cannot th=
e Truth be
realised even keeping the object as it is?*

*M.: No. Eliminatio=
n of drisya means elimination of separate identities of
the subject and obj=
ect. The object is unreal. All drisya (including ego) is
the object. Elimin=
ating the unreal, the Reality survives.When a rope is
mistaken for a snake,=
 it is enough to remove the
erroneous perception of the snake for the truth=
 to be revealed.Without such
elimination the truth will not dawn.*

*D.: Wh=
en and how is the disappearance of the objective world (drisya
vilaya) to b=
e effected?*

M.: *It is complete when the relative subject, namely the min=
d, is
eliminated. The mind is the creator of the subject and the object and=
 is the
cause of the dualistic idea.* Therefore, it is the cause of the wro=
ng notion
of limited self and the misery consequent on such erroneous idea.=


D.: What is the relation between mind and object? Is the mind contacting
=
something different from it, viz., the world?

M.: The world is =E2=80=98se=
nsed=E2=80=99 in the waking and the dream states or is the
object of percep=
tion and thought, both being mental activities.

*If there were no such act=
ivities as waking and dreaming thought, there
would be no =E2=80=98percepti=
on=E2=80=99 or inference of a =E2=80=98world=E2=80=99. In sleep there is no=

such activity and =E2=80=98objects and world=E2=80=99 do not exist for us =
in sleep.*Hence
=E2=80=98reality of the world=E2=80=99 may be created by th=
e ego by its act of emergence
from sleep; and that reality may be swallowed=
 up or disappear by the soul
resuming its nature in sleep. *The emergence a=
nd disappearance of the world
are like the spider producing a gossamer web =
and then withdrawing it.*

The spider here underlies all the three states -=
 waking, dreaming, and
sleep; such a spider in the person is called Atman (=
Self), whereas the same
with reference to the world (which is considered to=
 issue from the sun) is
called Brahman (Supreme Spirit). He that is in man =
is the same as He that is
in the sun. (Sa yaschayam purushe yaschasavaditye=
 sa ekah).

*While Self or Spirit is unmanifest and inactive, there are no =
relative
doubles; e.g., subject and object - drik and drisya. If the enquir=
y into the
ultimate cause of manifestation of mind itself is pushed on,mind=
 will be
found to be only the manifestation of the Real which is
otherwise =
called Atman or Brahman.*
