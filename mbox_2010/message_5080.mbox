Rajrishi Ji 

Just my thoughts. From the below quote 

"That sort of samadh=
i is always seperate from the normal waking 'you'"

In the first paragraph =
Vimalananda is probably talking about Savikalpa samadhi where some amount o=
f duality is still retained with the sadhaka aiming for merging into his Is=
tha .As long as the deity comes to play with the Sadhaka , he would be comp=
letely happy and when the deity leaves completely forlorn like a lover.Exam=
ple : Ramakrishna used to cry like a madman from the rooftops when the divi=
ne mother kali used to leave after granting him the visions.

In the last u=
nderlined lines Vimalananda must be referring to Nirvikalpa Samadhi where t=
ime has ceased to matter which also renders space useless . Sort of like mo=
ving on from mother to the father ( Mahakala -Devourer of time ) .

Even Ra=
makrishna had to move beyond the image of the Goddess to receive the final =
samadhi from Totapuri . 

In one of the 3 books remember that Vimalananda m=
entions that even Nirvikalpa samadhi is not the end , there are further rea=
lms of consciousness through which one ascends to become a rishi , avadhuta=
 ,siddha .

That is how probably the NavNaths or Rishis seem to weave playf=
ully between the realms.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
