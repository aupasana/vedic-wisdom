Namaste all,

When I first read the news about swamiji, I didn't get shocke=
d but got scared rather. If such a knowledgeble person can fall like this (=
 provided the news is true) how about a normal person like me !! How many t=
ests we need to face in our life time? This is not just about lust. How abo=
ut greed, anger, being too emotional ? I sincerely pray God to give me stre=
ngth to fight with these inner enemies of mine. 

I also think this should =
be a lesson to everyone who concentrates more on the Swamijis than on their=
 teachings. People show more interest in getting the attention of the Guru,=
 they want to touch him, they want miracles from him, they praise the glow =
in his face and in his eyes. They feel proud if the Guru gives a little att=
ention to them. While doing all this they completely forget God. If the fol=
lowers of swamiji are really God minded, they would have forgiven him rathe=
r than destroying the Dhyana Peethams and burning his photos and developing=
 so much ill feelings towards him. This shows they didn't digest his teachi=
ngs. They want their Guru to be perfect not themselves. 

Regards,
Padmaja
