Rajrishi ji

:) Many times I look at your messages and smile in agreement =
for often you echo similar thoughts.

Samarth Ramadas Ji was an spiritual c=
ollossus who had the direct experience of Sri Ramachandra on the lofty peak=
s of the himalayas.As you have rightly pointed out he was beside Shivaji in=
 guiding him in many ways.

:) It is all the play of the divine mother..If =
shivaji did not exist ,neither would have the south or maharatta country  s=
urvived.Like an mighty Vindhya mountain Shivaji stopped the onslaught on th=
e culture and dharma of the Land.


So was the great Vidyaranya Swami menti=
oned by Vimalananda in Chapter 1 ...The great guru and Sri Vidya Sadhaka of=
 Hari Hara Raya and Bukka raya. The forefathers of the Vijayanagara king Kr=
ishnadevaraya.


Why do we have to question what the peetadhipathis or guru=
s are doing .Nature has its own ways of doing things and their own good kar=
ma has given them that role  and what they do  need not follow the black an=
d white convoluted logic or political correctness expected by us.

Regards
=
Vemparla Ram Kishore

 Also, I personally do not agree that a saint cannot interfere in the polit=
ical situation of a country. Dharma depends on the desh-kaal-patra. Swami R=
amdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspired Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the =
Moghuls. Had it not been so, today Kashi would have remained Muhammadabad a=
