and attri=

The persona (body-name-entity) =
one inhabits on earth is a *temporary*

attributes of that persona, one gets bound. Inst=

that persona to fulfill dharma without forming an =
attachment. An
attachment to a persona brings many happinesses and many mis=
eries and
binds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At th=
e end
of the day, everything that is temporary perishes.
> =C2

 that pride can strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has
an attachment t=

contemplating and guard=

suppressed for a while, comes back=
 again, is suppressed again, comes
back again and so on. This cycle goes on=
 until one's attachment to the
persona is killed completely. This is a long=
 process. Don't worry too

closed=
 his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that this place
has a trem=

Manish started the =
homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him
doing the Chandi path, try=

my mind was also trying to ad=
just itself to the ambience. There were
quite a few people around watching =
what we were upto. But no one
disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood=
 from the pyre to light
other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner =

pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish=
 indicated to
him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and d=

disturb that pyre again.

As=C2 I=C2 read the Chandi I felt a great pr=

all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on m=

tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forg=
