Namaste Satish Ji,

First of all i must say that I was happy & impressed to=
 see your message and the honesty with which you went about writing such de=
tailed critique.

1) Narasimha Garu says that "Accumulated Shakti" is the p=
rimary pre-requisite to bring about the specific result of any specific rit=
ual.

you are of the opinion that It is not so and he is a mere Technician =
who is expert of performing ritual as prescribed and result is entirely bec=
ause of the invoked deity.

Both the views are correct to me only the subtl=
e understanding is needed. I am of the opinion that if the priest does not =
posses at least a little spiritual power, He can not invoke deity's presenc=
e however expert and perfectionist he is in performing a ritual.

Yes, i ag=
ree with you that "Results" are given because Deity is pleased by the ritua=
l and offerings BUT can a divine deity will even be present if invoked by a=
 person who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even far away.

It is wel=
l known that Brahamana's of yore were following very stringent, disciplined=
, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote good amount=
 of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majority of them. =
every Yuga has every yuga present as you correctly said). I think, because =
of that highly evolved life style and off course equipped with expertise of=
 performing various rituals, they were fit to become mediators between Yaja=
mana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefore capable of invoking Devine=
 preence to the best of his ability and get the results for the Yajamana.

=
So here i am sure you'll see point of "caliber" factor for person performin=
g the ritual for "Materialistic Desires" of 3rd party (i.e. Yajamana).

2) =
You have mis-understood "Bagging bawl" "Beggars" etc... With the term begga=
rs, He basically means most of us who are "Helpless & hopelessly Trapped" "=
Aspirants" who cry to mother for the release. It is not to be meant as a de=
grading term for the "Imperishable Self".
"Tamupeihi Mahaaraja Sharanam Tva=
m Parameshwari"
"Aaaraadhitaa Saivanrunaam bhog swargaapavargadaa"

Request=
 you to understand Narasimha a little deeper. Please do not take words lite=
rally. And in reality, to be blunt, most of us are "Beggars". We pray (beg)=
 for good life, good Job, good Money, good House, best of this and best of =
that and best of all that. we seldomly say to god "without" folded hands th=
at God tussi great Ho. Mujhe kuch nahi chahiye....tujhe kuch chahiye to bol=
...chal tujhe main mera pyaar deta hu tu bhi kyaa yaad karega ki kis rais s=
e paalaa pada tha"

3) I am very happy that you gave indirect answer to my =
earlier question to a different Gentleman, when you said this about Homa:

=
[Yes, as this concept is blessed by divine mother homa is going to be popul=
ar sadhana in coming years.]

Yes Narasimha is in Hurry. He has a finite li=
fe and there is a lot to start just like Vivekananda was in a hurry! But re=
st assured that hurry is also due to wish of Chandi and Narasimha, in my op=
inion, has become one of the best instruments of Jagadamba!!!

But Again, i=
 really appreciated your pointing apprehensions. 


Warm Regards,

Utpal
Na=
maschandikayei!
