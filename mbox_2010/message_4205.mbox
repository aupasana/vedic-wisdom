*Kaaba a Hindu Temple?*

[Note: A rec=
ent archeological find in Kuwait unearthed a gold-plated statue
of the Hind=
u deity Ganesh. A Muslim resident of Kuwait requested historical
research m=
aterial that can help explain the connection between Hindu
civilisation and=
 Arabia.]

Was the Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple?
By P.N. Oak (Historian)=


Glancing through some research material recently, I was pleasantly surpri=
sed
to come across a reference to a *king Vikramaditya* inscription found i=
n the
Kaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed=
 a part
of his Indian Empire.

The text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscrip=
tion, found inscribed on a gold
dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca,=
 is found recorded on page 315 of
a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=
=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania
library in Istanbul, Turkey. =
Rendered in free English the inscription says:

"Fortunate are those who we=
re born (and lived) during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign.
He was a noble, gen=
erous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his
subjects. But at that ti=
me we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual
pleasures. Plotting and=
 torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had
enveloped our country.=
 Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel
paws of a wolf we Arabs=
 were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was
enveloped in a darknes=
s so intense as on a new moon night. But the present
dawn and pleasant suns=
hine of education is the result of the favour of the
noble king Vikramadity=
a whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of
us- foreigners as we w=
ere. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent
scholars whose brill=
iance shone like that of the sun from his country to
ours. These scholars a=
nd preceptors through whose benevolence we were once
again made cognisant o=
f the presence of God, introduced to His sacred
existence and put on the ro=
ad of Truth, had come to our country to preach
their religion and impart ed=
ucation at king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s behest."

For those who would like t=
o read the Arabic wording I reproduce it hereunder
in Roman script:

"Itras=
haphai Santu Ibikramatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru
Bihill=
ahaya Samaini Ela Motakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara
phaj=
jal asari nahone osirom bayjayhalem. Yundan blabin Kajan blnaya

adunya kanateph netephi bejehalin Atadari bilamasa- rateen phakef
tasabuhu =
kaunnieja majekaralhada walador. As hmiman burukankad toluho
watastaru hihi=
la Yakajibaymana balay kulk amarena phaneya jaunabilamary
Bikramatum".

(Pa=
ge 315 Sayar-ul-okul).

[Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-okul=E2=80=99 sig=
nifies memorable words.]

A careful analysis of the above inscription enabl=
es us to draw the following
conclusions:

1.      That the ancient Indian e=
mpires may have extended up to the eastern
boundaries of Arabia until Vikra=
maditya and that it was he who for the first
time conquered Arabia. Because=
 the inscription says that king Vikram who
dispelled the darkness of ignora=
nce from Arabia.

2.      That, whatever their earlier faith, King Vikrama=
=E2=80=99s preachers had
succeeded in spreading the Vedic (based on the Ved=
as, the Hindu sacred
scriptures)) way of life in Arabia.

3.      That the =
knowledge of Indian arts and sciences was imparted by
Indians to the Arabs =
directly by founding schools, academies and cultural
centres. The belief, t=
herefore, that visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge
to their own lands th=
rough their own indefatigable efforts and scholarship
is unfounded.

An anc=
illary conclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi,
India)=
 could well be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest =
of
Arabia. This conclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the
in=
scription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the
m=
arriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika.
Thi=
s Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be
tha=
t Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who
conc=
luded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor.
Secondly, =
the township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli
after Mi=
hira who was the renowned astronomer-mathematician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s=

court. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=
=80=99 signifying a
row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and ass=
istants working on
astronomical observations made from the tower.

Having s=
een the far reaching and history shaking implications of the Arabic
inscrip=
tion concerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story
of its =
find. How it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What
are t=
he other proofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers
of th=
e Indian Vedic way of life and that tranquillity and education were
ushered=
 into Arabia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an=

uneasy period of "ignorance and turmoil" mentioned in the inscription.

In=
 Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania,
wh=
ich is reputed to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian
literat=
ure. In the Arabic section of that library is an anthology of ancient
Arabi=
c poetry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742
und=
er the orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim.

The pages of that volume =
are of Hareer =E2=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on.
Each page has a=
 decorative gilded border. That anthology is known as
Sayar-ul-Okul. It is =
divided into three parts. The first part contains
biographic details and th=
e poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets.
The second part embodie=
s accounts and verses of poets of the period
beginning just after prophet M=
ohammad=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the
Banee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The t=
hird part deals with later poets up to the end
of Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=
=80=99s times.

Abu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate =
of
Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology.
=

The first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed an=
d published in
Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in=
 Beirut in 1932.

The collection is regarded as the most important and auth=
oritative anthology
of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light =
on the social life,
customs, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Ara=
bia. The book also
contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine =
of Mecca, the town
and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held =
every year around
the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers t=
hat the annual haj
of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic co=
ngregation.

But the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a forum=
 for the elite
and the learned to discuss the social, religious, political,=
 literary and
other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =E2=
=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99
asserts that the conclusion reached at those d=
iscussions were widely
respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, follo=
wed the Varanasi
tradition (of India) of providing a venue for important di=
scussions among
the learned while the masses congregated there for spiritua=
l bliss. The
principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Ar=
vasthan
(Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva)=
 emblems
can be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims =
reverently
touch and kiss in the Kaaba.

Arabic tradition has lost trace of=
 the founding of the Kaaba temple. The
discovery of the Vikramaditya inscri=
ption affords a clue. King Vikramaditya
is known for his great devotion to =
Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India),
the capital of Vikramaditya, exists=
 the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of
Lord Shankara (Siva) associated wi=
th Vikramaditya. Since according to the
Vikramaditya inscription he spread =
the Vedic religion, who else but he could
have founded the Kaaba temple in =
Mecca?

A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars the entry=
 of any
non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days when the K=
aaba was
stormed and captured solely for the newly established faith of Isl=
am. The
object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prevent its=

recapture.

As the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to shave his=
 head and
beard and to don special sacred attire that consists of two seaml=
ess sheets
of white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and the other =
over the
shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic practice=
 of
entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white sheets.

The=
 main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as the
Kaaba.=
 It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates from the
days=
 when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by
camouflaging =
it.

According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 images.
T=
raditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 destroyed=

when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the Moon an=
d
yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs
=
worshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of
=
=E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is s=
till in vogue.
Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon.

In India the crescen=
t moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva
symbol. Since that=
 symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it
came to be grafted =
on the flag of Islam.

Another Hindu tradition associated with the Kaaba is=
 that of the sacred
stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). Accor=
ding to the Hindu
tradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva emblem=
 as the crescent
moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-exist=
. True to that
association a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its water =
is held sacred
because it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pr=
e-Islamic times
(Zam-Zam water).

[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who go=
 to the Kaaba for Haj regard this
Zam-Zam water with reverence and take som=
e bottled water with them as sacred
water.]

Muslim pilgrims visiting the K=
aaba temple go around it seven times. In no
other mosque does the circumamb=
ulation prevail. Hindus invariably
circumambulate around their deities. Thi=
s is yet another proof that the
Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiva =
temple where the Hindu practice
of circumambulation is still meticulously o=
bserved.

The practice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskri=
t- is
associated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culmina=
ting
rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round =
the
sacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Sinc=
e
"Makha" means fire, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca was=

the seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia.

It might come as a stun=
ning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself
is San=
skrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They
signify=
 a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskr=
it chants
invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahisha=
surmardini.
The Islamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but =
the ancient
Sanskrit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah mea=
ns mother or
goddess and mother goddess.

One Koranic verse is an exact tra=
nslation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This
was pointed out by the great re=
search scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in
one of his articles.

[Note: A=
nother scholar points out that the following teaching from the Koran
is exa=
ctly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7).

The Koran:

"Sig=
ht perceives Him not. But He perceives men's sights; for He is the
knower o=
f secrets, the Aware."

Kena Upanishad:

"That which cannot be seen by the =
eye but through which the eye itself sees,
know That to be Brahman (God) an=
d not what people worship here (in the
manifested world)."

A simplified me=
aning of both the above verses reads:

God is one and that He is beyond man=
's sensory experience.

The identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows t=
hat Unani is just the
Arabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taugh=
t to them and
administered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian =
empire.

It will now be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still =
prevailing
in West Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during=
 the last
1300 years. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as th=
e core of
Islamic practice.

The Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People =
in Asia Minor too worshipped
33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar =
calendar was introduced in
West Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim mon=
th =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 signifying the
=E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Ad=
hik Maas) in the Hindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is
the corrupt form =
of Ravi meaning the sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into
P=
rakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit l=
anguage). The
Muslim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu E=
kadashi (Gyrah
=3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.

The =
Islamic practice of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh
Yagn=
as or sacrifices of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The
Islamic=
 word Eed for festive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore
a pure=
 Sanskrit word. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb.
Since i=
n ancient times the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in
Aries, =
the occasion was celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin
of the=
 Bakari Eed festival.

[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word fo=
r a goat.]

Since Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99=
, the Islamic word Idgah
signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 whi=
ch is the exact Sanskrit connotation of
the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=
=98Namaz=E2=80=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99
an=
d =E2=80=98Yajna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping.

Ved=
ic descriptions about the moon, the different stellar constellations and
th=
e creation of the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran
p=
art 1 chapter 2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37
a=
nd chapter 10, stanzas 4 to 7.

Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes =
its origin to the Vedic
injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- P=
anch-Maha-Yagna) which is
part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all=
 individuals.

Muslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body b=
efore commencing
prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Sh=
areer Shydhyartham
Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99.

Four months of the year are =
regarded as very sacred in Islamic custom. The
devout are enjoined to absta=
in from plunder and other evil deeds during that
period. This originates in=
 the Chaturmasa i.e., the four-month period of
special vows and austerities=
 in Hindu tradition. Shabibarat is the corrupt
form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva=
 Ratra. Since the Kaaba has been an important
centre of Shiva (Siva) worshi=
p from times immemorial, the Shivaratri
festival used to be celebrated ther=
e with great gusto. It is that festival
which is signified by the Islamic w=
ord Shabibarat.

Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the =
side of the Kaaba
walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, =
according to the
correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. B=
ut according to
hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit=
, and some of
them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita.

According to extant=
 Islamic records, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia,
particularly in Y=
emen, and their life and manners deeply influenced those
who came in touch =
with them. At Ubla there was a large number of Indian
settlements. This sho=
ws that Indians were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient
strength and command=
ing position to be able to influence the local people.
This could not be po=
ssible unless they belonged to the ruling class.

It is mentioned in the Ab=
adis i.e., the authentic traditions of Prophet
Mohammad compiled by Imam Bu=
khari that the Indian tribe of Jats had settled
in Arabia before Prophet Mo=
hammad=E2=80=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of
the Prophet, was t=
aken ill, her nephew sent for a Jat physician for her
treatment. This prove=
s that Indians enjoyed a high and esteemed status in
Arabia. Such a status =
could not be theirs unless they were the rulers.
Bukhari also tells us that=
 an Indian Raja (king) sent a jar of ginger
pickles to the Prophet. This sh=
ows that the Indian Jat Raja ruled an
adjacent area so as to be in a positi=
on to send such an insignificant
present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is =
said to have so highly relished it
as to have told his colleagues also to p=
artake of it. These references show
that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=
=99s times Indians retained their influential
role in Arabia, which was a d=
windling legacy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times.

The Islamic term =E2=80=
=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 th=
at is
worship of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commem=
orate
their ancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved=
 for
their remembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-u=
l-Fitr=E2=80=99
(worship of forefathers).

The Islamic practice of observin=
g the moon rise before deciding on
celebrating the occasion derives from th=
e Hindu custom of breaking fast on
Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only af=
ter sighting the moon.

Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating =
those dead in battle or
by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit traditi=
on because in Sanskrit
=E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=
=99. Hindus observe Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those
who have died in =
battle.

The word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The=
 original
word is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=
=80=99 is Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original
Sanskrit name of the la=
nd is =E2=80=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means=
 a horse.
Arvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arab=
ia is
famous for its horses.

This discovery changes the entire complexion =
of the history of ancient
India. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts=
 about the king who had the
largest empire in history. It could be that the=
 expanse of king
Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all=
 others. Secondly, the
idea that the Indian empire spread only to the east =
and not in the west
beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thir=
dly the effeminate
and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country=
 in the world could
by some age spread her benign and beatific cultural inf=
luence, language,
customs, manners and education over distant lands without=
 militarily
conquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countr=
ies
physically wherever traces of its culture and language are still extant=
 and
the region extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Balti=
c in
Northern Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that =
while
Indian rulers identified themselves with the local population and
est=
ablished welfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands
perpe=
tuated untold atrocities over the vanquished.

=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=
=99 tells us that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held
in Mecca at=
 the annual Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets
used to parti=
cipate in it.

Poems considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved=
 on gold plate
were hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goats=
kin were hung
outside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasu=
re house of the
best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tr=
adition.

That tradition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic composit=
ions were
engraved and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. B=
ut most of
the poems got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaab=
a by Prophet
Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, H=
assan-bin-Sawik, who was among
the invaders, captured some of the treasured=
 poems and dumped the gold plate
on which they were inscribed in his own ho=
me. Sawik=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to
earn a reward carried those gold pl=
ates to Khalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the
well-known Arab scholar Abu=
 Amir Asamai. The latter received from the bearer
five gold plates and 16 l=
eather sheets with the prize-winning poems engraved
on them. The bearer was=
 sent away happy bestowed with a good reward.

On the five gold plates were=
 inscribed verses by ancient Arab poets like
Labi Baynay, Akhatab-bin-Turfa=
 and Jarrham Bintoi. That discovery made
Harun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to =
compile a collection of all earlier
compositions. One of the compositions i=
n the collection is a tribute in
verse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned A=
rab poet, to king Vikramaditya.
Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet M=
ohammad had received the highest
award for the best poetic compositions for=
 three years in succession in the
pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every=
 year. All those three poems of
Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the K=
aaba temple, inscribed on gold
plates. One of these constituted an unreserv=
ed tribute to King Vikramaditya
for his paternal and filial rule over Arabi=
a. That has already been quoted
above.

Pre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=
=80=99s tribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive
evidence that it was kin=
g Vikramaditya who first conquered the Arabian
Peninsula and made it a part=
 of the Indian Empire. This explains why
starting from India towards the we=
st we have all Sanskrit names like
Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan), Baluchis=
than, Kurdisthan, Tajikiathan,
Uzbekisthan,  Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasth=
an, Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan)
etc.

Historians have blundered in not givin=
g due weight to the evidence provided
by Sanskrit names pervading over the =
entire west Asian region. Let us take a
contemporary instance. Why did a pa=
rt of India get named Nagaland even after
the end of British rule over Indi=
a? After all historical traces are wiped
out of human memory, will a future=
 age historian be wrong if he concludes
from the name Nagaland that the Bri=
tish or some English speaking power must
have ruled over India? Why is Port=
uguese spoken in Goa (part of India), and
French in Pondichery (part of Ind=
ia), and both French and English in Canada?
Is it not because those people =
ruled over the territories where their
languages are spoken? Can we not the=
n justly conclude that wherever traces
of Sanskrit names and traditions exi=
st Indians once held sway? It is
unfortunate that this important piece of d=
ecisive evidence has been ignored
all these centuries.

Another question wh=
ich should have presented itself to historians for
consideration is how cou=
ld it be that Indian empires could extend in the
east as far as Korea and J=
apan, while not being able to make headway beyond
Afghanisthan? In fact lan=
d campaigns are much easier to conduct than by sea.
It was the Indians who =
ruled the entire West Asian region from Karachi to
Hedjaz and who gave Sans=
krit names to those lands and the towns therein,
introduce their pantheon o=
f the fire-worship, imparted education and
established law and order.

It m=
ay be that Arabia itself was not part of the Indian empire until king
Vikra=
ma , since Bintoi says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time
brou=
ght about a radical change in the social, cultural and political life of
Ar=
abia. It may be that the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian
=
rule before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or a=
s
a remote possibility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted=
 a
series of brilliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region bet=
ween
Afghanisthan and Hedjaz.

Incidentally this also explains why king Vik=
ramaditya is so famous in
history. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness=
 of heart and his impartial
filial affection for all his subjects, whether =
Indian or Arab, as testified
by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanen=
tly enshrined in the pages of
history because he was the world=E2=80=99s gr=
eatest ruler having the largest empire.
It should be remembered that only a=
 monarch with a vast empire gets famous
in world history. Vikram Samvat (ca=
lendar still widely in use in India
today) which he initiated over 2000 yea=
rs ago may well mark his victory over
Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar=
 (Kutub Tower in Delhi), a pillar
commemorating that victory and the conseq=
uential marriage with the Vaihika
(Balkh) princess as testified by the near=
by iron pillar inscription.

A great many puzzles of ancient world history =
get automatically solved by a
proper understanding of these great conquests=
 of king Vikramaditya. As
recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars=
, preachers and social
workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached t=
he Vedic way of life,
manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, t=
rained the local people
in irrigation and agriculture and established in th=
ose regions a democratic,
orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way =
of life. That was of
course, a Vedic Hindu way of life.

It is from such an=
cient times that Indian Kshtriya royal families, like the
Pahalvis and Barm=
aks, have held sway over Iran and Iraq. It is those
conquests, which made t=
he Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshippers. It is
therefore that we find =
the Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sanskritised
dialect, fire temples exist=
ing thousands of miles away from India, and
scores of sites of ancient Indi=
an cultural centres like Navbahar in West
Asia and the numerous viharas in =
Soviet Russia spread throughout the world.
Ever since so many viharas are o=
ften dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient Indian
sculptures are also found in e=
xcavations in Central Asia. The same goes for
West Asia.

[Note: Ancient In=
dian sculptures include metal statues of the Hindu deity
Ganesh (the elepha=
nt headed god); the most recent find being in Kuwait].

Unfortunately these=
 chapters of world history have been almost obliterated
from public memory.=
 They need to be carefully deciphered and rewritten. When
these chapters ar=
e rewritten they might change the entire concept and
orientation of ancient=
 history.

In view of the overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scho=
lars,
students of history and lay men alike should take note that they had =
better
revise their text books of ancient world history. The existence of H=
indu
customs, shrines, Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns=
 and
the Vikramaditya inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumpi=
ng
proof that Indian Kshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali t=
o
Baltic and Korea to Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.
