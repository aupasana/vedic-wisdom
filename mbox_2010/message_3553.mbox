CHAPTER XI



Of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress



We may=
 enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying

ourselves with the sa=
yings and doings of others, and things which

concern not ourselves.  How c=
an he abide long time in peace who

occupieth himself with other men's matt=
ers, and with things

without himself, and meanwhile payeth little or rare =
heed to the

self within?  Blessed are the single-hearted, for they shall h=
ave

abundance of peace.



2. How came it to pass that many of the Saints =
were so perfect,

so contemplative of Divine things?  Because they steadfas=
tly

sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so

were en=
abled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free

and at leisure f=
or the thought of Him.  We are too much occupied

with our own affections, =
and too anxious about transitory things.

Seldom, too, do we entirely conqu=
er even a single fault, nor are

we zealous for daily growth in grace.  And=
 so we remain lukewarm

and unspiritual.



3. Were we fully watchful of ou=
rselves, and not bound in spirit

to outward things, then might we be wise =
unto salvation, and make

progress in Divine contemplation.  Our great and =
grievous

stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and
=

desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the

Saints.  And =
when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly

are we cast down, and=
 fly to the world to give us comfort.



4. If we would quit ourselves like=
 men, and strive to stand firm

in the battle, then should we see the Lord =
helping us from Heaven.

For He Himself is alway ready to help those who st=
rive and who

trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions of striving,=
 to

the end that we may win the victory.  If we look upon our

progress in=
 religion as a progress only in outward observances

and forms, our devoutn=
ess will soon come to an end.  But let us

lay the axe to the very root of =
our life, that, being cleansed

from affections, we may possess our souls i=
n peace.



5. If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we

sh=
ould go quickly on to perfection.  But on the contrary, we

often feel that=
 we were better and holier in the beginning of our

conversion than after m=
any years of profession.  Zeal and

progress ought to increase day by day; =
yet now it seemeth a great

thing if one is able to retain some portion of =
his first ardour.

If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the b=
eginning,

then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and=


joy.



6. It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder
=

thing to go contrary to our own will.  Yet if thou overcome not

slight an=
d easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones?

Withstand thy will=
 at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit,

lest it lead thee little by =
little into worse difficulties.  Oh,

if thou knewest what peace to thyself=
 thy holy life should bring

to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh=
 thou wouldst be

more zealous for spiritual profit.
