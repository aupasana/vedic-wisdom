 The truth of the Namaskara is just that Silence, wherein the ego, who is
t=
he (sole) cause of the distinction between disciple and the Guru, and
betwe=
en God and the soul, springs up no more. (139)

So long as one has the noti=
on =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, he does not become illumined,
even thou=
gh he has (the merit of) great self-discipline; look upon him as
only a sad=
haka (one that is on the path). (127)

As a lion seen in a dream by an elep=
hant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a
sage, awakens the disciple from th=
e dream of ignorance. (135)

True adoration is becoming dissolved in the se=
a of the homogeneous essence
of the Experience of the Self, just as hail ge=
ts dissolved in the sea. (140)

As a deer seized by a tiger (cannot escape)=
, so a disciple on whom the
Guru=E2=80=99s gracious looks have rested will =
never be let go, but will surely be
led to the State of Kaivalyam. (143)

I=
t is by delusion that one says: =E2=80=98I have seen this Sage, I shall see=
 that
one also;=E2=80=99 if he knows the Sage that is within himself, then =
all Sages will
be (seen to be) one and the same. (131)

The Guru reduces on=
ly the unreal to nothing, and (thus) causing the one Real
Self to shine; th=
ereby he kills, without killing, the false ego. (132)

Adoration of the Gur=
u is just not taking back the gift, by means of the
ideas, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, after surrendering to the Guru everything i=
ncluding
the body. (142)

The meaning of the saying that one should not app=
roach the Guru
empty-handed, is simply this. =E2=80=9COne should go to him,=
 who is not distinct
from the Supreme Being, with heart full of love=E2=80=
=9D. (141)

As in a great forest, a roving robust elephant, seeing the eyes=
 of a lion in
the darkness of night, loses life and is eaten up by him, so =
the ego, named
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, roving in the forest of Relativity, is =
killed by the Guru by mere
sight, and is eaten up by Him, out of Grace. (13=
3 & 134)

Know that he who regards the Guru, who is enlightened and is noth=
ing but
unlimited Pure Consciousness as a mere human being is a most sinful=
 person
with a impure mind. (128)

Sages alone are the virtuous ones; ignor=
ant ones are without virtue;
therefore, for the sake of Deliverance, one sh=
ould cultivate the society of
the Sages, who are delivered from the untruth=
. (138)

The teaching of the Guru is just the dwelling in the Heart, throug=
h the
Experience of the One Reality, won by turning the one-pointed mind in=
wards
after understanding that Truth (intellectually). (137)

Sages alone a=
re the virtuous ones; ignorant ones are without virtue;
therefore, for the =
sake of Deliverance, one should cultivate the society of
the Sages, who are=
 delivered from the untruth. (138)

The teaching of the Guru is just the dw=
elling in the Heart, through the
Experience of the One Reality, won by turn=
ing the one-pointed mind inwards
after understanding that Truth (intellectu=
ally). (137)

The Supreme Lord Himself appears as Guru in human form to the=
 aspirant,
being pleased with (his) devotion. (129)

For those who shine as=
 Self, which is Grace =E2=80=93 since their mind, is the form
of ignorance,=
 has died =E2=80=93 everything and every place will be found to be
supremel=
y Blissful in their divine view, which emerged as Self-Existence.
(346)

Fi=
rmly abiding as =E2=80=98I am I=E2=80=99, without any movement of the mind,=
 is the
attainment of Godhood (Sivatvasiddhi). (Because) the shining of the=
 truly
well-established state of knowledge (Self-knowledge) where nothing e=
xists
other than that (knowledge) is pure Siva? (900)

Listen to the clue t=
o attain the reality which abides (as =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99) within the
kn=
owledge (the mind) as the knowledge to the knowledge (i.e, as the Self
whic=
h gives light to the mind); to scrutinize and cognize the object (the
mind)=
 by that same knowledge (enquiring =E2=80=98What is it?=E2=80=99 or Who am =
I?=E2=80=99) is the
means to abide within (as the reality). (899)

The divi=
ne life (of abiding as Self) alone is the life of supreme reality.
On the o=
ther hand, life in the world which is seen, is a life of delusion.
What an =
illusion (maya) it is to love a life of fear (fearing death). Is not
that (=
life of fear) merely (one=E2=80=99s ) drowning in the play of the
mind-illu=
sion? (1095)

Realization is for everyone. Realization makes no difference =
between the
aspirants. This very doubt, whether you can realize, and the no=
tion
=E2=80=98I-have-not-realized=E2=80=99 are themselves the obstacles. Be=
 free from these
obstacles. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospal)

Guru, the Lord of =
Jnana, who is the power of the unlimited greatness of
Self, is the Supreme =
Silence which completely defeats the worthless
arguments of those who are s=
tained with the delusion of worldly desires.
(Guru Vachaka Kovai 280)

By e=
nquiring, =E2=80=9CWho am I, the deluded one who suffers so much?=E2=80=9D,=
 the delusion
will be dissolved, the Reality will be attained, Jnana will d=
awn, Mouna will
flow forth and the Bliss of Peace will prevail. (404)

The =
Self is God. =E2=80=98I AM=E2=80=99 is God. If God be apart from the Self, =
He must be a
Selfless God which is absurd. All that is required to realize =
the Self is to
be still. What can be easier than that? Hence atma vidya is =
the easiest to
attain. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospal)

Those people who lack c=
onsciousness of being, the natural light (I am) and
who consequently come, =
through, ignorance, under the spell of karma and
suffer, will have their de=
lusion ended and reach the self, the supreme
reality, through meditation on=
 a divine from that is dear to them. (Guru
Vachaka Kovai 659)

To realize t=
hat you yourself are the Self, why do you require any light
other than bein=
g-consciousness, the light of the Self? (759)

What our Lord Ramana teaches=
 us to take as the greatest and powerful tapas,
is only this much =E2=80=93=
 summa iru (Be still). There is no other duty for the
mind and its thoughts=
 (Muruganar, 773)

If the jiva remains without cognizing the object, in tha=
t state it will
clearly see itself as the immaculate pure swarupa, free fro=
m limitations.
(646)

Bhagavan is always with you, in you and you are yours=
elf Bhagavan.

Only the attainment of tranquility of mind is God=E2=80=99s =
grace, not the
fulfillment of one=E2=80=99s desires. (753)

Living as the S=
elf is the essence of all dharmas. All other dharmas merge
here. (705)

The=
 lazy state of just being and shining is the state of self, and that is
the=
 highest state that one can attain. Revere as the most virtuous those who
h=
ave attained that (lazy) state which cannot be attained except by very
grea=
t and rare tapas. (774)

In the blissful experience of jnana, the Self, tho=
se prarabdha experiences
will not cling to the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. (698)

=
Deepavali festival signifies the great Self-effulgence which shines after
d=
estroying the reflected artificial light (i.e. the ego) Narakasura, who was=

ruling this filthy body which is the form of hell, as I. (189)

Before you=
 embark on treating the disease of others, first completely
destroy your ow=
n disease, and only then start your practice. (804)

Since charya (devotion=
 and detachment) alone sustains sadhana, observe and
cherish it in an appro=
priate way, without ever slackening. (826)

Since the moral and religious o=
bservances that have been laid down (by the
scriptures) protect the sadhaka=
 for a considerable period, they deserve to
be appropriately observed, but =
if they (become obstacles along the path) of
Self enquiry then give them up=
 as deficient. (791)

There is no fortune greater than (stillness of mind) =
peace, there is no
force greater than peace; there is no excellent tapas gr=
eater than peace;
there is no immortal life greater than (living in) peace.=
 (796)

For those who have abandoned their ego-mind what other things besid=
es that
are left that are worthy of being renounced. (837)

Arunachala is a=
 scared place worthy of being adored by Sivayognis. Know it
to be the heart=
 of the earth, attractive and thrilling to Siva. There the
Lord Sambu himse=
lf has assumed the form of a mountain. He has the name
Arunachala. He is co=
nducive to the welfare of all the worlds. (Greatness of
Arunachala)

The ap=
pearance of Annamalai before Brahma and Vishnu and their utter
distress at =
not being able to know it is symbolic of the Heart Centre (Self)
which shin=
es of itself when the intellect and the ego are non-plussed
(seeking it).

=
Let men have salvation by means of the vision (of this place) from afar or
=
by means of recollection (as) the perfect knowledge enshrined in the Vedant=
a
cannot be achieved without great effort. (Greatness of Arunachala).

In r=
egard to the men staying at this holy sport to the extent of three
yojanas =
(i.e. 36 KMs), at my bidding, let them have sayujya (becoming one
with God)=
 form of liberation even without the requisite initiation.
(Greatness of Ar=
unachala)
