 Q: Many visitors here tell me that they get visions or thought-currents
fr=
om you. I have been here for the last month and a half and still I have
not=
 the slightest experience of any kind. Is it because I am unworthy of
your =
grace?

A: Visions and thought-currents are had according to the state of m=
ind. It
depends on the individuals and not upon the universal presence. Mor=
eover,
they are immaterial. What matters is peace of mind.What is realizati=
on? Is
it to see God with four hands, bearing a conch, a wheel and a club? =
Even if
God should appear in that form, how is the disciple's ignorance wip=
ed out ? The
truth must eternal realization. The direct perception is ever-=
present
experience.

God himself is known when he is directly perceived. It=
 does not mean that he
appears before the devotee in some particular form. =
Unless the realization
is eternal it cannot serve any useful purpose. Can t=
he appearance of God
with four hands be eternal realization? It is phenomen=
al and illusory.

There must be a seer. The seer alone is real and eternal.=
Let God appear as
the light of a million suns. Is it pratyaksha [direct exp=
erience]? To see a
vision of God the eyes and the mind are necessary. It is=
 indirect knowledge,
whereas the seer is direct experience. The seer alone =
is pratyaksha.
