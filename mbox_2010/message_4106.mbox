At that time in India the political situation was quite unstable.
Mahatma G=
andhi and his helpers did what they could for the independence
of the count=
ry. However, the British tried to suppress all efforts for
freedom and kept=
 the Indian people down by force and inflicted severe
punishment. The India=
ns were afraid of the British rulers, who had a
great army equipped with mo=
dern weapons, while they were armed only with
their courage and bravery. Ma=
ny of them believed that to rebel against
the powerful British Empire would=
 be futile. Mahaprabhuji encouraged
them to strive for freedom through pati=
ence and perseverance and not
with force.

Mahaprabhuji foretold that an en=
d would soon come to British rule and
due to his inspiration, hundreds of I=
ndians regained courage through
belief in his protection.

Once when Mahapr=
abhuji and some disciples were in Mount Abu they decided
to go to Sabarmati=
, the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi came to the
door of the ashram to we=
lcome Mahaprabhuji and indeed it was a great
moment when these two outstand=
ing personalities met.

Mahatma Gandhi requested Mahaprabhuji sing one of h=
is bhajans.

"Master, please grant us the opportunity to hear your famous s=
ongs,
which we are told deeply move the hearts of all and fill them with
Di=
vine Light. Your existence in this world truly leads everyone to the
path o=
f liberation!"

"And it is your existence which serves to liberate the Indi=
an people,"
Mahaprabhuji said in reply. "No-one can stop you in this. Your =
service
to India will make history and the story of your life will always b=
e an
inspiration to others."

Mahaprabhuji then sang a bhajan and finally s=
poke to those present.

"My dear people! India is the country of ahimsa[1],=
 none will ever
suffer due to us. The Vedas expound ahimsa as the highest p=
rinciple in
human dharma. Do not give up this principle! Truth cannot be de=
stroyed
or changed, it is pure. Truth will always reign victorious[2]. Live=

simply with an honest heart and high thoughts. Honour your trade and
respe=
ct the traditions. Mahatma Gandhi is a brilliant example for you in
this!

=
"In a former life he was King Ajayapal, who himself tended the goats of
the=
 kingdom and he reigned successfully with wisdom and simplicity. Not
only d=
id the people worship him, but the animals as well. During his
rule the mig=
hty demon Ravana ruled in Sri Lanka and he demanded tributes
from all India=
n kings. But even the mighty Ravana was afraid of King
Ajayapal.

"One day =
Ravana said to his queen, Mandodari: 'Today I shall put the
powers of Ajaya=
pal to a test'. The queen at that moment was feeding her
doves and on a sud=
den impulse she spoke to them, 'Doves! If you are
loyal to King Ajayapal, d=
on't eat these grains'. The doves hid their
heads under their wings and kep=
t away from the feed.

"However, one dove didn't hear the queen's words and=
 ate the grain.
Immediately it died. The queen turned to Ravana and said, '=
This is an
ill omen. You now know the might of King Ajayapal'.

"But Ravana=
 didn't care for such signs and instead sent his emissaries
to the king dem=
anding tribute. On reaching the court, the emissaries
learned that the king=
 was away tending the goats, so they waited for him
to return. In the eveni=
ng, the king heard of the arrival of the
emissaries and put on his best rob=
es and welcomed the visitors in the
throne room of his palace. The emissari=
es delivered the message from
Ravana.

"King Ajayapal then ordered the emis=
saries to go into the courtyard and
make a drawing in the sand of Ravana's =
palace. When they had finished,
King Ajayapal took a stick and smudged a pa=
rt of the drawing. He then
turned to the visitors with a smile and said, 'R=
eturn to Ravana's palace
and if you find levelled to the ground this part o=
f the royal walls that
I have here erased with my stick, then tell your kin=
g that I would well
advise him to demand no tribute ever more'!

"He contin=
ued, 'In just this way I could destroy all Sri Lanka without
stepping out o=
f my palace. Now go to your king and report this to him'.

"The emissaries =
returned to Ravana and found exactly that part of the
palace which King Aja=
yapal had smudged in the sand indeed had fallen to
the ground. This inciden=
t so thoroughly frightened Ravana that never
again did he quarrel with King=
 Ajayapal.

"Mahatma Gandhi is the reincarnation of this great king. In thi=
s life
also he carries the shepherd's crook in his hand. Wherever he goes,
=
people are subject to his crook. The power of his devotion to India will
en=
sure victory over the British."

The listeners were deeply moved by Gurudev=
a's words, for they knew that
he always spoke the truth. After this meaning=
ful meeting with Gandhi,
Mahaprabhuji returned to Mount Abu.

On the day of=
 Gurupurnima, thousands of devotees came to Mahaprabhuji's
satsang.

"Lord,=
 you promised us swarajaya =97 self-determination," one of them
said. "Plea=
se tell us how long India will remain free and how things
will be for our c=
ountry in the future. When will a new satya yuga begin,
when Saints and wis=
e men will again rule over the land? And when will
you, God's incarnation, =
return to build the kingdom of sat sanatan
dharma?"

"These questions touch=
 the core of the universe, so listen well,"
Mahaprabhuji answered with a sm=
ile.

"The independence of India will last for a very long time and thereaf=
ter
many forms of government will follow. Finally, at the beginning of saty=
a
yuga, the age of truth, the great rishis and wise men will incarnate
from=
 the highest level and build the kingdom of wisdom on earth."

In a bhajan,=
 Mahaprabhuji continued:



HO RAJ MAHARISHAYA KO HO VELA RE

May it be soo=
n that wise men rule the states!

The Mahatma has appeared to extinguish th=
e castes,

He will clean India's system,

Difference in race and status wil=
l be abolished,

Now the era of arrogance ends.

Satguru Sri Devpuriji proc=
laimed this truth

And Swami Deep is his ambassador,

Under the gracious pr=
otection of the Guru

He realizes the unfathomable Lila, the Divine Play.

=


After this bhajan, Mahaprabhuji prophesied that at the end of the rule
of=
 Saints, he himself would again incarnate on earth, in conformity with
the =
words of The Bhagavad Gita that says: God always comes to earth to
re-estab=
lish the empire of Truth, when true faith is in danger.

"When I descend to=
 earth from the Divine level of satya loka, satya yuga
will again blossom w=
ith me. I will build the kingdom of true dharma,
without battle or war and =
people will follow me in love. The whole
cosmos is in Me =97 I am the Unive=
rse."


[1]ahimsa =3D non-violence. Not to harm or kill is the highest prin=
ciple
of human life.

[2]"Truth will always reign victorious" =97 SATYA MEV=
A JAYATE =97

is the motto of the Indian union.
