 Whatever work Vidyasagara has done for others has been very good and
helpful. To be kind and compassionate is also good; but there is a
difference between compassion and attachment.Compassion is good, but
attachment is not. Attachment is love for wife, children, brother, sister,
father, mother and other relatives, while true compassion is equal love for
all living creatures.

Mahendra: Is compassion also a bondage?

Ramakrishna: This question is not for ordinary mortals.Compassion is the
result of the Sattwa quality. The Sattwa quality is protective, the Rajas
quality is creative, and Tamas is destructive: but Brahman the Absolute is
beyond these three qualities, Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. It is also beyond
Prakriti or nature. Where there is absolute Reality, no quality of nature
can reach. As a thief cannot go to the exact spot where the treasure is,
because he is afraid of being caught, so Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, like
thieves, cannot go to the realm where, is the treasure of the Absolute. [p.
253]
