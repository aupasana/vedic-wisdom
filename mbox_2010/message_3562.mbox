Dear Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
If one is a beginner to doing homams, what is the =
best mantra to use and the best homam to do to keep things simple at the st=
art? Also,=C2=A0is there a manual one can follow=C2=A0or can you list a ser=
ies of steps to be followed? Sorry if this is=C2=A0too basic a question or =
has already been covered before but I am relatively new to this group and n=

Namaste,

Mahasudarshana homam is good, but please reme=
mber that Mahasudarsana is a personification of Vishnu's weapon. I recommen=
d preferring normal devatas to astra devatas (deities who personify weapons=
).
=C2=A0
Devatas like Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira are personifications =
of weapons. Their sadhanas are akin to taking a weapon and using it. When o=
ne takes a weapon, one can either do a ceremonial pooja to it and put it ba=
ck or actually use it to solve problems. Though homas and poojas to astra d=
evatas were akin to the latter in old days, they are akin to the former now=
-a-days. In the old days, detached sadhakas of a high caliber existed in th=
e priest class and they used to do homas and poojas to astra devatas like M=
ahasudarsana and Pratyangira and produced results quickly. Though most prie=
sts of today are only capable of doing an aayudha pooja rather than using t=
he aayudha, they nevertheless instinctively go for these poojas based on th=
e old habits. However, based on the changed capabilities, one should change=
 the strategy.

Just as a son who is troubled by bullies at school is bette=
r off complaining to mother or father and let them take care of the problem=
, instead of taking the weapon of mother or father and trying to use it one=
self, my humble opinion is that worship of deities who hold those weapons i=
s better today than worship of deities personifying weapons, to solve serio=
us problems.

For countering black magic, I suggest doing Rahu-Ketu homam o=
r Chandi homam or Narasimha homam. Narasimha homam with "ugram veeram" mant=
ra may be a good idea. For removing black magic, homam or worship of Dattat=
reya is also a good idea.

If you want the specific material result of remo=
ving black magic, maintain physical purity around you when you do homam. Of=
fer black sesame seeds in homam. If you have a pomegranate tree near you, o=
ffering pomegranate flowers in homam is a good idea. Put a full lime (green=
) everyday as poornaahuti and make sure it burns fully by putting enough fu=
el (wood/coconut/ ghee) along with it. You may need to offer more ghee a fe=
w times as poornaahuti burnas, to make it burn fully. Also, in the sankalpa=
 of the homam, you may add "maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH abhicaaraadi prayogebh=
yo bhaavita pIDaayaaH upashamanaarthaM" (in ITrans transliteration) after "=
so and so devataa prasaada siddhyartham" that appears in the Sankalpa in th=
e manuals.

Best regards,
Narasimha

=C2=A0 

Which homam works best for getting rid of black=
 magic? I wish to call a temple priest but I am confused between Maha sudar=
shan,Chandi and Mahakali. Within a span of two months if I ask the priest t=

regular basis. 
I am doing Ganpati homam with great devotion but still I se=

As I have chronic health issues my meditation is not effi=

 Hence the question always comes in my mind are my prayers working?

I can =

only think of minting money. People coming in this forum are genuine and he=
nce am looking for help here. Kindly suggest as life is going tough for me.=
 I am willing to work hard but don't know the right approach. 

Thanks and =
