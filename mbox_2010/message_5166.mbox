New Delhi:=A0 If you had not hea=
rd of Narayanan Krishnan, as I had not,
it is a collective failure. This is=
 one of the most incredible stories
of personal commitment.

Narayanan Kris=
hnan, all of 29 years old now, does what he was
professionally trained to d=
o as a chef. Feed people. Only Krishnan
does not do this in the swanky conf=
ines of a 5-star hotel. Every day,
he wakes up at 4 am, cooks a simple hot =
meal and then, along with his team, loads it in a van and travels about 200=
 km feeding the homeless in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Krishnan feeds, often with=
 his hands, almost 400 destitute people every day. And for those who need i=
t, he provides a free haircut too.

According to CNN, eight years ago, this=
 award-winning chef with a
five-star hotel chain was all set
 to go to Swit=
zerland for a
high-profile posting. On a visit to a Madurai temple, he came=
 across a
homeless, old man eating his own human waste. That stark sight ch=
anged Krishnan's life. Much to the dismay of his parents, CNN says, Krishna=
n abandoned his career plans and decided to spend his life and his professi=
onal training in looking after those who could not care for themselves. He =
has provided more than 1.2 million hot meals through his nonprofit organisa=
tion Akshaya Trust, and now hopes to extend this to shelter for the homeles=
s too.

Krishnan is the only Indian in a list of 10 heroes that CNN has pic=
ked
worldwide to honour. One of them will be chosen CNN Hero of the Year, s=
elected by the public through an online poll. If many Indians get together =
to vote for this inspiring man, he can win by a long mile.

If Krishnan win=
s he will get $100,000 in addition to the $25,000 that
he gets for being sh=
ortlisted for the Top 10.
 Akshaya Trust needs all
the monetary support it =
can get to build on Krishnan's dream. Let's
help him get there.

Vote for K=
rishnan here.=A0 (http://heroes.cnn.com/vote.aspx) The poll
continues throu=
gh November 18 at 6 a.m. ET.
