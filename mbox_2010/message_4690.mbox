 Devotee:

Being always Being-Consciousness-Bliss, why does God place us in=

difficulties? Why did He create us?

Bhagavan: Does God come and tell you =
that He has placed you in difficulties?
It is you who say so. It is again t=
he wrong =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. If that disappears there
will be no one to sa=
y that God created this or that.

source: Talk 197

People would not unders=
tand
the simple and bare truth.
--the truth of their everyday,
ever-present=
 and eternal experience.
That Truth is that of the Self.

Because they love=
 mystery
and not the bare truth,
religions pamper them.
Only to bring them =
around to the Self.
Wandering hither and thither,
you must return to the Se=
lf only.
Then, why not abide in the Self
right here and now?

Subject and o=
bject;
all merge in the Self.
All are only one Self.

A cultured lady, daug=
hter of a well-known solicitor of Madras asked:
What should one do in order=
 to remain free from thoughts as advised
by you? Is it only the enquiry "Wh=
o am I?"

M.: Only to remain still. Do it and see.

D.: It is impossible.

=
M.: Exactly. For the same reason the enquiry "Who am I?" is advised.

Ignor=
ance vanishing,
the residue reveals itself.
It is experience,
not in the ca=
tegory of knowledge.

Everything is one's Self.
To see the world there must=
 be a spectator.
There could be no world without the Self.
The Self is all =
comprising.
In fact, Self is all.
There is nothing besides the Self.

The S=
elf is changeless;
it is the ego that has intervened.
That which rises and =
sets is the ego;
that which remains changeless is the Self.

Realize the Re=
al Self.
It is all that is necessary.

The Self is ever the witness.
Whethe=
r imagined so or not.
There is no need to imagine it,
except for that purpo=
se.
It is best to remain as one's self.

It is as it is.
They are excited a=
t first.
By continued experience it becomes common
and then one is no longe=
r excited.

A wandering mind is on the wrong track.
Only a devotional mind =
is on the right track.

A gentleman ... asked: "Swami, you say that finding=
 out the self is the
greatest thing in life. But for finding it out, is the=
 Nama Japa (repeating
the name of the Lord) good? Can we attain Moksha in h=
tat way?"

Bhagavan said, "Yes it is good. That itself will take you in due=
 course to
the Goal. The repeating of the Name is to remove all extraneous =
things. Then
everything extraneous disappears and what remians is the Name =
alone. That
which remains is the Self or God or the Supreme Being. Nama Jap=
a means we
give a name to God and call HIM by that name. You give Him that =
name which
you like most."

from Nagamma: Letters, entry 29. July 1948

For whom is =
this ignorance [veiling?]
Does the Absolute tell you it is veiled?
It is th=
e person that tells you something veils the Absolute
Find out for whom this=
 ignorance exists.

For whom is this imperfection?
The Absolute is not impe=
rfect and cannot ask.
The insentient cannot ask the question.
Between the t=
wo
something has risen up
and which raises these questions
and feels the do=
ubt.
Who is it?
Is it the one who has now arisen?
Or is it the one who is e=
ternal?
Being perfect, why do you feel yourself imperfect?
Such is the teac=
hings of all the religions.
Whatever may be the experiences,
the experience=
r is one and the same.

Reality must be always real.
It is not entangled wi=
th forms and names,
but is That which underlies these.
It underlies limitat=
ions, being itself limitless.
It is not bound.
It underlies unrealities, it=
self being real.
Reality is that which is. It is as it is.
It transcends sp=
eech and lies beyond
such expressions as existence, non-existence, etc

Eac=
h one wants to know the Self.
What kind of help does one require to know on=
eself?
People want to see the Self as something new.
But it remains eternal=
 and is the same all along.

The best definition is, 'I Am That I Am.' - Ra=
mana Maharshi

Bliss is not something to be got.
On the other hand, you are=
 bliss.
This desire is born of the sense of incompleteness.
To whom is this=
 sense of incompleteness?
Inquire. In deep sleep, you were blissful.
Now yo=
u are not so.
What is interposed between that bliss and this bliss?
It is t=
he ego.
Seek its source and find you are bliss.

For whom is this ignorance=
?
It is the ego.
Trace the source of the ego.
Then the ignorance is lost an=
d bliss remains.
It is eternal.
You are That, here and now.
Search the sour=
ce of the ego,
and the Self is revealed.
That alone remains.

If the Self c=
ould be found in books,
it would already have been realized.
What wonder ca=
n be greater than
that we seek the Self in books?
Of course, books have giv=
en the
readers the sense to ask this question
and to seek the Self.

So you=
 see that you are really formless
but you are at present identifying
yourse=
lf with the body.

There is a state beyond both effort
and effortlessness.
=
Until it is realized, effort is necessary.
After tasting such Bliss even on=
ce,
one will repeatedly try to regain it.
Having once experienced the Bliss=
 of Peace,
no one would like to be out of it
or engage himself otherwise.

=
No activity of any kind affects a
Self-Realized man.
his mind remains ever =
in eternal Peace.
He will know it to be his real Being,
and thus be liberat=
ed even while alive.
