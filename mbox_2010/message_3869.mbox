Namaste Sayantan,
 
Marriage is not necessarily a problem. After all, many rishis had wives!
 
If latent desires are there in the mind, remaining unmarried may not solve the problem but only postpone it. The goal of sadhana is not to "pretend" to be a liberated person or "behave" like a liberated person, but to "become" liberated.
 
Karmas and rinas are like a rope that ties a goat to a tree. The goat can move around in a limited space, depending on the size of the rope, but cannot go beyond. Similarly, one has some free will but its scope depends on how serious (short) the karmas and rinas (rope) are. What your rinas are, what scope your free will has and what is the best course of action for you, is to be determined by you. But, if that is not clear at this time, do not think or analyze much now and go on with life. Try to do your sadhana and surrender. Guidance regarding the direction to take in this matter (as well as others) will come in time. When the logical mind and intuitive mind do not have enough information to decide a matter wisely, it is better to wait (unless one is forced to decide it now).

Namaste Aditi,
 
Very good points. Forcible repression can boomerang as you said. Nor is free indulgence a feasible strategy, for there is no end to it. You put it very well: "channeling healthily, controlling, and then overcoming the desire".
 
Your point regading unilateral decision by a man or a woman is also good. However, this is a matter of tradeoff. When one has two options before one, one weighs them and chooses the better option. One may commit a bad karma in order to facilitate another good karma that is deemed bigger or more important. It is a matter of a tradeoff and personal choice.
 
Swami Shivananda, whom Swami Vivekananda used to call "Mahapurush" (great soul), did not touch his wife after marriage and she died a broken person. Swami Yogananda was tricked into marriage by his eager parents and he too uniliterally took up brahmacharya. He did not even go into the room for his first night. Such Swamis may have succeeded in offseting the bad karma with some other good karma they did to the affected souls or they may be paying back in the next lives. Both are possible.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
