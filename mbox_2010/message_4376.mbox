Hi Everyone, 

As I practise Homam more and more, I want to do it on a dail=
y basis, but I want to know how to make it faster for a daily ritual. Yes t=
here are short and supershort procedures but what I notice is that I spend =
more time in preparing for Homam, than the actual homam itself. Is it the s=
ame with everyone else? Arranging for Alumium Wrap around the homa kundam, =
and within the fire-place, and outside of it, Melting the ghee, arranging f=
or water, Akshatas, flowers, incense sticks, camphor, oil lamp, wicks, fire=
wood, dry coconuts, Havan Samagri, water, preparation of Kalasam etc., take=
s at least about 15 minutes prior to starting of the homam. Also, preparati=
on of maha naivedyam (either ravva kesari or sweet rice pudding [payasam]),=
 which I normally do, takes another 20 minutes at the minimum. For these re=
asons, I am unable to do it other than weekends. So, generally I end up doi=
ng a Ganapati homam on Sundays. Any ideas as to how to make it faster for a=
 daily ganapati homam? Also I generally make offerings with Gayatri Mantra =
in every homam, I want to know if there is an exclusive Gayatri Homam with =
Gayatri being the main deity, with prana pratishtapana mantra etc., or can =
we just do the  Gayatri Avahana (that we do in Sandhyavandanam) at the homa=
m? The reason I ask this is, I sometimes do Purascharanas of Gayatri (curre=
ntly doing one), usually about 24,000 over a period of 40 days and then off=
er 10% of the same in Homam. Those 2,400 I make an offering into the fire w=
ithout any exclusive prana pratishtapana of Gayatri, but generally as part =
of Ganapati Homam itself, because I don't know any other way to do this. An=
y advice?

Also as I understand Adi Sankaracharya has established six order=
s of religion (Ganapatyas, Koumararas, Vaishnava, Shaiva, ShAktEya and Sour=
a orders). I wonder if there is a homam for Kumara Swamy. For the rest, the=
re is one, if I am right, although I am not sure if there is one exclusivel=
y for Lord Surya. I heard of Navagraha homams though. 

Also Kumaraswamy is=
 not part of Pachayatana pooja, which is also established by the Jagat Guru=
. Why?
