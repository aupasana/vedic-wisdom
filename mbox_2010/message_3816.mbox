Namaste Narasimha,

You have mentioned that:

>> Somehow or the other, sup=
pose I created a rina that set the stage for the work of this life. Suppose=
 the rina requires me to do something for those subjects,e.g. teach homam, =
teach astrology, give a free astrology software etc. All this is what I am =
"giving", i.e. I am paying back a rina I created before somehow or the othe=
r. <<  

We have been listening to your free astrology audios and we are us=
ing your software. Are we creating  new rinas to you or to the universe ?  =
  How can we pay this back? By teaching or giving astrological advises to s=
omeone else? Or .. we have to pay it back to YOU only (if you are not a Sel=
f-realized person yet). 

Can  homam be useful in these matters like rinas =
? When you say homam can help us in burning karmas, does that mean rinas al=
so? 
 
Sorry, if I am not able to put my questions properly. 

Regards,
Pad=
maja

> Rina is so=
mething you "owe" and hence "give back". Rina is all about giving and not t=
aking. Most sense gratification people engage in involves more taking than =
giving. When you "give" something (to others or to universe), you are payin=
g back your debt. When you "take" something (from others or from universe),=
 you are creating a new debt that will need to be paid back later. A simple=
 formula is "give all you can and do not get worked up if you are not recei=
ving enough in return". Of course, when you have an opportunity to give dif=
ferent things to different people and have to pick some, you have to use yo=
ur judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more important rina with t=
he little you have!!
>  
> The problem is that it is so difficult to give w=
ithout getting something back (i.e. pay back old debt and create a new debt=
)! This is true with anything and not just the example of sex you mentioned=
. Of course, when it comes to sex, it may be even more difficult. One may t=
end to think more about one's own pleasure than partner's. Even when one th=
inks about partner's pleasure, it may be with an egoistic focus ("am *I* ab=
le to give pleasure"). Who forgets own pleasure and thinks "I will submit t=
o the god in my partner and give as much pleasure as I can to god in this f=
orm. My own pleasure does not matter at all and I will not think about it"?=
 If one indeed does that successfully, then hardly new rina is created and =
old rina is paid back.
>  
> Now, forget sex. Even in other things, giving =
goes hand-in-hand with taking and we often create new rinas. As long as our=
 ego remains, we are always pursuing self-gratification in many ways.

 Suppose I made a promise to my guru in last life to spread homam and astro=

Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother.  But wha=
t I am trying to understand  is that how to worship both forms simultaneous=
ly. For  instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one o=
f the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sas=
try), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krit=
his  mention  great details about all the  nine avaranas and different form=
s of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.  In the Dhyana Kri=
thi  of those, in the very  first line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpala=
tike, ChanDike'.  That line tells me that  even through Sri Vidya one can w=
orship Chandi Ma, in that form.  
> > > >

that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned=
 how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those =
terms.
