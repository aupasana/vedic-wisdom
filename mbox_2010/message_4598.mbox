Namaskarams Narasimhaji,
Inadvertently or by some means there are always so=
me answers to my queries which I may not even have asked in your email thre=
ads. 
=C2=A0
The other day I had a query about which direction should one p=
lace one's head while sleeping. I have been told by my elders that only Sou=
th and East are good. i.e. one should not sleep with ones head placed in th=
e West or the North direction. Please let me know if there is any logic in =
this placement or does our subtle body is indeed affected by the directions=
 in which we sleep.
Also if possible throw some light on the query I had ra=
ised some days back=C2=A0on "Self Identification"
=C2=A0
Regards,
Girish Su=
ndaram

Namaste,

Physical gravity is not constan=
t across the world we live in. It varies from place to place. See a recent =
BBC news item at:

http://tinyurl.com/geograv

In the Aghora series of book=
s, Vimalananda had mentioned that gravity was different in India compared t=
o the rest of the world. As the gravity in the subtle body plane is also ac=
cordingly different in India from the rest of the world, Vimalananda said t=
his contributes to spiritual sadhana and progress being a little easier in =
India.

You can look at the gravity map and see that India indeed stands ou=
t from the rest of the world!

Best regards,
Narasimha
