PRANAM

Respected Narasimha Ji and Others,

Sometimes a trim down version i=
s very useful for me when there is time constraint for daily Ganapati Homam=
...

Currently the short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, yes I kno=
w there is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-ver=
se and sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum. 

So, could y=
ou please suggest/mark the various steps with important Mantras on priority=
 basis on the short-procedure of the Ganapati Homam, so that one could trim=
 down the homam process in the case of time constraint but mind should be s=
atisfy enough for the purpose...

best regards,
Biswajit
