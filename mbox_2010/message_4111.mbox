 31st December, 1945

During the first week of last month, on one morning, =
an ignorant traveller
came to the Ashram and, after staying here for two or=
 three days, and in
accordance with the saying =E2=80=9Csatra bhojanam math=
a nidra=E2=80=9D (eating in
choultries, sleeping in mutts) went away to eat=
 and stay elsewhere, but was
all the same coming here for some days enjoyin=
g the bliss of staying near
and having the darshan of Bhagavan. Before leav=
ing this town he approached
Bhagavan one day with great hesitation and said=
, in humble tones, =E2=80=9CSwami,
the people sitting here always ask you s=
omething and you give them some
replies. When I see that, I also feel tempt=
ed to enquire, but I do not know
what to ask you. How then can I get mukti?=
=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan, looking at him endearingly and smiling, said,=E2=80=9C=
How do you know that
you do not know anything?=E2=80=9D He said,=E2=80=9CAf=
ter I came here and heard the
questions asked by all these people and the r=
eplies Bhagavan is pleased to
give them, the feeling that I do not know any=
thing has come upon me.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThen
it is all right. You have fo=
und out that you do not know anything; that
itself is enough. What more is =
required?=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CHow to attain
mukti by that much=
 alone, Swami?=E2=80=9D said the questioner. =E2=80=9CWhy not? There is
som=
e one to know that he does not know anything. It is sufficient if you
could=
 enquire and find out who that someone is. Ego will develop if one
thinks t=
hat one knows everything. Instead of that, isn=E2=80=99t it much better to
=
be conscious of the fact that you do not know anything and then enquire how=

you could gain moksha?=E2=80=9D

He felt happy at that and went his way. T=
hat questioner might or might not
have understood the essence of that Bhaga=
wathvani (the voice of the Lord)
but, for us people here,those words were e=
choing in our heart of hearts like
mantraksharas (letters of the gospel).
