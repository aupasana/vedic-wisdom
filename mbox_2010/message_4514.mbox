 Swarni Pranavananda was one of the earliest devotees to come to Bhagavan.
=
He visited Bhagavan in 1910, in the Virupaksha Cave. His integrity and
stro=
ng spiritual aspirations earned him an enviable place among Bhagavan's
devo=
tees. He was one of Bhagavan's intimate companions. His love for
Bhagavan w=
as so great that he surrendered himself unconditionally at
Bhagavan's feet,=
 relinquishing all worldly attachments, and this filled his
heart with joy =
and peace. He was very modest and never spoke about himself
and his speech =
was restricted to the barest minimum. Though he did not
consider himself a =
teacher, his life itself served as a valuable lesson in
spirituality.

Pran=
avananda belonged to the Sarvepalli family, which was highly esteemed in
th=
e village of Venkatapuram, near Tiruttani in South India. The Sarvepalli
fa=
mily was a stronghold of learning in the Vedas, sastras and puranas. The
fa=
mily deity was Lord Yoganarasimha of Sholingapuram, and Pranavananda was
na=
med Narasimham after the family deity. He took the name of Swami
Pranavanan=
da at the time of becoming a sannyasi.

Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the w=
orld famous philosopher and one of the
most illustrious Presidents of India=
, was Narasimham's nephew. Surprisingly
enough, Dr. Radhakrishnan, who is e=
steemed for his erudition and wisdom, was
rather dull as a child. His fathe=
r was very much upset by Radhakrishnan's
nature, and concerned about his fu=
ture. Narasimham offered to take the boy
to Vellore and take care of his ed=
ucation. Upon reaching Vellore, Narasimham
initiated his nephew in the Rama=
taraka Mantram. Constant repetition of this
potent Mantram resulted in the =
blossoming of Radhakrishnan's intellect and
he grew into a brilliant studen=
t. He joined the Uris College in Vellore and
passed his Intermediate course=
. By taking care of Radhakrishnan during the
formative years of his life, a=
nd by helping him through the initial stages
of his academic career, Narasi=
mham can be said to have laid the foundation
for Radhakrishnan's success in=
 later life.

The S'arvepalh family was not a wealthy one. It is said that =
though Goddess
Saraswati (the Goddess of Learning) showered Her Grace upon =
the family.
Goddess Lakshmi (the Goddess of Wealth) looked askance at them!=
 Though they
were never reduced to extreme poverty, the family never enjoye=
d the comforts
of affluence. With the intention ofacqiringsome wealth, some=
 members of the
Sarvepalli family migrated to Madras, where they were able =
to make some
money by giving discourses in sastras and puranas. Later on, s=
ome of the
members settled down in Tiruttani. Narasimham was well versed in=
 the three
South Indian languages namely Telugu, Tamil and Kannada. He was =
also a
Sanskrit scholar. Ironically enough, Narasimham did not get through =
the
Matriculation Examination, but his scholarship in English was remarkabl=
e.
Englishmen themselves used to marvel at his mastery over the language!

=
Narasimham joined the Arcot Christian College as a teacher. The authorities=

were so impressed by his scholarship and his capacity as a teacher that th=
ey
appointed him as a Munshi (a teacher who trained foreigners in the use o=
f
local languages) to teach Telugu and English to the members of the missio=
n
and the managers of the institutions under their care.

Narasimham also t=
rained some of the members of the mission in the techniques
of meditation. =
Some of his students, like Paul Adiseshayya and Ida Scudder
(who founded th=
e CMC Hospital in Vellore) were so impressed by the clarity
of thought obta=
ined through meditation that they were prepared to embrace
Hinduism if Nara=
simham advised them to do so. Narasimham did not believe in
religious conve=
rsions, and did not think that only Hindus could benefit from
meditation. H=
e declared that one could meditate on God even if one did not
profess any r=
eligion. He told his students that one could serve mankind and
live in peac=
e even if one did not belong to any recognised religion.
Narasimham's belie=
fs and his teachings astonished the authorities of the
mission.

Narasimham=
 made several visits to the Vellore Central Jail, to meet the
prisoners and=
 to talk to them about moral values. He initiated the prisoners
into the Ra=
mataraka mantram and persuaded them to give up their lawless
ways. Through =
his influence, Narasimham helped in reforming and
rehabilitating many of th=
e criminals in the jail. He left the Mission
because of some difference of =
opinion with the authorities, and took up the
job of Munshi in the Police T=
raining College. Many of the Europeans who came
to Vellore during that peri=
od had the good fortune to learn the local
language from Narasimham. Those =
who were spiritually inclined found an able
guide in him, and his classes b=
ecame very popular satsangs (spiritual
congregations). Very soon, Narasimha=
m gained the reputation of a capable
teacher and a spiritual guide.

While =
Narasimham was serving as a Munshi in Vellore, Kavyakanta Ganapati
Muni was=
 working as a Telugu Teacher in the same town. In 1910, Narasimham
and Gana=
pati Muni went to Tiruvannamalai and met Bhagavan. At that time,
Bhagavan w=
as staying in the Virupaksha Cave. In the very first meeting,
Bhagavan's lo=
ok of grace entered deep into Narasimham's heart and destroyed
all the doub=
ts that had been troubling him till then. From that moment
onwards, Narasim=
ham's heart was full of peace.

Though Narasimham had originally accepted G=
anapati Muni as his guru, he was
proud to declare himself a devotee of Bhag=
avan Ramana. He led a very simple
life; but he never hesitated to help thos=
e in need. Though his was a very
modest house in a crowded street (named Av=
alkaran Veedhi), there were at
least ten students staying with him at any g=
iven time. He boarded them free
of charge, and his wife fed them all with t=
he loving concern of a
mother.Narasimham had no male issue. This fact did n=
ot bother him, but his
wife longed for a son. One day, she requested Ganapa=
ti Muni to bless her
with a male child. With the Muni's blessings, a baby b=
oy was born, but he
did not survive beyond early childhood.Narasimham's wif=
e was an ardent
devotee of Lord Yoganarasimha of Sholingapuram, and she oft=
en visited His
temple on the Ghatikachalam hill. Late one evening, while sh=
e was sitting in
meditation behind the idols of the Saptha Rishis (Seven Sa=
ges) the temple
priests, who had not noticed her, locked up the temple for =
the night and
went home. The lady claimed that, on that occasion. Lord Yoga=
narasimha
Himself brought her out of the locked temple and sat her on the s=
teps
leading up the hill.Narasimham had no special feeling towards his fami=
ly
deity, Lord Yoganarasimha. His whole concentration was on the Vichara Ma=
rga
(path of Self-enquiry) as taught by Bhagavan. In course of time, Narasi=
mham
renounced the world and became a Sannyasi, assuming the name of Swami
=
Pranavananda. However, the ritual was a mere formality, as Narasimham had
a=
lways been a Sannyasi at heart, living a life of detachment and devoting
hi=
s time to spiritual pursuits.

Pranavananda considered Bhagavan the very pe=
rsonification of the Vedas and
the Upanishads, and so he had great love and=
 reverence for him. Bhagavan,
too, had a special regard and concern for Pra=
navananda.

The following anecdote serves as an illustration of Bhagavan's =
concern for
him: Pranavananda used to compile Bhagavan's teachings into boo=
ks. One of
the devotees owned a printing press, and he printed the books th=
at were
brought to him by Pranavananda. One hot summer afternoon, Pranavana=
nda was
returning to Tiruvannamalai with a copy of one of the books. He had=
 just one
rupee with him, and, not wanting to engage a bullock cart, he dec=
ided to
walk to Ramanasramam. He somehow made it to the gate of the ashram,=
 but the
terrible heat had taken its toll-Pranavananda could not proceed an=
y further.
He sat down in the shade of a tree for a short rest before enter=
ing the
ashram. At that moment, Bhagavan happened to look out of the window=
. Seeing
Pranavananda's exhausted attitude, Bhagavan immediately came out t=
o him.
Sitting down beside him, Bhagavan poured cool water over Pranavanand=
a's sore
feet and spoke to him in gentle, compassionate tones, saying, "Why=
 do you
put yourself to such strain? Did I ever ask you to go out in this h=
eat?"
Such was the Masters concern for his disciples welfare!

Pranavanada =
was instrumental in printing several books of Bhagavan's
teachings. He pric=
ed these books at half-anna or one anna and gave them to
the ashram. It was=
 his desire that Bhagavan's teachings should be made
available to the maxim=
um number of people at affordable cost. It was
Pranavananada who first tran=
slated Bhagavan's Who am I?, Vicharasangraham,
Vivekachudamani and Devikalo=
ttaram into Telugu. His style was very simple
and lucid. In addition to the=
se translations, Pranavananda also wrote
several original books, including =
Rama-no. Maharshi Charitramu, Advaitabhoda
Dipika, Tatwamali Dhyanamu, Sri =
Guru-Anugraha-avataramu, Dipamu Choodandi
and Sri Ramana Stutipaatalu.

Pra=
navananda merged with Bhagavan in the year 1969, and his mortal remains
wer=
e entombed on the banks of the River Palar, in Vellore. Though
Pranavananda=
 is no more with us, his memory lives on, through the numerous
books he has=
 written.
