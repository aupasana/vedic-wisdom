Girish ji

Allow me to share a few thoughts. It might be my half baked theo=
ry and forgive me for any mistakes beforehand.

Doctors and Scientists agre=
e after a decade of research that the body has a bio magnetic field associa=
ted with it.The Brain MRI is based on this principle. We also have very tin=
y cell potentials across all the cells in the human body. 

The blood flows=
 from the heart to various organs and the direction is usually top to botto=
m. From Faraday's law of electromagnetism which we studied in high school.I=
f you place your thumb in the direction of the flow of current the fingers =
when wrapped will point the direction of the magnetic field. The pranic cur=
rent is in the same direction as blood flow.

That is why the Shirshasana w=
hich reverses the blood flow is highly praised in yoga. Anywaz with the dir=
ection of flow of blood we get a North pole orientation for the head and so=
uth pole orientation for the feet.

Like poles repel and hence if you place=
 your head in the Northern direction you might experience more dreams due t=
o the opposing poles and hence disturbed sleep.

The ancients beleived in s=
piritualizaiton of sleep since a average human being spends a lot of time i=
n sleep. Hence could have advised the southern direction to avoid this.

Ma=
ny scientists now are agreeing that Quantum theory applies to Biology as we=
ll. Recently there was an article in MIT technology review on Quantum entan=
glement keeping DNA strands together. Erwin Schrodinger the father of moder=
n quantum physics was hugely influenced by Vedanta and gave us the Wave equ=
ation as a result of that inspiration.

Science is still an imperfect tool =
to measure something as subtle as consciousness but might be getting close.=
..

my random thoughts.
