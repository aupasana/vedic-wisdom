Namaste Rajarshi,

Thank you for your reply to my e-mail and also your othe=
r e-mail responses. I 
wanted to make a few points to close off this discus=
sion (specifically  science 
related issues). If you would like to continue=
 these discussions privately, I 
would be happy to do so!

"That is because=
 Wikipedia is not a scientific journal"

We can have a discussion about a s=
ubject without deriding the source of 
publication. I first learned about B=
V, bioavailability, human nutrition etc. in 
the pre-internet era. Giving y=
ou a list of my textbooks, courses and lectures is 
not going to be helpful=
 for discussion. Besides when we are having a public 
discussion, it is bes=
t to give others a reference about where you are coming 
from.

Also, what =
is so sacrosanct about scientific journal articles? Check out this 
recent =
article about fraud in scientific journal publications.

http://www.ncbi.nl=
m.nih.gov/pubmed/21081306

I have the entire article and will be happy to s=
hare if you would like to read 
it.
Now coming specifically to the  wikiped=
ia article, there are no erroneous or 
false statements  in it. If there ar=
e let me know and we can discuss.

"Now some references from scientific pap=
ers on why a  vegeterian/vegan (a vegan 
does not use milk or ghee or any a=
nimal  product at all) diet often ends up 
becoming nutrient deficient"

Yo=
u seem to be conflating  protein deficiency with nutrient deficiency.  Ther=
e 
are related terms not equivalent terms, proteins are only one subset of =
various 
nutrients that the body requires. Also, being a vegetarian and veg=
an are two 
different issues. This thread is specifically about vegetariani=
sm (lacto 
vegetarianism, more specifically)

Citing an abstract of a paper=
 is not helpful for discussion. There are plenty of 
free, credible resourc=
es available on the internet these days. If you (or anyone 
else) would lik=
e to read, here is a nice lecture series on the physiology human 
nutrition=
.

http://www.cellinteractive.com/ucla/nutrition_101/phys_index.html

Human=
 nutrition is too complicated a subject to be dealt in a internet  
discuss=
ion group like this....too many variables to sort out..a couple of nice 
ar=
ticles on the interaction between different foods and factors that can 
aff=
ection bioavailability 


http://www.eufic.org/article/en/artid/Nutrient-bi=
oavailability-food/

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4777607.stm

"Vitamin B12 f=
or example is most easily fond in animal  carriers (it is a 
bacteria which=
 uses an animal carrier) to enter and  assimilate into the human 
body"

Th=
is is a inaccurate statement, both scientifically and grammatically, if I m=
ay 
add!

Here is a good write up on Vitamin B-12 deficiency.

http://www.a=
afp.org/afp/2003/0301/p979.html

"The problem is, as I mentioned, most vege=
terians are  unaware of the right 
food,

That is true for most people, veg=
etarian and non vegetarians alike!

".. and further, in a coutry like India=
, the poor  can never afford the 
vegeterian substitutes of non vegeterian =
nutrient  sources."

You need substitutes only if you are lacking in a bala=
nced diet in the first 
place! Lack of a balanced nutritious diet in India =
is because of socio-economic 
factors, not because of any inherent deficien=
cies in a vegetarian diet itself. 
This is a combination of the protein-ene=
rgy malnutrition and micronutrient 
deficiencies. For a comprehensive repor=
t, please read this report (or at least 
the executive summary!).

http://g=
o.worldbank.org/TUTLNHSPH0

"So scientifically, a totally vegeterian diet i=
s often an unbalanced diet..."

Really! Making such a disingenuous statemen=
t invalidates your whole argument 
about the scientific rigor that you clai=
m to have... Any diet can be 
balanced....it depends on a whole lot of fact=
ors....

"...This is a very complex  area of discussion and may require tim=
e and energy, 
and most  importantly, removal of preconceptions from the mi=
nd that is  acquired 
through birth and cultural conditionings."

We all ha=
ve our preconceptions based on our backgrounds and experiences...in 
anothe=
r e-mail to Narasimha, you wrote about homosexuality being a reversible 
co=
ndition...well, let me break this to you , both the American Psychiatric 
A=
ssociation and the American Psychological Association have removed it from =
the 
list of mental conditions since the past 35 years! Unless you think yo=
u know 
better than them, you might want to change your opinion....

http:/=
/www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx

Given that we all have a l=
ot to learn it is best to be respectful of others who 
may have a different=
 perspective and at least giving someone the benefit of 
doubt, before maki=
ng any judgments. For some reason, the use of the word, 
"scientific" touch=
ed a raw nerve in you and the rest is for everyone to see....

warm regards=
,
Chandraprakash.

Namaste Chandra Prakash ji,
 
Thank you for response=
 and thank you for looking up the meaning of Biological 
Value from Wikiped=
ia. Following is my response to your post. I would like to 
keep this stric=
tly within the realm of science, which means, I will not deal 
with, i.e, a=
rgue for or against the ethics/philosophy of meat eating.
 
More specifical=
ly, BV talks about protein assimilation exclusively and there are 
quite a =
few flaws even estimating that. Here is a nice journal article (it is 
refe=
renced in the wikipedia article mentioned above
 
This is more or less a co=

be taken and absorv=
ed by the human body from an external protein source. This is 
the most sta=
ndard accepted and used terminology when it comes to research on 
protein n=
utrition.
 
Nothing I have read so far backs up what you state:
 " fish is =

 the most difficul
 
That is because Wikipedia is not a scientific journal.=
 It gives a small over 
view of things. Here is some actual references from=
 scientific journals for your 
reference.
 
Following is the decreasing ord=

<<"fish > chicken > leafy vegetables* > egg* > under=
ground stems (potatoes, etc) 
> red meat > roots (carrot, raddish, etc)

is why it is recommended to athletes -- weightlifters and body builders,=
 in

The last variety is actually termed as "negative calorie d=

more calories trying to digest it than the calories=
 you extract from it.  
The absence/negligible presence of the organ called=
 caecum, next to our 
pancreas, which is present in herbivorous animals, ma=

Etc. etc.
 
Now com=
ing to the following parts of your mail.
 
 
More specifically, BV talks ab=
out protein assimilation exclusively and there are 
quite a few flaws even =
estimating that. 

 
The 'flaws' it speaks about pertain to differences in =
methods of calculations.  
Instead of BV, some researches use PCA, PCAAS. e=
tc or PRF. But none of them 
dispute the basic findings of which is the eas=
iest source of proteins.
 
There are two factors crucial in any nutritional=
 study. Assimilation of the 
nutrient into the bodymass (like BV calc) and =
ease of bio-availability. Vitamin 
B12 for example is most easily fond in a=
nimal carriers (it is a bacteria which 
uses an animal carrier) to enter an=
d assimilate into the human body. This can 
also be taken in from milk and =
soya flakes spread. But, ease of availaility 
descreases and finally a doct=
or recommends taking Vitamin B12 suppliments - 
specially for women during =
pregnancy - whose natural diet did not include the 
same. Also our body bei=
ng an organic matter and the supplements being mostly 
inorganic, the assim=
ilation always happens less than ideal.
 
Strictly from a scientific point =
of view, I have hardly seen any vegeterians 
being aware of the subtitutes =
to be taken which can provide the same nutrients 
that a fish/meat/egg can =
provide, not to mention the fact that the substitutes 
are far more costly =
and often unafforable for those who are not economically 
well off, special=
ly in a country like India. 

 
The points you have jotted down also state =
the same thing and thus validate what 
I have stated.
 
For the vast majori=
ty of the population living a fairly active lifestyle and 
access to suffic=
ient vegetarian food, adequate protein intake is not an issue at 
all. 

 
=
The problem is, as I mentioned, most vegeterians are unaware of the right f=
ood, 
and further, in a coutry like India, the poor can never afford the ve=
geterian 
substitutes of non vegeterian nutrient sources.
 
How many vegete=
rians in India actually go to a dietetics, or even a doctor to 
figure out =
the correct diet, even though an average doctor has really very 
little kno=
wledge of nutrition (which is because nutrition is merely a two weeks 
cour=
se in a 4 years study). If one has to learn about nutrition, search for an =

MD in Nutrition and Clinical Dietetics!
 
So scientifically, a totally veg=
eterian diet is often an unbalanced diet - for 
the reasons mentioned above=
, and this haas been shown through many tests on 
vegeterians and omnivores=
 - just like american/european extreme of meat based 
diets, which are very=
 unbalanced too. 
 
___________
 
 
Dr Atul mentioned that if by some mirac=
le the whole world population were to be 
converted to vegeterians, a proti=
en crisis of unheard proportions leading to 
riots would happen. In my anal=
ysis, it in an understatement.  To analyse and 
appreciate the whole impact=
 of suc a shift one must spend time to study and 
understand the economic, =
evolutionary and geological crisis that would ensue. 
For this the study ha=
s to start from why and when animal protein intake became a 
part of human =
diet, for which why certain species of animals were domesticated 
and breed=
 which would not have survived this long had it not been for human 
interve=
ntion (just like our rice/wheat too would not have survived had it not 
bee=
n for human intervention, in natural proccess of evolution). This is a very=
 
complex area of discussion and may require time and energy, and most 
imp=
ortantly, removal of preconceptions from the mind that  is  acquired throug=

birth and cultural conditionings.

Namaste Girish ji,
 
Some slight clarificati=
on from my side.
 
Now this "x-y" meat consumed should be compared to what =
is actually absorbed by 
the human body. I think it is generally known that=
 animal protein is absorbed at 
a lower rate than plant protein.
 
Yes, tha=
t is exactly what is called the Biological Value in Clinical Nutrition, 
wh=
ich means, the amount of assimilative capacity of the human body for x or y=
 
food. Therefore all journals of clinical nutrition and ditetics carry a B=
V 
chart, showing what is the ease with which body assimilates different fo=
od.
 
 
It is a myth that vegeterian food is easily assimilable by the huma=
n body. 
 
On the contrary, fish is the easiest to digest for huamans, and =
red meat 
and roots like carrots are the most difficult, considered to be n=
egative 
calorie. Rest, all other vegetables and chicken comes inbetween fi=
sh and red 
meat. If you so desire, I can paste a BV chart too. Science is =
very clear about 
this.
 
Don't believe what I am saying. Academic science =
does not ask anyone to believe 
anything. It only says read the evidence wi=
th a clear mind.

With deepest re=

protein der=
ived from Animals. 


We have to take into consideration that animals consu=
me "x" quantity of veg food 
and convert it to "x-y" meat (y will be due to=
 metabolism - 100% conversion or 
more than 100% conversion is impossible).=


Now this "x-y" meat consumed should be compared to what is actually absor=

the human body. I think it is generally known that animal protein i=

a lower rate than plant protein.

Without taking into consid=

Again with sincere respect.

an diet, for which why certain species of animals were domesticated and bre=
ed which would not have survived this long had it not been for human interv=
ention (just like our rice/wheat too would not have survived had it not bee=

 a <br>> diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman term=
