For a big temple-chariot to go along the streets and safely reach its
desti=
nation, not only the strong linchpins but also the obstructing blocks,
whic=
h prevent it from dashing into anything by running to the sides of the
stre=
ets, are indispensable.

Sri Muruganar and Sadhu Om: In the whole of this v=
erse, only an example
[upamana] is given and the =E2=80=98exampled=E2=80=99=
 [upameya] is left to the reader to
infer. It should be understood as follo=
ws: =E2=80=98Similarly,for an aspirant to
successfully complete his tapas o=
r sadhana, not only a blemishless character
and mode of life but also the o=
bstacles that come through prarabdha are
indispensable. Hence, an aspirant =
should accept obstacles patiently, viewing
them as being due to Grace=E2=80=
=99.

For instance, the harsh words, =E2=80=9CWhy all these for one who is =
like this?=E2=80=9D,
uttered by the elder brother of young Venkataraman,whe=
n patiently accepted,
brought forth one great Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi =
to the world. Not only
by unintentional words like these, but even by the i=
ntentional troubles
caused by wicked people, will great good result in the =
life of an aspirant.
