just a snippet....

The End of Days wasn't The End of Days.

An adventure, =
of sorts=85..

In the Second, or Parallel Entry.

             As I said...=
 this was no star, it is a hole with light
shining out of it, and I am damn=
 well falling in to it.... I am going
into it.... Wow !

I did not actually=
 experience going into the white light; I must have
blinked or something.  =
One instant I was about to enter it and the next
instant I was inside of it=
.  I was inside some kind of bubble - a bit
like a cobweb eggshell, or one =
of those string lamp shades that gather
all the dust.  I was aware of mysel=
f inside this thing; like an embryo
in an egg of some kind; or shell.  It w=
as the first time that I could
actually see anything of myself since all th=
is began.  I was somehow
sitting all cramped up like a bloody chicken in an=
 egg; wondering as to
what was on the outside which was so bright; and as t=
o what the hell was
going on now.  But thinking did not come easy at that p=
oint, and perhaps
simply more instinctive than rational thinking.  But I co=
uld still think
somehow.  Beyond this `bubble' which I was cooped up in was=
 a pure
radiance of brilliant and dazzling white light.  A blinding light. =
  Not
the soft gentle white light that I had previously been in prior to th=
is.

I had an instinctive urge of wanting to scratch my way out of this
bub=
ble or whatever it was, or at least see as to what was outside of it.
But t=
here was no form to scratch at.  I could not touch anything even
though I s=
eemed to have some kind of physical form of some kind.  I
think it must hav=
e been simply too bright and blinding to see properly. 
I suddenly realised=
 that the light was getting brighter and even
brighter by the second; blind=
ing and more blinding all the time. Or
perhaps more light was getting in th=
rough the mesh of this thing
somehow. I began to see something - or more tr=
ue to say `know'
something: but what is it... I'm not sure...  No, no no it=
 can't be...
it is... good grief almighty... the thing outside... it is... =
it is ME !
(With that thought, that event, that vision and knowledge - I wa=
s dead;
gone; finished).  I saw no form of anything other than brilliant an=
d
blinding light yet I knew that something outside was myself; it was made
=
obvious; axiomatic; absolute knowledge.  My being, my consciousness,
starte=
d spinning, swooning somehow, spinning in a giddiness like a
vortex of wate=
r going down a bath plug hole: a vortex of self existence
diminishing into =
nothingness.  I knew that my bubble was disintegrating
in the light... and =
so was I...  I am going... I am being damn well
annihilated, melted down, d=
isintegrating, burnt out, annihilated.  It
came to pass that everything end=
ed; everything had gone; and I was gone.
I and the universe were no more.  =
It was the end of time.

*       *       *

  But that was only back to the=
 beginning. There was more. Much more to
come.
