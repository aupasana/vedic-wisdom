Thanks a lot Narsimhaji for the reference.

Just a small note here. In our pariwar, there is a ritual that the 
YagyaAgni or Deepak is never lighted using the matchstick. First the 
agarbatti or something is lighted and then the Yagyagni.

This shloka seems to be the reason behind the practice.

Thanks
