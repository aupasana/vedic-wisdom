Best regards to Narasimha PVR Rao ji
and other respectfull members of this Vedic Astrology group

My question considers my carrier and the real purpose of my everyday
being.So I was studing informatics (still in proces of studying)and was
working in two small private firms up till now. My former company got
others on my
place and I haven't felt good there also. So I quit there. Now there is
huge financial problem in my life in this period. Also in the field of
informatics I was working, I felt, it doesn't fulfill me enough. So the
question is when will I find some suitable job in future and what kind of
carrier path is the most suitable for me as per the vedic astrology charts
and signs from knowledge of the great rishis?
My purpose is under question in this period and I do not know on which
path to follow from here? (have a lot of different talents but haven't got
the best of any of them acting, singing, martial
arts,spokesperson,writing,computers,sales...etc.etc.)
To be precise I have with my family small private firm that sells
aluminium artifacts but that job also feels big crysis in last years.

Other question considers my present girlfriend. I have a large wish to
marry her but the problems I spoke about make her I guess pretty insecure.
These days we had some disputes that made us counterparts. So will this
relationship last and will it lead to a more secure and stable place in
the future or will it end?

My D.O.B is 12.06.1978
T.O.B is 14:15 h
P.O.B is Kragujevac, Serbia

If some other data is needed please tell.
