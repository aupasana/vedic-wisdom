Dear Narasimhaji,
 
 Please answer this question (if you have the time) - I=
 am going to ask it in a very technical "computer sciencey" way so that you=
 get the import of the question I am trying to ask (which so far you have n=
ever answered): Lets say you have a hypothetical camera that can take snaps=
hots of everything material (material in the vedic sense i.e. gunas and hig=
her), then what has changed in a snapshot of a person immediately before th=
ey enter Nirvikalpa samadhi (NVKS for short) and after, assuming the eventu=
al goal is to "return" from NVKS? I do not include Brahman in any "snapshot=
" since it is non material and invariant anyway.

a) Is the Ahamkara gone a=
fter they enter NVKS? If so, how do they return from NVKS, and who is this =
"they" anyway?
b) If Ahamkara and consequently sookshma sarira are still th=
ere, how are they different. 
c) If they are not different, what quantity i=
s it in the person that has gotten enlightened/changed?
All these questions=
 are related to the "doughnut questions" I posed in http://groups.yahoo.com=
/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3357, but I guess you didnt see those (and that=
's quite ok by me, you have so many people constantly expecting replies)

R=
egards,

Sundeep
