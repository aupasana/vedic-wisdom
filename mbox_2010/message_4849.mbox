Namaskaram Narsimhagru,

I do Vishnu homam on a regular basis. Last week wh=
ile doing vishnu homam I felt like offering prayers to maa chandi also. I p=
rayed her with devotion. I immediately felt her energy invoked. As ever sin=
ce there is chaos in the house. Usually I am calm but now I have suddenly b=
ecome very angry. After a very long time I and my husband had a heavy fight=
. Same day a scorpion came inside the house. Yesterday my elder kid got hur=
t badly, today my little daughter injured her head badly while playing crea=
ting more tension in the house. I know with Chandi homam bad karma fastens.=
 So if at all anything bad should happen it should happen to me, then why i=
s my family getting affected. Unable to understand kindly guide. 
Best rega=
rds and many thanks for all the help given so far.

Priya
