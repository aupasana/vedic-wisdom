Dear Vemparla Ram Kishore,

Thank you for yo=
ur reply and your kind explanation. One request, please do not 
use "ji" fo=
r me.

The=C2=A0question I=C2=A0had=C2=A0was=C2=A0related to=C2=A0the visua=
lization of the "fire within" 
and=C2=A0getting=C2=A0the mind ready=C2=A0fo=
r a good visualization.
I do understand that doing a homam regularly makes =
it easier for such a 
visualization.

Well, my sadhana till now has been wi=
th japam due to the limitations that come 
with living in an apartment in t=
he US. I also have twins who just turned 
three=C2=A0and constant disturban=
ce,=C2=A0distractions, and toys=C2=A0being thrown=C2=A0around poses 
some c=
hallenges.

For now, awaiting the next=C2=A0nugget of gold=C2=A0from Narasi=
mha.

Love
Dhananjay

 (Re: Misc Replies)

=C2=A0 
Dhananjay Ji

I possess nowhere near the level=
 of knowledge many of the learned members here 
possess but just felt like =
sharing a little on this topic.It would be like the 
babble of a little chi=
ld before a learned assembly and I am sure Narasimha ji 
will respond with =
a much clearer explanation.

It is the view of the Naths and Siddha Saints =
that ultimately even external Homa 
must lead to Internal homa done in the =
body which is the best.This can take many 
forms such as offering Havishann=
a into the Jatharagni ( Fire in the form of 
digestion) or Mental homa.

Na=
rasimha ji explained this beautifully in the homa manual with stating that =
the 
power of homa is mostly in its visualization , the external homa is fo=
r 
purification of the nadis which leads to excellent visualization. Excell=
ent 
visualization leads to one being a better Mantra Drashta!!!!

The Nath=
 yogis say for example " One is not able to travel to Kashi Vishwavanth 
an=
d wishes to offer Mental Pradakshina to Lord Vishwanath . He should visuali=
ze 
the Temple its surroundings in all its glory with all its intricate det=
ails and 
the important point is it should take the same amount of time it =
would take in 
the real world "

If one has to do a mental homa the visuali=
zation similarly would have to be 
equally detailed with each step happenni=
ng mentally and it taking similar amount 
of time.

I think theoretically t=
he effect of Mental homa would be manifold except that 
due to impurities i=
n the nadis of one not used to sadhana it is much better to 
do external ho=
ma for many years and sharpen that visualization .

Regards
Vemparla Ram Ki=
shore

<DIV>Thank you for your reply =

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The question I had was related=
 to the visualization of the "fire within" and getting the m=

<DIV>I do understand that do=
ing a homam regularly makes it easier for such a visualization.</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>Well, my sadhana till now has been with japam due to the =
limitations that come with living in an apartment in the US. I also have tw=

 and toys being thrown around poses some challenges.</DIV>

<P>Dhananjay Ji<BR><BR>I possess nowhere near the lev=
el of knowledge many of the learned members here possess but just felt like=
 sharing a little on this topic.It would be like the babble of a little chi=
ld before a learned assembly and I am sure Narasimha ji will respond with a=
 much clearer explanation.<BR><BR>It is the view of the Naths and Siddha Sa=
ints that ultimately even external Homa must lead to Internal homa done in =
the body which is the best.This can take many forms such as offering Havish=
anna into the Jatharagni ( Fire in the form of digestion) or Mental homa.<B=
R><BR>Narasimha ji explained this beautifully in the homa manual with stati=
ng that the power of homa is mostly in its visualization , the external hom=
a is for purification of the nadis which leads to excellent visualization. =
Excellent visualization leads to one being a better Mantra Drashta!!!!<BR><=
BR>The Nath yogis say for example " One is not able to travel to Kashi Vish=
wavanth and
 wishes to offer Mental Pradakshina to Lord Vishwanath . He sho=
uld visualize the Temple its surroundings in all its glory with all its int=
ricate details and the important point is it should take the same amount of=
 time it would take in the real world "<BR><BR>If one has to do a mental ho=
ma the visualization similarly would have to be equally detailed with each =
step happenning mentally and it taking similar amount of time.<BR><BR>I thi=
nk theoretically the effect of Mental homa would be manifold except that du=
e to impurities in the nadis of one not used to sadhana it is much better t=
o do external homa for many years and sharpen that visualization .<BR><BR>R=
