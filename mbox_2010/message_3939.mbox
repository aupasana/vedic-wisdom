 On 19th March 1945, a visitor from Sind [Pakistan] asked:

It is said that=
 the world is like a dream. But there is this difference
between dream and =
the waking state. In dream I see my friends or relations
and go through som=
e experiences with them. When I wake up and ask those
friends or relations =
whom I met in the dream about the dream, they know
nothing about it. But in=
 the waking state what I see and hear is
corroborated by so many others.

B=
hagavan Ramana replied:

You should not mix up the dream and the waking sta=
tes.Just as you seek
corroboration about the waking state experiences from =
those whom you see in
the waking state,you must ask for corroboration about=
 the dream experiences
from those whom you saw in the dream state, i.e. whe=
n you wre in the
dream.Then in the dream, those friends and relations whom =
you saw in the
dream wuld corroborate you.

The main point is, are you prep=
ared when awake to affirm the reality of any
of your dream experiences? Sim=
ilarly, one who has awakened into Jnana cannot
affirm the reality of the wa=
king experience.From his view point, the waking
state is dream."

The visit=
or pursued:

It is said only some are chosenm for Self Realization and thos=
e alone would
get it. It is rather discouraging.

Bhagavan Ramana further c=
larified:

All that is meant is, we cannot achieve Realization of Self by o=
ur own
'buddhi' - intellect, unaided by God's grace.
