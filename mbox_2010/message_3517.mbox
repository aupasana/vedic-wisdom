Namaste Narasimhaji and others,
I had a query which I had been contemplatin=
g for some time today. Forgive me if this sounds ridiculous. I was wonderin=
g how Deep Sleep / Coma and Samadhi are related or similar in nature.
Altho=
ugh I have not experienced samadhi in any form but have managed to concentr=
ate intensely for shorter periods of time during japams and homams. Here ar=
e a few thoughts of mine. Kindly let me know your opinion.

1) Can we compa=
re a person in deep sleep with a person in Samadhi (nirvikalpa or otherwise=
) ? 
In both cases the person becomes unaware of the physical surroundings =
and sees images , hears sounds etc(as per the accounts of Pandit Gopi Krish=
na)
He can smell fragrances, feel transported to a different world and even=
 speak to persons ,deities , beings.

2) There have been instances where pe=
ople after being in Coma have come back to life. During coma these people h=
ave experienced out of body experiences like seeing their own body from out=
side, floating in air etc.. all very similar to what Ramakrishna and Gopi k=
rishan mention in their accounts when they experienced samadhi.

Again plea=
se forgive me if this analogy is totally outrageous or plain stupid . But I=
 felt I need to clarify this hence the post.

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Su=
ndaram
