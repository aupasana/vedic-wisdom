My personal opinion is that unless you know how to transform the semen into=
 something else it is probably difficult to keep it in the body.
Also I hav=
e noticed/read that there is some relationship between semen and phases of =
moon.
so if you watch the phases of moon then you may get hint on which day=
s not to sleep in order to avoid losing the semen.=C2=A0
e.g. could be ekad=
asi thithi in which it is suggested not to sleep in the night, purnima etc
=
This is what I wish to share
Manish

Namaskarams Narasimhaji=

I have been reading the mail exchanges on Aghor=
a and Bramacharya with avid interest and here are a few cents of thoughts a=
nd also a request for correcting my line of thinking in case I am going dow=
n the wrong path. I have been doing the Ganapathi Homam for the past half a=
 year or so and I should say that I am not maintaining the Brahmacharya as =
"defined" in the mail exchanges and some books. I feel that the problem wit=
h Sex with most of us is that we tend to identify it with something wrong o=
r something which is "impure" and hence forbidden. I have been performing s=
ome experiments in my daily life and I have found that it is defintitely po=
ssible to avoid the feelings of Lust, Greed and other feelings even while h=
aving sex. Although I am not perfect in this but I feel with lot of practic=
e it should=C2=A0be possible to achieve a state of mind even during sex whe=
re you are focussed on=C2=A0God and not wavered by the feelings that accomp=
anies mundane
 sex. In this case even something as materialistic as Sex wil=
l be transformed into a=C2=A0intense spiritual sadhana.=C2=A0If you start t=
hinking of Sex not as sometihng Impure and start doing it as Karma itself w=
ith out any other accompanying thoughts and do the "Act" itself as an offer=
ing to God then I feel that Brahmacharya as defined conventionally is not n=
eeded. I would say that we are very much observing Brahmacharya. Now coming=
 to Ojas I doubt that Ojas can be so physical as Semen. If the act of Sex i=
s itself perfomed as an offering to God and without any thoughts other than=
 that of God then where is the question of loosing any spiritual energy . I=
n fact you are adding to your spiritual growth. 
I have observed a change i=
n myself after doing this practically over the past couple of months. I hav=
e found that gradually over a period of time even though its possible to co=
mpletely abstain from physical sex, it is also possible to avoid getting sw=
ayed by it and also not crave for it.
=C2=A0
Continuing further=C2=A0, how =
would one justify "Nightfalls" which is a natural phenomenon wherein the bo=
dy automatically purges excess semen collected over a period of time when o=
ne is asleep without the persons control.In other words it is an involuntar=
y=C2=A0action just like breathing.
=C2=A0
Can this also be=C2=A0intrepreted=
 as break in Brahmacharya? I would be keen to know the experiences of those=
 persons who have abstained from physical sex for an extended period of tim=
e and=C2=A0what they think=C2=A0of=C2=A0"Nightfalls" .
=C2=A0
************ =

=C2=A0
I think that e=
very action that we do should be done with the thought of an offering to go=
d. For example even while having food , we can think each bite as an offeri=
ng to Ganapathi in fire (actually there is a fire in our stomach which burn=
s the food) , Our entire body can be visuilased like a living moving Homa k=
undam where we continuously offer ahuti of differnet materials. If we conci=
ously make this effort over a period of time we would think less about the =
process of eating=C2=A0food itself , the accompanying pleasure of taste etc=
 and concentrate more on mental homam which we are performing. Every though=
t process can be considered as an ahuti inside the mental fire in our soul.=
Like this every action that we do in our daily life can be thought as a hom=
am itself and thereby achieve the state of mind where there is no distincti=
on between the so called "Pure" and "Impure" , "Good" and "Bad" and so on.
=
=C2=A0
Please let us=C2=A0know your thoughts on this. If possible try to ge=
t Manishji's opinion on this as well.

rahmacharya (Re: Regarding Ganapati Homam...)


=C2=A0 

Namaste Biswajit,
=

Good luck with homam. Others answered your questions and I will leave them=
. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on aghora s=
eems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand when =
we are communicating verbally, because one's own mental conditioning has a =
role in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-text. It=
 is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.

* * *

> 3. When t=
he talking of "AGHORA" going on, is it really needed
> to perform "Bramhach=
ariya" for daily ganapati homam?

Brahmacharya is very important in any spi=
ritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in loss of=
 ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one's creative essence. Doing =
sadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leaking th=
rough a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it will so=
on become
 empty!

Just as a filled water pot that is leaking may still sat=
isfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similarly a =
person doing sadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do his d=
harma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do sadha=
na even as one's brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be if the=
 filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a sadh=
aka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak that =
energy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serv=
e dharma better.

If there are 12 people who maintain physical and mental b=
rahmacharya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the world c=
an be changed.

* * *

If an aghora sits naked with partner and chants mant=
ra, please remember that the goal isn't having sex. This practice is by mea=
ns a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*.
 Even if the mind is ov=
erwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the goal=
 is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy as =
something to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahmacha=
rya can be maintained despite such provocation.

In fact, the true meaning =
of brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to refrai=
n from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be abl=
e to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain phys=
ical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain from me=
ntal thoughts.

An aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those thoug=
hts in his mind (what Manish called as "sampradaaha" ). Mind considers some=
 things as pure and some things as impure. The "impure" objects and circums=
tances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other distur=
bance to the mind and waver it
 from god. But an aghora puts them right in =
the middle of a "pure" activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to deal =
with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or o=
ther disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impure=
! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure abo=
ut it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind and=
 waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what i=
s impure about it?

That is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yogis=
 may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opposi=
te sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of a =
naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his mind=
 may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinerate =
the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be aroused=
 by, not by
 staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to fo=
cus the mind on god.

Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may s=
tray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more per=
fect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahmach=
arya.

If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it ma=
y be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the othe=
r attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.

* * *

The coa=
rse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.

The finer meaning of bra=
hmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts even=
 in the mind.

The finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, =
anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in Bra=
hman always. Brahmacharya literally means "engaging in Brahman or Self". On=
e experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy
 etc only when one's mind perceiv=
es and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful la=
dy, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me e=
tc) and NOT when one's mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacha=
rya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celibac=
y and control over anger.

Rome is not built in a day.

Bottomline: It is v=
ery important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. St=
art off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes =
on. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.

* * *

BTW,=
 regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be b=
urning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming =
your offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.

Keep it as chea=
p as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood stick=
s
 collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.

Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha

fraining from lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and esta=
blishing mind in Brahman always. Brahmacharya literally means "engaging in =
Brahman or Self". One experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy
 etc only whe=
n one's mind perceives and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self =
(e.g. a beautiful lady, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being apprec=
iated more than me etc) and NOT when one's mind engages in true Self. Thus =
the truest brahmacharya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start w=
ith physical celibacy and control over anger.<br><br>Rome is not built in a=

 try to improve it as time goes on. Never be frustrated with lack of progre=

 goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be burning in the ember form for a =
long time. So Agni is still there consuming your offerings, even after it s=

 some sesame seeds may be all you need.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<b=
