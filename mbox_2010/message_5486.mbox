Once, while Dattatreya was roaming in a forest happily, he met king Yadu, w=
ho on seeing Dattatreya so happy, asked him the secrets of his happiness an=
d also the name of his Guru. Dattatreya said that the Atma alone was his Gu=
ru and yet he had learned wisdom from twenty-four individuals and that they=
 were therefore his Gurus.

Dattatreya then mentioned the names of his twen=
ty-four Gurus and spoke of the wisdom that he had learnt from each.

Dattat=
reya said: "The names of my twenty-four teachers are:
1. Earth
2. Water
3. =
Air
4. Fire
5. Sky
6. Moon
7. Sun
8. Pigeon
9. Python
10. Ocean
11. Moth
12=
. Honey-gatherer
13. Bee
14. Elephant
15. Deer
16. Fish
17. Dancing girl Pi=
ngala
18. Raven
19. Child
20. Maiden
21. Serpent
22. Arrow-maker
23. Spider=

24. Beetle

1. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the ea=
rth, for it endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it=
 does him good by producing crops, trees, etc.

2. From water I have learnt=
 the quality of purity. Just as the pure water cleanses others, so also the=
 sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust, egoism, anger, greed, e=
tc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.

3. The air is always=
 moving through various objects, but it never gets attached to anyone of th=
em; so I have learnt from the air to be without attachment, though I move w=
ith many people in- this world.

4. Just as fire burns bright, so also the =
sage should be glowing with the splendour of his knowledge and Tapas.

5. T=
he air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but the =
sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky t=
hat the Atma is all-pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.

6=
. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or increas=
e, on account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I have lear=
nt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that it is =
only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.

7. Just a=
s the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many different=
 reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the Upadhis (bo=
dies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson I have =
learnt from the sun.

8. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young bird=
s. A fowler spread a net and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was =
very much attached to her children. She did not care to live, so she fell i=
nto the net and was caught. The male pigeon was attached to the female pige=
on, so he also fell into the net and was caught. From this I learnt that at=
tachment was the cause of bondage.

9. The python does not move about for i=
ts food. It remains contented with whatever it gets and lies in one place. =
>From this I have learnt to be unmindful of food and to be contented with wh=
atever I get to eat (Ajahara Vritti).

10. Just as the ocean remains unmove=
d even though hundreds of rivers fall into it, so also, the wise man should=
 remain unmoved among all sorts of temptations, difficulties and troubles. =
This is the lesson I have learnt from the ocean.

11. Just as the moth, bei=
ng enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls into it and is burnt up, =
so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a beautiful girl comes to =
grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the mind on the Self is the=
 lesson I have learnt from the moth.

12. Just as black bee sucks the honey=
 from different flowers and does not suck it from only one flower, so also =
I take only a little food from one house and a little from another house an=
d thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha or Madhukari Vritti). I am not =
a burden on the householder.

13. Bees collect honey with great trouble, bu=
t a hunter comes and takes the honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealt=
h and other things with great difficulty, but they have to leave them all a=
t once and depart when the Lord of Death takes hold of them. From this I ha=
ve learnt the lesson that it is useless to hoard things.

14. The male elep=
hant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with grass, even at th=
e sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught, enchained and tort=
ured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps of women and co=
me to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the lesson I have =
learnt from the elephant.

15. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunte=
r through its love of music. Even so, a man is attracted by the music of wo=
men of loose character and brought to destruction. One should never listen =
to lewd songs. This is the lesson I have learnt from the deer.

16. Just as=
 a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait, so also,=
 the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to overpower =
him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for food must=
 therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the fish.=


17. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was=
 tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then sh=
e decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep.=
 I have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of ho=
pe leads to contentment.

18. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pu=
rsued and beaten by other birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained=
 peace and rest. From this I have learnt the lesson that a man in the world=
 undergoes all sorts of troubles and miseries when he runs after sensual pl=
easures and that he becomes as happy as the bird when he abandons the sensu=
al pleasures.

19. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries=
 and anxieties, and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfu=
lness from the child.

20. The parents of a young girl had gone in search o=
f a proper bridegroom for her. The girl was alone in the house. During the =
absence of the parents, a party of people came to the house to see her on a=
 similar mission. She received the party herself. She went inside to husk t=
he paddy. While she was husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tre=
mendous jingling noise. The wise girl reflected thus: "The party will detec=
t, by the noise of the bangles, that I am husking the paddy myself and that=
 my family is too poor to engage others to get the work done. Let me break =
all my bangles except two on each hand". Accordingly, she broke all the ban=
gles except two on each hand. Even those two bangles created much noise. Sh=
e broke one more bangle in each hand. There was no further noise though she=
 continued husking. I have learnt from the girl=EF=BF=BDs experience the fo=
llowing:=EF=BF=BDLiving among many would create discord, disturbance, dispu=
te and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be unnecessary words or=
 strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone in solitude.

21.=
 A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by other=
s. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for himself H=
e should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the lesson =
that I have learnt from the snake.

22. The mind of an arrow-maker was once=
 wholly engrossed in sharpening and straightening an arrow. While he was th=
us engaged, a king passed before his shop with his whole retinue. After som=
e time, a man came to the artisan and asked him whether the king had passed=
 by his shop. The artisan replied that he had not noticed anything. The fac=
t was that the artisan=EF=BF=BDs mind had been so solely absorbed in his wo=
rk that he had not known the king=EF=BF=BDs passing before his shop. I have=
 learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration of mind.

23.=
 The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into cobweb=
s. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man make=
s a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should ther=
efore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the l=
esson I have learnt from the spider.

24. The Bhringi or the beetle catches=
 hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and gives it a sting. The poor worm, a=
lways fearing the return of the beetle and the sting, and thinking constant=
ly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself. Whatever form a man constantly t=
hinks of, he attains in course of time. As a man thinks, so he becomes. I h=
ave learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn myself into Atma by contemp=
lating constantly on It and thus to give up all attachment to the body and =
attain Moksha or liberation".

King Yadu was highly impressed by the teachi=
ngs of Dattatreya. He abandoned the world and practised constant meditation=
 on the Self.

Dattatreya was absolutely free from intolerance or prejudice=
 of any kind. He learnt wisdom from whatever source it came. All seekers af=
ter wisdom should follow the example of Dattatreya.
