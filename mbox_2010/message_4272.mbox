Thanks Kishore garu for your explanation.

Dear Jai,

Your First Question :=


So you and I are exchanging unreal information in an unreal world ? Thus
=
whatever you are saying is also unreal.Why would I need to do Karma in an
u=
nreal world ? Is Karma even unreal ?

Answer:

Bhagavan says that we don=E2=
=80=99t deem a dream, a dream till we wake up, that the
dream looks quite r=
eal while it lasts; and that similarly this waking state
will not appear a =
dream till we wake up into jnana.Because of the above
difference between th=
e dream and the waking states, our effort is called for
and this is where k=
arma philosophy comes.

There is an elephant in the forest.The elephant is =
scared about the Lion in
the forest.The Lion has not appeared before the el=
ephant in recent times. It
was once sighted and the elephant became totally=
 afraid of lion. One night,
the elephant dreamt of the Lion, it got scared =
even its dream about the
Lion. It woke up with a huge cry.There was not Lio=
n. Only it was there. The
elephant got self realized.

Bhagavan Ramana used=
 to tell one story:

Once two persons were sleeping in a hall.Both were poo=
r.During the sleep,
one man was dreaming.He dreamt that he is a very rich p=
erson and he has
stacked all the gold and currency in a cupboard.And a thie=
f comes and takes
away all the gold and currency, and runs away.The dreamin=
g man shouts in
shock: "O! the thief is running away with all my wealth.

P=
lease catch him, please catch him...."

The other man woke up. He was not d=
reaming anything, neither the thief, nor
the gold and currency. What shall =
he do? Will he run out to the front yard
to catch the thief? Will he rush t=
o the police station to complain? He will
simply wake that wailing man from=
 sleep and dream.

The Guru is like the man who wakes us, the dreaming men,=
 up.The only
difference is that the Guru is within your Heart.

-----------=
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------------------

Your Second Question :

Why does consciousness co=
nstruct anything ? Why can't it just be as it is ?
What is the need for an =
unreal world ?

Answer:

Bhagavan's famous quote regarding whether the un-r=
eality of the world

Just as the spider emits the thread [of its web] out f=
rom its own mouth and
again withdraws it back, so the mind projects the wor=
ld out from itself and
again absorbs it back within.

Since the knower [the=
 jiva], the known [the worldappearance] and the knowing
[the act of perceiv=
ing the world through the five senses] form a triad
[triputi], all of them =
are equally false. In other words, since even the
jiva who is seen and his =
act of seeing are both a part of the
world-appearance, they are both unreal=
 as that appearance.

To illustrate this, let us suppose that a film is tak=
en of a king watching a
cinema show; when this film is projected, are not t=
he king and his act of
watching the cinema show, both pictures in the film?=


As known Adi Shanakara said,

(1) Brahman is real,
(2) the universe is un=
real, and
(3) The universe is Brahman.

He did not stop at the second, beca=
use the third explains the other two. It
signifies that the universe is rea=
l if perceived as the Self, and unreal if
perceived apart from the Self. He=
nce maya and reality are one and the same.

Bhagavan Ramana says,At the lev=
el of the spiritual seeker you have got to
say that the world is an illusio=
n. There is no other way. When a man forgets
that he is Brahman, who is rea=
l, permanent and omnipresent, and deludes
himself into thinking that he is =
a body in the universe which is filled with
bodies that are transitory, and=
 labours under that delusion, you have got to
remind him that the world is =
unreal and a delusion. Why?

So long as a man does not see the Self which i=
s the origin of all, but looks
only at the external world as real and perma=
nent, you have to tell him that
all this external universe is an illusion. =
You cannot help it.

Take a paper. We see only the script, and nobody notic=
es the paper on which
the script is written. The paper is there whether the=
 script on it is there
or not.To those who look upon the script as real, yo=
u have to say that it is
unreal, an illusion, since it rests upon the paper=
. The wise man looks upon
both the Paper and script as one. So also with Br=
ahman and the universe.

Just as fire is obscured by smoke, the shining lig=
ht of consciousness is
obscured by the assemblage of names and forms,the wo=
rld.

Ramana Maharshi=E2=80=99s actual experience is ajata though he Suppor=
ts Simultaneous
Creation(drishti-srishti vada)

World and life have<br>

attributes and will definitely look temporary. Kar=

Until karma is selflessly <br>performed, I-ness expects, observes, judges a=

consciousness exists to oper=
