Dear Respected Shri Narsimha,
Namaste,

I joined this group about one year =
back and during this time find lot of new practices though knowledge sharin=
g on this group.
I wonder how to overcome the thought process of every act =
done/ thought generated calling me again and again. One fine day I visited =
my guru ji with this question who helped me by suggesting that the speed of=
 the mantra has to very slow and enjoy every word in it whenever you are do=
ing jap.
In the process it is realised that the act done/ thoughts generate=
d may be offered to the mantra itself and soon after within few days all th=
e thought process revolving in mind vanished and now can concentration on w=
ork/ jap with increased intensity.
Kindly guide further.
Regards/ Ganesh Gu=
lati
