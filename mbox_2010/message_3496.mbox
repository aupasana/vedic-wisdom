Namaste,
=C2=A0
Only in Hindu religion(most of the castes) they cremate the=
 body whereas
in other religions they are buried after doing the last relig=
ious rites. Does
their soul wander? Can a similair sadhana is possible on a=
 body which is 
buried and not creamted?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This specific sadhan=
a is basically a homa. So a fire is a must. Therefore it can be done only i=
n a body that is being cremated.
=C2=A0
Those who are expert in Aghor sadha=
nas, can and do perform many other kinds of sadhanas as well with a corpse,=
 which do not require a fire. Like a Shav Sadhana etc. These can be done - =
so I have been told - on any fresh corpse (with some more specific requirem=
ents) irrespective of the religion of the person who died.

=C2=A0
I also l=
like to add from one of the mails in another group wherein the writer
has s=
aid that the entire Kasi is filled up with shiva linga ie wherever u dig
th=
e ground after some depth u find Shiva lingam and that is the reason
the wh=
ole of Kasi is energised
=C2=A0
The whole of Kashi is indeed energized. I h=
ad asked Manish this question. He said that scientifically speaking, Varana=
si exists between two rivers, Varuna and Asi. These flow in clockwise and a=
nti-clockwise directions around Kashi, therefore creating some subtle curre=
nt which pervade this whole city. However, a bigger query is whether this=
=C2=A0is an accidental creation of nature, or someone, something deliberate=
ly created the city in this way so that energies exist.

Dear Rajarshi,

=C2=A0 Namaste. What an inspiring recitation =
of the experiences. After reading the third day's experience about the "MOK=
UL", I wonder, is there religion among SPIRITS also.....I mean there are sp=
irits of all religions floating around....I was, in my limited knowledge, t=
hinking that the religion is only to the body...Please shed some light on t=
his...

=C2=A0 Narasimhaji, can you please enlighten on this...

=C2=A0 Tha=
nks a lot for sharing these experiences. .

Acharyulu
