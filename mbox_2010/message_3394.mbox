 SANKARACHARYA was a Brahmajnani, to be sure! But at the beginning he too
had the feeling of differentiation. He didn't have the absolute faith that
everything in the world is Brahman.

One day as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath,he saw an
untouchable, a butcher, carrying a load of meat. Inadvertently the butcher
touched his body.

Sankara shouted angrily, "Hey there! How dare you touch me?" "Revered sir",
said the butcher, "I have not touched you, nor have you touched me.

The pure Self cannot be the body or the five elements or the twenty four
cosmic principles." Then Sankara came to his senses.
