Namaste All,
     This depends on the diety you chose  for prayers or Homa.=
 From what i read somewhere Krishna/Vishnu devotees generally gets closer t=
o the diety by giving up or having to give up material comforts, before you=
 reach the goal. One can see that in saints like Mirabai etc That is why it=
 is said that many saints/monks who are devotees of krishna/vishnu also do =
worship dieties in mother/devi form so that they will continue to get their=
 basic needs.
Warm Regards
Shashi
