Utpal Ji

Narasimha ji will surely explain it much better , just sharing my=
 view. 
Intiation in the specific context of Sri Vidya or Sadhana of the Go=
ddess is basically similar to the analogy of Gayatri mantra intiation often=
 mentioned by Narasimha ji( Example of a rich man putting a million dollars=
 in his son's bank account...similar to the guru passing on a siddha mantra=
) .Others might not be so fortunate to have that opportunity but it just me=
ans they start with a empty bank balance and have to strive a little harder=
.

There is a very beautiful book by Pandit Rajmani Tigunait of the Himalay=
an Institute who is a disciple of Swami Rama .The book also explains mantra=
 shastra.

Google books link attached.

Power of Mantra and the mystery of =
Intiation
