 I was born at Madurai in 1924. I had my first darshan of Bhagavan in 1937
=
when I was just thirteen.

Tiruchuzhi Lakshmiammal was there at that time. =
She had been a playmate of
Bhagavan at Tiruchuzhi. She introduced me to Bha=
gavan as her relative.
Bhagavan asked me, "O, from Madurai? Which school ar=
e you studying in?" I
answered that I was studying in Sethupathi High Schoo=
l. Bhagavan commented,
"Oh! That school is very old."

Lakshmiammal had fou=
r sons and Lalita was the daughter of her second son,
Dr. Narayana Iyer. He=
r first three sons, Ramakrishna Iyer, Narayana Iyer and
Mahadeva Iyer were =
all Licensed Medical Practitioner doctors, certified from
the Tanjore Medic=
al College. The fourth son, Guruswamy, was a teacher.

When Lalita was born=
 in 1926 and brought to the presence of Bhagavan, he
named her Lalita, tell=
ing her parents, "You worship Sri Chakra and Sri
Vidya, so name her Lalita.=
"

When we were young Lakshmiammal told my parents that her grand daughter
=
Lalita and I were made for each other and that we should marry. In 1943 whe=
n
I was 19 and she 17 our marriage took place.

My wife Lalita was the one =
who had been with Bhagavan right from her
childhood. Bhagavan taught her co=
oking, grinding, mixing condiments, making
garlands, etc. He would even pla=
y children's games with her. When they were
young, my wife Lalita, Manavasi=
 Ramaswami's daughter, Lalita Venkataraman
and others would play in the Ash=
ram. Bhagavan would sometimes call them, ask
them to come near, and narrate=
 stories to them.

We built a new house at Madurai and we went to Ramanasra=
mam and invited
Bhagavan to come and grace our grihapravesam (house warming=
 ceremony).
Bhagavan laughed and pointing to the Hill said, "You make this =
Annamalai to
come and then I too shall come."

Once when my wife and mother=
-in-law were assisting Bhagavan in grinding rice
and black gram for the nex=
t day iddli preparation, utilizing a mortar,
Lalita said, "Bhagavan you pus=
h the flour and I shall grind," to which
Bhagavan replied, " No Lalita, if =
I push the flour I may forget myself and
crush my fingers. So you push the =
flour and follow my grinding." Casual
utterances like these by Bhagavan wer=
e pregnant with meaning. This indicated
his state.

When we were there, occ=
asionally Chinnaswami would report to Bhagavan that
the storeroom was almos=
t empty and that he was at a loss for what to do for
the morrow. Bhagavan w=
ould advise him not to worry. Then some devotees like
us would bring rice, =
dhal, provisions, leaf-plates, etc.

Once somebody who saw Bhagavan sitting=
 on the sofa in the old hall
commented, "For a sadhu what need is there of =
a sofa?" Hearing this Bhagavan
smiled and told Lalita, "Look Lalita, am I s=
itting for my sake on the sofa?
It is for others that I am here. For me, ac=
tually, I do not require anything
at all."


Bhagavan used to talk to me fr=
eely when we were alone. When I was with him
every morning at 4 `o clock he=
 would sometimes tell about his days in the
Arunachala Temple, life on the =
Hill, etc. His boyhood classmate and
playmate, Vilachery Ranga Iyer, would =
also tell me about his association
with Bhagavan. He once told me that one =
day at Madurai while swimming in a
tank he got trapped in the outlet. Bhaga=
van immediately went and rescued
him. Later on, he would say, "Bhagavan you=
 rescued me once from the tank now
you should rescue me from samsara." It w=
as usual for boys in those days to
plait their long hair. Once when Venkato=
o (son of Chinnaswami) was a child
staying at Skandashram he refused to all=
ow anyone to plait his hair. Then a
snake slowly slithered into the Ashram.=
 Bhagavan just told it to go away and
it obeyed. Turning to the boy, Bhagav=
an said, "Even the snake obeys. Why
don't you too obey."

Bhagavan used to =
sit on a raised platform at the entrance to Skandashram
every morning. Arou=
nd that time of the day visitors from out of town would
usually arrive by r=
ail. Whenever he saw any devotee or devotees climbing up
towards the Ashram=
 he would tell others to prepare extra food for the
newcomers.

One of my w=
ife's uncles set up a medical practice near Courtalam and donated
a piece o=
f land to one of the devotees of Bhagavan, named Sivaiya. Sivaiya
establish=
ed an Ashram there and came to be known as Mouna Swami of
Courtalam. Later =
hearing that there were herbs on the Arunachala Hill that
would turn base m=
etal into gold he came to Bhagavan and asked about the
herbs. Bhagavan told=
 him, "You are a sannyasi. Why do you want to be an
alchemist? Don't be int=
erested in all these siddhis. They will lead you
astray," and sent him away=
.

Bhagavan would tell me about the greatness of the Hill =E2=80=94 how it =
is a hill of
effulgence. Just because trees grow on it we should not take i=
t to be an
ordinary hill. He would extol the merits of going round the Hill=
.

In 1946 when we visited the Ashram, we were standing near the newly buil=
t
hospital and Bhagavan was returning from the hill after his evening strol=
l.
When he came near he told my wife Lalita, "You are a doctor's daughter. =
Your
father and your uncles, Dr. Narayana Iyer, Dr. Mahadeva Iyer, Dr.
Rama=
krishna Iyer are all doctors. So go and help in arranging medicines in
disp=
ensary." Accordingly, my wife and I stayed there for three days and
arrange=
d the medicines.

Once when we were taking leave of Bhagavan, he told us to=
 stay for two more
days. We obeyed him and on the next day there was a heav=
y downpour and part
of the railway track from Villupuram to Trichy was inun=
dated. The trains
were cancelled. Now we understood why Bhagavan wanted us =
to stay for two
more days.

Once when my wife informed Bhagavan that she wa=
s going to Tiruchuzhi, he
told her to visit his house, the temple, the prim=
ary school where he
studied, the tank where he swam and other places where =
he used to play, etc.

People who come to Bhagavan think that he is just li=
ke any other sage and
casually bow to him and go away, but he is Dakshinamu=
rti himself. Whether at
Virupaksha Cave, at Skandashram, in the Old Hall, o=
utside the hall, in the
Jubilee Hall or in the New Hall he always used to s=
it facing south like
Dakshinamurti. Even while lying down in the Nirvana Ro=
om the door was facing
south and he gave us his darshan facing south.

When=
 Bhagavan had the tumour on his arm my wife saw the wound and started
sobbi=
ng uncontrollably. Bhagavan looked at her and said, "After coming to me
for=
 so long she still doesn't know that it is the body that suffers and not
I.=
 Am I the body?"
