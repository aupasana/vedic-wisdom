 "It is all a question of the mind. Bondage and liberation are of the mind
alone.

The mind will take the colour you dye it with. It is like white clothes just
returned from the laundry. If you dip them in red dye, they will be red. If
you dip them in blue or green, they will be blue or green. They will take
only the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be.

If you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your
companions. On the other hand, when you are in the company of devotees, you
will think and talk only of God.

"The mind is everything. A man has his wife on one side and his daughter on
the other. He shows his affection to them in different ways. But his mind is
one and the
same.

"Bondage is of the mind, and freedom is also of the mind. A man is free if
he constantly thinks: 'I am a free soul. How can I he bound, whether I live
in the world or in the forest? I am a child of God, the King of Kings. Who
can bind me?'
