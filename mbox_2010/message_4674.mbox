Dear Narasimhaji (or other wise people on this group),

My father passed aw=
ay a few hours ago, and I am in shock. I am in the US and will be travellin=
g to India within the next few hours. My father's last wish as communicated=
 to my mother was to be cremated in an electric crematorium. I have to make=
 the decision. It doesnt sound right to me. What do I do so that his soul t=
ruly rests in peace. I very desperately want to make the right decision. Sh=
ould I honor his wish? An additional question - when does the soul leave th=
e body: 48 hours will have passed by the time I get there?

Please reply qu=
ickly.

Details of the time etc: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sohamsa/mess=
