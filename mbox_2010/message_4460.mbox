 Devotee: =E2=80=9CThere must be stages of progress for gaining the Absolut=
e. Are
there grades of Reality?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CThere are no g=
rades of Reality. There are grades in the
experience of the jiva.=E2=80=9D
=

Note: =E2=80=9CGrades of Reality?=E2=80=9D Reality is perfect because it i=
s partless,
integral, and changeless, or else it contradicts itself.So, Rea=
lity is not
affected by evolution, nor is it divisible into a number of imp=
erfect beings
who need the evolution to attain perfection. We have seen els=
ewhere that the
jiva is the Self itself, but deluded.

The appearance of mu=
ltiplicity of jivas is an illusion due to the unfoldment
of the senses whic=
h create qualities and hence differences. Bhagavan says
that it is not the =
Self that has grades but the experiences of the jivas. Thus
the difference =
between the savage and the Jnani is one of experience, that
is, of mental o=
utlooks and not of substance =E2=80=94 of being.

Devotee: =E2=80=9CThere i=
s a multiplicity of jivas. Jivas are certainly many.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =
=E2=80=9CJiva is called so because he sees the world. A dreamer sees many
j=
ivas in dream, but all of them are not real. The dreamer alone exists and
h=
e sees all. So it is with the individuals and the world.=E2=80=9D

Note: Th=
e critics argue that if the world is the senses, as Vedanta says,
individua=
l senses would show exclusively individual worlds, so that there
would be a=
s many worlds as there are human beings with no connection with
one another=
,which experience disproves.

Bhagavan answers that all the senses, all the=
 men and all the worlds are the
dreams or thoughts of the jiva, which alone=
 exists as the dreamer or
thinker. As the jiva in dream sees other jivas wi=
th bodies and senses,
without any of them enjoying real existence, so it do=
es in the waking state
(jagrat).

Jagrat is called waking only in compariso=
n with the dream state known to us,
because the senses are then all out to =
intensify the illusion of a real
external world, whereas the dream state fe=
eds on mere impressions carried
over from the state of jagrat, and not on t=
he senses, which are then
withdrawn.
