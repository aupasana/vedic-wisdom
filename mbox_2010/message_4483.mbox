Pranams,

Learned members please help me with this puzzle. Every time I com=
e across the karma theory the following puzzle troubles me.

Let's take two=
 milestomes of world population. In the year 1927 it was 2 billion and in t=
he year 1999 it was 6 billion. That means it has multiplied three fold over=
 a period of seventy two years which is the average human longevity. Let's =
leave aside the fine maths about these figures. This means that every human=
 being who existed in 1927 must have died before 1999 and reborn( you may l=
eave provison of a few millions for those centenarians). There were 2 billi=
on jeevatmas "trapped in human bodies"in 1927 and 6 billion in 1999, an add=
itional 4 billion. Where did they come from? I am able to see only two poss=
ibilities.

1. Each jeevatma divided itself into 3 ( or more or less). In w=
hich case did the sanchita karma of the original jeevatma of 1927 also get =
divided between the three ? That should make the karma less intense nowadya=
s. Or did the 3 jeevatmas inherit the entire karma of their predecessor eac=
h one in full (poornamada poornamidam ........)?

2.Some jeevatmas "trapped=
" in plants and animals graduated into humans. Karma arises only out of act=
ion performed with free will or action performed with attachment. Plants an=
d animals do not carry any sanchita karma. When they are at the entry level=
 of a series of human lives they should be coming in with a zero balance of=
 sanchita karma. In which case, at least 4 billion (or even a billion if my=
 maths is wrong !) of the world population should not have any sanchita kar=
ma.

Or, it could be a mix of the above two.

Or, is it possible that the t=
otal number of humans who have died until now could exceed 6 billion ? This=
 may not be possible because from generation to generation we see a multipl=
ication of numbers. 1+2+4 can not be more than 8. That's why the population=
 is on the increase.

Please help.
