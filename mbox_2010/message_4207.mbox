I recall in one of past mails, Narasimha mentioned offering lemon (if I rem=
ember, as poornahuti) would help counter black magic.

Try searching throug=
h the archives.

Consider tarpanam on behalf of your wife. Tarpanam relieve=
s us from vasanans. Tarpanams may help in increasing mental well being!

If=
 your wife is inclined towards spirituality, you may want to try suggesting=
 her to do homam as well!

My intution suggests (please don't give too much=
 weight to my intution) that you offer ahutis for Nageswara (a form of Siva=
 - you can simply recite lingashtakam if you are unaware of any other mantr=
a).

God bless you.

Best regards,
Vijay

ises few doubts on your intent. If your wife is destroying every thing in y=
