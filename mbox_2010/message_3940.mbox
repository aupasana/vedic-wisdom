Dear Raju,

It seems honest outburst. One person in my office read your mes=
sage and she was very happy reading it because she identified with your tho=
ughts instantly and i am sure that you have echoed feelings of few others.
=

BUT i am not entirely agreeing with this. It sounds like- because 'Agni' i=
s very effective medium for praying, one is taking its advantage to get all=
 the mundane benefits, release from various troubling issues, fulfilling th=
e worldly ambitions. It's like switching the source (Normal prayers in temp=
les, Japam etc...) for asking the same thing. It's like acting very smart w=
ith God. 

Narasimha Insisted in his homam manual about the mental attitude=
. He indicated that one is hoped to use these manuals for Spiritual purpose=
 (purifying or getting control over internal nature) and to the benefit of =
the external nature (World at large) 

I am not trying to be rude or 'holie=
r than thou' but sincerely request you to change this mental attitude. I, y=
ou and others must cultivate the idea of self surrender. Oh Mother! We are =
doing this homam and request you to take us from darkness to Light, from le=
sser truth to higher truth, from poison (desires) to Nectar (Devotion). Ple=
ase make us so strong that we can accept, with mental equilibrium, whatever=
 you decide for us. Eradicate our ego and make us tools in your hands. Make=
 us sit on your lap by purifying us.
After some few years struggle, i have =
understood that one must not confuse Spiritual rituals with Material benefi=
ts.

As Narayana said our money, fame etc...are the result of Rnas/Karmas. =


We must pray during homam for the continuation of daily Homam. Let Mother=
 take care of that in the same breath i would also say here that it is perf=
ectly human to ask for help if something in life is really going unbearable=
. If once in a while, i ask Maha Ganapati to show me a way out from a troub=
led relationship or disastrous financial troubles. such prayer may naturall=
y come if one is really going through deep trouble and that should be fine =
but we must consciously avoid to pray for so called good things in life-Nam=
e, fame, money, career, Roti, Kapada, makan, dukan, biwi, bachha, motor gad=
i etc...:)

Regret if I was all "Chhota mu badi baat"

Yours,

Utpal
