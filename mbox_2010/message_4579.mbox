 The Upanishadic line: "Mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation o=
f
men," rises from my heart and dances in the pathway of the mind. The meth=
od
of practice here is only to let go of that oppressive spirit. Here we ca=
n
for once at least experience the truth of Patanjali's aphorism: "Yoga is
=
control of the modifications of the mind."

His Routine

Even at the first =
crow of the cock, the Sage leaves his bed and goes to the
hill to answer th=
e calls of nature. At four o'clock he is engaged in the
routine of the day.=
 The first thing the Sage does every day is to chop
vegetables. Sometimes h=
e himself prepares the morning meal. There is no
conflict between jnana and=
 daily work. Bodily labour is not degrading. To
teach this truth about work=
 is the Sage's motive.

When the first bell rings at five, the Sage is seat=
ed at ease upon the sofa.
The disciples now begin to enter the hall, and as=
 the cool morning breeze,
charged with the light of dawn is lightly stirrin=
g, the Vedic recitation
begins. The students of the Ashram school raise the=
ir voices with so much
feeling and chant with such devotion that there is n=
o one who will not be
overcome by it. And for a time it is as though the Di=
vine Mother of India's
eternal spirituality dances before us. The ladies wh=
o had left the Ashram
the previous night, now return. The Maharshi goes for=
 his bath, and at
half-past seven the bell rings. Together with the guests =
and inmates the
Sage takes two rice-cakes and half a cup of coffee. After t=
his he comes to
the hall. The sadhakas engage in their sadhana before him. =
Some go about the
work of the Ashram. The Vedic students attend to the work=
 and worship of the
temple, as the devotees come and receive the silent ble=
ssings and are
satisfied.

Lunch will be over by noon, afternoon coffee by =
three. The Sage will be
present in the hall from three till supper time at =
eight P.M. He goes out
once towards the cowshed in the morning and once by =
the adjoining sadhus.
garden in the afternoon to ease himself. So few are h=
is movements. At five
in the afternoon music begins from the radio in the h=
all. The songs of
Tyagaraja, the poet, singer-bhakta, siddha, can be heard =
with enjoyment. The
Sage is a lover of the fine arts. He is an aesthete who=
 can appreciate the
sweetness of music.

In the evening of the first day I =
offered him my composition, titled Govinda
Ramayana. For a while he read it=
 to himself here and there. Reading the
prose colophon he remarked, "He too=
 is of Parashara gotra." It seemed as
though this Sage who has sprung from =
Parashara gotra was a little pleased at
this. When I mentioned that my mate=
rnal gotra was also Bharadwaja, the same
as his, a little further pleasure =
was visible. When I told him that I was
putting the entire Ramayana in vers=
e, I felt that the Sage blessed me.

Towards the evening there is the Vedic=
 recitation once again. After this the
devotees sing the praises of the Sag=
e and his verses. For a while after
supper the Sage is immersed in samadhi,=
 his devotees with him. Such is the
daily routine.

He Rules by Silence

I =
stayed for three days and only once or twice a day was his sweet voice
hear=
d. He rules all through silence only. I drew near that sea of love and
pros=
trating said, "I take leave. Bless me." The Sage nodded his head in
assent =
and blessing. He looked on me for once to my heart's content with his
graci=
ous countenance. Somehow my foot was unable to move back, arrested by
the p=
ower of that stupefying arrow. I again prostrated. I felt he told me,
"Now =
you may depart." I came out from the Sage's hall with peace in my
heart. I =
said to myself, "I am blessed." I left the Ashram pondering the
words of Bh=
avatrihari:

"When I knew a little I was blinded by pride as an elephant by=
 rut,and my
mind was covered over by the thought, 'I know everything'. But =
when through
the company of the enlightened I learned little by little, the=
n I found that
I was a fool and the fever of my pride departed."

It seemed=
 as though my heart had been graven with Bhavatrihari's lines:

"Some inner=
 cause brings things together. Attachments are by no means
grounded in exte=
rnal causes." The hairs of my body stood on end. With the
silent words, 'I =
am thy servant,' I offered the great Sage my heartfelt
adorations.
