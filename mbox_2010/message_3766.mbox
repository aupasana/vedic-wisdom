Namaste,
 
> I do share your viewpoint. But does the Lord give without asking?
 
Let us go back to the analogy I gave. Let us say a master director is making an epic movie and you have a small role in the movie. Only the director knows the entire script and you only know your scene. Instead of telling the director how your scane should be, you should just leave it to the director.
 
At the same time, it does not hurt to tell the director, "I am willing to work hard, rehearse well and do the best job I can. If possible, please give me a good role". Exactly what that "good role" should be is better left to the director.
 
Similarly, one can ask god to make one's life meaningful and worthwhile, enable one to pay off one's kaarmik debts, help increase dharma in the world and make progress towards liberation. Other specific requests may not be helpful. However, I realize that many people will find the need to make other specific requests.

I will put it slightly differently. That art is *nearly* extinct, but not fully extinct. Nevertheless, for all practical purposes, it is extinct.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

The Lord has complete knolwedge while we can only guess or assume what we want will make us happy or satisfied.Sometimes we really do not know what we want but think that we want this or that. I do share your viewpoint. But does the Lord give without asking? There was a time when I was so hardpressed for money so I had to ask. I anticipated the problem arising so tried my best to avoid the situation coming to that point. But I never asked the Lord until it reached a point when I was completely mentally cornered. It tootk me over 3 yrs of applying for jobs before I got something that improved my situation. It was truly a mental torture for me.

But I do ask for him to do whetever it takes to relieve my stress without asking for specifics which I think will relieve my stress. Probably if I were a more confident person, I might not be doing that...I would not have to ask. So I never ask until I see myself in a tight position becuase I do not know what to do in that case.

God is the Director with the full script of the movie in hand, while we are two cent actors who act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie. Why not leave it to the Director, instead of taking charge and trying to dictate how a particular scene should be handled, when we know nothing about the whole movie and how our character fits in the whole script?

For getting married and marital bliss, use parched rice. For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali tree (also known as kaalonji or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For cattle and well-being, use ghee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree (palash/modugu/ Butea monosperma). For success in agriculture, use barley grains. For overcoming enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti-cholesterol properties in ayurveda). For good health, use sesame seeds - white for mental (and spiritual) health and black for physical. For general happiness and prosperity, use various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc. For good relations and attracting others, use the flowers or seeds of daadimi (anaar/daanimma/ pomegranate) .

For example, one can use darbha (sacred grass) dipped in ghee made with cow's milk for shanti (peace-making) . These activities (other than peace-making) entail bad karma and not for normal sadhakas. These activities are justified only when a highly elevated sadhaka performs them for the greater good of the world. So I will not even mention those specific materials.

Within Kali yuga, we are entering a renewal/redefinitio n phase where knowledge will be re-established for the upcoming phase of further decay of dharma. There will be re-establishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, but with focus on setting rules and procedures that will be the guiding light for the next 1-2 thousand years when dharma will decay more. In that upcoming phase of decay, this art will become even more extinct and the ground will be (is being) set.

Essentially, what I am asking is that is there any offerings that we may offer based on what we would like to achieve through this homa such as if there is any materials more suitable for homa being performed for health reasons or if the homa is being performed for hapiness or knowledge or financial prosperity/security ? If there is none, then it doesn't matter, however if there is just to much for you to list them out, then I would request if you could point me to some resource maybe on the internet from where I may obtain this information.
