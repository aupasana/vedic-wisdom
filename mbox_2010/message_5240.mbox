Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
In the actual=C2=A0Mahabharata, before t=
he=C2=A0actual story starts there are many parts and descriptions of differ=
ent things and spiritual lineages. There is history to the place of Kuruksh=
etra it says.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is mentions=C2=A0that once there was a time w=
hen - due to the actions of Sri Parashurama - the brahmanas gained supremac=
y and they started marrying kashtriya women. This resulted, in ashuric forc=
es being born in this material plane of existence. So all the deities came =
to Narayan asking for help. Narayan consoled them saying he will come down =
to earth himself and that they - the gods and rishis=C2=A0- too must sent d=
own their own amsa along with him and chose which ashuras they must fight. =

=C2=A0
Thus during the course of the Mahabharata, at many times Krishna ma=
de Arjuna fight and destroy different cluster of ashuras and finally made s=
ure Ashuras do not take birth in human forms. Aurobindo says these days an =
Ashura can influence the minds of people, not come down directly.

<DIV>Dear Utpal,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=

<DIV>In the actual Mahabharata, before the actual story starts =
there are many parts and descriptions of different things and spiritual lin=
eages. There is history to the place of Kurukshetra it says. </DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>It is mentions that once there was a time when - =
due to the actions of Sri Parashurama - the brahmanas gained supremacy and =
they started marrying kashtriya women. This resulted, in ashuric forces bei=
ng born in this material plane of existence. So all the deities came to Nar=
ayan asking for help. Narayan consoled them saying he will come down to ear=
th himself and that they - the gods and rishis - too must sent down th=
eir own amsa along with him and chose which ashuras they must fight. </DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Thus during the course of the Mahabharata, at many =
times Krishna made Arjuna fight and destroy different cluster of ashuras an=
d finally made sure Ashuras do not take birth in human forms. Aurobindo say=
s these days an Ashura can influence the minds of people, not come down dir=
ectly.</DIV>
