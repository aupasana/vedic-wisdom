Namaste Andri,
 
As far as I know, no sandhi rules say that anuswara disappears when ya comes after it. If anything, anuswara should change into the infamous "gum"/"gam" nasal, written as {\m+} in iTrans notation (as in gaNapatiM + havaamahe = gaNapati{\m+}havaamahe). "tryambakayajaamahe" makes no sense whatsoever. Your friend may have misunderstood something that those scholars are saying.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
