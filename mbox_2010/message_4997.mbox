Dear All

According to me, Shakthi worship is the most appropriate for the =
present day.=C2=A0 Our legends say that Devi Parasakthi gives powers to the=
 trinity to perform their duties and she is absolute Power.=C2=A0 Hence Sha=
kthi worship is the most purest form of worship and this sadhana elevates o=
ne both spiritually and materially.=C2=A0 

Regarding the 'test' by the Par=
asakthi one goes through, if it is some temporary sufferings one go through=
, according to me, does not the 'test' by Sakthi as one perceive because, s=
he is the Mother of all and no Mother will 'test' their children.=C2=A0 SHE=
 Loves all and bestow all that one need irrespectively.=C2=A0 It is to be p=
erceived that the sufferings one undergoes during the Sadhana is only to cr=
oss our limitations and hurdles and with devotion and pure bhakthi and Sadh=
ana one can overcome all these.

This is only my personal opinion and is no=
t intended to hurt anybody

With love
S Subramanian
