 24th October, 1947

A few days before, on the 11th or 12th,while Bhagavan =
was seated in the
Jubilee Hall, an army of monkeys came clamouring for frui=
t. Krishnaswami,
the attendant, tried to drive them away by shouting, where=
upon Bhagavan
said, =E2=80=9CRemember, the 15th of August is an Independenc=
e day for them as well.
You must give them a feast on that day instead of d=
riving them away.=E2=80=9D

On the 14th, while some of the Asramites were b=
usy making arrangements for
the hoisting of the flag, the army of monkeys c=
ame again and again. One of
the servants tried to drive them away. Seeing t=
his, Bhagavan said with a
laugh, =E2=80=9CDo not drive
them away, please. T=
hey too have attained independence, have they not? You
must give them Benga=
l-gram, lentils and parched rice and feast them. Is it
proper to drive them=
 away?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=9CBut tomorrow is the Independence Day, Bhagavan,=E2=
=80=9D
said the servant, =E2=80=9Cnot today.=E2=80=9D Bhagavan laughed, =E2=
=80=9CSo that=E2=80=99s it, is it? But
when you are making arrangements for=
 the celebrations, should they not make
their own arrangements? That is why=
 they are busy, don=E2=80=99t you see?=E2=80=9D

You know what happens with=
 the monkeys on other occasions? One of the
attendants will be sitting with=
 a basket to receive the fruit offered to
Bhagavan by devotees. Off
and on =
the attendant sits with closed eyes being drowsy or listening to the
radio.=
 Waiting for a suitable opportunity,some of the monkeys come and
snatch awa=
y the fruit. When the people in the hall try to scare them away,

Bhagavan =
would say, =E2=80=9CWhen these attendants are immersed in deep meditation
(=
dhyana samadhi), the monkeys come and see to the work of the attendants.
So=
meone has to look after the work! The attendants put the fruit into the
bas=
ket, the monkeys put the fruit into their stomachs; that is all the
differe=
nce. While people forget themselves while listening to the music over
the r=
adio the monkeys busy themselves in enjoying the sweet juice of the
fruit. =
That is good, isn=E2=80=99t it!=E2=80=9D If the monkeys come while no atten=
dants are
there, Bhagavan says, as soon as one returns to duty, =E2=80=9CSe=
e, not one of you
was here and so the monkeys have been looking after your =
work.They are
actually helping you. So you can take some rest. When I was o=
n the hill,
they were my constant companions. You now drive them away, but =
in those
days, theirs was the empire.=E2=80=9D

Sometimes these great monke=
y-warriors knock the fruit out of the hands of
newcomers, while on their wa=
y to Bhagavan, and at times even snatch away the
fruit which people keep by=
 their side after having had it given back to them
as prasadam by Bhagavan=
=E2=80=99s attendants.

Noticing these things Bhagavan would say, =E2=80=9C=
They take their share of the
fruit, why be angry with them? There is the co=
ncentrated look, the =E2=80=98lakshya
drishti=E2=80=99.

Somehow they find =
out where the fruit is kept and in the twinkling of an
eye, all of them com=
e and take away their share. Their attention is always
on the fruit. That i=
s why, in Vedantic parlance, the monkey=E2=80=99s look is given
as an illus=
tration of the concentrated look, lakshya drishti.The moment the
Guru makes=
 a sign with his eye, the disciple should understand; otherwise
the discipl=
e cannot achieve his aim.
