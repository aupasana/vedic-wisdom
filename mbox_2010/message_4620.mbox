Narasimha ji

I have been doing homam for Lord Ganesha and have been using =
pieces of fresh sugarcane also as offering for the Lord. I happenned to rec=
ently study the magazine published by the Rochester Devi temple and they sp=
ecifically mentioned in one of the articles that a Devi Upasaka must never =
cut Sugarcane since it is held in the hands of the goddess.

I also remembe=
r something to the effect of "Ikshu Khandam " should not be offered in some=
 of the devi puja manuals.

"Lalithopasako na iskshu khandam bhakshayet"

I=
 have been only offering it out of sincere love for Lord Ganapati since fel=
t he is extremely fond of Sugarcane .Often have read your writing stating t=
hat one must not be afraid to approach god and must take up homa with the m=
ind of a child . 

Please do advice if I could continue to offer the pieces=
 or if am committing a grave mistake by offending the goddess .

Regards
Ve=
mparla Ram Kishore
