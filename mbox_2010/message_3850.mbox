Dear Vijay,

I suggest reading "Brahmacharya" pdf in file section. The manu=
al, written by Swami Sivananda, is comprehensive and throws light on the to=
pic in a big way. It probably answers many or all of your questions.

One t=
hing is for sure - Swami Vivekananda (In Rajayoga book), Sivananda (In the =
Manual mentioned above), Even unconventional Vimalanada (Aghora Part-2) agr=
ee, in no uncertain terms, that real spiritual progress requires complete a=
bsent of Sex Idea and action.

Best Regards,

Utpal
