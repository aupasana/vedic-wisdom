Namaste Satish ji,

The main point you differ from Narasimha=E2=80=99s mail=
, if I observed correctly, is
that you point out there are two relationship=
s with God: spiritual (love
relationship) and materialistic (give and take/=
mantrashastra). The
materialistic relationship solves worldly problems, whi=
le spiritual
relationship leads towards self-realization. This is one way o=
f leading
life.

To my understanding, Narasimha spreads the message to live=
 with only one
relationship which is spirituality or love/surrender to God.=
 Yes, Narasimha
certainly believes homam as the vehicle for this relationsh=
ip and teaches
the same since he has first hand great experiences through h=
omam.

In spirituality, there is no problem of counting gives and takes fro=
m
Yajamana. A saadhaka accepts whatever he gets due to his karmic baggage a=
nd
leads his life. If he still has desires, he uses the same relationship n=
ot
with a staunch give or take attitude, but with a surrender attitude.
Sur=
render is a tough path. Belief is that homam creates exactly such an
attitu=
de over time and all the material needs are taken care without paying
much =
attention to them. Once in spirituality path, one may learn shastras
based =
on his conditioning, but I don=E2=80=99t see it being discouraged here. In
=
fact, learning homam ritual is increasing awareness of shastras.

Coming to=
 priest as a mediator or technician, I believe, his message is to
find a ca=
pable technician or priest for the job. Don=E2=80=99t we want a plumber who=

fixes the plumbing problem rather than to see that the problem comes back
=
after he leaves with money? We want to hire capable plumber and also need t=
o
do some maintenance ourselves. If one thinks it is an important desire to=
 be
fulfilled, the message is to attain it through spirituality or the next=
 best
is to hire a spiritually inclined priest while still maintaining love=

relationship with God. In fact, I have seen Narasimha encourages such
capa=
ble priests. So, he has nothing against priests who perform their job.

Thi=
s mail on remedies and priests is inline with spreading spirituality.
This =
will help some people who are confused with many solutions and point
them t=
owards spirituality. To me, the message delivered is consistent with
earlie=
r messages.
Best Regards,
-Kishore

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Namaste Satish ji,</p><p class=3D"MsoNormal">The mai=
n point you differ from Narasimha=E2=80=99s mail, if I observed correctly, =
is that you point
out there are two relationships with God: spiritual (love=
 relationship) and materialistic (give and take/mantrashastra). The materia=
listic relationship solves worldly problems, while spiritual relationship l=
eads towards self-realization. This is one way of leading life.</p>


<p cl=
ass=3D"MsoNormal">To my understanding, Narasimha spreads the message to liv=
e
with only one relationship which is spirituality or love/surrender to God=
. Yes,
Narasimha certainly believes homam as the vehicle for this relations=
hip and teaches the same since he
has first hand great experiences through =
homam.=C2=A0</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In spirituality, there is no probl=
em of counting gives and
takes from Yajamana. A saadhaka accepts whatever h=
e gets due to his karmic
baggage and leads his life. If he still has desire=
s, he uses the same
relationship not with a staunch give or take attitude, =
but with a surrender
attitude. Surrender is a tough path. Belief is that ho=
mam creates exactly
such an attitude over time and all the material needs a=
re taken care without
paying much attention to them. Once in spirituality p=
ath, one may learn
shastras based on his conditioning, but I don=E2=80=99t =
see it being discouraged here.
In fact, learning homam ritual is increasing=
 awareness of shastras.</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Coming to priest as a m=
ediator or technician, I believe, his
message is to find a capable technici=
an or priest for the job. Don=E2=80=99t we want a
plumber who fixes the plu=
mbing problem rather than to see that the problem
comes back after he leave=
s with money? We want to hire capable plumber and also
need to do some main=
tenance ourselves. If one thinks it is an important desire
to be fulfilled,=
 the message is to attain it through spirituality or the next
best is to hi=
re a spiritually inclined priest while still maintaining love
relationship =
with God. In fact, I have seen Narasimha encourages such capable priests.
S=
o, he has nothing against priests who perform their job.</p>

<p class=3D"M=
soNormal">This mail on remedies and priests is inline with spreading
spirit=
uality. This will help some people who are confused with many solutions
and=
 point them towards spirituality. To me, the message delivered is consisten=
t with earlier messages.</p>Best Regards,<div>-Kishore</div><div><br><div c=

t will
generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic m=
antra is
capable of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is t=
imeframe. If
we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy to=
 have all
pleasures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends upon=
 the
individual. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing so=
 we need
that energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that =
lady will be
capable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will giv=
e child but in
next birth as specific form of punya required to beget a bab=
y will be
accumulated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole=
 life time. As
said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next=
 birth including
baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for sai=
d cause of baby
leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden ha=
mmer to fix a nail
it might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer ca=
n do this in five
minutes. This science, not logic is behind different mant=
ra, rituals sanctioned
by sages for different purposes as karma is never ge=
neric.</span></b></p>
