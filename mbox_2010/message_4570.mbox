Namaskaram Priya,
                  Detachment is to neither want or not to=
 want. It is the opposite of attachment( bandhana)- it does not mean dislik=
e or aversion. 

The Goddess Mahalakshmi- from the Sri Suktam and the Devi =
Mahatmyam is not money- She is creation itself. She is consciousness.. The =
effect that you see may be due to wrong linkage of Her in your mind. She is=
 Sri- prosperity and abundance- even renunciates do not say that they do no=
t want money or food( they may be indifferent to them- which is different f=
rom aversion). The thing is to be indifferent
to it. Using bhakti, we do no=
t withdraw our consciousness forcefully as in some other forms of yoga. We =
form an attachment to Her and that does all this and more.A person who does=
 true upasana will get detachment naturally. Use the attitude of 'do as you=
 will' and surrender as your tools.

So coming to the point- say 'I want YO=
U mother-whatever you give me is your prasada.I will accept it. But YOU are=
 most important.' She who is Tarini will help you cross the ocean of diffic=
ulties.

On the spiritual path, remember the 6 enemies( shad ripu) and 9 bo=
ndages( nava pasham), which hold back a sadhaka. Both attachment and hatred=
( among others) are enemies.

I hope this helps.

S
