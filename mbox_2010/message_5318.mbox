Namaste,

The divinizing of Physical body by Mahavatar Babaji is a scriptur=
e in itself, 
and since such a thing is not being idealized by any scriptur=
e, it only means 
that: "Scriptures other than Vedas contain partial truth"=
. 

=C2=A0
Can you name/quote/metion any exact references or statements fro=
m anywhere which 
explain how a physical immoratlity can be achieved. Mahav=
atar Babaji was the 
guru of Lahiri Mahasaya. Lahiri Mahasaya in many of hi=
s=C2=A0diaries speak of 
interactions between him and Babaji. But no where =
does Babaji state that 
physical immortality is an objective to be attained=
 or even achieveable. On the 
contrary in the section where Babaji and his =
sister (who lives in samadhi under 
the dasasamedha ghata in Kasi) meet Lah=
iri Mahasaya, Babaji states that he is 
the only one who would be remaining=
 in physical body till the end, no one else. 
Neither is this=C2=A0to be se=
t as an=C2=A0achieveable target of spiritual progress, or 
else Lahiri Maha=
saya and Babaji would have mentioned the same clearly. 


Vedic method, wor=
shipping the devatas, allows for immortality, through Soma 
devata.
=C2=A0
=
Why did not the Rishis of yore or even Krishna, attain physical immortality=
 till 
end of the cycle of creation? Because if one is immortal in the phys=
ical body, 
one must survive in it till the end of creation. Anything less =
is not exactly 
physical immortality, but only living as long as it is nece=
ssary for one to 
live. Chang Dev Maharaj lived for 1400 years, and then ga=
ve up his body. He is 
not physically immortal.

No one can attain liberati=
on in Physical body, unless one divinizes it - Kriya 
and Jnana are not a s=
ubstitute to Iccha shakti.
=C2=A0
Divinizing of the body may not necessaril=
y be physical immortality at all. It is 
merely removing impurities such th=
at a higher consciousness can pervade 
throughout.

Even=

divinizing the Physical body. Vishnu is one of the many devatas from whi=

T=

Divinizi=

self-identification, =
Ahamkara, in any limited sense bound to a Physical body of 
ones' own posse=

 unless one divinizes it - Kriya and Jnana are not a substitute to

The divinizing of Physical body by Mahavatar Babaji is a scripture in itsel=
f, and since such a thing is not being idealized by any scripture, it only =
means that: "Scriptures other than Vedas contain partial truth". </EM></DIV=

<P><EM></EM> </P>
<P>Can you name/quote/metion any exact references =
or statements from anywhere which explain how a physical immoratlity can be=
 achieved. Mahavatar Babaji was the guru of Lahiri Mahasaya. Lahiri Mahasay=
a in many of his diaries speak of interactions between him and Babaji.=
 But no where does Babaji state that physical immortality is an objective t=
o be attained or even achieveable. On the contrary in the section where Bab=
aji and his sister (who lives in samadhi under the dasasamedha ghata in Kas=
i) meet Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji states that he is the only one who would be=
 remaining in physical body till the end, no one else. Neither is this =
;to be set as an achieveable target of spiritual progress, or else Lah=
iri Mahasaya and Babaji would have mentioned the same clearly. </P>

<P><EM></EM> </P>
<P>Why did not the Rishis =
of yore or even Krishna, attain physical immortality till end of the cycle =
of creation? Because if one is immortal in the physical body, one must surv=
ive in it till the end of creation. Anything less is not exactly physical i=
mmortality, but only living as long as it is necessary for one to live. Cha=
ng Dev Maharaj lived for 1400 years, and then gave up his body. He is not p=
hysically immortal.</P>
<DIV><BR><EM>No one can attain liberation in Physic=
al body, unless one divinizes it - Kriya and Jnana are not a substitute to =
Iccha shakti.</EM></DIV>
<P><EM></EM> </P>
<P>Divinizing of the body m=
ay not necessarily be physical immortality at all. It is merely removing im=
purities such that a higher consciousness can pervade throughout. </P>

<P>Namaskar,<BR><BR>Immortal and immortalizing Will is the "a=

Saints/yogis who ascended to the immortal planes with their physical body (=
e.g. Sant Tukaram who was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha in his *phys=
ical* body to live there forever!) never talked about such a pursuit.<BR><B=
R>Even yuddhisthir went to heaven in his physical body, but that is differe=

hipping divinity in its numerous forms, is the most complete expression of =
truth for all the creatures in all the planes of existence. Such a worship =
would finally lead to divinization of Physical body.<BR><BR>> > (1) A=
s I said, Yoga Vaasishtham and other scriptures tell you to unidentify with=
 the body to realize higher realities. They do talk about higher states bey=

o actively pursued the divinization/immortalization of physical body did no=

ne in his physical body. His family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused to help=

 him. Maharshi Vishwamitra tried to help, but did not succeed!<BR><BR>OTOH=
, if one doesn't perform the yagna correctly, Indra doesn't allow the ascen=
