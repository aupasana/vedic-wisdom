 Swami Chidbhavananda joined the Ramakrishna Order at a very young age.
Lat=
er he established his own Asramam near Tiruchi which is flourishing. His
bi=
rth centenary was celebrated recently.

IT WAS in the year 1922 that a few =
of us religiously inclined college
students undertook a pilgrimage from Mad=
ras to Tiruvannamalai for a darshan
of Ramana Maharshi. The Asramam was the=
n in its initial stage. An august
person was seated on a raised platform, a=
nd it was evident he was the sage
whom we had come to see.

Around him on t=
he floor were seated a number of devotees, all intently
looking at him, and=
 we found our places among them. Silence reigned supreme.
The presiding dei=
ty of the Asramam was the author of that silence, hence its
perfection. Thi=
s was a novel experience for us, but we took to this
congenial environment =
quite happily.

There was no such thing as a formal introduction of newly a=
rrived devotees.
As others did, we sat quietly. Maharshi turned his penetra=
ting gaze at us
off and on. We felt ourselves highly blessed by his benign =
look.
Occasionally he spoke a word or two, which was always pertinent and t=
o the
point. But his silence was more eloquent. An occasional smile reveale=
d his
bliss.

Visiting devotees often brought packets of sugar-candy or som=
e such thing
and offered them to him. He would help himself to a tiny piece=
 from the
packet and pass it on to the assembled group. Then and there it w=
ould be
shared by the entire lot.

I made deeper personal contact with the =
Maharshi in the year 1928. I had
renounced the world in 1923 and joined the=
 Ramakrishna Math. In 1926 I
entered the order of sannyasa.

>From 1926 to 1=
940 I was in charge of the Ramakrishna Asramam at Ootacamund.
During that p=
eriod, when I travelled between Ootacamund and Madras, I took
as many oppor=
tunities as possible to go to Tiruvannamalai in order to see
the Maharshi. =
I was not inclined to talk much with him; being seated in his
presence was =
more than sufficient. Occasionally he spoke, but his silence
was what I sou=
ght and prized every time I went to him. A purified enquirer
made a rich ha=
rvest of the blissful calmness that prevailed in his presence.

The Maharsh=
i occupied a couch in a corner of a middle-sized hall in the
Asramam. Barri=
ng this corner the entire hall was at the disposal of the
visiting public, =
and anybody could go into the hall at any time of the day
or night. Visitin=
g devotees would quietly steal in, sit for a while in quiet
meditation and =
then leave unobtrusively. One day a man following the path of
devotion came=
 in and occupied a place very near the sage. Then he unburdened
all that la=
y buried in his heart.

His speech was choked with feeling. He poured forth=
, "I have gone on
pilgrimage all over the land. I have been regular in my s=
piritual practices.
Many a sleepless night have I passed in prayer. Still t=
o this day I have had
no mercy from the Lord. I am forlorn." He cried bitte=
rly, but Maharshi sat
unconcerned. Eventually all his suppressed feelings w=
ere worked out, and
then in a measured voice the sage said, "Strange man. H=
e cries =E2=80=93 what is
there to sob about? Instead of being poised in th=
e blissful Self, he goes on
wailing." This observation had a telling effect=
. The man saw that his
problem was self-created, and a new chapter in his l=
ife started.

On another occasion a talkative man made his appearance in th=
e hall. He
chose to sit near the sage and unceremoniously raised a question=
, "Bhagavan,
what is your view on birth control?" There was no answer, so t=
he man
explained at length the importance of the topic. Again getting no re=
ply, he
continued until he could say no more, and then fell silent. Silence=
 reigned
supreme in the hall. In the midst of this silence, Maharshi asked,=
 "Do you
know death control?" There was no response.

One day it was sugges=
ted to Maharshi that no spiritual progress could ever
be made without sadha=
na, or spiritual discipline. After a pause he made
these observations:

"Mi=
nd it is that binds man, and the same mind it is that liberates him. Mind
i=
s constituted of sankalpa and vikalpa, desire and disposition. Desire
shape=
s and governs disposition. Desire is of two kinds =E2=80=93 the noble and t=
he
base. The base desires are lust and greed. Noble desire is directed towa=
rds
enlightenment and emancipation. Base desire contaminates and clouds the=

understanding. Sadhana is easy for the aspirant who is endowed with noble
=
desires. Calmness is the criterion of spiritual progress. Plunge the
purifi=
ed mind into the Heart. Then the work is over. This is the essence of
all s=
piritual discipline!"

During one of my visits I was seated at some distanc=
e from Maharshi. There
were many devotees in the hall and the usual silence=
 prevailed. I remembered
his injunction to "Plunge the pure mind into the H=
eart," and decided to
practise it then. I gazed at him and he gazed back at=
 me. What followed was
indescribable. His body seemed a glass case from whi=
ch a blissful brilliance
streamed out. More than half an hour passed this w=
ay. It was an experience
unique and unforgettable.

It confirmed Ramakrishn=
a's statement that spiritual experience can be
transmitted from one person =
to another in the manner in which material
things are handed over.

Bharata=
 Varsha is ever the bestower of spirituality on mankind.Ramana
Maharshi is =
verily a true spiritual son of this holy land, who spontaneously
and impers=
onally showered benediction on mankind.
