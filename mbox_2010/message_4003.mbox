Namaste,
Its like you spoke my mind. I intend to visit India shortly. This =
would be my first trip after I started my spiritual journey. There are lot =
of beggars,poor,helpless people there in India. I am sure God will definite=
ly test me too.=C2=A0How is one to judge whether the people asking for help=
 are really innocent? Should a sadhaka keep giving alms to beggars when one=
 sees them? During my stay in India before I was always against of beggars =
as I believe in hard work. Our home maid in India is an extremely greedy pe=
rson. Once you give something she keeps asking for more. Morally speaking a=
ren't we making them more lazy. How to judge right or wrong?=C2=A0 

Thanks=
,
Priya

=C2=A0 
PRANAM GU=
RUJAN

Recently I got noticed about "Dimethyltryptamine " drug as well as t=
he topics of near-death-experien ce, though I personally believe the life a=
fter death through some incidents of telepathy. Some of my family members (=
gurujans) absolutely dedicated to sadhana, and hear some stories from them,=
 but I don't have any personal experience.. .

Those Gurujis, who have some=
 experience atleast, please guide for something spiritual experience, I kno=
w having this experience is not the goal, but somethimes mind seeks atleast=
 one...

I can remember two experience of mine, but not entirely sure about=
 that...

1. there is a dream like vision during meditation when performing=
 daily-ganapati- homam, but it could be the secration of "Dimethyltryptamin=
e " too...

2. normally I give money frequently to street beggars, but one =
day when I was busy at drinking from a street side food stall, a young(30 a=
round! but i am not sure, its hard to guess) woman ask for something to giv=
e, but just look and find she is young enough to earn, so I refused to give=
. After that I suddenly remember the stories of Rajarshi, P.V.R Ji during t=
heir tours with Manish, and then try to find her again, but she just vanish=
ed within merely 30 seconds...I haven't see her before or after that incide=
nt...but I am sure too with this incident...

Gurujis, please guide, help.
=

Pranam again,
Biswajit
