 Dr. Hand asked, =E2=80=9CIs there not individuality? I fear to lose my ind=
ividual
being.=E2=80=9D

Sri Maharshi, =E2=80=9CWhy fear to lose individual=
ity? What is your state in
dreamless sleep? Are you conscious of your indiv=
iduality then?=E2=80=9D

Dr. Hand, =E2=80=9CIt is possible.=E2=80=9D

Sri M=
aharshi, =E2=80=9CBut what is your experience? If the individuality be ther=
e
would it be asleep?=E2=80=9D

Dr. Hand, =E2=80=9CThat depends on the inte=
rpretation. What does Maharshi say?=E2=80=9D

Sri Maharshi, =E2=80=9CMahars=
hi does not speak for your experience. He does not
force anything down your=
 throat.=E2=80=9D

Dr. Hand, =E2=80=9CI know. That is what I like so much a=
bout the Maharshi and his
teachings.=E2=80=9D

Sri Maharshi, =E2=80=9CDo yo=
u not really take great care to get sound sleep? Do you
not prepare your be=
d carefully? And are you not anxious to lose your
individuality in deep ste=
ep? Then why fear it?=E2=80=9D

One visitor asked him, =E2=80=9CHow can one=
 root out the sex idea?=E2=80=9D

Sri Maharshi=E2=80=99s reply was, =E2=80=
=9CBy rooting out the false idea of the body being
the Self. There is no se=
x in the Self.=E2=80=9D

The visitor again asked, =E2=80=9CHow is one to re=
alise it?=E2=80=9D

Sri Maharshi said, =E2=80=9CBecause you think you are t=
he body,you see another as
the body. Difference in sex arises. But, you are=
 not the body. Be the real
Self and there is no sex.=E2=80=9D
