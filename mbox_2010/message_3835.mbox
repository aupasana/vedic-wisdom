Namaste Sri Biswajit,

Congratulations! I hope you keep up your niyama of p=
erforming Ganapathi Homam. All the best.

1. Generally dawn/morning are bes=
t times to do Ganesha Homam. It is awesome especially at dawn, when it is v=
ery quiet outside and dark and still and everyone else is sleeping, and enj=
oy the brilliance of fire in total darkness (switch off all the lights). Yo=
u just got to ensure you wake up (not easy for most) and perform your homam=
.


2. Keep it simple & practical (economical). Stick to white/black til (s=
esame seeds) and/or poha. Economize so that it becomes affordable. Maybe we=
 can, as a group, pool some funds, and help our friends to do homam.

3. Pr=
eservation of Semen is very helpful. It is made up of an ethereal substance=
 called Ojas, which is responsible for vitality, vigor, rejuvenation, stren=
gth, concentration and many other things including Aura. If you dissipate y=
our semen, this leads to loss of these qualities, including the all-importa=
nt shakti one accumulates by doing sadhana! But, I guess, the only way to c=
ontrol is to try and eventually one is bound to succeed, with her grace. Un=
fortunately, Food/Sex/Sleep is such that the more one has it, the more one =
wants it. So beware!

4. What do you mean remove the fire? I let it go down=
 naturally. 

5. As I said, we can start an initiative, whereby, people who=
 can afford it can donate these samagri's to the lesser privileged, thereby=
 earning some good karma's. But this should be restricted to samagri's and =
homa kundam or other relevant materials for homam. No money! If you want to=
 donate til seeds, buy it and donate it. 

Hope this helps.
Regards
Narayan=
