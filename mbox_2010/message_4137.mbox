Devotee: =E2=80=9CIt seems that this L.N. Sastri is a great poet. =
Nagamma is all
praise for his poems and tells me he is about the best Telug=
u poet who has
come to Bhagavan for the past five or six years.=E2=80=9D G.=
 Subba Rao said: =E2=80=9CYes, I
agree, he is a great poet.=E2=80=9D

Bhaga=
van said, =E2=80=9CHe is a pandit in the Raja=E2=80=99s College at Vizianag=
aram. Nobody
would take him for such a great poet. He looks a very ordinary=
 man. He wants
to compose extempore poems on any given subject. But all thi=
s is only
activity of the mind.

The more you exercise the mind and the mor=
e success you have in composing
verses or doing satavadanam (giving attenti=
on to many things at a time) the
less peace you have.

What use is it to ac=
quire such accomplishments if you don=E2=80=99t acquire peace?
But if you t=
ell such people this, it does not appeal to them. They can=E2=80=99t
keep q=
uiet. They must be composing songs.

As Nayana used to say: =E2=80=98In goi=
ng forward one can run any distance at any
speed, but when it is a question=
 of going backward,that is turning inwards,
even one step is hard to take.=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=9CSomehow it never occurs to me to write any book or comp=
ose poems. All the
songs I have made were made at the request of someone or=
 other in connection
with some particular event. Even the Reality in Forty =
Verses, of which so
many commentaries and translations now exist, was not p=
lanned as a book but
consists of verses composed at different times and aft=
erwards arranged as a
book by Muruganar and others. The only poems that cam=
e to me spontaneously
and compelled me,as it were, to compose them, without=
 anyone urging me to do
so,are the Eight Verses to Arunachala and the Eleve=
n Verses to Arunachala.
