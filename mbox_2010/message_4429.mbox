This composition of Shankaracharya was translated into Tamil by Sri
Bhagava=
n. Bhagavan also composed the following introductory verse and
introduction=
.

Oh thou divine Shankara,
Thou art the Subject
That has knowledge
Of subj=
ect and object.
Let the subject in me be destroyed
As subject and object.
F=
or thus in my mind arises
The light as the single Siva.

Introduction

=E2=
=80=98Brahman is only one and non-dual=E2=80=99 declare the Srutis.Since Br=
ahman is the
sole reality, according to advaita, how is it that Brahman is =
not apparent
to us, whereas the prapancha (world, i.e., non-Brahman) is so =
vivid? Thus
questions the advanced sadhaka.

In one=E2=80=99s own Self, whi=
ch is no other than Brahman, there is a mysterious
power known as avidya (i=
gnorance) which is beginningless and not separate
from the Self. Its charac=
teristics are veiling and presentation of
diversity.

Just as the pictures =
in a cinema, though not visible either in sunlight or
in darkness,become vi=
sible in a spot of light in the midst of darkness, so
in the darkness of ig=
norance there appears the reflected light of the Self,
illusory and scatter=
ed, taking the form of thought.

This is the primal thought known as the eg=
o, jiva or karta (doer), having
the mind as the medium of its perceptions.T=
he mind has a store of latent
tendencies which it projects as the object of=
 a shadow-show in the waking
and dream states.This show, however, is mistak=
en for real by the jiva. The
veiling aspect of the mind first hides the rea=
l nature of the Self and then
presents the objective world to view.

Just a=
s the waters of the ocean do not seem different from the waves, so
also for=
 the duration of objective phenomena, the Self, though itself the
sole bein=
g, is made to appear not different from them. Turn away from the
delusion c=
aused by latent tendencies and false notions of interior and
exterior. By s=
uch constant practice of sahaja samadhi, the veiling power
vanishes and the=
 non-dual Self is left over to shine forth as Brahman
itself.

This is the =
whole secret of the advaita doctrine as taught by the master to
the advance=
d sadhaka. Here the same teaching is contained, which Sri
Shankaracharya ha=
s expounded concisely without any elaboration, in the
following text.

The =
Text

All our perception pertains to the non-Self. The immutable Seer is in=
deed
the Self. All the countless scriptures proclaim only discrimination be=
tween
Self and non-Self.

The world we see, being seen by the eye, is drisy=
a (object);the eye which
sees it is drik (subject). But the eye, being perc=
eived by the mind is
drisya (object) and the mind which sees it is drik (su=
bject). The mind, with
its thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (objec=
t) and the Self is drik
(subject).The Self cannot be drisya (object), not b=
eing perceived by
anything else. The forms perceived are various, blue and =
yellow, gross and
subtle, tall and short, and so on; but the eye that sees =
them remains one
and the same. Similarly, the varying qualities of the eye,=
 such as
blindness, dullness and keenness and of the ears and other organs,=
 are
perceived by the mind singly. So, too, the various characteristics of =
the
mind, such as desire, determination, doubt, faith, want of faith,
coura=
ge,want of courage, fear, shyness, discrimination, good and bad,are all
per=
ceived by the Self singly. This Self neither rises nor sets, neither
increa=
ses nor decays. It shines of its own luminosity. It illumines
everything el=
se without the need for aid from other sources.

Buddhi, as the sum total o=
f the inner organs, in contact with the reflected
consciousness has two asp=
ects. One is called egoity and the other mind. This
contact of the buddhi w=
ith the reflected consciousness is like the identity
of a red-hot iron ball=
 with fire. Hence the gross body passes for a
conscious entity. The contact=
 establishing identity between the ego and the
reflected Consciousness, is =
of three kinds.

1. The identification of the ego with the reflected Consci=
ousness is natural
or innate.

2. The identification of the ego with the bo=
dy is due to past karma.

3. The identification of the ego with the witness=
 is due to ignorance.

The natural or innate contact continues as long as t=
he buddhi, but on
realization of the Self it proves to be false. The third =
mentioned contact
is broken when it is discovered by experience that there =
is no sort of
contact of anything at all with the Self, which is Being. The=
 second
mentioned contact,that born of past karma, ceases to exist on the
d=
estruction of innate tendencies (vasanas).

In the deep sleep state, when t=
he body is inert, the ego is fully merged (in
the causal ignorance).The ego=
 is half manifest in the dream state, and its
being fully manifest is the w=
aking state. It is the mode or modification of
thought (with its latent ten=
dencies) that creates the inner world of dreams
in the dream state and the =
outer world in the waking state. The subtle body,
which is the material cau=
se of mind and ego, experiences the three states
and also birth and death.
=

Maya of the causal body has its powers of projecting (rajas) and veiling
(=
tamas). It is the projecting power that creates everything from the subtle
=
body to the gross universe of names and forms. These are produced in the
Sa=
t-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss) like foam in the ocean. The
veili=
ng power operates in such a way that internally the distinction between
sub=
ject and object cannot be perceived,and externally that between Brahman
and=
 the phenomenal world. This indeed is the cause of samsara. The
individual =
with his reflected light of Consciousness is the subtle
body existing in cl=
ose proximity with the Self that is the vyavaharika (the
empirical Self). T=
his individual character of the empirical Self appears in
the witness or sa=
kshi also through false superimposition. But on the
extinction of the veili=
ng power (tamas), the distinction between witness and
the empirical Self be=
comes clear; and the superimposition also drops away.

Similarly, Brahman s=
hines as the phenomenal world of names and forms only
through the effect of=
 the veiling power which conceals the distinction
between them. When the ve=
iling ends,the distinction between the two is
perceived, for none of the ac=
tivities of the phenomenal world exist in
Brahman.

Of the five characteris=
tics, Being, Consciousness, Bliss,name and form, the
first three pertain to=
 Brahman and name and form to the world. The three
aspects of Being,Conscio=
usness and Bliss exist equally in the five elements
of ether, air, fire, wa=
ter and earth and in devas (gods), animals,men, etc.,
whereas the names and=
 forms are different.

Therefore, be indifferent to names and forms, concen=
trate on
Being-Consciousness-Bliss and constantly practise samadhi (identit=
y with
Brahman) within the Heart or outside.

This practice of samadhi (ide=
ntity with Brahman) is of two kinds: savikalpa
(in which the distinction be=
tween knower,knowledge and known is not lost)
and nirvikalpa (in which the =
above distinction is lost). Savikalpa samadhi
again is of two kinds: that w=
hich is associated with words (sound), and
meditation on one=E2=80=99s own =
consciousness as the witness of thought forms such
as desire, which is savi=
kalpa samadhi (internal), associated with
(cognizable) objects. Realizing o=
ne=E2=80=99s Self as =E2=80=98I am
Being-Consciousness-Bliss without dualit=
y,unattached, self-effulgent=E2=80=99, is
savikalpa samadhi (internal) asso=
ciated with words (sound).

Giving up both objects and sound forms of the a=
foresaid two modes of samadhi
and being completely absorbed in the Bliss ex=
perienced by the realization of
the Self is nirvikalpa samadhi (internal). =
In this state steady abidance is
obtained, like the unflickering flame of a=
 light kept in a place free from
wind. So also, in the Heart, becoming indi=
fferent to external objects of
name and form and perceiving only Being of (=
or as) Sat, is savikalpa samadhi
(external) associated with objects; and be=
ing aware continually of that Sat
(true existence) as the unbroken single e=
ssence of Brahman is savikalpa
samadhi (external) associated with words (so=
und).After these two
experiences, Being, which is uninterrupted like the wa=
veless ocean, is
nirvikalpa samadhi (external). One who meditates should sp=
end his time
perpetually in these six kinds of samadhi. By these, the attac=
hment to the
body is destroyed and the mind that perpetually abides in the =
Supreme Self
(paramatman) wherever it may wander, is everywhere spontaneous=
ly in samadhi.

By this constant practice of samadhi, the supreme Self, who=
 is both highest
and lowliest,who encompasses Paramatman as well as jivatma=
n is directly
experienced, and then the knot of the Heart is loosened; all =
doubts are
destroyed and all karmas (activities) cease too.

Of the three m=
odes of individual being, the limited self (as in deep sleep),
the empirica=
l self (as in the waking state) and the dreaming self, only the
individual =
limited by the deep sleep state is the true Self (paramarthika).
Even he is=
 but an idea. The Absolute alone is the true Self.

In reality and by natur=
e he is Brahman itself, only superimposition creates
the
limitations of ind=
ividuality in the Absolute. It is to the paramarthika jiva
that the identit=
y of Tat-tvam-asi (That thou art) and other great texts of
the Upanishads a=
pplies, and not to any other. The great maya (the
superimposition without b=
eginning) with her veiling and projecting power
(tamas and rajas) veils the=
 single indivisible Brahman and, in that Brahman,
creates the world and ind=
ividuals. The individual (jiva), a concept of the
empirical self in the bud=
dhi, is indeed the actor and enjoyer and the entire
phenomenal world is its=
 object of enjoyment.

>From time without beginning, till the attainment of =
liberation, individual
and world have an empirical existence. They are both=
 empirical. The
empirical individual appears to have the power of sleep in =
the shape of the
veiling and projecting powers. It is associated with Consc=
iousness. The
power covers first the individual empirical self and the cogn=
ized universe,
and then these are imagined in dream.

These dream perceptio=
ns and the individual who perceives them are illusory,
because they exist o=
nly during the period of dream experience.We affirm
their illusory nature,b=
ecause on waking up from dream no one sees the
dream,no one sees the dream =
objects. The dreaming self experiences the dream
world as real, while the e=
mpirical self experiences the empirical world as
real but, when the paramar=
thika jiva is realized, knows it to be unreal.

The paramarthika jiva, as d=
istinguished from those of the waking and dream
experiences,is identical wi=
th Brahman. He has no =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99. If he does see any
=E2=80=98=
other=E2=80=99, he knows it to be illusory.

The sweetness, liquidity, and =
coldness of water are characteristics present
equally in waves and foam. So=
, too,the Being-Consciousness-Bliss character
of the Self (the paramarthika=
) is present in the empirical self and through
him in the dream self also, =
because of their being only illusory creations
in the Self. The foam with i=
ts qualities, such as coldness, subsides in the
waves, the waves with their=
 characteristics, such as liquidity, subside in
the water, and the ocean al=
one exists as at first. Similarly, the dream self
and its objects are absor=
bed in the empirical self; then the empirical world
with its characteristic=
s is absorbed in the paramarthika and, as at first,
Being-Consciousness-Bli=
ss which is Brahman shines alone.

sweetness, liquidity, and coldness of water are characteristics present equ=

the Self (the=C2=A0paramarthika) is present in the empirical self and throu=

ns in the Self. The foam with its qualities, such as coldness, subsides in =
the waves, the waves with their characteristics, such as liquidity, subside=
 in the water, and the ocean alone exists as at first. Similarly, the dream=
 self and its objects are absorbed in the empirical self; then the empirica=
l world with its characteristics is absorbed in the paramarthika and, as at=
 first, Being-Consciousness-Bliss which is Brahman shines alone.<br>
