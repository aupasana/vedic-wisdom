Namaste Atul Ji and List members,

arily mean other person is not right.

My views are there on this subject i=
n archives. I wanted to stay away but still inspired to write at least one =
message on the same.

1) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so many of r=
esearches and plenty of informations available on the Internet, One will ne=
ver be able to come to a definitive conclusions.

2) I never argue with peo=
ple (even when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea of vegetarian=
 food) with the above basis.
Whatever said and done, people will continue e=
ating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as well. I h=
ave, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing with peo=
ple giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, own sets =
of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.

3) Instead I appeal th=
eir conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topic comes up, only o=
ne simple thing - "I dont want to kill for filling up my Stomach" and I say=
 it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on your own Throat o=
r Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now realize the Plight of a=
 butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., Suffocate your=
self by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few seconds, how you pent=
 for the Air and Now realize the "Chhatpataahat" of a fish forced out of wa=
ter.

And all these, because one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravin=
gs of a habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of sp=
ice and other food stuff but the very vital difference is that such craving=
 does not need killing!

4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who i=
s a Srilankan, has left eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of t=
he reasons for his leaving meat is because I told my views him a few times =
when such discussions came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, =
the religion of Non-Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hat=
s-off to him for he really seems to have thought about it and dared to chan=
ge his swabhava which is so very difficult.
Just to clarify, I do not hesit=
ate to express my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea =
is appreciated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are al=
so taken a back with this idea. All though they know from their hearts of h=
earts, it comes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up=
. Most of us are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea=
 would have gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will=
 germinate.

5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and=
 that side is bad. It'll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to =
just appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the ration=
al Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and=
 if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder o=
f "Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma" at least to those of us who b=
elieve in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.

Best R=
egards,

Utpal

 One should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attit=
ude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor=
 or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training.=
 and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food =
unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree w=

strology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.

% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied b=

(including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nu=

of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per =
person, along with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quanti=
ties. Different sources may quote different quantities). There is average f=

Sir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, =
even for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you ca=
n not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not=
 produce it yourself)

 Bioavailability or BV of different sources
> 
> It is always a questionabl=
e point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight t=
he results which support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of  halfbak=
ed researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for differe=
nt sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal sources=
 are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources =
are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this)=
 So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. =
Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is conc=
erned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.
>

eg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian food=

 agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, les=
