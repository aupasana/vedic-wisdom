 ONCE when Sri Bhagavan was very debilitated, the doctors recommended that
=
he take some nourishing food. But he would not listen to them or the
devote=
es who appealed to him to follow the advice. Some of them were
earnestly be=
gging him to eat thickly-buttered bread, others were trying to
make him dri=
nk milk and orange juice. But to all of them he had only one
answer to give=
. With his usual genial smile he would say, "But how can we
afford to have =
such a luxurious diet? For us there can only be the poor
man's rations."

"=
But what is the harm in changing one's diet for the sake of one's health?"
=
ventured one devotee in a plaintive tone. "Even Mahatma Gandhi takes a
spec=
ial diet and Sri Aurobindo too does the same, to keep up their health.
Plea=
se, therefore, take a tumblerful of orange juice, at least for our
sake."

=
"But do you know the cost of a tumbler of orange juice?" asked Sri Bhagavan=
.

"Oh, only four annas," rejoined the devotee, with hope gleaming in his e=
yes.

"No, It won't be four annas. We will require about 200 tumblers of ju=
ice. Do
you want me alone to gulp down the drink with all of you watching,
=
empty-handed ? Moreover, how can poor people like us provide for 200
tumble=
rs of juice, costing fifty rupees daily?"

This answer checked the devotee'=
s pleas for a while, but he would not give
up so easily. He still had a lin=
gering hope that if once Sri Bhagavan
started to take the nourishing diet, =
he would continue to do so for at least
enough days for his health to impro=
ve a little. So, the next day, he quietly
prepared hot rotis well smeared w=
ith ghee, and filled two tumblers, one with
milk and the other with orange =
juice. Then, with the assistance of a few
other devotees, he took all these=
 things to Sri Bhagavan on a tray.

"What's all this?" he inquired as he sa=
w them walking towards him. The
devotees placed the tray before him, uncove=
red it and begged him to accept
the offering. He refused point-blank even t=
o touch the food, asking instead
that the devotees should consume it. Repea=
ted appeals to him from other
devotees were also of no avail.

Then, in the=
 heat of the moment, a woman devotee who was present at the time
burst out,=
 "O Bhagavan! Just as you are kind enough to agree to sit on your
sofa - in=
stead of on the floor like everyone else - for our sake, why not
also favor=
 us by taking this special diet?" Though the woman spoke these
words in goo=
d faith, the outcome was quite the reverse of what was expected.

Hardly ha=
d she finished when, to her and the other devotees' dismay, Sri
Bhagavan go=
t down from his sofa and squatted on the floor. The woman was
horrified by =
the consequences of her suggestion. She called out with anguish
in her hear=
t and tears in her eyes, "Bhagavan! No! Please don't! What a
stupid woman I=
 am!" Then she got hysterical and started screaming.

All the others stood =
around, aghast at what had happened. The remedy had
turned out to be worse =
than the disease. The rotis, the milk, the juice were
abandoned as everybod=
y racked their brains to find a way out of this impasse
and reseat Sri Bhag=
avan on the sofa.

It was certain that no appeal or argument would move Sri=
 Bhagavan to change
his decision. Eventually a devotee who had been associa=
ted with Sri Bhagavan
for over thirty-five years resolved to take a despera=
te step. Without any
fuss, he simply started lifting Sri Bhagavan bodily. S=
eeing this, one or two
other devotees joined him and together they succeede=
d in placing Sri
Bhagavan's body back on the sofa. Sri Bhagavan did not res=
ist, nor
subsequently did he try to come down from the sofa. But the devote=
es had
been so upset by the incident that even after seeing Sri Bhagavan si=
tting
quietly on the sofa again, they began to beseech him not to get down =
again.

Sri Bhagavan accepted the new situation graciously. Thus, a loving =
attempt
by devotees to make Sri Bhagavan agree to take a special diet came =
to a
fruitless end.

Though he would usually get annoyed if devotees tried =
to give him special
treatment, or if he saw people needlessly inflicting su=
ffering on others, Sri
Bhagavan could never be provoked to anger by anyamou=
nt of criticism or
personal abuse. Two separate incidents illustrate this v=
ery well.

Once when Sri Bhagavan was sitting in his cave on Arunachala, a =
sadhu who
was jealous of his increasing fame urinated on his back as a deli=
berate act
of provocation. Sri Bhagavan remained as unperturbed and Self-ab=
sorbed as
ever. Not a tinge of anger rose in him. The sadhu was baffled by =
his calm
response. Realizing that nothing could irritate Sri Bhagavan, the =
poor sadhu
quietly went away.

On another occasion, many years later, a you=
ng man visited Sri Ramanasramam
with an evil purpose. After entering the ha=
ll and taking his seat in the
front row, he began to put all kinds of aggre=
ssive questions to Sri
Bhagavan. We found out later that he wanted to extor=
t hush-money from the
ashram by trying to expose Sri Bhagavan as a hypocrit=
e and a fraud. He had
already successfully tried his trick elsewhere, and b=
y repeated practice he
had cultivated this art into a paying profession. Ha=
ving gained successes in
other ashrams, he had come to Sri Ramanasramam to =
try his tricks there.

Sri Bhagavan's own method of meeting insolence, mali=
ce, jealousy and
misbehavior in general was the observance of complete sile=
nce. This powerful
weapon baffled and disarmed all aggressive and insolent =
visitors.

When the youth tried to draw Sri Bhagavan into a controversial d=
iscussion so
he could catch him when he made a potentially embarrassing ans=
wer, Sri
Bhagavan remained completely silent. The poor man could make no he=
adway at
all. He tried insults, he tried belching out foul language, but Sr=
i Bhagavan
did not utter a single word. He did not accept any of the insult=
s or respond
to them in any way. He merely remained calm, unperturbed and s=
miling. The
young man, after exhausting all his insults, saw the impossibil=
ity of
achieving his object. He had to admit defeat and quit the ashram.
