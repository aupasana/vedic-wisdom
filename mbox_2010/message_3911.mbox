Namaste,

The discussion below prompted me to send this mail.I am new to th=
is group and haven't done homam yet. The reason being I will be honest in t=
his God's place. Unlike you all who are determined to give yourselves to th=
e Lord I am not ready for extreme level of spirituality.I like praying god =
but don't want to commit saying that I don't want any riches,any happiness =
etc. 

I don't want to go for something in an extreme level and later face =
the wrath of God. So my question is I believe purnahuti is the part where o=
ne surrenders completely and gives this commitment. I want to call god in f=
ire pray, meditate keep it simple. As fire is the most auspicious form I am=
 tempted to pray God in that medium. So can I skip the purnahuti section. D=
o I need to make any changes in sankalpam? 

Thanks and regards,
Pratima
