Narasimhaji,

Pranaam

I realize that you are very busy with all the thing=
s that you do for
spiritual and astrological aspirants, among your other re=
sponsibilities,
however if you ever get time an instructional manual on Rud=
rabhiskhekam
and a long version of the Mahaganapati Homam would be very hel=
pful and
appreciated.  I pray that the mother gives you the inspiration to
=
perform this task one day.

Thank you for all the guidance that you have gi=
ven and continue to give
on a regular basis.

Regards

Veenu
