Dear Narasimha ji and other Sanskrit scholars on this list.

Recently I hav=
e been debating with a friend over the pronunciation of the Maha Mritunjaya=
 mantra, especially the first line "tryambakam yajamahe". 

My friend is st=
ationed in India and associates with Sanskrit scholars that tell him that t=
he pronunciation of these first words of the mantra is: "Tryambakayajamahe"=
 This version skips the Anusvara "M" and the logic given is that a Sandhi r=
ule is applied when the ending of one word is "am" and beginning of another=
 is "ya"!

As far as I know this is still not the way it is written in the =
Rk Veda (Mandala 7, Sukta 59, Rica 12). Would the mantra be written in the =
Veda without the intended Sandhi applied?

Narasimha, on your website your =
rendering is in agreement with what I thought was the true mantra. Are the =
Sandhi rules to be applied between all words in Sanskrit or are there excep=
tions?

I sincerely hope this is not too off topic.

Many thanks,

Andri Li=
