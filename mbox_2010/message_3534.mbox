Namaste Narasimha,

Thanks for the explanation. You replied explicitly abou=
t the query of Counts Vs Time. While your analogy given in the message is t=
he indirect reply to my second query of Place, Same time and such helpful s=
econdary details in concentrating the Mad-drunk-stung monkey called mind.
J=
ust wanted to make sure before experimenting with 'Time duration' because i=
f a person of the level of Manish has mentioned explicitly *Counts* then it=
 is better to get clarified before trying with *Duration*. Your reply reall=
y helped in the dilemma and confirmed my own view point.

Thanks,

Utpal

In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. o=

t.

gnificance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practise with Brahmachary=
a) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 =
times) for a period of two months and then I did a homam to complete the da=
samsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called about 10 people (Grih=
astas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the mantra while I pe=
rformed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a D=
asamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally das=
amsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so basically, for a l=
aksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharan=
