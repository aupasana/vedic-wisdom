Dear Vishal,

please don't afraid about the details procedure seen in the v=
ideo, its hard to follow all the details with perfection in first attempt, =
go through the manual where you can find the shortest/simplest version of t=
he Ganapati Homam "Super-Short Homam Procedure"...start with that simplest =
version and eventually incorporate part-by-part from the main homam procedu=
re, writeup of mantras in your own language sometimes makes things simpler.=
..

best of luck
Biswaji
