 1) Those who have one-pointed devotion towards God,like the magnetic needl=
e
[of a ship=E2=80=99s compass] which always stands facing towards the nort=
h, will
never be perplexed and go astray in the ocean of attachment of this=
 world.

2) If one fixes one=E2=80=99s mind firmly on that pure Supreme Rea=
lity which
pervades all activities, one will not be affected by any number =
of
activities that are done.

Sadhu Om: Just as the cinema screen, which is=
 the base pervading all the
pictures, is not burnt by a picture of fire or =
drenched by a picture of a
flood, so Self, the Supreme Reality which is the=
 base pervading all
activities, is not affected by any number of activities=
.Therefore, since the
one who attends to Self remains as Self itself,he is =
not affected by any
number of activities he may appear to be doing.

3) Amo=
ng all the rice grains, only those which move here and there will be
crushe=
d by the hand-mill, while those which do not move away from the foot
of the=
 axle will not be crushed.

Michael James: Likewise, among all the people i=
n the world, only those who
stray into worldly desires, leaving the thought=
 of the Feet of God, will be
ruined by maya, while those who do not leave H=
is Feet will not be so ruined.
