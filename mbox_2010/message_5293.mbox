GOOD QUESTION....
Purush is presenting something beyond limit of time ever =
steady and "NIRVIKAR". When purush started to create universe(matter,energy=
,antimatter or what ever the physical stuff exists...) Mahattatva was creat=
ed this mahattatva holds the three type of Chittas based on their actions. =
However, this mahattatva is Maha purush who holds the billion universe in e=
ach of his "Randra". This mahapurush is combination of Purush and prakruti.=
 since prakruti is ever changing with time and ever stay stable it is calle=
d dynamic and purush who never changes but always steasy like water in ice,=
 he is called dynamic. Everything we see,feel,do is done is time dimension.=
 if one of this is absence we will neither be able to exists nor be able to=
 feel anything. Hence it is combination of this two causes world to exists.=
 As Bhagavat says, before Mahattatva, "Ahamkar" was also created or Mahatta=
tva is "Ahamkar". Let me just explain something about "ahamkar". Ahamkar is=
 something within which creates reaction. like our reflex, is produce due t=
o ahamkar, something sting on hand your other hand goes to scretch or squze=
 is due to ahamkar, our vision is due to ahamkar. any ab-normality or any p=
roperty of an object is due to ahamkar. stone ahamkar is keeping stone in s=
hape. Anyway, it is purush and prakruti which makes universe but it by any =
means does not respresent gender.
