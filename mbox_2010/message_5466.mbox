Dear All,


I have tried to make spiritual progress =
for long, and made little progress (but not significant). Ever since my chi=
ldhood, primarily because of my upbringing, I have been trying and observin=
g a lot of "Good" things. I have been reading texts on spirituality and was=
 a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda's writings. I always found Kabir's fo=
llowing lines, as a best (and most compact) commentary on the two prominent=
 paths of spirituality: -


"Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari"
"H=
ai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vicharee"


i.e.
"If I say One, it is not,=
 If I say two, it is contemplation"
"Let it be what it is, says Kabir after=
 contemplation"


Until last year, my faith was getting stronger and strong=
er in my beliefs. Last year made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of =
personal time to think. I have come up with several doubts (just a few give=
n below) about spirituality and God and Goodness, and I have started to fee=
l getting drifted towards atheism (susprisingly am writing all this on Vaik=
untha Ekadashi, when am observing a fast). If someone can help me understan=
d the problesm with my doubts, it would be great help:-=C2=A0


- Isn't "Is=
hwar Paridhaan" i.e. "Ishwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti" same as stockholm=
 syndrome?=C2=A0
- Most people with good conduct I see these days are suffe=
ring and those who happily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prospero=
us life. Where is the supreme power's role in this. I know materialism is a=
 different issue, but last year made me realize that materialistic troubles=
 made me very weak spiritually too. So, I dont see them to be connected som=
ehow.
- I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low, and=
 so called Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes its own time. But doe=
sn't that promotes the bad karma in itself, specially in this yuga? And how=
 long can one wait?
- Suicide is considered a greatest sin, as it is throwi=
ng away the best gift we get from the lord. But, I am not sure that if peop=
le do it for fun. God presents a person with tough situations in the name o=
f testing times, and some day the limit is reached. Then isn't god accompli=
ce in this so called crime.
- In first place, why does he need to test us?
=


As I said that all these question make me feel that I am losing the faith=
 in His goodness. All my spiritual progress if any has been corrupted by th=
ese testing times. And no help came to me(I could not figure out). And thos=
e who did offer, faced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering =
now. This is what makes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this tha=
t I have passed my agony to someone.


Despite all these thoughts that have=
 pre-occupied my mind for quite some time, I feel that I still survive a ch=
ance to get back to my faith in real terms and not driven by materialistic =
desire. This is the reason I am writing this mail. May be someone can make =
me see what I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting totally crazy, in=
sane and moving towards atheism and quit possibly committing the so called =
"Sin".


Regards,
Sri
