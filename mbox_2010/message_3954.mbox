Namaste S

Very good post, you are very correct and I agree that if the sad=
haka cultivates and becomes an uttama quality, 
he or she will immediately =
see
an uttama guru in his life directly guiding him or her in physical body=
 or in sooksma sharir i.e. astrally.

There is mention of fake guru in kakb=
husundi ramayana, when lord rama
was ready to go back, it appears he librat=
ed all around him or and finally he sends his servants to check if anyone i=
s left out.
To their surprise the find a dog, whose half body was decayed a=
nd other half there were many creatures sucking blood and eating flesh.

Th=
ey come back to Rama and share the facts, and Rama indicates he as a guru i=
n his past life and instead of truely guiding his disciples he took their m=
oney and enjoyed life. So this lifetime he has to pay back. 

The gist is f=
ake gurus were present even in Lord Ramas time too.
Please pardon if there =
are some inaccuracies in the description of the story, for accuracy I recom=
mend others to read the chapter in ramayana.

We donot hear more as no one =
wrote about it. We do see a lot now a days as we now live in internet age, =
both good and bad news travel fast.

On a different perspective, there is a=
lso need for guidance and help for those masses who are not uttama sishyas,=
 and so since the time we live in and the time to come are different from t=
he last 1000 years or the last 9000 years, I hope that god or guru shakti w=
ill manifest in a different way that is more effective to the time and the =
type and state of sadhakas that is going to come.

It is the law of nature =
where we see birth and then growth and then like a lamp towards the end the=
 lamp shines very brightly and then the light in the lamp goes out. In a si=
milar way in the past we have seen birth, growth, and then disappearance of=
  many sects and spiritaul practices, we will see new ones coming out to su=
it more to the time.

Best Regards
Mitesh

    I have to 'disagree' with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru ap=

We indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting peo=
ple just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramaha=
nsa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in co=
ming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great maste=

he hands of people.
