Shiva is the platform on which Shakti creates and together the eternal reso=
nance Spanda emerges.

      Namaste,

 

Let me try t=
o put it in simple words. I hope members know basic physics to understand t=
his analogy.

 

Purusha (also known as Narayana or SadaShiva) is essential=
ly the *potential* energy of this entire universe, while Prakriti (also kno=
wn as Narayani or AadiShakti) is essentially the *kinetic* energy of this e=
ntire universe.

 

That way, Purusha and Prakriti are not essentially diff=
erent and are interchangable, but they do play different roles.

 

Best re=
gards,

Narasimha
