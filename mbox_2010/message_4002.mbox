PRANAM GURUJAN

Recently I got noticed about "Dimethyltryptamine" drug as w=
ell as the topics of near-death-experience, though I personally believe the=
 life after death through some incidents of telepathy. Some of my family me=
mbers (gurujans) absolutely dedicated to sadhana, and hear some stories fro=
m them, but I don't have any personal experience...

Those Gurujis, who hav=
e some experience atleast, please guide for something spiritual experience,=
 I know having this experience is not the goal, but somethimes mind seeks a=
tleast one...

I can remember two experience of mine, but not entirely sure=
 about that...

1. there is a dream like vision during meditation when perf=
orming daily-ganapati-homam, but it could be the secration of "Dimethyltryp=
tamine" too...

2. normally I give money frequently to street beggars, but =
one day when I was busy at drinking from a street side food stall, a young(=
30 around! but i am not sure, its hard to guess) woman ask for something to=
 give, but just look and find she is young enough to earn, so I refused to =
give. After that I suddenly remember the stories of Rajarshi, P.V.R Ji duri=
ng their tours with Manish, and then try to find her again, but she just va=
nished within merely 30 seconds...I haven't see her before or after that in=
cident...but I am sure too with this incident...

Gurujis, please guide, he=
lp.

Pranam again,
Biswajit
