Dear Rajarshi,

    Sri Aurobindo's yoga is Integral, which means it _also_=
 includes material existence which is nothing but condensed consciousness. =
It is a different path from most others which call the world as maya and bo=
dy consciousness as something to be forgotten or gotten rid of. 

    Our p=
hysical body as such is not plastic enough. The nature of Universe or the e=
xpression of consciousness (Divine Mother) is constant change / progress. S=
o the body has to die and soul housed in a new form as time progresses. All=
 Rishis / Naths do not live for ever in the same material body as ours. Eit=
her their body is transformed or they will have to lose their body after so=
me time. By power of yoga one can prolong existing body into several centur=
ies or even few thousand years, but that body will still be mortal. The nec=
essary condition for that is the matter that forms the body regaining its c=
onsciousness and becomes totally fluid  - a body of light can be immortal a=
s it can modify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousness. So the=
re will not be a necessity to break that form and create another new form. =
It can simply transform. That is the essense (atleast in my understanding) =
of what Sri Aurobindo refers to as physical immortality. He and the Mother =
have explained it more clearly in some other places but I am not able to fi=
nd it now. 

As per Sri Aurobindo, there has been few being who might have =
attained Supramental descent and even partial transformation personally but=
 not the full supramental transformation. Besides, as per him, unless the t=
ransformation is collective, individual transformation is not perfect. 

Su=
pramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja Samadhi. In Sahaja Samadh=
i, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but body still is unc=
onscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they remain mostly de=
tached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Maharishi). A person in Saha=
ja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her body will also b=
e transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi and vibration of t=
he enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri Aurobindo calls =
as Supramental transformation. 

However, in Supramental transformation, th=
e matter of the body _also_ is transformed to express the Sat-Chit-Ananda c=
onsciousness. There are lots of other things too other than body transforma=
tion. 

If you have time and are interested, I would suggest you read "Sri =
Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness" by Satprem. It is a not a larg=
e book but may take a loong time to read and assimilate. It very lucidly an=
d clearly delineates different stages of consciousness from a very practica=
l standpoint, starting with body consciousness to vital, mental, intellectu=
al and higher regions of consciousness. It is a unique biography which deal=
s not with mundane life details of the subject, but his journey through con=
sciousness and while doing that explains various finer stages and aspects o=
f consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biographies of other Masters ar=
e written in that way, it would be amazing. 

What ever I said on this topi=
c is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the topic at all. I really mea=
n it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the post. This topic needs a ve=
ry subtle and sublime treatment  stemming at least in part from correspondi=
ng inner experiences & realizations which I am not capable of at present. T=
he best I can do is point to those that have done it. Once "Sri Aurobindo o=
r adventure of Consciousness" is read, then all of Sri Aurobindo's works an=
d what he says about Supramental descent and transformation can be comprehe=
nded more easily.  Alternately one can start with the works of M.P. Pandit =
as well. Shri. Pandit's writings are very lucid, profound and illuminating.=


BTW, I read with interest your thread "Rama Nam Satha Hai". Thanks for sh=
aring.

Warm regards,
    Shiva.
