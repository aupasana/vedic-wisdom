 In 1912 Ramana had a kind of second death experience. One morning, around
=
10 a.m. he was on his way back from the temple tank at the Pachaiamman
Shri=
ne together with his companions Palaniswami, Vasudeva Sastri and others.
Th=
ere they had taken an oil bath. The sun was by now burning hot and the
asce=
nt to Virupaksha Cave was causing additional strain. When they came near
th=
e Tortoise Rock, which is a huge boulder on the path, Ramana was suddenly
o=
vercome by a bodily weakness. He supported himself against the rock. His
sk=
in turned dark and his companions thought he was going to die.

Vasudeva Sa=
stri reports, =E2=80=9CWhile all else stood at a distance weeping,I
suddenl=
y embraced him. I was a bachelor at the time and had the liberty to
do so. =
No one else used to touch Swami=E2=80=99s body. He was in that state for
ab=
out ten minutes, I think, and then gained consciousness. I jumped about
wit=
h joy. =E2=80=98Why this weeping? You thought I was dead? If I am to die, w=
ill I
not tell you beforehand?=E2=80=99 Bhagavan said, consoling us.=E2=80=
=9D

Ramana described his experience as follows, =E2=80=9CSuddenly the view=
 of nature in
front of me disappeared and got covered up like a sheet of wh=
ite cloth. =E2=80=A6
All around me was the view of the white cloth. My head=
 was reeling. The
circulation of blood and the beating of the heart stopped=
, and my body began
to get dark in colour, same as what happens to a dead b=
ody, and as that
slowly increased, Vasu thought that I was really dead and =
began to weep, and
embraced me. The change in my body=E2=80=99s colour, Vas=
u=E2=80=99s embrace, the shivering
of his body, and the talks of the others=
 around me =E2=80=93 I was conscious of all
these. I was also conscious of =
my hands and feet getting chill, and the
stopping of the beats of my heart,=
 but I had no fear in me. The flow of my
thoughts and the consciousness of =
my self were not lost and I was not
worried about my body=E2=80=99s conditi=
on.I sat cross-legged in the padmasanam pose
[lotus seat]. I was not leanin=
g on the rock behind. The circulation of blood
stopped but the sitting post=
ure remained intact. All that lasted for about
fifteen minutes. Suddenly en=
ergy permeated throughout my body.The
circulation of blood and the beating =
of the heart commenced.The black colour
of my body disappeared. I began to =
perspire profusely from all pores in my
body. I opened my eyes, got up and =
said: =E2=80=98Come on. Let us go.=E2=80=99 We then
reached the Virupaksha =
Cave without any further incidents.=E2=80=9D

It is possible that this even=
t allowed Ramana=E2=80=99s final transition to a normal
outer life. One thi=
ng is certain, around this time his life started to
follow a normal path ag=
ain. This development had been gradual and had
started to set in in the yea=
rs leading up to this event. He had started to
react to visitors and had sl=
owly started speaking again, although still very
little. He ate and drank r=
egularly and took care of his body. He performed
all kinds of domestic work=
. He also carved many walking sticks, which he
then gave away, and likewise=
 spoons and cups which he carved out of coconut
shells and then polished so=
 long that they started to shine. He developed a
good deal of practical abi=
lity in daily life, became an extraordinarily good
and painstaking cook, a =
talented architect and in all that he did was
extremely economical and tidy=
. Increasingly his life followed a precise
timetable, in which everything h=
ad its fixed place.
