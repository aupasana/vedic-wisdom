Namaste Ashutosh and Rajarshi,
 
There are several technicalities like this, which apply when one does a ritual to ensure a specific material result. Some of them are meaningful to an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millennia by intellectuals.
 
However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.
 
There are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam everyday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these technicalities.
 
*        *        *
 
If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on earth. You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow of signals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all times. Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainly capable of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and making them reach various deities.
 
*        *        *
 
If you want to get your father (or mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course, even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agendas and only want to tell your father "I love you" and take whatever he gives, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favored by parents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to give.
 
Similarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are several technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many corruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting specific material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best approach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your love and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. Such a person will be favored by deities over the long run.

Namaste Ramakishore,
 
Different points of space and different points of time have a different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as sadhana on Pournima.
 
If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Krishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned with the energy of that deity.
 
However, one can only make so much progress with occasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, more intense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/deity, one can do it every day and at all times.
 
*        *        *
 
A lot of beggars may be standing at the gate of a king's palace, waiting for the king to see them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king may be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many beggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the other hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king's eyes may fall on you someday!
 
Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity's grace. That is a sureshot formula for success.
 
*        *        *
 
The issue of auspicious days and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more auspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For example, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to go there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you may still get out cheaply.
 
Instead of helping, sadhana done on a particularly good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I remember one incident.
 
A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Manish and he said, "excellent, go ahead". I meditated with Gayatri mantra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.
 
Next morning, I realized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to be an auspicious day.
 
I mentioned it to Manish. He said, "I knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me". I asked him why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, "knowing you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have instead distracted you."
 
He was right. As such, I was a little "proud" of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement and expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of useless excitement would've been higher and distracted me even more!
 
Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy. My 2 cents..
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

If the relationship with the deity is truly personal why should one even consider the nava grahas in the ritual worship. I increasingly find that astrology is only serving to discourage the masses rather than pointing them in the direction of worship of divinity.
