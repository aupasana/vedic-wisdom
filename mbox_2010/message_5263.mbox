Namaste Sir,
 
Let me add my 2 cents of perspective on your nice observatio=
ns.
 
> The examples I give above does not illustrate a picture of people w=
ho were
> compassionate and always willing to forgive and forget.
 
Forgivi=
ng and forgetting is not necessarily saattwik, when it is the work of a den=
se ego. For example, one may do it to look good or impress others. Similarl=
y, hurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a resul=
t of a light ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest =
with his foot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.
 
Copying the action=
s of divine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow an idiom from my m=
other tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paints stripes on its bod=
y.
 
People you are talking about are very high level beings. Those who eff=
ace their ego and start to self-identify with some higher deities will star=
t to exhibit the nature of those deities. Their actions may be fierce at ti=
mes, but their purpose will be divine.
 
Whether one wants liberation or on=
e wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga (oneness) of a deity or whatever on=
e wants, the first step is to efface ego. All sadhanas are meant for that o=
nly. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or someone else achieved, the =
starting point is to efface your ego through sadhana. As you make progress,=
 at some stage, you may start seeing some results.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is thin=
king of it. A cricketer telling himself "I must score a century today" is u=
nlikely to score a century. The best strategy is to take it a ball at a tim=
e and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thinking about =
results and just focusing on the "here and now".
 
Moreover, liberation is =
not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he would come back a =
century later and that people would be liberated en masse in that birth. Ev=
en in these times, it is possible to be liberated.

Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish con=
siders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I a=
m privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=
h Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish's mesage is to do sadhana and=
 efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.
