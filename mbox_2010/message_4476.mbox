 LAKSHMI Ammal, usually referred to as Echammmal,belonged to Mandakolutur
a=
bout twenty miles away from Arunachala. At one time she lived at Karedu
vil=
lage in Nellore district where her husband was posted. Her first born, a
bo=
y, passed away. Later she had a boy and a girl.

Calamities befell her almo=
st all at one stroke. Her son, daughter and
husband passed away one after t=
he other in quick succession. She bore them
stoically and went back to her =
place with her last daughter. When the girl
was about ten Echammal fixed up=
 her marriage. A few days before the wedding
the girl developed high fever.=


A few days after the girl passed away.

Accompanied by a friend she visit=
ed the ramana mahashi who was then staying
at Virupaksha cave. She noticed =
that the form which had appeared in her
dreams three times earlier was of t=
his very Sadguru. She sat in silence for
an hour. The Swami was as usual si=
lent. She was not inclined to return, it
was as if her feet got planted
the=
re. Yet she had to return. On reaching home she told her friend that the
op=
pressive weight in her heart torturing her in the recent past had gone.

Fr=
om that day she regularly visited the ashram, like an iron filing
attracted=
 to a magnet. She also began serving food to the Swami. She used
the money =
sent by her father,and later by her brother, for the service of
the Swami a=
nd his disciples. She would prepare food for them and serve it
wherever the=
y went. For a number of Ramana devotees her house became a
lodging place.

=
With the permission of the Swami she adopted her niece, Chellammal, and
per=
formed her marriage. She named her grandson after Ramana. One day, she
rece=
ived a telegram from her son-in-law saying that Chellammal had passed
away-=
 which came as a bolt from the blue.

The Swami showed her his grace in sev=
eral ways. Here are a couple of such
instances.

One day while Echammal was=
 climbing the hill carrying food for the Swami
there was a heavy downpour.S=
he took shelter at a particular place and looked
at the Swami who was not f=
ar away. She observed that the area surrounding
him was absolutely dry wher=
eas at a little distance from him it was raining
heavily!

On another occas=
ion, a Pandit from the North visited the Swami at Virupaksha
cave and was d=
iscussing some subtle points with the Swami. When Echammal
reached the cave=
 as usual she was astonished at what she saw. She began
trembling when the =
Swami asked her the reason.She narrated her experience
thus: On reaching th=
e Sadguru Swami cave on her way, she felt that there
were two persons - one=
 of whom was the Swami and the other the visitor close
by. Without halting =
she moved along. As she was doing so a voice said =E2=80=9CWhy
climb when h=
e is here?=E2=80=9D When she turned back she could see nobody at the
spot o=
r nearabouts. She trembled with fear at this experience and somehow
reached=
 Virupaksha cave. The Sastry then said to the Swami. =E2=80=9CYou have been=

speaking to me here but appeared before her at a different place! You have=

not blessed me with your grace similarly.=E2=80=9D

The Swami merely said =
that because Echammal was constantly thinking of him
she saw his form elsew=
here.But the question still remained as to why she
should see the visitor a=
lso!

Echammal was a sattvic devotee. With all her devotion to the Swami sh=
e never
ignored other great souls. She had great devotion for Seshadri Swam=
i also
who was pleased
with her goodness and devotion. Seshadri Swami who n=
either allowed others to
come near him nor go to others,would visit Echamma=
l=E2=80=99s house.

The Swami rid Sivaprakasam Pillai of worldly desires an=
d put him on the path
of enquiry. He did the same for Echammal also. But fo=
r the Swami=E2=80=99s grace how
could a person immersed in sorrow because o=
f worldly affairs, get on to the
path of self-enquiry?
