Dear KK,

Correction in my earlier message =96 It should read `Aghora, at t=
he left hand of God'

A sincere suggestion from me- No need to address me w=
ith `Ji' suffix. However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I=
'll happily accept it hence forth.

I just came across Vimalananda's though=
t on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is=
 only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.
Although=
, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple time=
s difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely important statement=
 to answer our queries.

Important information about Vimalananda which I ca=
me to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was no=
t a single day passed in his life when he didn't do smoking except on the f=
inal day of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Toba=
cco' frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because=
 as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidenc=
e of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an import=
ant thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do=
 what he says and not try to do what he does.

Now whatever I wrote above s=
eems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thought=
s further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the wor=
th can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda=
 or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants=
, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high=
 level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many thin=
gs in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned =
to universal ego.  In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trik=
aal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if the=
y ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually =
knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind e=
ach and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete backgr=
ound behind their each action and moreover their self identification is mis=
sing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to a=
ccomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.=

Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very=
 different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him =
which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind=
 him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for othe=
rs, a kind of food intake is extremely important.
If Vivekananda ate meat d=
uring his stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is not =
possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of t=
hat level. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst we=
sterners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly =
try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable hab=
its. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanc=
ed Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible th=
at he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by cons=
uming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons for that =
but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, H=
is Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from dro=
wning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned=
 to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for=
 the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water and whe=
n he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments =
thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and w=
ill give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramh=
ansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-c=
up by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew' bef=
ore 40 years.

Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.

S=
o moral of my whole writings is that it's unwise as well as self deluding t=
o take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sa=
inbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and su=
ch masters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish c=
ruel/unjust actions.

Utpal
