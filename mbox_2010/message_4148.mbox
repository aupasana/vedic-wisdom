 Sri Venkatarathnam lived with Bhagavan from 1944 to 1950. During the last
=
year he served as one of his personal attendants. Neal Rosner came to Sri
R=
amanasramam from the USA in 1968, attached himself to Venkatarathnam and
di=
ligently served him until his passing in 1976. Neal's immersion into the
sp=
iritual heritage of India under the guidance of Venkatarathnam is
elaborate=
ly described in his book On the Road to Freedom: A Pilgrimage in
India.

Ne=
al now resides in Amritanandamayi's Kerala Ashram and is known as Swami
Par=
amatmananda.

In the following article, details regarding the life of Venka=
tarathnam have
been extracted from a 25-page essay written about Venkatarat=
hnam by Neal
Rosner. He presented this manuscript to us thirty years ago at=
 Sri
Ramanasramam. We have also utilized some material from the above-menti=
oned
book.

THE following is what Sri Venkatarathnam personally told me abo=
ut himself.

He was born in Koduru, Krishna District on the 23rd of May 192=
1, and at the
age of three months his father died of a diabetic carbuncle. =
At seven his
Upanayanam was performed and from that day onwards he never fa=
iled to repeat
the Gayatri mantra for even a day. Even when in Maharshi's s=
ervice, he would
not come into his presence without having done some Gayatr=
i beforehand. From
his seventh year till his last he performed the yearly S=
raddha of his
parents. He had deep faith in this and believed that the pitr=
us (departed
ones) would bless him with good health and Brahmajnana. Even w=
hen he was
physically in a serious condition, he would somehow struggle and=
 do it.

He went to school in Gudivada, Hyderabad and Guntur in Andhra Prad=
esh. At
this time he was somewhat opposed to Hindu orthodoxy and even wrote=
 a paper
for the uplift of Harijans, about which he laughed while recalling=
 later.He
also now and then would go to see movies of the bhakti type only.=
 He used
these occasions at the cinema to test how his mind would react. A =
scorpion
in Hyderabad once stung him, but being afraid to tell his elders, =
he simply
bore the pain until they discovered it and sent him to a doctor. =
Whenever he
had free time from his studies, he would either go to a temple =
or do japa,
sometimes a lakh (100,000) in one day.


Marriage Proposal

Aft=
er he graduated from school, he thought of using the money from a
scholarsh=
ip he was awarded to go and live in Tiruvannamalai, but his
brothers wanted=
 him to get married. A rich family who offered a big dowry
and a lucrative =
post was arranged. Even though his mother knew his
temperament she had to k=
eep quiet since she was under the influence of her
other sons. Venkatarathn=
am said that they should first ask his guru, Dass
Garu, for permission. The=
y searched him out and after finding him proposed
their idea. Dass Garu sai=
d that it would be all right if Venkatarathnam got
married. When the brothe=
rs returned thinking victory was in their hands, Sri
Venkatarathnam objecte=
d, saying that according to Sastra, a brahmachari must
first serve a Guru b=
efore entering into Grihastashrama (married life). No
one accepted this eva=
sive objection and so he told them that if such a thing
is not written in t=
he Sastras, he was ready to burn the Sastras. He asked
them to immediately =
bring the Bhagavata and Ramayana and he would set fire
to them. Naturally t=
hey did not want to be a party to this crime, and so
they helplessly let hi=
m go to Arunachalam. He, however, told them that he
would go only on an exp=
erimental basis and if it suited him there he would
stay, otherwise he woul=
d return. At this time one of his brothers declared,
"You will all see. He =
will become a sadhu for sure," and this came out to be
true.


At Ramanasra=
mam

At the Ashram he was put in charge of the book depot. He later laughed=
 when
telling this because it seems that one astrologer had told him that h=
e would
get married and do business and he really thought this is what happ=
ened
because he had married Sri Ramana and was selling his books. Afterward=
s he
became an assistant of Sri Niranjanananda Swami, Sri Ramana's younger
=
brother and the Sarvadhikari of the Ashram. Then he was put in charge of th=
e
Ashram library and the books that were kept for the personal use of
Bhaga=
van. Bhagavan personally taught him to bind and stitch books and also
to re=
ad.


Bhagavan's Attendant

In 1949, Shiv Mohan Lal asked Bhagavan if Sri V=
enkatarathnam could join as
one of Sri Bhagavan's personal attendants.Bhaga=
van told that he had no
objection but that the office people must give the =
permission, which they
did. Bhagavan was very strict in correcting him and =
if anything was done
improperly it would be a matter of two days of continu=
ous chiding in front
of all the devotees.

One evening Sri Venkatarathnam c=
ame into the hall and quietly went behind
the Maharshi and started fanning =
him. In the morning Bhagavan had told that
nobody should fan him. Now he ex=
ploded and scolded him saying, "Oho, very
good, very special, this fellow t=
hinks he is doing a great service. He has
so much bhakti, much more than th=
e rest of the bhaktas here. Why doesn't he
go and fan all of them and get t=
he punya (merit) of fanning the devotees of
the Guru? He thinks that by his=
 tapas he can make me bend to his will."
Bhagavan spoke like this on and of=
f to every incoming devotee for nearly two
days. Finally, when alone with t=
he Maharshi, Sri Venkatarathnam broke down
in tears and asked Bhagavan to f=
orgive him for having made Bhagavan exert
himself so much to correct his fa=
ult. Sri Bhagavan graciously said, "Never
mind, everyone makes a mistake," =
and that was the end of the matter.

Bhagavan then had about six or seven a=
ttendants who would serve him taking
shifts. When it came time to choose sh=
ifts, they asked Venkatarathnam which
shift he wanted. He told them that he=
 would take that shift which remains
after everyone else had chosen for him=
self. So he got the 10 P.M. to 4 A.M.
shift, since everyone liked to sleep =
at that time.

This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because after =
9.30 P.M. all
the bhaktas would go away to sleep and Venkatarathnam and Sri=
 Maharshi would
be left all alone for the night. It was at this time that S=
ri Venkatarathnam
got his heart's desire to be intimately close to Bhagavan=
 without others
around fulfilled. Many nights were spent in spiritual talk =
or simply gazing
on the Divine Face of the Maharshi.


Failing Health

By t=
his time, Sri Bhagavan's health was already serious with sarcoma cancer
in =
the left arm. At the sight of the blood while dressing the wound, Sri
Venka=
tarathnam would feel faint. Whenever he would come near Bhagavan,
Maharshi =
would rebuke him thus, "Don't come near me. You people come here
thinking `=
0h, Bhagavan is sick. He is dying'. I don't want you to come near
me when y=
our mind is full of such thoughts. Stay away." Then Sri
Venkatarathnam aske=
d Bhagavan that without thinking that Bhagavan is sick or
that such and suc=
h a thing must be done to relieve the suffering, how can he
serve Bhagavan?=
 Bhagavan told him that he should simply play his part as in
a drama and do=
 whatever is necessary without having any feeling and to have
the mental at=
titude of a witness, attending to the work as the situation
demands. After =
this, he again was permitted to attend on the Maharshi.
Following
Bhagavan'=
s instructions, he began to feel everything as Atma Vilasa (the
Divine Play=
) and that Bhagavan was simply playing a role as a sick person,
although in=
 reality he was the Paramatma Himself.


Serving Mother

In 1952 he went to=
 serve his mother who was ailing with paralysis and wanted
him nearby. She =
had already spent a year or two at Arunachalam with him in
the presence of =
the Maharshi. When she first came to the Ashram, Sri
Venkatarathnam went an=
d prostrated to her and returned to the bookstall
where he was working at t=
hat time. On seeing this, Niranjanananda Swamy
chided him for not showing h=
is mother round the Ashram and finding her a
place to stay. He said, "Oho, =
I see, you are a gunatita (beyond all
differences) and need not serve your =
mother, is it?" Then Sri Venkatarathnam
went and got her settled in a room,=
 since the Sarvadhikari had ordered him
to do so.

Whenever his mother woul=
d sit in Bhagavan's presence, she would become
completely unconscious of th=
e world. Even after everyone had gone out for
food she would be sitting lik=
e that in trance. She told her son this and he
suggested that she sit outsi=
de near a window facing Bhagavan. He later
related that she really had the =
Grace of Bhagavan during her residence
there. When others told her that it =
was a sorry thing that one of her sons
had become a sadhu, she retorted and=
 said that because she was a woman she
could not live as a sadhu but her de=
sire to do so had found its fulfillment
in her son, Sri Venkatarathnam.

Wh=
en he came to serve her in his home, she insisted on taking food only from
=
his hands, even though he was not maintaining madi (orthodox procedures). H=
e
had personally served and touched the body of the Maharshi and that
conse=
crated everything he touched afterward, she thought. She always kept a
phot=
o of the 21-year-old Maharshi by her head. Every day after bathing his
moth=
er, he would read to her Bhagavatam, as this was her favorite book.

As her=
 end approached, Sri Venkatarathnam would everyday keep the Darbha
Seyya (k=
usa grass mat) under her cot, as it was her only wish that she
should die o=
n the Darbha Seyya and not on the cot.On the last day he shifted
her to the=
 ground in spite of the cold and damp weather and the objections
of Venkata=
rathnam's brothers. Then he kept her head in his lap and plunged
himself in=
to dhyana. At that time the same experience of an infinite expanse
of Grace=
 in the heart, which he had had in Sri Ramana's presence, occurred
again, a=
nd it was while he was in this state that his mother expired in his
hands.
