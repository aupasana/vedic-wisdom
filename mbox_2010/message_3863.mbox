Namaste

I have learnt a lot from the learned members of this group and jus=
t wish to share my limited understanding of the Aghora books pertaining to =
the topic of brahmacharya.Once again I apologize beforehand if my thoughts =
offend  any of the women on the list . 

Of course at the very beginning a =
midget should not attempt what a spiritual giant has done in the past and a=
s often Narasimha ji says " What is good for the goose is not good for the =
gander ".

1.I distinctly remember Aghori Vimalananda saying it is not the =
act that matters , it is the underlying thought which gives power to the ac=
t. Borrowing the words of two modern masters whom I tend to respect a lot (=
 Sadhguru Jaggi vasudev and Paramahamsa Nithyananda ) ...

" Karma is creat=
ed deepest in the thought level rather than in the physical level "

If you=
 think about it the act has already been committed on that plane of referen=
ce. 

If we dream every day of killing a person the karma generated is said=
 to be three times stronger than actually killing the person. Same goes for=
 Sex .

2.I do not wish to type the exact paragraph used by Vimalananda to =
maintain the focus on the discussion. But if you read the second book he cl=
early advises the same thing Manish ji recently said in his mail . Use the =
act of sex also for divine worship. Keep the mind focussed on god .

I have=
 read very little of the vedas but from the little understanding of the Ath=
arva veda , the female organ and male organ are compared to a blazing fire =
and the ghee ladle and the act is similar to an homa. I am sorry if this of=
fends the purists but this is the truth. 

3.Continuing on similar lines  t=
he act of eating is also recommended by Vimalananda as an internal homa . I=
n other places like the Upanishads this art is expounded as Vaishvanara Vid=
ya ...using the internal jathara agni to make an offering of food.


The tr=
ick is not in repressing it ...neither in embracing it . What use is abstin=
ence if you think about it all day. Like Thakur says in one of the parables=
 of the wish fulfilling tree...

Dismissing the visible world and its pleas=
ures and sorrows as maya is folly...for then the man has not learnt anythin=
g.

Embracing the visible world and its pleasures and sorrows as maya is fo=
lly too...for then also the man has not learnt anything.


The easiest way =
is to trust the mother ...trust the medicine she gives and not run away fro=
m relationships or fall heads over heels in the pursuit of those relationsh=
ips. Use each one of those opportunities to serve the divine in those forms=
.


Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
