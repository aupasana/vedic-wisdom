 In February 1892 Sundaram Iyer unexpectedly died, he was in his
mid-fortie=
s. He left behind him his wife Alagammal, their three sons,
Nagaswami aged =
fourteen, Ramana aged twelve and Nagasundaram aged six and
their daughter A=
lamelu aged four. When Ramana returned from his school at
Dindigul to Tiruc=
huli, to see his dead father for the last time, he
reflected thoughtfully, =
=E2=80=9CWhen Father is lying here, why do they say that he
has gone?=E2=80=
=9D One of the elders answered him, =E2=80=9CIf this were your father, woul=
d
he not receive you with love? So you see, he has gone.=E2=80=9D

The sudd=
en death of the head of the family was a dramatic event which
resulted in t=
he family being split up. Alagammal moved to Manamadurai with
the younger c=
hildren Nagasundaram and Alamelu to live with her younger
brother-in-law Ne=
lliappa Iyer,who was also working as a pleader. The two
older children move=
d into the house of Subba Iyer, another uncle on the
father=E2=80=99s side,=
who lived at number 11 Chokkappa Naicken Street near the
famous Meenakshi t=
emple.

Ramana was sent to Scott=E2=80=99s Middle School and later to the A=
merican Mission
High School. He was an average scholar who learned easily, =
but was not much
interested in his lessons. He would often go unprepared to=
 class. If others
recited the day=E2=80=99s lesson he would remember enough=
 to enable him to keep up.

Later he told his devotees the following story =
with regard to his
schooldays, =E2=80=9CWhile the school lessons were being=
 taught, lest I should fall
asleep I used to tie a thread to the nail on th=
e wall, and tie my hair to
it. When the head nods, the thread is pulled tig=
ht and that used to wake me
up. Otherwise, the teacher used to twist my ear=
s and wake me up.=E2=80=9D

Wrestling, boxing, running and other sports wer=
e much more appealing to
Ramana. He was stronger than most boys of his age =
and his strength and
ability even impressed the older boys. He also liked t=
o play football with
his friends. People noticed that his team always won. =
This and other similar
occurrences earned him the nickname =E2=80=98Thangak=
ai=E2=80=99 (Golden Hand). It is a title
given in Tamil Nadu to people who =
are always successful in their
undertakings.

Ramana did not study Sanskrit=
 or the sacred traditions of Hinduism such as
the Vedas or the Upanishads. =
In both the schools he attended he was taught
Christianity, but Hindu boys =
generally showed little interest in such bible
classes =E2=80=93 and Ramana=
 was no exception in this respect.

Although he was very much like any othe=
r boy, he did have one peculiar
trait. His sleep used to be exceptionally d=
eep. When a relative later
visited him at the Ashram Ramana recalled the fo=
llowing incident which
happened in Dindigul, =E2=80=9CYour uncle Periappa S=
eshaiyar was living there then.
There was some function in the house and al=
l went to it and then in the
night went to the temple. I was left alone in =
the house. I was sitting
reading in the front room,but after a while I lock=
ed the front door and
fastened the windows and went to sleep. When they ret=
urned from the temple
no amount of shouting or banging at the door or windo=
w could wake me. At
last they managed to open the door with a key from the =
opposite house and
then they tried to wake me up by beating me.All the boys=
 beat me to their
heart=E2=80=99s content, and your uncle did too, but with=
out effect. I knew nothing
about it till they told me next morning. =E2=80=
=A6 The same sort of thing happened
to me in Madurai too. The boys didn=E2=
=80=99t dare to touch me when I was awake,but
if they had any grudge agains=
t me they would come when I was asleep and
carry me wherever they liked and=
 beat me as much as they liked and then put
me back to bed, and I would kno=
w nothing about it until they told me in the
morning.

Soon thereafter, in =
the middle of July 1896, at the age of 16, the great
change took place in h=
is life. He was at the time a pupil in his final year
at secondary school. =
He later described the incident which changed his life
completely and irrev=
ersibly, =E2=80=9CIt was about six weeks before I left Madurai
for good tha=
t the great change in my life took place. It was so sudden. One
day I sat u=
p alone on the first floor of my uncle=E2=80=99s house. I was in my usual
h=
ealth. I seldom had any illness. I was a heavy sleeper. =E2=80=A6 So, on th=
at day
as I sat alone there was nothing wrong with my health. But a sudden =
and
unmistakable fear of death seized me. I felt I was going to die.Why I s=
hould
have so felt cannot now be explained by anything felt in my body. Nor=
 could
I explain it to myself then. I did not however trouble myself to dis=
cover if
the fear was well grounded. I felt =E2=80=98I was going to die,=E2=
=80=99 and at once set
about thinking out what I should do. I did not care =
to consult doctors or
elders or even friends. I felt I had to solve the pro=
blem myself then and
there.

The shock of fear of death made me at once int=
rospective, or =E2=80=98introverted=E2=80=99.I
said to myself mentally, i.e=
., without uttering the words =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98Now, death has
come. What =
does it mean? What is it that is dying? This body dies.=E2=80=99 I at
once =
dramatized the scene of death. I extended my limbs and held them rigid
as t=
hough rigor-mortis had set in. I imitated a corpse to lend an air of
realit=
y to my further investigation. I held my breath and kept my mouth
closed, p=
ressing the lips tightly together so that no sound might escape.
Let not th=
e word =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or any other word be uttered! =E2=80=98Well then=
,=E2=80=99 said I to
myself,=E2=80=98this body is dead. It will be carried =
stiff to the burning ground
and there burnt and reduced to ashes. But with =
the death of this body, am
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D dead? Is the body =E2=80=9CI=
=E2=80=9D? This body is silent and inert. But I feel the
full force of my p=
ersonality and even the sound =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D within myself, - apart
fr=
om the body. So =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D am a spirit, a thing transcending the b=
ody. The
material body dies, but the spirit transcending it cannot be touch=
ed by
death. I am therefore the deathless spirit.=E2=80=99

All this was no=
t a mere intellectual process, but flashed before me vividly
as living trut=
h, something which I perceived immediately,without any
argument almost. =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 was something very real, the only real thing in that
state=
, and all the conscious activity that was connected with my body was
centre=
d on that. The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or my =E2=80=98self=E2=80=99 was holding=
 the focus of attention by
a powerful fascination from that time forwards. =
Fear of death had vanished
once and forever. Absorption in the Self has con=
tinued from that moment
right up to this time. Other thoughts may come and =
go like the various notes
of a musician, but the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 contin=
ues like the basic or fundamental sruti
note which accompanies and blends w=
ith all other notes.Whether the body was
engaged in talking, reading or any=
thing else,I was still centred on =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.

He reports, =E2=80=
=9CWhen I lay down with limbs outstretched and mentally enacted
the death s=
cene and realized that the body would be taken and cremated and
yet I would=
 live, some force, call it atmic power [power of atman] or
anything else, r=
ose within me and took possession of me. With that, I was
reborn and I beca=
me a new man. I became indifferent to everything
afterwards,having neither =
likes nor dislikes.=E2=80=9D

>From now on he swallowed everything that was =
served to him,whether delicious
or tasteless, good or bad, with no regard t=
o how it tasted or smelled, or to
its quality. Formerly, if he thought an i=
njustice had been done to him or if
other boys teased him, he would stand u=
p for himself. Now he accepted
everything without protest. He was also no l=
onger interested in joining in
his friends=E2=80=99 sporting activities, bu=
t rather sat alone and meditated with
eyes closed in yogic posture. At scho=
ol he started to encounter
problems,because he was no longer interested in =
books. He remembered,=E2=80=9CAfter
the =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99 experience =
I was living in a different
world. How could I turn my attention to books? =
Before that, I would at least
attend to what the other boys repeated and re=
peat the same myself. But
afterwards, I could not do even that. At school, =
my mind would not dwell on
study at all. I would be imagining and expecting=
 God would suddenly drop
down from Heaven before me.=E2=80=9D

After his en=
lightenment Ramana started to visit the temple regularly.He
recalled, =E2=
=80=9CFormerly I would go there rarely with friends,see the images, put
on =
sacred ashes and sacred vermilion on the forehead and return home without
a=
ny perceptible emotion.

During his last month in Madurai, Ramana suffered =
from an unusual intense
pain in his head and a burning sensation. But all s=
ymptoms of his profound
change disappeared when he stepped into the temple =
at Tiruvannamalai for the
first time on 1st September
1896.
