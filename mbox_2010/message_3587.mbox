Namaste,

The visualization may vary based on one's conditioning and attitu=
de.

One may visualize Mother Gayatri with certain number of faces. Or one =
may visualize Savitaa or Surya Narayana (Sun god as supreme cosmic being) r=
unning the whole universe through his shakti Saavitri. Or one may visualize=
 a bright light that fills the entire universe. And so on.

One can use whi=
chever visualization comes naturally to one. Irrespective of how one visual=
izes, one can experience something sublime with Gayatri mantra. But the key=
 is to suppress all other mundane thoughts and visualizations happening in =
the mind side by side with the mantra! THAT is a long process, but one can =
keep trying.

One important point is that feeling guilty or frustrated at t=
he mundane thoughts and laboring consciously to "suppress" them can actuall=
y increase distracting thoughts instead of suppressing them. The best way t=
o suppress other thoughts is to move the mind back to mantra whenever one o=
bserves another stream of thought, without any guilt or frustration. Suppre=
ssion of other thoughts when chanting a mantra is a long process. Success m=
ay suddenly come oneday unannounced. You just keep doing it and wait patien=
tly.

Best regards,
Narasimha

      Namaste,

We tell a =
young student to study well and get good scores in examinations. We tell hi=
m that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM et=
c). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the =
goal of education. The goal of education is to understand the subject well =
and have a good career. It is possible to get 90% score without understandi=
ng well and it is possible to go to IIT and not understand the subject well=
.

Similarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over m=
ind, overcome the internal enemies as much as possible and become liberated=
. But, we tell people to do so and so
 rituals, follow so and so procedures=
/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.

Some formulas were created so that=
 there is some structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about th=
ose
 formulas.

Yes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n=
/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please =
do so. No harm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives "sidd=
hi" in a mantra.

However, please note that there are many people who did p=
urascharanas using such formulas and did not really get any "siddhi" in the=
 mantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not stick to those for=
mulas and yet found god through the mantra.

In my opinion, you can do just=
 japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th cou=
nt tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam without any j=
apam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is so absorb=
ed in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is =
free (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free).

 *

Regarding the astrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mant=
ra, I would like disown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath =
and shared by me in my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, bu=
t many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and t=
echnicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get spe=
cific material results (and naturally those rules have been intentionally c=
orrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).

Bottomline is that a=
 mantra done for spiritual progress works based on your mental visualizatio=
n of the mantra and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your=
 mind. All the house calculations based on the numbers of letters and numbe=
r of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can =
be done by anyone without worrying about technicalities.

Regarding adding =
"Om"
 or "Om Bhur bhuvas suvah" or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah.." e=
tc, there are many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were taugh=
t by your gurus and not worrying too much about it.

Utpal =
asked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up=
. In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g.=
 one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the co=
unt.

      Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for suc=
h a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see s=
ignificant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatr=
i Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in=
 future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was o=
ne a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months a=
nd then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, howe=
ver, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) an=
d we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our =
Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam,=
 sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the n=
umber of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be =
fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big =
japams must be done. Can you shed more light on
 this? 
=C2=A0
Also, Gayatr=
i mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the =
vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=
=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th ho=
use, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanati=
on? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated =
here and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretatio=
n is right and also please tell me which approach is better.

Namas=
te,

What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyday in =
one sitting and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. Then =
possibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that=
, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.

Of course, if needs no break, one c=
an do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be =
difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.

For succe=
ss in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and c=
ontrol of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (pur=
ifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some s=
hakti.

Every factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The =
tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a=
 reason. We discussed this sometime back.

If one is living a lifestyle whe=
re one avoids
 contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living=
 in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one i=
s living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations re=
gularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), b=
eard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is=
 not the complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a rail=
ing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding of=
f the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control,=
 similarly a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to r=
etain control in some tricky situations.

Trimming beard is ok.

=A0 *

If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of=
 hours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,
 
while follo=
wing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same=
 direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key =
thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes clo=
sed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost ze=
ro if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a=
 chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still=
 for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to be=
ing still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then vario=
us kinds of samadhis become possible.

This is a great mail and very inspiring. =
However, I have one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry out t=
he sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3=
 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 =
times every day for=C2=A0300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a p=
rofessional corporate life, that could be a difficult thing. How about trim=

<div>Thank you for such a nice explanation. =
Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant progress in=
 terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the past. D=
id not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practis=
e with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana=
 (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a homam =
to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called abo=
ut 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the=
 mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us=
 to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjan=
am and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so =
basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the rit=
ual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must be done. C=
an you shed more light on
 this? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, Gayatr=
i mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the =
vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah&n=
bsp;). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th hous=
e, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation=
? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated he=
re and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretation =
is right and also please tell me which approach is better. </div>

solution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly mo=
