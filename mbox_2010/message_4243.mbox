 In Days of Great Peace, a book recounting Mouni Sadhu's (M. Sudouski) visi=
t
to the Ashram of Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1949, was first published in 1953=
.
It has been out of print for many years and is now in the process of bein=
g
republished by Sri Ramanasramam. We hope to have it available in our book=

store in a few months.

In Days of Great Peace inspired many Westerners to=
 seek spiritual guidance
from Sri Ramana Maharshi in the years following hi=
s Mahasamadhi.

Through a narrative that is both simple and profound, the a=
uthor takes us on
his journey to the quiet hermitage of the renowned Sage o=
f Arunachala in
South India. Basking in the radiance of the 'Great Rishi' h=
is mind turns
inward, following the path of Self-inquiry of 'Who Am I?'. He=
 describes,
with perceptive insight and emotion, how in the gracious presen=
ce of the
Master, thoughts are stilled and one rests calmly in the thought-=
free,
egoless state.

Below are a few excerpts from various chapters of the=
 book.

When I arrived at the abode of Maharshi, called 'Ramanashram,' and =
jumped
out from the two-wheeled cart just in front of the temple, in spite =
of the
late hour, but in accordance with the custom of the place, I was tak=
en
straight into the presence of the Sage.

A modest Indian supper was serv=
ed a little rice, vegetables and fruit on a
banana leaf. By the time I had =
finished, Maharshi had gone. As soon as I
found myself in the small one-roo=
m cottage prepared for me in the Ashram's
compound, I immediately fell asle=
ep, being very tired after my whole day's
journey.

Life in Maharshi's Ashr=
am

At 7 A.M. there was the loud sound of a gong calling us to breakfast. W=
hen I
reached the dining hall, Maharshi was just mounting the few steps lea=
ding to
it. He was accompanied by several Indians, his permanent attendants=
. Here,
in full daylight, I noticed for the first time that the physical st=
ate of
Maharshi was really precarious. He walked with difficulty, as his jo=
ints and
knees were affected by acute rheumatism. His left arm and elbow we=
re
bandaged because of a malignant tumour, which had begun its growth about=
 six
months earlier and, in spite of two operations, had continued to sprea=
d its
devastating work, causing Maharshi's death one year later.Sometimes h=
is head
shook slightly and this increased the impression of serious ill hea=
lth; the
whole frame, once tall and powerful, was now bent and weak.

The S=
age ate with his hand according to the general Indian custom. His
movements=
 seemed to be automatic. I saw that he was quite aware of his
surroundings =
and reacted in a normal way to all the phenomena of the outward
world, but =
I felt certain that his real Self had nothing to do with the
functions and =
actions of his visible vehicle.

There are three communal meals in the Ashr=
am: lunch or dinner at about 11:30
A.M., supper at 7.30 P.M. and also tea a=
t 3.30 P.M. for the Ashram guests
and occasional visitors. One is given tea=
, coffee, or by special request,
milk, as was the case with me. The dishes =
are well prepared, but some
vegetables and pastry have many condiments adde=
d and are too hot for the
European palate. [Less spicy preparations are now=
 available for Westerners]

Maharshi took a little of everything. At the en=
d of the meal, when
buttermilk was distributed, he made a kind of round wal=
l of rice, leaving a
space in the middle for the liquid. When he had enough=
 he stopped, with a
gesture to the Brahmin who was serving. He never left a=
 single grain of rice
on his leaf.

Farewell

And I begin to tell Him slowl=
y and clearly that I have to leave the Ashram
and beg His permission, and a=
fter He nods in consent, I proceed to ask His
blessing for my present, my f=
uture, and forever. His eyes seem even more
luminous; the face, expressing =
a superhuman kindness, seems to become more
serious. He gives me the blessi=
ng. I know He sees my next, still unexpressed
entreaty. I do not hear any w=
ords, yet I feel He is asking me whether I am
aware of the meaning of my ow=
n prayer. And without moving my lips, I give
Him my answer. Yet all is so n=
atural, so simple, so real, that I would
rather doubt my standing here than=
 this mute conversation. A short silence
follows.

I bow my head and feel t=
he touch of his hand on my brow, the delicate touch
of his fingers along my=
 head. A subtle current of power and purity passes
through my whole frame.
=

In a lightning flash, I realize that the power of this moment will sustain=

me in all the years to come, and its light will for ever shine on my life.=
