 IT WAS in the beginning of January 1921 that I first saw Bhagavan Sri
Rama=
na Maharshi. He was then living in Skandashram, which looks like the
very h=
eart of the majestic hill, Arunachalam. It is a beautiful, quiet spot
with =
a cluster of coconut and other trees and a perennial crystal-clear
spring.
=

Ganapati Muni

When I entered Maharshi's hut early the next morning and bo=
wed to him, there
were many devotees seated before him. But my attention wa=
s particularly
gripped by a radiant personality amidst that group. He was, =
I learned,
Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri. He had the face-cut of the great poe=
t
Rabindranath Tagore and from the light that shone on his face, I found ho=
w
mistaken I had been in my hitherto impression that he was only one of the=

learned pandits. His broad forehead, gracefully bright eyes, aquiline nose=
,
charming face and beard, and the melodious ring in his voice =E2=80=94 al=
l these
proclaimed that he was a genius, a great poet, a rishi. Everything =
about him
reminded me of the Vedic seers, especially Vasistha, and it is in=
teresting
to note that he was of the line of Vasishta. There was authority,=
 dignity
and sweetness in his talks and his eyes sparkled as he spoke.

He =
was then living in the Mango Tree Cave on the eastern slope of
Arunachala. =
Adjoining it and a little above it is the perennial
spring,Tiru-Mullaipal-T=
hertham. This cave has often served as the Maharshi's
summer abode when he =
lived at Virupaksha Cave. It was here, in the Mango
Tree Cave, that Ganapat=
i Muni composed extempore the last quarter of a
'Thousand Verses in Praise =
of Uma' (Uma Sahasram) within a few hours one
night, in the presence of the=
 Maharshi.

One evening I went to that cave to see him. I waited for him a =
few minutes
in the room next to the cave before Ganapati Muni emerged from =
the cave.
There was the fragrance of tapas in the person of the Muni and ab=
out his
residence. I sat down before him after paying my respects to him. H=
e
silently looked at me for a few minutes. Then I had a talk with him about=

spiritual sadhana and the details of discipline needed for it. After a few=

days I expressed to the Maharshi my desire to go through the principal
Upa=
nishads. Maharshi directed me to go to 'Nayana',saying that he was the
man =
who could elucidate anything concerning sacred lore. So I went to Nayana
an=
d placed before him a passage from the Taitiriya Upanishad for
explanation.=


He dilated upon its profound significance with clarity and ease. After
he=
aring him for an hour, I came to the conclusion that I need not make a
stud=
y of the Upanishads under him, as whatever he uttered was
Upanishadic. Thou=
gh
Nayana was himself a man of wisdom and tapas, he used to direct aspirant=
s
coming to him to the Maharshi. He knew that there was a special effect in=

hearing the truth of Atman from the Maharshi himself. And Maharshi would
s=
end to Nayana devotees who sought light upon upasana (methods of worship)
o=
r details pertaining to various sastras. Thus their mutual appreciative
rel=
ationship was beautiful.

Guidance and Grace

Four months after I came to A=
runachalam, my parents came there to have
darsan of Maharshi and take me ba=
ck home. Though they did not succeed in
their latter intention, they were s=
omehow consoled by the Maharshi before
they returned. My father is a cousin=
 of the Maharshi, older than him, and as
such knew him very intimately as a=
 boy before he left home for
Tiruvannamalai. Though he had heard from other=
s about the Maharshi and read
carefully Sri Ramana Gita, he came there with=
 an open mind to see for
himself what the Maharshi was. But the moment he s=
aw him he was so
overpowered by a sense of veneration that he prostrated be=
fore him with
emotion and observed, "There is nothing here of the Venkatara=
man I knew,
nothing to identify him."

Maharshi gracefully smiled and remar=
ked, "Oh! It is long since he
disappeared," indicating the complete transfo=
rmation he had undergone. My
father then told the Maharshi that he had not =
come to him so long, as he had
not achieved dispassion for the world. "How =
could a man," he said, "who has
no spirit of renunciation in him be benefit=
ed by the company of the sage?"
The Maharshi, from his usual and normal hig=
h level, replied, "Oh! Then you
seem to be obsessed by the delusion that yo=
u are going to achieve vairagya
(nonattachment) in some distant future. If =
you just discern your real
nature, the Self, with what is it attached? Disp=
assion is one's very
nature."

One day someone told the Maharshi about a de=
votee who claimed to be Ramana
himself and said that honoring him was honor=
ing Ramana. Maharshi replied
with a smile, "There is nothing wrong about it=
; it is all right. But if
somebody else claims the same status for himself,=
 this man should not deny
it, because every one is Ramana, all is Ramana." =
We all enjoyed that
straight and humorous remark of Maharshi.

As the recon=
struction of the Ashram cottage was then going on, Maharshi
often remained =
with his devotees and visitors in the big stone mantap,
situated on the oth=
er side of the road. Maharshi used to dine with all in
the shade of a huge =
mango tree in front of his mother's samadhi. There was
cool water kept in b=
ig pots at the foot of the tree during these hot summer
days. All of us enj=
oyed the cool shade, the cool water, and the grace of the
Maharshi, which l=
ike a cool breeze removed the heat of man's torments.
