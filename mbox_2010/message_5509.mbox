Dear Narasimha Gaaru and Learned Members,

Please point me to the right pla=
ce if this was already answered.

With my limited knowledge, I know that th=
ere is s specific significance for the 
"Dravyam" used in the Homam. For ex=
ample, 


	1. Ghee represents something
	2. Atukulu represents somethings
	=
3. Black sesame seeds mean something etc

Is there any place where there is=
 more information on the significance of each 
type of "Dravyam" used in th=
e Homam? or could you please enlighten me on this 
topic?
 
Regards, 
Bhush=
an

Yes, Thanks - I did remember the spice avoidance instru=
ctions, however wasn't 
sure if there were some exceptions, hence had asked=
 the question.
Your response stirred vague memories made me dig through the=
 archives; and I
