Effecting Spiritual Experience



[ There are two basic types of spiritual=
 experiences (in the sense
I'm using the term). The first are ecstatic expe=
riences caused by a
disruption of the homeostasis of the human organism. Th=
ese can occur as
a result of fasting, sleep deprivation, drugs, breathing e=
xercises,
pain, dancing, and so on. All of these activities can put us "out=
 of
homeostasis" =96 by changing our body temperature, blood pressure
or me=
tabolic rate, causing dehydration and exhaustion or chemical
changes =96 an=
d when this happens there's a chance that we'll
experience a higher state o=
f consciousness. (Although this certainly
doesn't always happen, of course.=
 Most of the time the only effect
that depriving yourself of sleep and food=
 often has is to make you feel
miserably tired and hungry.)



The second t=
ype of spiritual experiences are more serene and calm states
which occur wh=
en there is an intensification and stillness of
life-energy (or vitality) i=
nside us. This can happen in any situation
when we're very relaxed, when th=
ere's peacefulness around us,
and when the mental chatter inside our heads =
fades away. In meditation,
we make a conscious effort to intensify and stil=
l our life-energy by
being inactive, by withdrawing our attention from the =
world around us,
and by focusing on a mantra (or a candle flame or on our b=
reathing or
any other object) to slow down and quieten our mental chatter. =
As a
result, meditation is probably the most effective way of generating
sp=
iritual experiences.



However, they can also happen more spontaneously =
=96 in natural
surroundings, for example, when there's peacefulness around =
you and
the beauty of nature has a similar effect to a mantra in meditation=
,
focusing your attention and quietening your mental chatter. They often
oc=
cur when people are listening to music or contemplating works of art.
Certa=
in sports are also very conducive to spiritual experiences, such as
long-di=
stance running or swimming. This is also probably part of the
reason why sp=
iritual experiences can occur during or after sex. The
sheer pleasure of se=
x can have the effect of shifting our attention away
from our ego-minds, wh=
ich may fall silent as a result. ]



Well, I would not argue with any of t=
hat. I would simply ask you as to
if there is `spiritual' experience then w=
hat is non spiritual
experience? And who says so? Also, what do you mean by=
 `higher state
of consciousness' ?  What makes it higher than what?  Does i=
t mean
UP?  And what is this `higher' state of consciousness like?  And
is =
there anything wrong with `lower' states of consciousness? 
And what exists=
 in-between the higher and the lower states; and what is
it like there ?   =
Do you perchance speak of altered states of
consciousness? Time consciousne=
ss and eternal consciousness maybe?  Is
existing in the timeless formless m=
ode of being more spiritual than
sitting under a tree in the sunshine?   Wh=
y segregate and call one good
and the other not good? What is the ego mind?=
  Do you mean the daily
personality?  What is wrong with that? We need that=
 to wash the babies
arse mate. I cannot take care of you if I am in paradis=
e.
