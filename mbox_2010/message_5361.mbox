proteins are Legumes (including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 8=

50 gms of fruits per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These are =

 always a questionable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian =
diet will highlight the results which support veg food and vice versa. Ther=
e are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will f=
ind that for different sources different sources are better. For example ca=
lcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, fo=
r Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurved=
a also support this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg wil=
l suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. =
As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.

 that after food, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How m=
