Hi all,
 I had an unusual dream last night and I would appreciate if learne=
d members can decode the meaning to me?
I saw myself watching a person and =
a goddess (4 arms, white sari, copper-gold hued faced, about 10 feet tall, =
floating about 2 feet above air)person was on the left and goddess was on r=
ight as I was watching this conversation. He went on explaining (complainin=
g) the goddess how bad the world has become etc. after listening to that, t=
he goddess proceed to cut his face from right underneath the bottom of his =
nose all the way down to the jaw. Then I saw that person still has his face=
 intact, but half of his tongue has been cut (the cut tongue resembled a qu=
arter of an ellipse cut into four equal parts)
Then she took that tongue an=
d replaced it on her own tongue. So now she had half of her own tongue and =
half of that persons tongue. The tongue of that person was now green like m=
oss covered green. Then she looked at me and it was kind of a fierce look.
=

 I don't know what to make out of it. I don't know at what time I saw this=
 dream. 

Thanks for taking your time to read this.

Regards
Kshroum
