Dear All

I would like to express my view about Karma theory.=C2=A0 It is t=
he most interpreted and mostly misunderstood theory not only Western world;=
 but also in India and Hindus.,=C2=A0 According to my opinion for every act=
 of ours there is double entry; mostly like double entry book-keeping where=
 every transaction has two entries.

Though the act is one, by you,=C2=A0 (=
1) it affects or benefits somebody, that is the opposite person according t=
o his own Karma and (2) by doing the same act, you are also accumulating a =
Karma the result of which either positive or negative will be experienced b=
y you at a later date.

Many people fail to understand the second entry to =
their own Karma or when they receive the effect of a bad or good karma, the=
y think what they have done to get this.

Knowingly or unknowingly we are b=
ecoming=C2=A0 a channel and once anybody understood the concept, they can t=
ry to use their free will not to become a channel at least for bad karmas.
=
To this extent only free will is anything but useful and for other things, =
the GOD has got 
greater designs for every individual.

This is only my per=
sonal opinion and as far as possible I would not like to be a channel for b=
ad karma's. 

Yours with love
S. Subramanian
