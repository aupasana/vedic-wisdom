Dear Kishore,
=C2=A0
What is the importance of 3 days that many yogis pick =
it for events in their saadhana?
=C2=A0
Tri-Chandi in Manikarnika is consid=
ered to be a nice/powerful sadhana, specially if the tithi is Krishna Paksh=
a saptami, astami and navami or even astami, navami and dasami.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
A bit about Baba=C2=A0Bhagwan Ram:
=C2=A0
I had read the biography of B=
aba Bhagwan Ram when I visited Kasi in 2008. It is there that I read about =
his meditating at the Manikarnika for 3 continuous days. He had left home a=
t the age of about 11/12 ( from bihar - where he was born) to become a wond=
ering monk and landed up in Kasi finally. When he came to Kasi he went to t=
he Dasasmedha Ghat where he saw a lady - very well dress, decked in jewelle=
ry - standing. The kind lady told him that she will take him to visit Vishw=
anath, but before that asked him to take a bath in the water. As he came ou=
t of the Ganges water he saw the lady had bought some milk, ghee, flowers a=
nd asked the young boy to accompany him as she lead him to the Kasi Vishwan=
ath temple. Once they reached the Shiva Linga, the lady instructed him how =
to do Abhisekha of the Linga with the stuff she had bought. After coming ou=
t of the temple, the lady kept walking along the lanes - VIshwanath Gali - =
with the 11 year old boy following her.
 Suddenly infront of a huge gate, t=
hey stopped and the lady went inside. Baba Bhagwan Ram thought it must be t=
he house of some rich person, and preferred to stand outside waiting. Plus =
that was his first day in Kasi, and he had neither any money for anything e=
lse with him. After waiting there for a few hours, when the lady did not co=
me out, he decided to enter through the gates. Once inside he realized that=
 it was not the house of a rich man but the famous Annapoorna temple. And t=
here was no sign of that lady anywhere! Confused, he came out of the Vishwa=
nath Gali into the main road, when he saw that lady standing there again. S=
he called him and asked him, what does he want. Bhagwan Ram said he wanted =
to realize God. The lady instructed him to go to the Kinnarama Ashram, sayi=
ng there are paramhamsas who live there, you will find guidance there. Devo=
tees of Baba Bhagwan Ram believe that lady was none other than Ma Annapurna=
.
=C2=A0
Later, he was instructed in many Aghor Sadhanas and spend years pr=
actising them. When he had been meditating at the Manikarnika for three day=
s - he used to live on the samshan like an Aghori - around the age of 18/19=
 (I don't recollect exactly), he suddenly saw/felt/realized everything as m=
illions of=C2=A0beautiful petals of concentric circle around a centre. He c=
hose a few of the petals and came back to his normal senses again. After th=
at, he said, any slight desire that would arise in the mind would immediate=
ly manifest. 
=C2=A0
With age, Baba Bhagawan Ram toured all along India and=
 even went abroad telling people about God realization and sadhana. He was =
the person who opened up the Kinnaram Ashram to ordinary people, before him=
 the ashram never encouraged ordinary visitor. Even today, if=C2=A0you go t=
here you will hardly find not more than 5/6 people at any given time.=C2=A0=
But his idea was to let people come in and meditate inside the ashram premi=
ses. He made all sadhakas of the ashram promise to become vegetarians and n=
ot use alcohol. 
=C2=A0
He died in 1990s (dont remember exact year). Some p=
eople consider him to be a reincarnation of Baba Kinnaram.

Namaste,

Rajarshi, your whole experie=

What is the importance of 3 days that many yogis pick it for events in t=

Namaste All,
=C2=A0
While re reading my ma=
ils after I sent them to the list, I found many silly errors of spelling an=
d grammer. I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly p=
ardon such errors and read through them. As they say, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
During the day time, we roamed around shooting at dif=
ferent places. In this 3 days we never visited any of the temples in Kasi. =
I asked him, "What about the temples? Won't we visit them?". Manish retorte=
d immediately, "=C2=A0Aren't we=C2=A0going to the most powerful temple in K=
asi every night?"! I silently agreed. This is something about Manish I have=
 observed. He rarely enters temples or standard places of worship, but sudd=
enly he might see a small roadside temple and stand and stare for sometimes=
, even do a pranam and then remark, "There is something here."
=C2=A0
Durin=
g evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori =
who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-s=
thal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside th=
e Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong energies in here=
. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=C2=A0 pranam=C2=A0at the sam=
adhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan =
Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days a=
t the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=A0 Manish, on being=C2=A0questioned, said tha=
t many sadhanas have been done here in this place for long by people with n=
o mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking a=
round the Ashram we found some quotations which were written in small woode=
n boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Trans=
lated to English, it read, "If you have to give your head off to get a sadg=
uru, you
 have=C2=A0got it cheap".
=C2=A0
By 8 PM we sat for dinner. We use=
d to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going to the=
 samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing any sad=
hana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed. Ther=
e is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/concepts/=
 experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subtle bod=
y. It is the second which must increase in order for one to "digest" variou=
s experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni is les=
s, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused on so=
mething and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not feel hu=
ngry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agn=
i.
=C2=A0
As we sat eating our food and talking on different topics, we dis=
cussed history.The conversation mentioned here is a thread picked up from a=
n earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha and=C2=A0me) had before co=
ming to Kasi. 
=C2=A0
Manish said, "It is the same set of=C2=A0souls who co=
me back=C2=A0again and again in different bodies and personalities at diffe=
rent times, who=C2=A0are responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta a=
nd Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakri=
shna etc." He continued, "They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form =
which is necessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is=
 connected to this land=C2=A0which we call India=C2=A0today.This land is co=
nnected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when ne=
eded.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what ha=
ppened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently con=
templated her fate.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
"One very senior Rishi has decided to=C2=
=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=C2=A0Ve=
d=C2=A0Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Not=
hing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0=
can stand against the will of a Rishi."=C2=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent qu=
estion here. "What were the Rishis doing for=C2=A0one thousand years?". Man=
ish laughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply=
 in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=C2=A0one day=C2=A0wake up from medit=
ation=C2=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2=A0and all sorts of non-spir=
itual things going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re cr=
eate the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do=
. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child's p=
lay for Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is s=
o important to keep doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.
=C2=A0
As n=
ight approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manikarnika again. This=
 was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We wal=
ked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a=
=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2=A0yes why not, but witho=
ut Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie is the mo=
st practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest consciousne=
ss, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind such that it=
 can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0worshipping the divine Mother is the b=
est way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda says, "Let the Mother show you the fa=
ce of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, "Kala Bha=
irava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in=
 the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here =
in Manikarnika." Then staring at the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled li=
ghtly and
 added, "That man was something." This was again an old conversat=
ion we had started=C2=A0before which Mainsh continued, "All these babas of =
today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them. T=
hose three books have the power of a deity flowing through them. Without be=
ing physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of sadhakas!". I int=
erjected, "The books=C2=A0are like a Bible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn't th=
ey?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was possible for someon=
e to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes it was, if one does =
serious sadhana. However, the important question is whether one will be abl=
e to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd b=
ook of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a time will come when=
 his "children" would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how=
 deep things run. 
=C2=A0
We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This =
time we sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. Th=
e fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the=
 homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now =
this did not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would s=
lowly lift his=C2=A0palm upwards=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediat=
ely the fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0th=
e flames were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing=
 on the samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was wo=
rking on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish=
 too responded back, "Jai Mahadev". This homa was faster. He did not use an=
y "samputs", but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got =
up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to=
 make them burn properly. I was
 enjoying it. A few people came and sat nea=
r us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in=
 the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has=
 any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. =
He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could r=
aise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Mani=
karnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point mentall=
y wondering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said, i=
f a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan sca=
red. But there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the ni=
ght.
=C2=A0
Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Thou=
gh this homa got over faster than previous days, the meditation that happen=
ed, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst =
forth and expand across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was =
good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish contin=
ued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Not=
hing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his=
 feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, " I could have just le=
ft my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the=
 next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that mome=
nt the cow and brought me back." Smiling he added, "What a sight it would h=
ave been for the people to see, how the body can be left at will".=C2=A0 I =
did not know what to say. 
=C2=A0
We stood there watching another pyre in f=
ront. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0re=
d patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserte=
d it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the bu=
rning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in the middle=
 of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, st=
icking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, nigh=
t-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0o=
r vegetables, both dead -=C2=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked =
me smiling, "Maza aya?". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commente=
d=C2=A0that I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let pe=
ople know.
=C2=A0
By this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doi=
ng the Chandi path, one dog=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I inf=
ormed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as=
 well." Manish said we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before=
, in some life.
=C2=A0
As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (=
the three peaks)=C2=A0of Shiva's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Th=
erefore, it is a "safe" samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here wi=
ll face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will ca=
use any unnecessary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there =
are people here even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As=
 long as ones intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful p=
lace to do sadhana.
=C2=A0
While walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=
=A0totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red l=
ungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and ke=
pt moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I=
 had got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint =
smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of =
similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you a=
re out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not m=
ove too close to the water=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the=
 water. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The prot=
ection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya=
 Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ga=
nges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would=
 roam around naked. It is their city.
=C2=A0
Next morning, as we sat recoll=
ecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadha=
ks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Ved=
as. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must get the intonation perf=
ect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2=A0enquired that I had heard =
from someone that a certain procedure needs to be done before one starts an=
y sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0"Karna to s=
ab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!".=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly be=
come half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=C2=A0"The color of Rama's=
 body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2=A0around him. Like a sun blaz=
ing. That=C2=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayat=
ri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arro=
ws, the motion of his hands=C2=A0is so fast that a normal human eye will no=
t able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0R=
avana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2=A0mantra shakti he had acquired=
 through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would=
 fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2=A0command from his mind. S=
uch was the calibre of the enemy. 
=C2=A0
And Rama removed even=C2=A0his Ga=
yatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana=
 which=C2=A0means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a G=
od, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north=
 India goes crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?". 
=C2=A0
He=
 spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was there and =
seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.
=C2=A0
Thus ends my recounting of our fas=
cinating trip to Kasi.

Dear Narasimha
=C2=A0
It may sound=
 weird, but this is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all the=
se people are pieces in another kind of chess game. 
=C2=A0
Great analogy. =
Manish had given this analogy to us after he=C2=A0completed a beautiful=C2=
=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2=A0one divine chess player, and it=
 is totally His game. 
=C2=A0
Before I continue with the narration, I would=
 like to mention a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in =
my last mail:
=C2=A0

At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikar=
nika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish sud=
denly said, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a pu=
blic forum. Therefore my mails.
=C2=A0

Caveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is=
 an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, i=
n many paramparas it is said=C2=A0only someone who has a direct agya from S=
amshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya fro=
m a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=
=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts on=
e should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. 
=C2=A0

Many people have a=
 negative=C2=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due t=
o lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of thes=
e sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films e=
tc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly inc=
orrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts s=
tart with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the r=
each the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a=
 path. Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen pat=
h but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many gre=
at saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is con=
sidered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga =
Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are inten=
ded to give a first hand objective=C2=A0account of how a
 powerful sadhana =
in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.
=C2=A0
=

There are many people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, wh=
o feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go ab=
out it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2=A0people that these sadhana=
s can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Man=
ikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go a=
bout it and=C2=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything =
else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in =
whatever condition you are in right now=C2=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sa=
i Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is gen=
uine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangeme=
nts. This is the eternal promise to every individual=C2=A0because for Her, =
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2=A0kind.=C2=A0 In the intruduction t=
o "Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimalanada says :


"Publish this boo=

=C2=A0
Back to the narration. The s=
econd day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful =
night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this night which can=
 destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika al=
ong the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any of the mu=
ltitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighti=
ng among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was =
any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I =
knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, j=
ust at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who chased the d=
ogs away.=C2=A0Without looking at me=C2=A0Manish said, "Sometimes a simple =
prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breeches".
=C2=A0
=
As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2=A0I =
did not think too much about it then since my mind was already pre occupied=
 with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning when we again c=
ame to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my =
head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is=
 where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are still here. I w=
as little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swa=
mi was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=C2=A0Later on r=
eturning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person =
confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do=
 his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.
=C2=A0
Back to midnight. =
We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time w=
e did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitabl=
e chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respec=
tfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We sto=
od exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There=
 were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there ha=
s not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. =
Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my=
 right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull c=
ome and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull=
 looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go t=
o the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2=A0 but there is s=
omething else as well. I did not ask him what. So we
 went to another side.=
 The dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se =
chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the dome th=
en went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make space =
for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said=
 it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all=
 made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing oth=
ers not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very uniq=
ue about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but no=
t here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas =
have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have ei=
ther themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thus the=
y do not disturb. 
=C2=A0
The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre was larg=
er than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus was stro=
nger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten minutes a=
gain a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange because=
=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose this spe=
cific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense perc=
eption than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Every no=
w and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently for a=
 few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, every=
time Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the dogs =
too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt a bit=
 jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=C2=A0 - being suc=
h an=C2=A0ordinary person -=C2=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle=
 of the Chandi path=C2=A0I could hear
 chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and re=
latives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. 
=C2=A0
Suddenly to my=
 right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer burst=
ing. The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Go=
ddess was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursti=
ng of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Ch=
andi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages o=
f the=C2=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=
=C2=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. A=
nd the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back=
. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=
=C2=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to obse=
rve and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an ima=
gination but reality and this can=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in =
any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.
=C2=A0
While offer=
ing coconuts into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took=
 a long bamboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the =
coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past =
lives, because I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the =
domes do. I even wondered if=C2=A0there was any company which would may me =
for this kind of a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadh=
ana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=A0 Interestingly, I then remembere=
d that Manish had bought one extra coconut while buying the samagri to toni=
ght's homas. Now I understood why.
=C2=A0
In the middle of the homa, sudden=
ly Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=
=C2=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=
=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in th=
e night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to =
him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are onl=
y praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what=
 is going on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, h=
um log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit d=
own and continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish =
asked me to observe the skin on the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face=
 had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!
=C2=A0
There is a =
tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I =
could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or=
 do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they c=
ame to Manish and=C2=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish s=
aid ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won'=
t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to=
 the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manis=
h called the people and said, " Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam k=
ijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fir=
e. Then they wanted to touch=C2=A0Manish's feet, but Manish would not let t=
hem do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals =
we had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. Sudde=
nly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came
 =
running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. M=
anish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everyt=
hing is all right.=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of th=
e day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person =
suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous s=
aint)=C2=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query=
 asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manis=
h advised him to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the=
 ordinary people of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why ou=
r land and culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educated'=C2=A0people a=
re too rational to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalc=
ulating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately =
I felt as if my body existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothi=
ng
 below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on t=
hin=C2=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one wor=
d reply, "Good".
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
As we were walking back from Manikarn=
ika Manish suddenly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Man=
ikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but do=
es not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to=
 come and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, un=
less she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would n=
ot be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, whe=
n we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, l=
ooking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me =
that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the=
 samshan. "She has desire, but directionless. " At that time there was noth=
ing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing =
some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no go=
od,=C2=A0so that you are ready when
 Nature decides to give you a push. 
=
=C2=A0
After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and obs=
erved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, =
specially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0trip=
od. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if =
the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tou=
rists, wondering what is going on.
=C2=A0
Thus ended my second day of obser=
ving a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kash=
i.

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A bit about Baba&=
nbsp;Bhagwan Ram:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I had read the biography of =
Baba Bhagwan Ram when I visited Kasi in 2008. It is there that I read about=
 his meditating at the Manikarnika for 3 continuous days. He had left home =
at the age of about 11/12 ( from bihar - where he was born) to become a won=
dering monk and landed up in Kasi finally. When he came to Kasi he went to =
the Dasasmedha Ghat where he saw a lady - very well dress, decked in jewell=
ery - standing. The kind lady told him that she will take him to visit Vish=
wanath, but before that asked him to take a bath in the water. As he came o=
ut of the Ganges water he saw the lady had bought some milk, ghee, flowers =
and asked the young boy to accompany him as she lead him to the Kasi Vishwa=
nath temple. Once they reached the Shiva Linga, the lady instructed him how=
 to do Abhisekha of the Linga with the stuff she had bought. After coming o=
ut of the temple, the lady kept walking along the lanes - VIshwanath Gali -=
 with the 11 year old boy following
 her. Suddenly infront of a huge gate, =
they stopped and the lady went inside. Baba Bhagwan Ram thought it must be =
the house of some rich person, and preferred to stand outside waiting. Plus=
 that was his first day in Kasi, and he had neither any money for anything =
else with him. After waiting there for a few hours, when the lady did not c=
ome out, he decided to enter through the gates. Once inside he realized tha=
t it was not the house of a rich man but the famous Annapoorna temple. And =
there was no sign of that lady anywhere! Confused, he came out of the Vishw=
anath Gali into the main road, when he saw that lady standing there again. =
She called him and asked him, what does he want. Bhagwan Ram said he wanted=
 to realize God. The lady instructed him to go to the Kinnarama Ashram, say=
ing there are paramhamsas who live there, you will find guidance there. Dev=
otees of Baba Bhagwan Ram believe that lady was none other than Ma Annapurn=
a.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Later, he was instructed in many Aghor Sadh=
anas and spend years practising them. When he had been meditating at the Ma=
nikarnika for three days - he used to live on the samshan like an Aghori - =
around the age of 18/19 (I don't recollect exactly), he suddenly saw/felt/r=
ealized everything as millions of beautiful petals of concentric circl=
e around a centre. He chose a few of the petals and came back to his normal=
 senses again. After that, he said, any slight desire that would arise in t=
he mind would immediately manifest. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>With age,=
 Baba Bhagawan Ram toured all along India and even went abroad telling peop=
le about God realization and sadhana. He was the person who opened up the K=
innaram Ashram to ordinary people, before him the ashram never encouraged o=
rdinary visitor. Even today, if you go there you will hardly find not =
more than 5/6 people at any given time. But his idea was to let people=
 come in and meditate inside the ashram premises. He made all sadhakas of t=
he ashram promise to become vegetarians and not use alcohol. </DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>He died in 1990s (dont remember exact year). Some people co=
nsider him to be a reincarnation of Baba Kinnaram.</DIV>

IV>Namaste All,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While re reading my mails afte=
r I sent them to the list, I found many silly errors of spelling and gramme=
r. I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon su=
ch errors and read through them. As they say, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".</DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>During the day ti=
me, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never =
visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, "What about the temples? W=
on't we visit them?". Manish retorted immediately, " Aren't we go=
ing to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?"! I silently agreed. T=
his is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or =
standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temp=
le and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, "Th=
ere is something here."</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>During evening we went=
 to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=
 during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before ente=
ring Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish =
became silent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we medit=
ated for sometime, Manish did  pranam at the samadhi of Baba Bhag=
wan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered N=
irvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika=
 Samshan.  Manish, on being questioned, said that many sadhanas h=
ave been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desires=
. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram =
we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish =
called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English,=
 it read, "If you have to give your head
 off to get a sadguru, you have&nb=
sp;got it cheap".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>By 8 PM we sat for dinner. W=
e used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going t=
o the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing an=
y sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed.=
 There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/conc=
epts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subtl=
e body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to "digest" v=
arious experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni i=
s less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused =
on something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not fe=
el hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathar=
a Agni.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we sat eating our food and talking =
on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here i=
s a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha=
 and me) had before coming to Kasi. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Mani=
sh said, "It is the same set of souls who come back again and aga=
in in different bodies and personalities at different times, who are r=
esponsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Pri=
thviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc." He continued, "=
They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for the=
m to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land&nb=
sp;which we call India today.This land is connected to the Rishis. Thi=
s is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed. Prithviraj made=
 one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who m=
ade Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently contemplated her fate. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>"One very senior Rishi has decided to cha=
nge this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen. Ved =
;Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing, =
however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or group, can st=
and against the will of a Rishi."  Arunisha asked a pertinent question=
 here. "What were the Rishis doing for one thousand years?". Manish la=
ughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply in sa=
madhi, meditating. Then suddenly one day wake up from meditation&=
nbsp;and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone and all sorts of non-spiritual =
things going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create t=
he Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about what a Rishi can do. One =
Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child's play fo=
r Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so impo=
rtant to keep
 doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.</DIV>
<DIV> =
;</DIV>
<DIV>As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manika=
rnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika=
, for now. We walked long the deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if=
 it is ok doing a homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said yes w=
hy not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine =
feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of hi=
ghest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and =
mind such that it can hold shakti for which worshipping the divin=
e Mother is the best way. That is why Vimalananda says, "Let the Mothe=
r show you the face of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manis=
h said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exi=
sts powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahak=
ala sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then staring at the pitch black ganges,
 =
Manish chuckled lightly and added, "That man was something." This was again=
 an old conversation we had started before which Mainsh continued, "Al=
l these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand i=
nfornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowing through=
 them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of =
sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books are like a Bible for sadhak=
as, arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was po=
ssible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes it =
was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question is whethe=
r one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interestin=
gly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a ti=
me will come when his "children" would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not =
so. Who knows how deep things run. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We reached=
 the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place where =
we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body had=
 been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came a=
nd sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more. I=
n the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his palm upwards&nbs=
p;and with the next ahuti immediately the fire would leap higher. He d=
id this quite a few times, when the flames were getting weaker. I coun=
tinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when h=
e required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towards=
 us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahadev". =
This homa was faster. He did not use any "samputs", but a direct, straight =
Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushi=
ng around some of the coconut pieces to make them
 burn properly. I was enj=
oying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi=
 there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the =
Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old tim=
es, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary =
of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it=
 is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for the=
se sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many pe=
ople in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, ever=
yone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there=
 are people here even so late in the night.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>On=
ce the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa g=
ot over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, wa=
s superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expa=
nd across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I ha=
d to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating=
 for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still li=
ke a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That ma=
de him open his eyes. Manish remarked, " I could have just left my body and=
 gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or =
anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and=
 brought me back." Smiling he added, "What a sight it would have been for t=
he people to see, how the body can be left at will".  I did not know w=
hat to say. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We stood there watching another p=
yre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=
 red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick=
 inserted it (the bamboo stick) from the side of the corpse, lifting u=
p the burning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in th=
e middle of the pyre. The smooth motion of lifting up the half burnt t=
orso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick, into the thin, da=
rk, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - mea=
t or vegetables, both dead - from our plates to our mouths. Manis=
h asked me smiling, "Maza aya?". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he =
commented that I should write about this experience in the coming days=
. Let people know.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>By this time I remembered t=
hat when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog had run off =
with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! L=
eave the other chappal here as well." Manish said we had a rna with this sa=
mshan. We had been here before, in some life.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks) o=
f Shiva's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "safe"=
 samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The t=
rishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary dis=
turbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even at=
 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intention=
s are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.</DI=
V>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While walking along the ghats which were&nbs=
p;totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lu=
ngi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it with one hand and kep=
t moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I =
had got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint s=
mell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of s=
imilar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you ar=
e out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not mo=
ve too close to the water late in the nightt. There are things in the =
water. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The prote=
ction of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya =
Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Gan=
ges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would =
roam around
 naked. It is their city.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Next mor=
ning, as we sat recollecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked about=
 Vedas. Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths =
of Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must g=
et the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I enqu=
ired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be don=
e before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish laughed and rep=
lied, "Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!". =
I was dumbstruck. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While talking about Ra=
mayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became=
 slow and heavy, "The color of Rama's body is deep blue with a golden =
tinge all around him. Like a sun blazing. That was the kavacha gi=
ven to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It w=
as impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands =
is so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he=
 had destroyed a forest of Ashuras. Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. I=
t was a mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had =
become part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at t=
he slightest command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy.=
 </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>And Rama removed even his Gayatri Kavac=
ha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which =
;means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and fou=
ght like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India goes=
 crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?". </DIV>
<DIV> </D=
IV>
<DIV>He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was=
 there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Great a=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Before I continu=
e with the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I =
had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI=
>At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were=
 standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the co=
ming days you will write about this experience in a public forum. Therefore=
 my mails.</LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI><B>Caveat</B>: A homa on a =
funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor sadhana, and it is not entirely risk =
free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said only someone who has a dir=
ect agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone w=
ho has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (gi=
ving ahutis) I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading t=
his accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. </LI></UL>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>Many people have a negative bias towards Agh=
or sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or understa=
nding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent=
 time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them a=
s perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what =
they are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved bia=
ses. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-real=
ization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don't=
. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a h=
ealthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants =
have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9=
 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimala=
nada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand
 objec=
tive account of how a powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. No=
thing more. I am just the cronicler.</LI></UL>
<DIV> </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>T=
here are many people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who =
feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go abou=
t it. These accounts are ment to tell such people that these sadhanas =
can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manik=
arnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go abo=
ut it and actually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything el=
se in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in wh=
atever condition you are in right now and let Nature decide. Like Sai =
Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is genui=
ne and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangement=
s. This is the eternal promise to every individual because for Her, NO=
THING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so kind.  In the intruduction to =
"Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimalanada says :</LI></UL>

<DIV>Back to the narration. The second da=
y was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night fo=
r chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this night which can destroy=
 Ashuras. Past midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along the =
ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitude =
of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among=
 each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any alte=
rnate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I knew and=
 praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at t=
hat moment we saw a man coming from the other side who chased the dogs away=
. Without looking at me Manish said, "Sometimes a simple prayer c=
an work wonders but never become to big for your breeches".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful =
place. I did not think too much about it then since my mind was alread=
y pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning w=
hen we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a p=
ressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me an=
d said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are s=
till here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi o=
f Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.&n=
bsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras an=
d that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lali=
ta Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was=
 filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, a=
nd Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people st=
arted staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through =
to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish o=
bserving the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is=
 said in thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there h=
as not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans=
 in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when=
 suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I=
 did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice=
 my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not=
 only the bull,  but there is something else as well. I did not ask hi=
m
 what. So we went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to=
 Manish, "Baba,aap log kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish i=
ndicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people stan=
ding around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from th=
