 2-2-46 Morning

A visitor told Bhagavan that he was working for Harijan up=
lift, that he and
his co-workers in the cause had darshan of Mahatma Gandhi=
 and got his
blessings, that Mahatma Gandhi told them that if they could br=
ing about
marriages between Harijan girls and higher caste gentlemen, such =
marriages
would have his blessings; and that he (visitor) would like to hav=
e
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s views in the matter.

Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CIf Mahat=
ma Gandhi has said so, we will all hear what he has
said. What more is ther=
e for us to do? He is a distinguished man and is
working in that field.What=
 have we to do with that?=E2=80=9D

Turning to us, Bhagavan added,=E2=80=9C=
If I open my mouth, something will appear in
the papers that so-and-so has =
also said such-and-such a thing. The next day
there will be people to criti=
cise it. Our business is to keep quiet. If we
enter into all these, people =
will naturally ask, and justifiably, =E2=80=98Why is he
interfering in all =
these instead of keeping quiet?=E2=80=99

Similarly if Mahatma Gandhi keeps=
 quiet leaving aside all his
activities,they will ask, =E2=80=98Why is he k=
eeping quiet instead of engaging in
all these activities?=E2=80=99 He must =
do what he has come for. We must do what we
have come for.=E2=80=9D
