I have listened to many folks talking about Kundalini, Yoga, different
pra=
ctices and rituals, et al, but in all truth none of it interests me,
and th=
ese things just happen anyway, I never found that they needed any
help :- )=
  Yes, the Self realisation in that timeless mode was
fascinating and illum=
inating, but I was not looking for it or expecting
anything, it just happen=
ed, I did not have to do anything. But the only
experience I found (twenty =
years later) which was better than that was
when the self and all the parts=
 of ones being resonated with all the
stuff in the world in a kind of dance=
, a different kind of union. The
self realisation event was a re-union with=
 the SELF but the second one
was a union with everything. But I don't know =
why it is but folks
don't seem to describe these experiences in detail. May=
be they are
not interested. Or maybe they have not known them.  I think the=
y are
worth documenting for the record of human experience.
