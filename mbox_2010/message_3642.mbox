Namaste,
=C2=A0
Same way.=
 How does one decide if one is hallucinating or not? By checking on other c=
orresponding things. See if you meet someone in reality vs you hallucinate,=
 the hallucination is something restricted ONLY to your mind, whereas the a=
ctual meeting will have added factors to it, which are=C2=A0not from=C2=A0w=
ithin your body/mind.
=C2=A0
For example, one day Manish was doing a Ganapa=
ti homam. There were some people sitting near him and watching. At the end =
of the homa, Manish asked one specific person from the=C2=A0 group about wh=
at he saw during the homa. The person replied, he saw a form of=C2=A0a huge=
 elephant, "shendri"=C2=A0color enter the fire for a fraction of a second.=
=C2=A0 Then Manish asked another person from the group about his reaction. =
This person said that he did not see anything but he suddenly felt his mind=
 being drawn inside deeper, such that he could not stop his meditation. As =
if there was some huge force nearby and it was pulling him. Then Manish sai=
d, Ganapati had come into the fire and exactly at that time one person saw =
the elephant and another felt=C2=A0the strong force. Also some more things =
happened in the coming days which confirmed=C2=A0that it was the real stuff=
. 
=C2=A0
My=C2=A0point is, in case it is a pure hallucination of the mind,=
 you will not get simultaneous associated factors happening outside your bo=
dy/mind which will imapct a third party. The above was just one small examp=
le.=C2=A0Hope you get the drift of what I am trying to say.

Dear Rajarshi,=
 


Your analogy is good. But what about case of hallucination. How can we =
know if something is not real in this case?


Thanks,

Dear Jitender,
=C2=A0
If these things shap=
e our visulaisations then what is the difference between this sort of visua=
lisation/ hallucination and the DARSHAN of deity.
=C2=A0
Suppose you have a=
 friend named X. When you meet him, you know it for sure that that IS X sta=
nding infront of you. At home if by chance you are thinking about X, you fo=
rm a mental image of the him but you know for sure that this is just your m=
ental image. What is the difference between the mental image of X and the r=
eal X? Think along these lines. Similar maybe the difference between having=
 a full darshan of a detiy and imagining a deity mentally. The "energy" wou=
ld be different. The interaction would be different. The "feeling" would be=
 different. Also there maybe other phenomenon outside of your body that may=
 happen when you meet your friend X or have darshan of a deity, which you m=
ake you think that it is not something you have mentally created.

 On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling wit=
h renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we =
were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my min=
d was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3=
) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on =
a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would=
 get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonder=
ful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - so tha=
t he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, =
I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly=
 reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a =
feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experienci=
ng intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially
> in/around th=
e abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as e=
quanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon=
 after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind,=
 and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental im=
agery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a fr=
iend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I t=
hink of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went a=
way saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 th=
ings and in addition he bought some ghee.

> It was my first time =
at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dea=

ut soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunse=
t time), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the=
 friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaa=
sana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that=
 I would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something'=
 happens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid d=
escription in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so=
 I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!=

fast. I continued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centre=

'mangalmayee' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/exc=

not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the=
 truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I hav=

<DIV>Same way. How does one decide if one is hallucinat=
ing or not? By checking on other corresponding things. See if you meet some=
one in reality vs you hallucinate, the hallucination is something restricte=
d ONLY to your mind, whereas the actual meeting will have added factors to =
it, which are not from within your body/mind.</DIV>
<DIV> </=
DIV>
<DIV>For example, one day Manish was doing a Ganapati homam. There wer=
e some people sitting near him and watching. At the end of the homa, Manish=
 asked one specific person from the  group about what he saw during th=
e homa. The person replied, he saw a form of a huge elephant, "shendri=
" color enter the fire for a fraction of a second.  Then Manish a=
sked another person from the group about his reaction. This person said tha=
t he did not see anything but he suddenly felt his mind being drawn inside =
deeper, such that he could not stop his meditation. As if there was some hu=
ge force nearby and it was pulling him. Then Manish said, Ganapati had come=
 into the fire and exactly at that time one person saw the elephant and ano=
ther felt the strong force. Also some more things happened in the comi=
ng days which confirmed that it was the real stuff. </DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>My point is, in case it is a pure hallucination of the min=
d, you will not get simultaneous associated factors happening outside your =
body/mind which will imapct a third party. The above was just one small exa=
mple. Hope you get the drift of what I am trying to say.</DIV>

<DIV>Suppose you have a friend=

ers,<BR>> <BR>> After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this =
note to share an experience with the members on this forum - hoping that do=
ing so would elicit some
 feedback in the form of further guidance. <BR>>=
; <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I am a student of Vipassana and have been doin=
g homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a simple version of Dur=
ga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And I have been reading the po=
sts on this forum with much awe and interest. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <B=
R>> On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggli=
ng with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. Wh=
en we were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, =
my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai -=
 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Hom=
am on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I=
 would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how =
wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - =
so that he would
 also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immedi=
ately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I =
quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do =
such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started exp=
eriencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially<BR>>=
 in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the se=
nsations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would =
change'. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level=
 of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in=
 my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so=
 I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery =
(now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - =
and he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with t=
he above 2
 things and in addition he bought some ghee. <BR>> <BR>> <=
BR>> <BR>> It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the ver=
y first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was=
 a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (b=
y my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in t=
he direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and =
sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew=
 to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and reques=
ted them to let me know if 'something' happens. I had already observed a br=
own colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi's notes) as we=
 reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to =
behave a little differently (silly me!!):). <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>=
> I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, =
the
 Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very=
 first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am us=
ed to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I cont=
inued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I =
remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pure=
st intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and foun=
d the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates=
 some 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee=
' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too =
in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to =
give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa, =
I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done<BR>&g=
t; homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have
 b=
elieved and still believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/ nu=
llification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the sam=
e speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind=
 that I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya an=
d his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa,=
 so please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. =
Please pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". <BR>> <=
BR>> <BR>> <BR>> After this mental dialogue, I though of invoking =
Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kal=
i etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortab=
le with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the=
 same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which Devi form I invoke=
. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a
 cloud-li=
ke pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I thou=
ght of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gang=
rene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was different, and imm=
ediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colour with the colou=
r of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) and=
 I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did men=
tal Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desire=
 and surrendering of<BR>> my ignorance. I sought permission from the dei=
ty to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remember clearly,=
 that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give=
 me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punis=
h me in any way for doing this.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I had a =
small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him
 about what I w=
as going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. <BR=
>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> And then I started my mantra chanting (wit=
h swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre.=
 I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still co=
ntinued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switc=
hed to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully=
 aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad's funeral. Som=
etimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was=
 crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or=
 a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which wa=
s opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little=
 curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere ar=
ound. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I
 was not disappointed, =
but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite th=
e deity, but nevertheless I<BR>> continued. Few minutes later, I heard s=
ome sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen=
 (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). =
It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a gra=
veyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall=
. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving aroun=
d the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral an=
d die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because i=
t was amused with the fire particles (which looked like 'jugnus') falling d=
own on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof o=
f the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myse=
lf, thinking a black hen came instead of a
 dog, but nevertheless I said I =
would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he s=
aid 30 more minutes. So I<BR>> continued the mental chanting. <BR>> <=
BR>> <BR>> <BR>> And then my cousin signalled me that it was time =
for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the e=
xit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet i=
tself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my i=
mpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three tim=
es, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonderi=
ng how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? =
Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry =
up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen ex=
actly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyo=
ne to know that I had 'Aghori'
 tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied=
 the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again=
 for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw=
 it at the funeral<BR>> pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again a=
nd requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (includ=
ing the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined=
 the group. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> When I was washing my hands=
 and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red ting=
e to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame=
 seeds or jaggery??). <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> On the way back h=
ome and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would=
'nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what hap=
pened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinkin=
g about 'it'. There was
 a certian stillness within my existence that eveni=
ng. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, jus=
t a sense of 'wonder'. The visualisations could have been a product of my o=
wn imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence w=
as the most beautiful thing. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> The next d=
ay, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but =
the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my bro=
ther was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; <BR>> <BR>> Now that it is few days since that incident, I have q=
uestions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumpin=
g 'madly' around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fa=
ct that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Sha=
kti really grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualis=
e my dad crawl
 and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-const=
ructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? <BR>&=
gt; <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I am not sure if these questions can be answ=
ered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the above experienc=
e, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most ap=
preciative.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Thank you PVR/Manish and Raj=
arshi for the continued inspiration. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Al=
so, apologies for the length of the note.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>>=
