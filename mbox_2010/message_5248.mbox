Namaste Bhupendra Ji and friends,

>As for Utpal Ji, rather than going to s=
uch puja's and getting >boiled up, the best would be to turn down your fire=
nds invitation >to attend the puja...I mean, after you have been through it=
 once, >why go there again?

Since you have asked me directly here, i must =
clarify...

I wasn't boiled up but i was amused and laughing inside. i said=
 i had a very hard time to control because it is against my prakruti to lis=
ten to false things for long time and keep quite. and i really kept quite a=
nd hence i had a tough time.

I turned down the invitation very strongly tw=
ice giving few reasons. Actually one more invitation for same Damodar Pujan=
 (by an ISCKON devotee) came to me 3 days back from one more friend. but i =
wanted to do Homam and hence i turned down several times and did not go the=
re.

I turned down the 2nd invitation came from another friend yesterday. b=
ut today he and his wife called me again and their insistence was so much t=
hat i finally gave in. actually i thought that Damodar Krishna himself is c=
alling so many times then if i don't go then its like rejecting the call of=
 Baby Krishna (pl. dont laugh and take me wrong here- i actually thought th=
at way).

BUT it is a good lesson. Not that I start hating them or somethin=
g like that. actually Homam and My Guru's influence has almost removed feel=
ing of Hatred from my heart but Yes I've decided now that whenever any ISCK=
ON devotee or anybody in future gives such speech and i am present there I'=
ll not keep quite. I'll engage him/her in arguments and at least try to cre=
ate sufficient doubt in his/her heart for their belief system injected by I=
SCKON. I'll try to create doubt for his/her fanaticism and I think that is =
why Lord Krishna pulled me there. Every incident has a meaning.

***

I als=
o request friends to remove feeling of hatred or even anger for such people=
/organisation/concepts. Yes but surely try to tear-apart such belief system=
 of Fanatiscism whenever get in to such situation. even if a Single person =
is turned away from such wrong thoughts, will be beneficial for many. But i=
t is also very good to appreciate a genuinely devoted Krishna Bahkta from I=
SKCON to do more and more Bhakti for beloved Krishna while always standing =
up against their attitude towards other Gods.

***

Some times such discuss=
ions are necessary and they are out of spontenity and not by design. Truth =
sometimes creates uncomfortable situations and many sparks comes out in suc=
h threads occasionaly which may make a group look like an aggressive and in=
tolerable etc...but that doesn't matter. on the contrary i take it as a hea=
lthy sign. The Truth must be told sometimes frankly and who knows what purp=
ose it may serve in future.

***
I sincerely wish that one day differences =
of Vaishnava & Shaivaite, Brahmins and Non-Brahmins etc... are completely g=
one from Vedic Dharma.
***
I wish to conclude here. I have got my light on =
the subject and  would not write anything else in this thread now.

Best Re=
gards,

Utpal





The goal should not be to just speak truth. The goal sho=
uld be to speak truth
*purposefully*.
