This purush is known by follower of Shiva as Adi Shiva, Vaistav call MahaVi=
shnu, Shakto calls Adi Shakti, Islam calls Allah, Christine call God. Thy i=
s Nirvikalp/Nirakar, uniform all places always exists regardless to time an=
d space universe. Prakruti is Maya, one which makes us feel different but a=
t ultimate condition all is one, point of Cingularity. nothing is different=
 at this point. I becomes you becomes the universe. that is real I the Aham=
. Shivo Aham, Shivo Aham.
