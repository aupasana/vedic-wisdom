Great.  A murti of any size (idol) o=
f the diety is preferred during the
homam but a picture will do as well in =
case you don't have one.  As far
as I know the shivalingam is not required =
as part of the homam but do
worship it on a regular basis now that you have=
 it.

Normally, dhoop should burn on its own and should not get extinguished.=
 
Maybe the dhoop is not of very good quality or has gone dry or perhaps
yo=
u are not lighting a big enough portion initially that it gets
extinguished=
 after a while.  Experiment with different brands or
techniques of lighting=
 to see what works.  Alternatively, use incense
sticks (Agarbatti) and they=
 should not have this problem.

Camphor burns very =
quickly so you need to be careful in handling it.  I
normally light the ghe=
e lamp with matchstick first and then I place a
small piece of camphor on w=
ooden ladle, at the edge, and bring it near
the ghee lamp flame so that the=
 camphor catches fire and then after
showing it to the diety as offering yo=
u can place it in the homam to
start the fire.  The size sold in stores can=
 be used as is but note that
Camphor leaves no residue but does give out a =
black carbon smoke so the
amount that you want to use is a function of the =
amount required to
start the fire vs. any smoke restrictions in your place.=
   In my case, I
take 1/2 of the size commercially sold to start the Homam =
fire and you
may want to experiment a few times to right size it to your ne=
eds.

> 3. Is 'turmeric powder' the same thing as ground turmeric, the spic=

Yes, but keep the one used for Homam separate from t=

cooking.

This is a go=
od question.  I recently had a group of friends who were
both non-vegetaria=
n go on a pigrimage and one of the friends who did ate
meat 24 hours prior =
to the pilgrimage was making fun of the other who
ate meat about 12 hours b=
efore.  So which one is more devout or pious is
a relative question.  At a =
minimum don't have eggs, meat, and seafood on
the day you do Homam which is=
 from one Sunrise to the next.

A mudra is usually a hand gesture which has a specific me=
aning.  There
are several types of Dhenu mudras out there.  One form is als=
o called
Surabhi Mudra and you can see the instructions below.  There is a =
You
Tube video also for another type.

<http://www.yo=
utube.com/watch?v=3Draj5q2U8C9c>

I cannot tell you what Navadana is but if=
 it is vegetarian and does not
contain any spices and you strongly believe =
that there was a reason you
purchased it and it is fit to be offered to a d=
iety then you can use a
small portion in your offering in the fire.   If yo=
u have some doubt on
any of these then play it safe and use only the ingred=
ients listed on
Narasimhaji's website.

> 6. I bought three dried coconut h=
alves today. Roughly how many of
> these rituals can I expect this supply t=
o last?


For a small homam such as Mahaganapati homam 0.5 to 0.75 of a who=
le
coconut may be sufficient (cut into pieces of 1-2 inches each) whereas
f=
or bigger homams such as Vishnu Sahasranaama 0.75 to 1.0 coconut is
require=
d and for Chandi Homam usually 1.5 to 2 whole coconuts are
required.   Agai=
n, these are my personal experiences and you have to try
on your own and se=
e what works.  If you plan to do Homam on a regular
basis you will need mor=
e dry coconuts for sure.  If you have a wood
firelplace in your home or are=
 able to do homam in the open you could
consider wood also instead of cocon=
uts but if you are doing this inside
of the house then coconut is better.  =
Try to do a couple of dry runs to
build confidence and get a hang of things=
.

> 7. When the instructions say "You can offer just a raisin or a little
=
> sugar also," how much is "a little?" A pinch? A teaspoon?


I usually off=
er anywhere from 2-3 rasins each time I make an offering. 
In the Poorna Aa=
huti you can put 5 or more depending on the size of your
homam.  Similarly =
for sugar a pinch is good enough  (quantity which can
be captured between y=
our right hand ring finger, middle finger, and
thumb)

> 8. Is there ever a=
 problem, when offering ghee onto an open flame with
> a wooden spoon, of t=
he spoon catching fire?


No, I have never experienced that.  It should be =
a non-issue as long as
you are putting a limited quantity of ghee (anywhere=
 from 2-10 drops per
offering)


> Also, just kind of general questions abo=
ut a few things:

> 9. I have a copper bracelet with Sanskrit lettering on =
it reading "OM
> Namah Sivaya." I have been normally wearing this on my lef=
t wrist,
since
> that is where it feels natural to do so. Is that where suc=
h are
normally
> worn?


I cannot say much on this except that the left sid=
e of your body is the
Moon channel which is cool and both copper and Shiva =
are associated with
the Sun channel.  If you are wearing it on the left sid=
e and it feels
good then perhaps you needed to fire up your left hand side.=
  Try to
flip the wrist and see how you feel.

> 10. OOC, where it says "Th=
e rakshaa (holy ash) can be mixed with a
drop of
> ghee and applied on the =
forehead as a dot or a line,"
> do I remember correctly that it is traditio=
nal for Saivites to use
three
> horizontal lines on the forehead instead of=
 the single dot? Or is that
a
> misunderstanding? And if that is the case, =
what is the symbolism
there?


Based on my limited understanding, the Homam=
 ash is energized with the
mantras and the presence of the diety whom you i=
nvoked into the fire and
taking a portion of that offering and putting in o=
n your forehead is to
gain both protection (tilaka) as well as to ask for b=
lessings to open
the third eye of wisdom.
