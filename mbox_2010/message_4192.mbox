=C2=A0 



The king =
of Kasi welcomed Sankara and offered royal comforts in his palace for his s=
tay.Sankara said that such a stay is not for ascetics and he requested him =
to make a small dwelling on the banks of Ganga for the stay of his disciple=
s and himself.He also declined any food offering stating that they would ta=
ke food only on alms.=C2=A0

Sankara used to teach the disciples from Kasi =
and also to those who came with him from Naramada country.After early morni=
ng bath, he expounded teachings of Vedas and Upanishads and also the atma v=
ichara. Then he and his disciples would go for bhiksha.This Satsangh was go=
ing on for some time. Then in the same period, he composed Sri Annapurna As=
htakam and Sri Kasi Viswanatha Ashtakam. Nityanandakari Varabhayakari Sound=
arya Ratnakari... ... Gangadharanga kamaneeya Jadakalabam. .....

There in =
Kasi, one miracle also took place upon Sankara. He had his early morning ba=
th and was returning in one of the bylanes to his residence. He found an ou=
tcaste, a dog eater, smelling of toddy all over his body, in tattered cloth=
es, without any bath for days, holding a oozing toddy leather pouch on his =
shoulders, -- coming on the opposite direction. There was no space to go fo=
r both, without brushing on each other. Some stories say that even wife of =
outcaste,came with him.=C2=A0

Sankara says: Andhi vesha dharam dhrushtva g=
acha gacha idhi cha abravit.... O outcaste! Move away! Move away!

The outc=
aste asks Sankara:

1. O noble among the brahmins! Whom do you want to move=
 away? Is it one body which is made up of food to the other body which is a=
lso made up of food? Or, should the Chaitanya in me move away from the Chai=
tanya that is in you?

2. Is there any difference between the Sun that is r=
eflecting on Ganga and the ditch water that is near my home? Is the Space t=
hat is within a gold vessel, different from the Space that is within a mud =
pot? Wherefrom do you get the delusion, in the all-expanding Pure Space whi=
ch is the waveless Ocean of Bliss, as between a brahmin and a dog eating ou=
t caste?=C2=A0

Sankara thought for a second about this mind-blowing questi=
on! He meditated and looked in front and could see Siva and Uma,smiling. Si=
va was holding the leash of four dogs! He looked in the form of Kalabairava=
!

Sankara then sang in a cry:=C2=A0

3. That eternal Pure Awareness, which=
 is the Witness of wakeful, dreaming and deep sleep states, which is in all=
 souls from an ant to Brahma, as the sphurna, as I,I,I.., the One who is ha=
ving this stable Atmajnana, he is my Guru regardless of whether he is a bra=
hmin or an outcaste!=C2=A0

4.I am Brahman.This entire universe is the expa=
nsion of this one Brahman-consciousne ss.I am unaware of this only due to m=
y sattvic,rajas and tamas characteristics which produce this ignorance=C2=
=A0and I am deluded into thinking that all un-Brahman are Brahman. All thes=
e are delusions. There is one Pure Awareness which is Brahman and this is a=
ll pervading. One who is having this stable Brahma Jnana, he is my Guru, re=
gardless of whether he is a brahmin or an outcaste!

5. With Guru's Upadesa=
, my determination that this entire universe is perishable will be strength=
ened. With that non vacillating mind,I shall meditate on Brahman and burn m=
y past and future karmas in that Pure Awareness.=C2=A0I shall leave this bo=
dy to the current,Prarabdha Karma and remain unmoving. This is my convictio=
n.=C2=A0

(The Prayatna Mahavakyam, the great saying for practise, is menti=
oned here: I am Brahman. Aham Brahmasmi.)

6.That Pure Awareness which stay=
 in the Heart of men and animals and devas, as I,I,I,; in whose effulgence =
the solid non-shining mind, senses, body, knowledge, shines;the Awareness w=
hich is hidden by ignorance like Sun hidden by clouds, The yogi meditates u=
pon and remains in peace.=C2=A0He is my Guru. This is my conviction.

(This=
 is the great saying for experience. Anubhava Mahavakyam.Tatvam Asi. You ar=
e That.)

7. From this great ocean of bliss, even Indra and Devas get satis=
fied by taking a droplet.The peaceful Sages feel completion. The One who ha=
s merged into that ocean of biss, Brahman, will become Brahman.=C2=A0Who ev=
er is such a realized Sage, his feet are to be worshipped even by Indra. Th=
is is my conviction.

This is the famous Maneesha Panchakam.=C2=A0The whole=
 thing is a play for the sake of the seekers. Even though casteism and unto=
uchability were rampant in Sankara's days, one cannot think that Sankara ha=
d such a feeling of separateness.

Maneesha means, my conviction.
