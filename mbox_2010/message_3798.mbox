 Mastan himself had passed away in 1931, and he had received little more
th=
an passing mentions in the ashram books I had read. He was present on the
f=
amous occasion when the ashram was robbed in 1924, and also on the occasion=

when the golden mongoose visited Bhagavan at Skandashram.

Below relevant =
information is from Sadhu Om=E2=80=99s Tamil account of Akhilandamma.

Mast=
an, is a weaver who made the cloth for Bhagavan=E2=80=99s clothes, was born=
 in
1878 in Desur, a small village about forty miles from Tiruvannamalai. H=
e
came from a Muslim family but was drawn to Bhagavan by Akhilandamma, a wi=
dow
of the village who made regular trips to Tiruvannamalai to see Bhagavan=
 and
cook for him. A document preserved in the shrine where Mastan is burie=
d
states that at a very early age he would spontaneously fall into a
samadh=
i-like state while he was working on the family loom. His hands and
feet, w=
hich were plying the machinery of his trade, would stop and he would
become=
 absolutely still. His parents, Hussain and Salubi, thought that he
was fal=
ling asleep on the job. Whenever they saw him in this condition, they
would=
 hit him, bring him back to his waking state, and tell him to get on
with h=
is work. These episodes seem to have been a recurring feature of his
childh=
ood. The notebook in which this story is recorded says the =E2=80=98he plun=
ged
into jnana=E2=80=99 on these occasions, making it clear that they were =
not just
fainting fits.

Mastan himself made no mention of these dramatic e=
xperiences when he
described his early years:

I came under the spell of bh=
akti before the age of twenty. During the
Muharram festival I would put on =
the garb of a pandaram [a Saiva monk],
smear vibhuti on myself, carry a beg=
ging bowl and roam around.

I discovered and read the verses of Gunagudi Ma=
stan [a Muslim saint who
probably lived during the early 19th century]. It =
occurred to me that at the
following Muharram festival I should dress up as=
 a pandaram and sing these
verses. I obtained a copy of this book, read the=
 portion entitled =E2=80=98Ecstatic
Joy=E2=80=99 and tried to learn it by h=
eart.

While I was doing this, it occurred to me that I should never again =
put on
this pandaram outfit.

=E2=80=98It is of no use,=E2=80=99 I thought.=
 =E2=80=98I should, instead, seek liberation.=E2=80=99

For one year after =
this decision I didn=E2=80=99t sleep either during the day or the
night. Mo=
st of the time I was going through Gunagudi Mastan=E2=80=99s verses. I also=

went through the poems and songs of Thayumanavar and Pattinathar.

There i=
s one verse of Gunagudi Mastan that says: =E2=80=98O mind, is it possible t=
o
speak of the misery and desolation experienced by those who get wedded to=

women?=E2=80=99

This impressed me very much. There would be no marriage f=
or me. When I
became aware that my elder brothers, who were employed in the=
 army, were
making arrangements to get me married, I shuddered.

At the age=
 of fifteen I lost my father, and when I was twenty-five my mother
died. Af=
ter these deaths I gave up the family weaving business. I had a Rs
100 debt=
 from this work, but a devotee paid it off for me, freeing me from
this occ=
upation.


This is how Mastan described the meeting when he spoke to Kunju =
Swami:

When I came to Bhagavan, he was seated like a rock=E2=80=A6. [His u=
nwavering gaze]
was filled with grace, compassion and steady wisdom. I stoo=
d by his side.
After giving me a look, he opened the gate of my Heart and I=
 was also
established in his state. I stood like that for eight hours, abso=
lutely
without fatigue, but filled with total absorption and peace. Bhagava=
n in
those days used to open our Heart with a simple gracious look, and it
=
transformed us. There was no need for any questions since he made us, by hi=
s
look, like himself.

Akhilanda=
mma describes how they(Mastan) used to come to Tiruvannamalai
together:


M=
astan and I would come to Arunachala from our village to have the pleasure
=
of serving Bhagavan. Mastan, a weaver, belonged to our village, but he did
=
not stick to his craft. A man of whims, he would suddenly suspend his
weavi=
ng and go to live with Bhagavan for months on end. During this time he
woul=
d keep his body and soul together on alms that he begged.

In those early d=
ays we had no buses. I would make a bundle of provisions,
such as rice and =
pulses, and put them on his head. Loaded in this way, we
would start on our=
 journey of forty miles to Arunachala. We would walk
slowly and leisurely, =
telling each other stories of Bhagavan.

Mastan occasionally made towels an=
d kaupinas and offered them to Bhagavan,
who accepted them with deep regard=
.

Bhagavan once remarked, with great joy, =E2=80=98Mastan=E2=80=99s craft,=
 though it did not
give food either to him or his parents, gives me clothes=
=E2=80=99.


On full moon nights we would go round the hill in the divine c=
ompany of
Bhagavan. In those days there would be about ten of us =E2=80=93 =
Perumal, Mastan and
a few others. On those moonlit nights we would walk in =
rapture, forgetting
the entire universe, except for the sacred mountain. I =
don=E2=80=99t think those
enchanting days will ever come again!

On one of =
those occasions Mastan began to sing at the top of his voice. I
had never h=
eard him singing so loudly.

=E2=80=98Mastan, what happened to you today?=
=E2=80=99 asked Bhagavan as soon as the
pradakshina was over. =E2=80=98You =
never ever sing, so why did you sing like that?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It was n=
othing,=E2=80=99 replied Mastan, casually. =E2=80=98Perumal instructed me t=
hat I
had to sing in order to ward off your drowsiness. To raise my spirits=
 and to
equip me for the job, he made me take a drink containing ganja.=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98So that=E2=80=99s what happened. Ganja intoxication was be=
hind your wild singing.
How many times have I told you that I need no exter=
nal help to keep me
awake? Also, I have told you before not to do anything =
for my sake. Don=E2=80=99t
listen to other people who tell you differently.=
=E2=80=99

Though Bhagavan rebuked Mastan in this way, I don=E2=80=99t thin=
k he took the
criticism very seriously. Mastan was a very innocent man, and=
 events like
this didn=E2=80=99t touch him.


I remember one incident that =
took place when Bhagavan lived at Skandashram.
A golden mongoose entered th=
e ashram premises and made straight for
Bhagavan. It sat on his lap for a w=
hile. Later, it wandered around and
closely inspected all the different par=
ts of the cave. When the inspection
was over, it disappeared into the bushe=
s on the hill. While all this was
happening, Mastan was the only devotee wi=
th Bhagavan.

Some time later Perumal came back to the ashram and Mastan to=
ld him about
the visit of the mongoose. One can get a glimpse of Mastan=E2=
=80=99s state of mind
at the time from the remarks he made.

=E2=80=98I was=
 afraid that the mongoose might harm our peacocks,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=
=98so I
kept myself ready in case it made an attack. I had a big stick hand=
y.
Fortunately, it moved away without making any move towards the peacocks.=
=E2=80=99

Perumal told him, =E2=80=98Mastan, you should have caught it. If=
 you had managed to
capture it, we could have brought it up here and kept i=
t as a pet.=E2=80=99

Bhagavan was listening to this conversation.

Address=
ing Mastan, he said, =E2=80=98Whom do you think he was? Do you think you
co=
uld have caught him, and do you think that this other man could have
domest=
icated him? This was a sage of Arunachala who took on this form to
come and=
 visit me. He wanted to pay his respects to me. How many times have
I told =
you that sages come to see me in various forms?=E2=80=99

Mastan never told=
 me about this mongoose. Bhagavan himself mentioned the
incident to me on o=
ne of my later visits.

Source: (=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by Akhi=
landamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982,
pp. 5-9)


Mastan continued to visit=
 Bhagavan throughout the 1920s, although his visits
were less frequent than=
 in earlier years. He was present in Ramanasramam,
along with a small numbe=
r of other devotees, on a famous occasion in 1924
when Bhagavan was attacke=
d by a gang of robbers who were under the mistaken
impression that a large =
amount of money was kept there.

Bhagavan received a severe blow on his leg=
 during the robbery, but in a
characteristic response he told the robbers, =
=E2=80=98If you are not satisfied, you
may strike the other leg also=E2=80=
=99.

Ramakrishna Swami, one of the devotees present, was so outraged by th=
e
assault on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s person, he took up an iron bar with the int=
ention of
attacking the intruders.

Bhagavan restrained him, saying, =E2=80=
=98Let these robbers play their role. We
shall stick to ours. Let them do w=
hat they like. It is for us to bear and
forbear. Let us not interfere with =
them.=E2=80=99

Mastan appeared to follow Bhagavan=E2=80=99s advice during =
this attack since there
is no record of him reacting in any way to the viol=
ent invasion. In one of
his rare recorded statements, Mastan is reported to=
 have said, =E2=80=98Even if the
sky falls on your head, or even if a sword=
 is firmly driven through your
chest, do not slip from your true state.=E2=
=80=99 The final clause, which can
equally well be translated as =E2=80=98d=
o not get agitated=E2=80=99, seems to sum up
Mastan=E2=80=99s response to t=
his event.

Akhilandamma rushed to Tiruvannamalai when she heard the news. =
This is her
report of how Bhagavan reacted to the assault:

What one could =
not imagine had happened: Bhagavan was beaten up by thieves.
The news took =
wing and many like me ran to the ashram in great anxiety.

Seeing me Bhagav=
an expressed surprise and said, =E2=80=98Oh, Desuramma, you have
come as we=
ll. Kunju Swami is telling the story over there. Go and listen.=E2=80=99

I=
t was as though Bhagavan had directed some children to go and listen to a
s=
tory that was being told some distance away. I learned that Bhagavan had
ap=
pointed Kunju Swami to relate all the incidents surrounding the robbery.
Fr=
om his reaction I gathered that the persistent questioning by devotees
anno=
yed Bhagavan more than even the beatings of the thieves.

Sitting at the fe=
et of Bhagavan and stroking the wounded leg, I expressed
surprise and sorro=
w, saying, =E2=80=98How unjust! What injustice!=E2=80=99

Bhagavan contradi=
cted me. =E2=80=98What injustice is there in this? As you feed me
sweets, s=
o they have fed me blows, and I have received them too. However
many times =
I tell you that I am not the body, it never goes into your
head.=E2=80=99

=
(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, Jun=
e 1982, pp. 23-4)


Below is Akhilandamma's description of Mastan's final m=
oments:

He was sick and bedridden for about a week. During those days he s=
poke of
many things not of this world, as if he were actually seeing them.
=

He said, =E2=80=98There, Nandiswara [Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Siva] =
is
descending. He is very affectionately licking all over my body! Look! Th=
e
Siva ganas [celestial followers of Siva] are dancing here! See! They are
=
beckoning me to come to their world. Look at those lotus ponds where
celest=
ial swans are swimming!=E2=80=99

We thought that this was nothing but deli=
rium, but on the last day a very
strange thing happened, and we cannot ligh=
tly dismiss it as delirium. On
this day he suddenly got up from his bed and=
 stood up, looking as if
someone, face to face, had been calling him.

Then=
, in great excitement, he exclaimed, =E2=80=98Mother Apeetakuchamba, [the
c=
onsort of Siva in the Tiruvannamalai temple] have you come yourself to
esco=
rt me?=E2=80=99

The next moment he fell down dead. I immediately sent a me=
ssage to
Bhagavan.

When Bhagavan learned of Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away,=
 he sent Kunju Swami to our
village with full instructions on how to make a=
 samadhi for Mastan. There is
a Tamil book [Tirumular=E2=80=99s Tirumandira=
m] that faithfully gives the details of
how saints who have followed Lord S=
iva have to be buried. In accordance with
these details Bhagavan drew up a =
plan of the dimensions of the samadhi and
sent it along with Kunju Swami. I=
t seemed very strange to us that a Muslim
should be given a Saiva saint=E2=
=80=99s burial and stranger still that Bhagavan, who
did not generally enco=
urage ceremonial rites, actually laid down in the
minutest detail the rites=
 to be followed in the samadhi of Mastan.

Whatever the reason, just as Bha=
gavan stipulated, we made a tomb for Mastan
in our village. It is a village=
 whose population is predominantly Jain.
These inhabitants of the village f=
elt that having a Hindu samadhi in their
midst would be very inauspicious. =
When they first heard of it, there was
even talk of their abandoning the vi=
llage completely. However, in the time
that has passed since Mastan=E2=80=
=99s samadhi was constructed, the village has
thrived and grown rich. Nowad=
ays the samadhi is a visible deity to all
people from the village, whatever=
 their caste or religion. What a wonder!

(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=
=99 by Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982, pp. 5-9.)

Bhagavan only =
ordered this type of samadhi for three of his devotees: his
mother, Lakshmi=
 the cow, and Mastan.

Some days later Akhilandamma went to Tiruvannamalai =
to tell Bhagavan about
Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away:

I went to Bhagavan a=
nd described the final days of Mastan.

Upon hearing about them Bhagavan co=
mmented, =E2=80=98Maybe the universal mother,
Apeetakuchamba, personally ca=
me to take him. All his descriptions tally with
the world of Siva. Mastan w=
as an unassuming devotee. He had a wealth of
hidden spiritual experiences. =
It is a matter for gratification that he
passed away in your care and under=
 your supervision.=E2=80=99

damma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982, pp. 5-9.)

inging so loudly.=C2=A0<br><br>=E2=80=98Mastan, what happened to you today?=
=E2=80=99 asked Bhagavan as soon as the pradakshina was over. =E2=80=98You =
never ever sing, so why did you sing like that?=E2=80=99=C2=A0<br>

<br>=E2=
=80=98It was nothing,=E2=80=99 replied Mastan, casually. =E2=80=98Perumal i=
nstructed me that I had to sing in order to ward off your drowsiness. To ra=
ise my spirits and to equip me for the job, he made me take a drink contain=
ing ganja.=E2=80=99=C2=A0<br>

<br>=E2=80=98So that=E2=80=99s what happened=
. Ganja intoxication was behind your wild singing. How many times have I to=
ld you that I need no external help to keep me awake? Also, I have told you=
 before not to do anything for my sake. Don=E2=80=99t listen to other peopl=
e who tell you differently.=E2=80=99<br>

<br>Though Bhagavan rebuked Masta=
n in this way, I don=E2=80=99t think he took the criticism very seriously. =
Mastan was a very innocent man, and events like this didn=E2=80=99t touch h=
im.<br></span><br><br>I remember one incident that took place when Bhagavan=
 lived at Skandashram. A golden mongoose entered the ashram premises and ma=
de straight for Bhagavan. It sat on his lap for a while. Later, it wandered=
 around and closely inspected all the different parts of the cave. When the=
 inspection was over, it disappeared into the bushes on the hill. While all=
 this was happening, Mastan was the only devotee with Bhagavan.<br>

<br>So=
me time later Perumal came back to the ashram and Mastan told him about the=
 visit of the mongoose. One can get a glimpse of Mastan=E2=80=99s state of =
mind at the time from the remarks he made.<br><br>=E2=80=98I was afraid tha=
t the mongoose might harm our peacocks,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=98so I kep=
t myself ready in case it made an attack. I had a big stick handy. Fortunat=
ely, it moved away without making any move towards the peacocks.=E2=80=99<b=
r>

<br>Perumal told him, =E2=80=98Mastan, you should have caught it. If yo=
u had managed to capture it, we could have brought it up here and kept it a=
s a pet.=E2=80=99<br><br>Bhagavan was listening to this conversation.=C2=A0=
<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Addressing Mastan, he said, =E2=80=
=98Whom do you think he was? Do you think you could have caught him, and do=
 you think that this other man could have domesticated him? This was a sage=
 of Arunachala who took on this form to come and visit me. He wanted to pay=
 his respects to me. How many times have I told you that sages come to see =
me in various forms?=E2=80=99</span><br>

<br>Mastan never told me about th=
is mongoose. Bhagavan himself mentioned the incident to me on one of my lat=
er visits.=C2=A0<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Source</span>:=C2=

<br><br>Mas=
tan continued to visit Bhagavan throughout the 1920s, although his visits w=
ere less frequent than in earlier years. He was present in Ramanasramam, al=
ong with a small number of other devotees, on a famous occasion in 1924 whe=
n Bhagavan was attacked by a gang of robbers who were under the mistaken im=
pression that a large amount of money was kept there.<br>

<br>Bhagavan rec=
eived a severe blow on his leg during the robbery, but in a characteristic =
response he told the robbers, =E2=80=98If you are not satisfied, you may st=
rike the other leg also=E2=80=99.<br><br>Ramakrishna Swami, one of the devo=
tees present, was so outraged by the assault on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s person, =
he took up an iron bar with the intention of attacking the intruders.<br>

=
<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan restrained him, saying, =E2=
=80=98Let these robbers play their role. We shall stick to ours. Let them d=
o what they like. It is for us to bear and forbear. Let us not interfere wi=
th them.=E2=80=99</span><br>

<br>Mastan appeared to follow Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s advice during this attack since there is no record of him reacting in =
any way to the violent invasion. In one of his rare recorded statements, Ma=
stan is reported to have said, =E2=80=98Even if the sky falls on your head,=
 or even if a sword is firmly driven through your chest, do not slip from y=
our true state.=E2=80=99 The final clause, which can equally well be transl=
ated as =E2=80=98do not get agitated=E2=80=99, seems to sum up Mastan=E2=80=
=99s response to this event.<br>

<br>Akhilandamma rushed to Tiruvannamalai=
 when she heard the news. This is her report of how Bhagavan reacted to the=
 assault:=C2=A0<br><br>What one could not imagine had happened: Bhagavan wa=
s beaten up by thieves. The news took wing and many like me ran to the ashr=
am in great anxiety.<br>

<br>Seeing me Bhagavan expressed surprise and sai=
d, =E2=80=98Oh, Desuramma, you have come as well. Kunju Swami is telling th=
e story over there. Go and listen.=E2=80=99<br><br>It was as though Bhagava=
n had directed some children to go and listen to a story that was being tol=
d some distance away. I learned that Bhagavan had appointed Kunju Swami to =
relate all the incidents surrounding the robbery. From his reaction I gathe=
red that the persistent questioning by devotees annoyed Bhagavan more than =
even the beatings of the thieves.<br>

<br>Sitting at the feet of Bhagavan =
and stroking the wounded leg, I expressed surprise and sorrow, saying, =E2=
=80=98How unjust! What injustice!=E2=80=99<br><br>Bhagavan contradicted me.=
 =E2=80=98What injustice is there in this? As you feed me sweets, so they h=
ave fed me blows, and I have received them too. However many times I tell y=
ou that I am not the body, it never goes into your head.=E2=80=99=C2=A0<br>=

by Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, June 1982, pp. 23-4)</span><br><br><br>=
<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Below is Akhilandamma's description of=
 Mastan's final moments:</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bol=
d">He was sick and bedridden for about a week. During those days he spoke o=
f many things not of this world, as if he were actually seeing them.<br><br=
>He said, =E2=80=98There, Nandiswara [Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Siva] =
is descending. He is very affectionately licking all over my body! Look! Th=
e Siva ganas [celestial followers of Siva] are dancing here! See! They are =
beckoning me to come to their world. Look at those lotus ponds where celest=
ial swans are swimming!=E2=80=99<br>

<br>We thought that this was nothing =
but delirium, but on the last day a very strange thing happened, and we can=
not lightly dismiss it as delirium. On this day he suddenly got up from his=
 bed and stood up, looking as if someone, face to face, had been calling hi=
m.<br>

<br>Then, in great excitement, he exclaimed, =E2=80=98Mother Apeeta=
kuchamba, [the consort of Siva in the Tiruvannamalai temple] have you come =
yourself to escort me?=E2=80=99<br><br>The next moment he fell down dead. I=
 immediately sent a message to Bhagavan.=C2=A0<br>

<br>When Bhagavan learn=
ed of Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away, he sent Kunju Swami to our village wit=
h full instructions on how to make a samadhi for Mastan.</span>=C2=A0There =
is a Tamil book [Tirumular=E2=80=99s Tirumandiram] that faithfully gives th=
e details of how saints who have followed Lord Siva have to be buried. In a=
ccordance with these details Bhagavan drew up a plan of the dimensions of t=
he samadhi and sent it along with Kunju Swami. It seemed very strange to us=
 that a Muslim should be given a Saiva saint=E2=80=99s burial and stranger =
still that Bhagavan, who did not generally encourage ceremonial rites, actu=
ally laid down in the minutest detail the rites to be followed in the samad=
hi of Mastan.=C2=A0<br>

<br>Whatever the reason, just as Bhagavan stipulat=
ed, we made a tomb for Mastan in our village. It is a village whose populat=
ion is predominantly Jain. These inhabitants of the village felt that havin=
g a Hindu samadhi in their midst would be very inauspicious. When they firs=
t heard of it, there was even talk of their abandoning the village complete=
ly. However, in the time that has passed since Mastan=E2=80=99s samadhi was=
 constructed, the village has thrived and grown rich. Nowadays the samadhi =
is a visible deity to all people from the village, whatever their caste or =
religion. What a wonder!=C2=A0<br>

y ordered this type of samadhi for three of his devotees: his mother, Laksh=
mi the cow, and Mastan.=C2=A0</span><br>

<br>Some days later Akhilandamma =
went to Tiruvannamalai to tell Bhagavan about Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away=
:=C2=A0<br><br>I went to Bhagavan and described the final days of Mastan.=
=C2=A0<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Upon hearing about them Bhag=
avan commented, =E2=80=98Maybe the universal mother, Apeetakuchamba, person=
ally came to take him. All his descriptions tally with the world of Siva. M=

your care and under your supervision.=E2=80=99=C2=A0<br>
