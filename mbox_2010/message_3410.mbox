On Jan 15 what time exactly the eclipse will be in India? I know it will be=
 midnight for US. Is it ok to do homa at that time i.e midnight? Which homa=
 should one do for eclipse? For japa is there any special mantra that one n=
eeds to chant to get the maxim benefit or any mantra is fine? For those who=
m the eclipse might cause harm what mantra should they chant to revert the =
negative effect. Any other valuable suggestions as this eclipse will be a b=
ig one. Thanks!

Best Regards
Sudha
