NAMASKAR to all

I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the last three =
weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this beautiful=
 forum...

Now I need some practical approach best suitable for me...

1. S=
uggested / Suitable time to perform ganapati homam(currently, I am performi=
ng around the time of sunrise, is it suitable at night or before sunrise to=
o?)

2. What substance should not be offered in Ganapati homam (bel-leaves =
should be one in the list, I unknowingly used it and experience very bad ef=
fects!) 

3. When the talking of "AGHORA" going on, is it really needed to =
perform "Bramhachariya" for daily ganapati homam? if someone can control hi=
s/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/masturbating/consume non-veg foo=
d is really needed? (In my practical experience, consume very low-diet litt=
le food at last night are excellent for performing Ganapati Homama in the m=
orning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hours before the homama pro=
cedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful for me!)

4. Is there a=
ny practical methods to keep the fire more times in the homam kundam so tha=
t more time to spend on meditation?

5. Is there any cost effective solutio=
ns for daily homam in Kolkata, India? Sometimes I find expensive for daily =
ganapati homam. We may ask to create a group in Kolkata to use our cumulati=
ve purchasing capacity for cheap rate. 

best regards,
Biswajit
