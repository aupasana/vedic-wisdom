GLORY OF SANYAS

A pious social worker was somehow up=
set by certain young aspirant-Sanyasins going astray. He had heard many sto=
ries of such misconduct on the part of Sanyasins from the Rishikesh public.=
 What struck him as unique was the fact that in Siva's Ashram almost all th=
e Sanyasins were young and youthful.

`Swamiji, pardon my presumption. But =
would it not have been better for these people to wait for some time more b=
efore embracing this holy order which is so very difficult to stick to? Are=
 you sure that these young initiates have really understood the duties of t=
his Ashrama, and that they will adhere to the principles? I should think it=
 is a great mistake to initiate them so early.'

Siva laughed gently. `Why!=
 I myself can give you many examples of this type. One young man took Sanya=
s. He was a great Vairagi. His exemplary life made his brother also to take=
 Sanyas. Later on, his (the former's) dispassion wanted. He married, ate eg=
gs and meat. His brother, however, stuck to the line. The former did not li=
ve with his Guru: he had his own Manmukhi (whimsical) Sadhana. He did not p=
rotect himself in seclusion by Satsang. Another young Sanyasi was fiery in =
his Sadhana. He inspired and elevated many Sadhaks. Later on he married and=
 has a child. How did this happen? He freely mixed with householders. He al=
lowed ladies to shampoo his legs. He had a downfall, brought forth a child.=
 There are many such instances.'

`That is exactly what I mean, Swamiji. In=
 that case, is it not better not to give Sanyas to young people at all.'

`=
My dear Bhagatji, that is where you are mistaken. They might fall and rise =
again. Yet, they are worthy of your veneration. For, at least one day they =
were Sanyasins. They had the courage to throw up their hands and say: `I re=
nounce the pleasures of the three worlds.' How glorious is Sanyas. How glor=
ious is such renunciation of the pleasures of the three worlds.

`They had =
the boldness and daring to stand up against the greatest forces of nature, =
the forces that maintain this Samsara=97those of self-preservation and proc=
reation. They stand there as the masters of nature: you are mercilessly dri=
ven by these forces whose slave you are. Maybe: some renunciates do not pro=
perly assess the strength of these opposing forces. They are sometimes take=
n unawares, when they are a little heedless. But those who never renounce, =
for fear of having a downfall are cowardly, and they never know what it is =
to renounce all. They never look at the battle-field lest their nose should=
 be injured. They jest at scars that never felt a wound. But a brave warrio=
r wears these scars as ornaments, for those scars taught him to protect him=
self in battle.

`Churchills are required in Sanyas. Brave, courageous even=
 in the face of successive defeats, Sanyasins should learn lessons and pin =
their faith in `ultimate victory'. Sure, victory will be theirs if only the=
y persist, persevere and plod on, without yielding midway. Let the light of=
 God shine brightly in the heart: protect that faith and tenacious adherenc=
e to the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Storms of passions will sweep the external=
s: and when God's grace descends on the Sadhaka, everything will be quiet a=
nd tranquil. Glory, glory to Sanyas and Sadhana.

`Sadhaks should learn a l=
esson from these stories. They should be vigilant, cautious. There is no ne=
ed to lose heart. But, each such episode ought to re-awaken in the young Sa=
nyasin a love for seclusion, for Satsang with his own Guru. Sadhaks should =
never drift away from their Guru. They should plunge themselves into Sadhan=
a and endeavour to realise God, every moment of their life.

`A wise man pr=
ofits himself by others' experience: a middling by his own: a fool by neith=
er. The story of others' downfall ought not to dishearten you. But, on the =
contrary, it should teach you a lesson. It should put you on your guard. An=
d, you should uphold the glory of Sanyasa. Because one man has failed to li=
ve up to Sanyasa, you should not think that the Order itself is unsuitable =
for the youth.

`What about the names of great Sanyasins like Swami Vivekan=
anda, Swami Rama Tirtha, Swami Dayananda, Bhagavan Raman Maharshi. As a mat=
ter of fact, you find that most of the noteworthy Sanyasins renounced the w=
orld while yet they were youthful. What can an old man achieve? When the po=
wer of hearing has gone, what Sravana is he going to do? No Sadhana will be=
 possible for the old man. It is mock-Sanyas if he embraces the Holy Order.=
 Sanyas would then become a formality. Further, conditions are such these d=
ays that an old man finds himself inextricably entangled in family life. Th=
erefore, it is essential that young boys should renounce the world and embr=
ace Sanyas. They have fewer worldly ties.'

`It was because perfectly or im=
perfectly man has striven to live, to exist, that we find today that he has=
 survived when countless other species have perished and gone. Similarly, i=
t is because young men or old felt disgust for the worldly life and embrace=
d Sanyas whether they have later been able to rise to eminence or have been=
 the victims of animal nature, that today that glorious Order has survived.=
'

`Young Sanyasins should keep themselves ever busy in Japan, Kirtan, Swad=
hyaya, meditation and Vichara: they should live in the company of their Gur=
u and practise vigorous Sadhana. They should never enter the cities. Even i=
f they have to pass through a city, they should as far as possible avoid th=
e crowd. Seclusion is the key to successful Sanyas-life. I have always advi=
sed my disciples never to enter the plains: and even if they have to do so =
owing to the exigencies of selfless service, I ask them to finish their wor=
k quickly and run back to their Himalayan abode. The Himalayas are the home=
s of Sadhakas and Sanyasins. A Sanyasin is safe so long as he is there. San=
yas was born in the Himalayas: Sanyas lives and will ever live in the Himal=
ayas alone.
