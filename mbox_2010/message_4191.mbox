The king of Kasi welcomed Sankara and offered royal comforts in his palace
=
for his stay.Sankara said that such a stay is not for ascetics and he
reque=
sted him to make a small dwelling on the banks of Ganga for the stay of
his=
 disciples and himself.He also declined any food offering stating that
they=
 would take food only on alms.

Sankara used to teach the disciples from Ka=
si and also to those who came
with him from Naramada country.After early mo=
rning bath, he expounded
teachings of Vedas and Upanishads and also the atm=
a vichara. Then he and his
disciples would go for bhiksha.This Satsangh was=
 going on for some time.
Then in the same period, he composed Sri Annapurna=
 Ashtakam and Sri Kasi
Viswanatha Ashtakam. Nityanandakari Varabhayakari So=
undarya Ratnakari......
Gangadharanga kamaneeya Jadakalabam......

There in=
 Kasi, one miracle also took place upon Sankara. He had his early
morning b=
ath and was returning in one of the bylanes to his residence. He
found an o=
utcaste, a dog eater, smelling of toddy all over his body, in
tattered clot=
hes, without any bath for days, holding a oozing toddy leather
pouch on his=
 shoulders, -- coming on the opposite direction. There was no
space to go f=
or both, without brushing on each other. Some stories say that
even wife of=
 outcaste,came with him.

Sankara says: Andhi vesha dharam dhrushtva gacha =
gacha idhi cha abravit....
O outcaste! Move away! Move away!

The outcaste =
asks Sankara:

1. O noble among the brahmins! Whom do you want to move away=
? Is it one body
which is made up of food to the other body which is also m=
ade up of food?
Or, should the Chaitanya in me move away from the Chaitanya=
 that is in you?

2. Is there any difference between the Sun that is reflec=
ting on Ganga and
the ditch water that is near my home? Is the Space that i=
s within a gold
vessel, different from the Space that is within a mud pot? =
Wherefrom do you
get the delusion, in the all-expanding Pure Space which is=
 the waveless
Ocean of Bliss, as between a brahmin and a dog eating out cas=
te?

Sankara thought for a second about this mind-blowing question! He medi=
tated
and looked in front and could see Siva and Uma,smiling. Siva was hold=
ing the
leash of four dogs! He looked in the form of Kalabairava!

Sankara =
then sang in a cry:

3. That eternal Pure Awareness, which is the Witness o=
f wakeful, dreaming
and deep sleep states, which is in all souls from an an=
t to Brahma, as the
sphurna, as I,I,I.., the One who is having this stable =
Atmajnana, he is my
Guru regardless of whether he is a brahmin or an outcas=
te!

4.I am Brahman.This entire universe is the expansion of this one
Brahm=
an-consciousness.I am unaware of this only due to my sattvic,rajas and
tama=
s characteristics which produce this ignorance and I am deluded into
thinki=
ng that all un-Brahman are Brahman. All these are delusions. There is
one P=
ure Awareness which is Brahman and this is all pervading. One who is
having=
 this stable Brahma Jnana, he is my Guru, regardless of whether he is
a bra=
hmin or an outcaste!

5. With Guru's Upadesa, my determination that this en=
tire universe is
perishable will be strengthened. With that non vacillating=
 mind,I shall
meditate on Brahman and burn my past and future karmas in tha=
t Pure
Awareness. I shall leave this body to the current,Prarabdha Karma an=
d remain
unmoving. This is my conviction.

(The Prayatna Mahavakyam, the gr=
eat saying for practise, is mentioned here:
I am Brahman. Aham Brahmasmi.)
=

6.That Pure Awareness which stay in the Heart of men and animals and devas=
,
as I,I,I,; in whose effulgence the solid non-shining mind, senses, body,
=
knowledge, shines;the Awareness which is hidden by ignorance like Sun hidde=
n
by clouds, The yogi meditates upon and remains in peace. He is my Guru. T=
his
is my conviction.

(This is the great saying for experience. Anubhava M=
ahavakyam.Tatvam Asi.
You are That.)

7. From this great ocean of bliss, ev=
en Indra and Devas get satisfied by
taking a droplet.The peaceful Sages fee=
l completion. The One who has merged
into that ocean of biss, Brahman, will=
 become Brahman. Who ever is such a
realized Sage, his feet are to be worsh=
ipped even by Indra. This is my
conviction.

This is the famous Maneesha Pa=
nchakam. The whole thing is a play for the
sake of the seekers. Even though=
 casteism and untouchability were rampant in
Sankara's days, one cannot thi=
nk that Sankara had such a feeling of
separateness.

Maneesha means, my con=
viction.
