What to note here is that within India itself, so called intellectuals demo=
nstrate their ability to debate on logical grounds by putting down our fait=
h. Anything and everything taught by the gora's is true...it has got to be =
true. We indians don't seem to understand the "why" for so many practices i=
n our scriptures that it is not possible to  give a rebuttal especially whe=
n the attacker is an Indian. It is amazing that decades after British left =
India their brainwashing has not and we are still in the grips of inferiori=
ty complex.

Merely doing silent sadhana and hoping for the problem to go a=
way is not the answer. I think to start with, we should be proud of our fai=
th system and those who claim themselves to be gurus should take the troubl=
e to explain to the layman the reasons for some of our practices...our guru=
s seem to have a tendency to easy get irritated when asked a lot of questio=
ns. Once i was told to " do as I was told" and so gradually I stopped follo=
wing this guru. In such an environment though, how can one learn and unders=
tand?
