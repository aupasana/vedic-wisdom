Namaste,

My emails are usually ignored as pointless blabber but if I could=
 add some words 
here. Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be only re=
quired in the initial 
stages when you are still struggling to acquire a st=
eady mind needed for mantra 
sadhana success. Once you have achieved some l=
evel of success, discipline that 
may have been required in the initial sta=
ges is no longer necessary.

I have read a few of Sivanandas books....most =
of them are available on their 
website for free downloads as pdf. And what=
 he has stated is that to develop a 
steady mind, strict discipline is nece=
ssary on food and detachment from sexual 
activity as would be=C2=A0in celi=
bacy. Once you have been able to steady you mind, 
you may give up this dis=
cipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he did a lot 
of penance while =
he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that people thing 
of him today=
 is essentially part of his adult life.....once he had already 
perfected h=
is ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana alone. You read any 
myth=
ology, purana or granth and you will come across Rishi's who are supposed t=
o 
be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be ever ready to curse anybod=
y even with a 
slightest disappointment, most of them seemed to have big eg=
os.

I do not know if you have read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 =
but if you read 
that, even when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or =
his gurus did not like 
being challenged on any matter and this is time and=
 again=C2=A0seen in his books.

Ofcourse above all, you need to keep your e=
go in control before the Lord even 
though you may be reckless to other hum=
ans. There is someone I know....I do not 
know him personally but only thro=
ugh message exchanges over groups like this. He 
seems to have knowledge of=
 a lot of sadhana's and has practiced quite a lot of 
them. Success seems t=
o illude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana 
for others, it=
 succeeds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And 
he was on=
ce=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I =

really do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific =
needs. 
So I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of differe=
nt sadhana 
from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his praye=
r one day that 
the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear =
and if the Lord could 
provide him the success he is looking for in his lif=
e. He retorted and shot back 
at me that he did not spend time and energy i=
n learning these various tantric 
sadhanas just to beg before god, he only =
knows how to demand from god.! I 
reminded him that all this while, he was =
not having any problems begging for 
help and suggestion from other group m=
embers and yet, he is not willing to beg 
from god when really god is the o=
ne and only who can really do anything the 
problems he is facing. I do not=
 think even Ravana had that attitude that this 
person did,=C2=A0when he wo=
uld sit down for his sadhana.

Cheers,
Bhupendra

=C2=A0 
Namaskar,
How did Ravana got s=
uccess with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with 
loss of Ahamka=
ra and purity of mind ?
Where is the liberation without shakti, even the sl=
aves were humble, devoted and 
with complete surrender to their masters, wh=
at results did they ever get ?
There is a saying in sanskrit, "Kshama shobh=
ti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal 
ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vine=
et saral ho". Meaning, the shakti-heen 
(powerless) person needn't worry ab=
out forgiving, because his anger can do no 
harm to another.

ck does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously=
 spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk =
but also run. Similarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra do not ma=
tter much. Use mantra to focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.=
e. impurity!).<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>>

t; I want to thank you for taking the step that is badly needed. I am a str=
ong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate answers to thing=
s not in our control. Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the re=
aders; literally hundreds would benefit from this as they seek their solace=
. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on internal strengths (of individu=
als) and become stronger to overcome difficulties.<BR>> > > > &=

 of Astrology for 20+ years, and continue to use it for guidance for the fu=
ture, but do not expect predictions would come true as there are factorial =
12! x 9! factorial permutations and combinations to deal with, virtually ma=
king it impossible to predict correctly. But for a trained eye and the lear=
ned gurus, and for those
 who have focused more on the good lord to seek th=
e knowledge (with total discipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditio=
nally), this art becomes a science as they acquire "vak-suddhi"; AND they a=
re able to guide the people. I see many in this group following such discip=
line and thanks to them. <BR>> > > > > > <BR>> > &g=

mantras listed for the benefit of the members to address the common issues =
people face, plus to appease the lords of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu=
, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but wo=

 would be more useful and powerful than prescribing remedi=
