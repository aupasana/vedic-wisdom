Dear Sir,

>From the pitri tarpana manual, it says that pitri tarpana can be=
 done daily
however it is advised to do this ritual outside the place of re=
sidence, say
in the back garden or front garden or if it is a flat, then in=
 the balcony.

On certain days like amavasya, surya sankranti, mahalaya pit=
rupaksha, the
tarpanam can be done inside the house.

Hope this helps you.
=

best regards
Hari
