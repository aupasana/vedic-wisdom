Self Realisation



Hello, a good many years ago now I underwent an experi=
ence which can go
by this name, so I was wondering if we are talking about =
the same thing,
the same experience.  It began as a dark journey and ended =
up in a
wonderful place where I was alone, and aware of what I am. Time did=
 not
move there, it was an eternity of being in love and aware of the essen=
ce
and spirit of life and what it is to be.  I don't really give it a
name,=
 perhaps HOME is the best name.  Is there a file or document on the
group w=
hich describes this experience and then I could compare notes for
curiosity=
.
