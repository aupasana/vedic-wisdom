Namaste Sri S,
 
You made good points. I see us focusing on slightly different angles of the same picture and not really disagreeing.
 
> People are led by their own karma to false Gurus.
 
As Vimalananda says, one gets a guru one deserves. If one is attracted to a fake guru and gets misled, it is one's own karma and conditioning that pulled him that way. You're right. The root cause of whatever happens to one is in one's kaarana sareera (causal body) and external things are just symbols projecting a play of one's own karmas and samskaras externally.
 
> The Guru as well as the devatha are never external.
> Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. 
 
A very correct and wise statement!
 
Truly speaking, whether one's guru is a good one or not is a pseudo-question. An unready person may not recognize or benefit from a good guru. If a person is ready and does not have a good guru, it is only a matter of time before Nature sends the right guru. The fact that one is being externally guided by a good guru is a projection of the internal truth that there are no blocking karmas and one is ready to progress.
 
*        *        *
 
Now, I can change the angle a little bit and say the following.
 
As external things (including guru) are merely a projection of internal things (karmas and vaasanas), focusing on the external and trying to control it is like putting the bullock cart before the bullock. Seeking to find a sadguru without working on one's blocking samskaras and karmas is like putting the bucllock cart before the bullock.
 
*        *        *

Unfortunately, fake gurus are (will be) slowly becoming the rule and not the exception.
 
Of course, the majority who get influenced by them do have corresponding karmas. No matter what Paramahamsa Yogananda wrote, no matter what Vimalananda wrote and what we may write, people with corresponding karmas will flock to fake gurus with great hopes of being rescued from the cycle of samsaara.
 
However, there are going to be some (many?) who will read the words of Paramahamsa Yogananda that great masters will no longer descend to earth or the words of Vimalananda and others that good gurus will be tough to find, or our discussions that one is better off doing some sadhana oneself than search for a sadguru, and spend their time on sadhana instead of going around searching for a sadguru as did the person in my example below. Of course, ironically, some of those may end up finding a sadguru, while those who actively search for a sadguru might not find anyone or find a fake one.
 
There are many strategies and people are attracted by different strategies based on their karmas and vaasanas, but the stretegy I will suggest is: Pick a sadhana such as homam, japam etc. Keep doing it. Keep working on your attitude. Do not worry about finding a guru. For all you know, a guru may be working on you without even your knowing it. After all, the fact that you are even doing some sadhana and thinking about spiritual progress may be due to some guru somewhere. Who (s)he is, what his/her name is, how (s)he looks like may be irrelevant. If and when it is relevant, Nature will send that guru to you physically. Just keep doing sadhana.
 
Do not be in a hurry to find a guru, but, once you fully realize that so and so person is your guru and accept so and so person as your guru, be fully devoted to his/her word and have complete faith. Unless you can be like that, there is no point in calling someone your guru.
 
*        *        *
 
> My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or
> caused any offense.
 
What you said is very good and far from being nonsense.
 
There is one person who visits me now and then and discusses vedanta. He is at loggerheads with me on several issues (I intentionally leave out many areas of agreement and focus on angles where he disagrees). He speaks his mind freely, but at the end worries about causing offense to me and is always very apologetic. I say to him, "nobody who is worth apologizing to will be offended by this. Somebody who is offended by this is not worth apologizing to. So, in either case, don't apologize."
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen between them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the physical being his Guru is not destined to succeed.

Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited personalities are not. The 'dress' the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru.

I do not say 'dont do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever'; but I do not agree with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.

He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone like that.

In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.

They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn't it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.

As such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.

In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years.

Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?

There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.
