Dear Narasimha
=A0
It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real lif=
e all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of ches=
s game. 
=A0
Great analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=A0=
completed a beautiful=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=A0one divine ch=
ess player, and it is totally His game. 
=A0
Before I continue with the nar=
ration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I had not clearl=
y mentioned in my last mail:
=A0

At the end of the third day of Chandi hom=
a at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, whe=
n Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experi=
ence in a public forum. Therefore my mails.
=A0

Caveat: A homa on a funera=
l pyre is an extreme Aghor=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Inf=
act, in many paramparas it is said=A0only someone who has a direct agya fro=
m Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya =
from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=
=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts on=
e should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. 
=A0

Many people have a ne=
gative=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack=
 of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadh=
anas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films etc of =
Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect=
. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts start w=
ith many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach t=
he same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path.=
 Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but =
at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great sai=
nts and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considere=
d the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami =
was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to=
 give a first hand objective=A0account of how a
 powerful sadhana in the sa=
mshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.
=A0

There are m=
any people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an at=
traction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. Thes=
e accounts are ment to tell such=A0people that these sadhanas can and do ha=
ppen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is sti=
ll as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and=A0a=
ctually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, ther=
e is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition=
 you are in right now=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha =
and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and on=
e is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eter=
nal promise to every individual=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. A=
nd She is so=A0kind.=A0 In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand o=
f God", Vimalanada says :


"Publish this book after I am gone. Let people =
know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may re=
ad it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then=
 Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as She did fo=
r me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. The progress=
ion will go on; there is nothing to fear".
Therefore have faith, do sadhana=
.=A0 

=A0
Back to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishn=
a Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shakti=
s are available on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we=
 were walking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was =
to be seen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Sudd=
enly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path.=
 We stopped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I s=
tarted mentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make o=
ur journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming =
from the other side who chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Man=
ish said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to b=
ig for your breeches".
=A0
As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is=
 a wonderful place.=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind =
was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day=
 morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenl=
y felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smile=
d at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the ener=
gies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the=
 samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say a=
nything.=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Ben=
eras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at t=
he Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.
=A0
=
Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with peopl=
e. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept loo=
king for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at u=
s, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of t=
he samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the diffe=
rent chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands=
 of years there has not been a single minute when there has not been a body=
 burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There w=
as one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found =
a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to s=
it there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manis=
h said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0=
 but there is something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we
 went t=
o another side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap lo=
g=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end,=
 the dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to=
 make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but=
 Manish said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlook=
ers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom ins=
tructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is somethi=
ng very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have obje=
cted, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Agh=
or sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the d=
omes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families =
and thus they do not disturb. 
=A0
The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre=
 was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus=
 was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten =
minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strang=
e because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose th=
is specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sens=
e perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Ev=
ery now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently=
 for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But,=
 everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the=
 dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt=
 a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being =
such an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of=
 the Chandi path=A0I could hear
 chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relative=
s wailing as new bodies were being brought in. 
=A0
Suddenly to my right th=
ere was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The =
dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was=
 moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the=
 transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was =
in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages of the=A0book=
. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=A0I looked bac=
k and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow pass=
ed over my book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanti=
ng with more vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=A0 Manish later s=
aid, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her =
presence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination but reality and=
 this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The i=
dea is to keep doing sadhana.
=A0
While offering coconuts into the fire, on=
e coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the=
 domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondere=
d if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt n=
atural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=A0there=
 was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily=
 take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=
=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconu=
t while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood why.
=A0
In=
 the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who wa=
s standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre =
has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It =
was already late in the night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenl=
y Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being=
 done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentall=
y wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relatives came forw=
ard and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok a=
nd asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of the=
 homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse=A0 I saw t=
he skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!=

=A0
There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=A0at the end to finsh the=
 fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water o=
n the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at t=
he end they came to Manish and=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water=
. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fir=
e, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing h=
appened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahu=
tis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log p=
ranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to =
the fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0Manish's feet, but Manish would not l=
et them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower pet=
als we had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. S=
uddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) ca=
me
 running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubte=
d. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, ev=
erything is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of t=
he day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person=
 suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous =
saint)=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query a=
sked him where was he from, the person replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish adv=
ised him to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordi=
nary people of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our lan=
d and culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educated'=A0people are too r=
ational to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculating.=
 By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt a=
s if my body existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothing
 belo=
w, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I t=
old Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one word reply, "Good".
=A0=

=A0
=A0
As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "Th=
ere is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of de=
sire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about i=
t. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to come and perform these sadha=
nas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sad=
haka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze o=
f a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat =
(as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting=
 on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom h=
e had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, bu=
t directionless." At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess =
that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, inst=
ead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=A0so that you are ready wh=
en
 Nature decides to give you a push. 
=A0
After passing the Lalita Ghat, =
next afternoon,=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We wer=
e dressed like any other tourist, specially with Manish's camera hanging fr=
om his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too cl=
ose to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shoc=
ked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.
=A0
Thus end=
ed my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed =
Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.
=A0

Rajarshi

This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and sayin=
g to myself "all iz well"-:).  Manish later said, as one does sadhana =
the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if sl=
ightly. It is not an imagination but reality and this can happen =
not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doin=
g
 sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While offering coconuts into the f=
ire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick wh=
ich the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I =
wondered if I had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strang=
ely felt natural stroking the pyre the way the domes do. I even wonder=
ed if there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job,=
 I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom a=
t Manikarkina! Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought=
 one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I under=
stood why.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In the middle of the homa, suddenly=
 Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him&nb=
sp;that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that th=
ey (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the nig=
ht. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, =
do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only pra=
ying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is g=
oing on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum lo=
g ahsirwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down a=
nd continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked=
 me to observe the skin on the corpse  I saw the skin on the face had =
caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water at the end to finsh=
 the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour wat=
er on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally =
at the end they came to Manish and asked if they could pour some Gange=
s water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to =
the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but no=
thing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some m=
ore ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi samne khadi hai.=
 App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially=
 bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch Manish's feet, but Manis=
h would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed so=
me flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very late in=
 the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had
 address=
ed earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for =
having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done=
 no wrong, everything is all right.  Later Manish said, if it was some=
 other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea=
. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain =
saint (a famous saint) who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respon=
ding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior&=
nbsp;Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night.=
 The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so uniqu=
e, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educat=
ed' people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the =
simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the f=
ire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my
 head to my hear=
t, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach , as if I was sim=
ply floating on thin air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a&=
nbsp;curt one word reply, "Good".</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish sud=
denly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who =
has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know ho=
w to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to come and perf=
orm these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a =
Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to =
meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to t=
he Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreign=
er lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is =
the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. "She=
 has desire, but directionless." At that time there was nothing more we cou=
ld do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on=
 your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good, so tha=
t you are
 ready when Nature decides to give you a push. </DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon, we stood an=
d observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tour=
ist, specially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck and the =
;tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, wha=
t if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed a=
s tourists, wondering what is going on.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Thus e=
nded my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the fame=
d Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.</DIV>
