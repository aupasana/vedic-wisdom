Respected Guruji,

Pranam!!!!

By the valuable knowledge you provided and =
by the Grace of GOD I did
Maha Ganapati Homam this Vinayaka Chaturthi for t=
he first time.

Without your text and support it won't have been possiable.=
 There are
many people who has knowledge and there is very few who share th=
eir
valuable knowledge to people like us, and Guruji YOU are the ONE who
do=
es so.

The excitement and experience is not possiable to write in words bu=
t
truely its awesome.

The homam was good from the begning till end but onl=
y problem I faced
was with the pronunciations a bit.

Though I didn't plann=
ed for the Homam at begining but within 3 hours
every thing was arranged an=
d I did the Homam in the evening.

I would also like to thanky all my frien=
ds of this group for their
valuable opinions regarding Homam which I follow=
 regularly.

I would also like to thank my husband and my mother-in-law wit=
hout their
support it won't have been possiable.

Thanking You

Pranam & Re=
gards
Shreya Sampathy
