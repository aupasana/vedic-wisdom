Namaskarams Kishoreji , Hemanthji and others,
As you told correctly I have =
my self experienced that sleeping with Head in the North direction actually=
 leads to disturbed sleep. Also sleeping in the pathways like the corridors=
 or near the entrance of a door etc also leads to disturbances as I have be=
en told that the Ganas(both Devaganas and Bhutaganas) in the house=C2=A0wal=
k around in these pathways and we might get disturbed if we in the way. Lik=
ewise sleeping under a tree in the night is also not advisable especially d=
rumstick or Tamarind tree since these are said to be the favourite resting =
places for spirits like Vetalas and Mohini. 
Of course I have never experie=
nced any of these spirits :) :) .. Just quoting from what I have heard.

Th=
is has some scientific basis since trees exhale CO2 in the night which is h=
armful to humans.
Of course if one is sufficiently beyond ones normal self =
on account of his karmas and sadhana none of these petty things really matt=
er. 

Regards,
Girish Sundaram

ity variation in the world!

=C2=A0 
Hemanth ji

The Lord of the southern d=
irection is Yama so it is the natural direction to keep the body after deat=
h. Also the toes of the body are tied together . Modern mystic Jaggi Vasude=
v says this is to prevent an easy repossession of the body by any stray spi=
rits hence the body is kept on the S-N axis.

I beleive Vimalananda also wr=
ites about this in one of the three books.

Lord Dakshinamurthy is the only=
 one among the deities facing south and the temples of Lord Dakshinamurthy =
also face south.

I beleive rest from the activities of the physical world =
is equal in meaning to death. Each day we are reborn said the Buddha.....Du=
ring sleep the consciousness retreats to the centre of the heart and if res=
tful sleep occurs it is one step closer to samadhi . If one has very deep r=
estful sleep with no dreams during that sleep he or she has no sense of nam=
e, fame , family ,caste or age. When people wake up at the very second of w=
aking up they have a hard time remembering who they are...Which is among th=
e states (Sushupti ) is closer to samadhi.

So the southern direction might=
 naturally support the rest from the activities of the world and might not =
be a bad direction to keep one's head. Also one can keep it towards the eas=
tern direction as well.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
