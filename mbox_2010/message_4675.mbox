death some hours ago, need advice

   
Dear Narasimhaji (or other wise peop=
le on this group),

My father passed away a few hours ago, and I am in shoc=
k. I am in the US and 
will be travelling to India within the next few hour=
s. My father's last wish as 
communicated to my mother was to be cremated i=
n an electric crematorium. I have 
to make the decision. It doesnt sound ri=
ght to me. What do I do so that his soul 
truly rests in peace. I very desp=
erately want to make the right decision. Should 
I honor his wish? An addit=
ional question - when does the soul leave the body: 48 
hours will have pas=
sed by the time I get there?

Please reply quickly.
