Namaste Priya,
        To those who worship Narayana, He is the parabrahman=
, to those of Shiva- Sadashiva/Paramashiva is the parabrahman and to those =
who worship the Devi- She is the power animating Siva, Vishnu and all the G=
ods and beings and is the Parabrahman. This is a continuation of the vedic =
attitude where one after the other each Deva is in turn praised as being ev=
ery other Deva and being responsible for all creation.

The crux of this is=
 that we are relying on the Divine and not on our own effort or intelligenc=
e.

To take it a step further, as they say- Yatho brahmande- tatho pindande=
.Then you have all the related stories of millions of Gods being in the go-=
matha and in the human body etc.Ultimately, Sri Hari, Sadashiva, Mahadurga/=
Chandi are the same.We just have to rely on belief until we experience. 

 =
        So the important thing is the attitude and not the form. Its all di=
fferent flavours of the same thing. Which flavour really attracts you ? The=
re are various sources from our scriptures which can give you a mental stru=
t for this thought till it is realised- based on who your ishta devatha is(=
 and I dont mean this in an astrological sense). Reading all the different =
sources and getting confused is like having chocolate, pickle and spicy foo=
d all the same meal and complaining of a stomach ache. They are all good by=
 themselves, but are not meant to be combined and cause intellectual confus=
ion. One need not be a Pundit to be a good sadhaka.

>From what I have read-=
 deha suddhi is essential for bahir puja and even upamsa japa. Manasa japa =
does not require external purity.


I hope this helps..

Gum gurubhyo namah=
