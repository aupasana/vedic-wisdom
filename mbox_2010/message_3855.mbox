Atul,

While Narayan was correct in his explanation, perhaps, he did not ad=
dress your question.

A person P is suffering from some illness. It is perh=
aps a result of bearing result of his past karma K. P goes to the doctor D =
and doctor treats him and P becomes healthy. You are asking is D accepting =
the karma of person P, which is K.

Accepting karma of another person is no=
t easy. If I consult a doctor, will he/she be able to diagnose successfully=
? Only when it is in patients destiny that he/she be cured, a doctor diagno=
ses correctly. The patient will face the consequence of his/her karma.

How=
 ever, if the doctor feels that it is his ability to diagnose that helped t=
he patient, doctor is incurring new karma.

In fact, the doctor may be just=
 paying back his past rinas by curing people.

Best regards,
Vijay
