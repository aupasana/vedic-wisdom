SPARKS FROM THE ANVIL =E2=80=94 I

Talk 281.

A certa=
in man, who claims to have been Sri Maharshi=E2=80=99s quondam disciple, ha=
s
filed a suit in the court praying for a declaration that he
is the legiti=
mate Sarvadhikari of the Asramam.

Sri Maharshi was examined on Commission.=
 There was a crowd but the
proceedings went on smoothly in the room on the =
North East.

The following are a few titbits therefrom: Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s answers were quite
spontaneous and smooth.

Q.: You do not touch money=
 nor other offerings, I trust.

M.: People sometimes place fruits in my han=
ds. I touch them.

Q.: If you receive one kind of offering, why should you =
not receive money
also?

M.: I cannot eat money. What shall I do with it? W=
hy should I take that with
which I do not know what to do?

A lawyer devote=
e asked Sri Bhagavan if the previous day=E2=80=99s examination by
Commissio=
n caused much strain.

M.: I did not use my mind and so there was no strain=
. Let them examine me
for a thousand days. I don=E2=80=99t mind.
