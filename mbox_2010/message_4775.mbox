Dear Narasimhaji and others,

Struggling how to put this properly but I hav=
e been wondering a lot about the above concept, especially in relation to t=
he results of mantras for the same. The same theme repeats itself over and =
over again in many ways:

o Shiva/Shakti
o Prakriti/Purusha
o In astrology =
mantras for planets versus mantras for signs (signs always related to mahav=
idya/devi)
o General literature about male/female gods and their progeny

O=
verall, it seems to me that the idea is one of progressive manifestation (o=
f consciousness/form/individuality). The male is the manifester, the female=
 is the field/area in which the manifestation will occur and the progeny (i=
n the cases there is progeny) is the result. The result is always at a prog=
ressively more outward level. 

I assume this is the idea behind all the ma=
le/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wrong. However, I still s=
truggle with what is the result of devi/mahavidya mantra versus the other (=
I assume "male") mantras. Extending the same concept as above, it would see=
m that the non-devi/non-mahavidya type mantras are the ones that result in =
aligning one's actions with whatever it is that the mantra's goal is. While=
 devi/mahavidya type mantras, in going with same symbolism, would not actua=
lly directly influence one's actions but would give knowledge of the area o=
f action, and thereby help in making the correct choice when indeed the tim=
e comes for action. This is purely my own conclusion. Is this correct?

And=
 even so, I still don't understand why there seems to be a requirement for =
precision and exactness in devi/mahavidya type sadhana but not in the non-d=
evi type sadhana.

Please forgive me if I am simplifying things too much. A=
ny and all comments are more than welcome, I am simply trying to improve my=
 understanding (for now).

Sincerely,

Sundeep
