 How can we understand the ways of God through our small intellects?

As Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava brothers and Krishna
stood around him.They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the great hero.

Arjuna said to Krishna: "Friend, how surprising it is! Even such a man as
our grandsire Bhishma - truthful, self-restrained, supremely wise and one of
the eight Vasus - weeps through Maya,at the hour of death." Sri Krishna
asked Bhishma about it.

Bhishma replied: "O Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause
of my grief. I am thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas' sufferings,
though God Himself is their charioteer,A thought like this makes me feel
that i have understood nothing of the ways of God, and so I weep."
