Namaste Kumar ji,

First thing is to download Maha Ganapati Homam Manual fr=
om http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm

This manual has answ=
ers to all your questions. you can even download video of Narasimha which w=
ill surely help you.
***
After some experience, I say that fear not. Do not=
 worry even if you do it COMPLETELY incorrectly initially. just have the in=
tentions and strive to do it to the best of your ability and for the love o=
f Maha Ganapati and then forget about whether you did it right or you did s=
o and so mistake and now what will happen etc...etc...

1) You'll get in th=
e manual.
    You can start Homam tomorrow (i.e. Vijayadashami or on coming=
 Pournima i.e. 21/22    October
2) Homam can be performed "Every day" and "=
any time" of the day.
3) You'll get in the manual
4) You may fast if you fe=
el like but not necessary. but please remember not to eat anything 2 to 3 h=
ours before starting Homam. try to avoid Meat, alcoholic drinks, excess of =
onion, garlic and such eatables.

Best of Luck!

Utpal
