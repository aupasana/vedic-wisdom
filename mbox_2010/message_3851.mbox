Dear Nagraj ji
=C2=A0
Let me offer my views on the pertinent questions you =
have raised. 
=C2=A0
I am able to find answers to many questions that my im=
mature mind keeps on asking! 
=C2=A0
Don't worry about that, many of us hav=
e a tendency to keep asking. I have been stronly advised against too much l=
ogical reason - which I keep doing - and yet the mind keeps poppings querie=
s. But make sure you do not get trapped only in theoritical questions. Do s=
adhana, do meditation. That is of more importance.
=C2=A0
1. On the page 45=
 it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara =
with his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this =
bizarre behavior and why should=C2=A0the priest who slapped him=C2=A0die, b=
ecause in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least!=C2=
=A0Since you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing thi=
ngs, I hope=C2=A0to find and answer here. 
=C2=A0
There are two ways of=C2=
=A0looking at this. There is no compelling reason except for the love of Go=
d. If you love God THAT strongly, you can offer anything to Him/Her. But mo=
st of us are not Trilanga Swami and would better off not trying something l=
ike this. Trilanga Swami did this probably also to break orthodoxy and show=
 people that even this kind of a stage can be achieved by a human being. IN=
 Bengal there was a sadhaka named Bamakshepa who had done something similar=
. He had offered his own urine as Ganges water to Ma Tara. The priests of c=
ourse went mad at this and locked him up and beat him, untill the queen of =
that area got a dream where Ma Tara told her that she will leave the place =
for good unless the people stop harassing Her son (Bama). 
=C2=A0
This is n=
ot something that is done often and by everything. Ramakrishan, when he say=
 Trilanga Swami, said it was as if Vishwanath himself who was sitting. Fina=
lly the only measure of purity is inside the mind. Nothing is impure if you=
r mind is perfectly pure.
=C2=A0
If you have read the 3 books of Aghora you=
 will come across an example about a few aghoris who were Chandi sadhakas, =
who were refused entry into a village and so a=C2=A0famine struck the villa=
ge=C2=A0killing people. When a man of very, very, very high calibre has era=
sed his Karana Shareera through Sadhana, then the person become one with th=
e Universe or his/her choice form of deity. In such a doing harm to that pe=
rson - slapping Trilanga Swami - will bring the force of the deity or unive=
rse to act again the offender. As Vimalananda says, if a tiger were to come=
 infornt of you, will you misbehave with it or treat it with respect? And w=
hy will=C2=A0you treat it with caution and respect, because it's energy is =
different from your energy. =C2=A0Same way, a man like Trilanga Swami is no=
t just an ordinary man but=C2=A0the power of the UNiverse itself. If he is =
doing something - however obnoxious it may seem - the universe has agood re=
ason for the same. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
In quite a few places, Vimalananda=C2=A0e=
quates changing the=C2=A0loyalty from diety to diety=C2=A0as akin to prosti=
tution, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi S=
ankara compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja compo=
sed in=C2=A0the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata a=
s well.=C2=A0So are so many great composers / poets. 
=C2=A0
Loving differe=
nt deities, and doing sadhana on one specific deity to attain self realizat=
ion are different. Ramakrishna too gives an example. A woman in a household=
 is courteous and nice to her father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law,=
 sister-in-law etc etc, but the relation she shares with her husband is uni=
que and cannot be replaced.=C2=A0Same way, love all deities and respect all=
 paths, but if one has to progress it has to be through one deity. That is =
what Vimalanada means. Trying to divide ones love/intensity equal among all=
 deities and all paths, in my humble opinion, is a recipie for definite lac=
k of progress.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Dear Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Excellent answers on each threa=

=C2=A0
Anywa=

2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda=
=C2=A0equates changing the=C2=A0loyalty from diety to diety=C2=A0as akin to=

a composed in=C2=A0the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaga=

Namaste,

> Ho=
w to achieve it effectivey?

If it can be achieved easily, we will not have=
 so many spiritual paths and so many sadhanas. All spiritual paths, scriptu=
res, teachings and spiritual sadhanas are meant for this only.

Vasishtha t=
eaches in Yoga Vaasishtham that one can read scriptures, contemplate their =
teachings, spend time in the company of spiritual people and engage in one'=
s natural activities with dispassion, in order to progress fast.

* * *

Le=
t me quote something from Ramakrishna. Look at your belongings (spouse, chi=
ldren, job, house, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the property=
 of god. Imagine that you are a temporary caretaker, just as a servant may =
be living in a rich person's house as the caretaker as that person stays aw=
ay. Think of all that is in your hands as the sacred property of your maste=
r and take care like a committed servant. A servant takes the best care of =
his master's property, but does not get attached. Do not be attached anythi=
ng and yet take the best possible care. If something goes wrong, do not wor=
ry too much and tell yourself that the master will take care of it when he =
gets a chance to look at it. Think for a moment how a servant taking care o=
f the properties of a master living away thinks and behaves.

If one can at=
tain the spirit and mental state of the servant in this analogy, one's life=
 will be made.

* * *

Read what Manish wrote below:

<<<<Once you take Tim=
e out of the equation (because a deity has a different time space frame whi=
ch runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waitin=
g with patience, then where will God go? God has to come, He can't escape.>=
>>>

Take time out of the equation, i.e. do not put a time limit or say "I =
have done this sadhana for XYZ years. Why is God not coming?" Wait patientl=
y. After all, if you have truly surrendered, why is it a problem then to wa=
it, let us say, 1000 years for Her grace? If you say "I want Her to come in=
 1 year or 10 years and not 1000 years", that means you have not fully surr=
endered.

* * *

> How to measure it?

One can measure it by seeing how one=
 is internally reacting to challenging circumstances that would earlier pro=
voke lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc inside one.

However, what will one do=
 by measuring? It is not like one can turn a knob based on the measurement =
to correct it.

In fact, when surrender is completeone you will stop measur=
ing or even thinking about how to measure it.

Best regards,
Narasimha
