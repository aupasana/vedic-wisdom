 Dr. K. Subrahmanian (1928-1998)

Dr. K. Subrahmanian's genuine love and de=
votion, insight, compassion and
selflessness formed a vortex that drew hund=
reds of devotees from Andhra
Pradesh into the shining presence of Sri Raman=
a Maharshi. In 1979, he
founded Sri Ramana Kendram in Hyderabad and continu=
ed to nurture it until
his final day in January of 1998.

The following is =
an extract from "Dr. K. Subrahmanian (1928-1998), A
Tribute", a book publis=
h by the Hyderabad Kendram in his memory. Dr. K.
Subrahmanian relates in hi=
s own words about his early years and how he was
naturally drawn to the Mah=
arshi, and also some anecdotes from his uncle's
life.

Coming into the Rama=
na Fold

Presentation Convent, the school that my father worked for, used t=
o prepare
children for taking the Cambridge University examination. The sch=
ool was run
by Irish nuns and almost all the children were European girls. =
My father was
the only male teacher for a number of years. In the 50s, one =
more male
teacher was appointed to teach Hindi.

As the winter vacation was=
 during Dec-Jan every year, my parents would go
from Kodaikanal to Tiruvann=
amalai to attend the Jayanti function. My father
used to take English veget=
ables grown in Kodaikanal to the Ashram for the
Jayanti celebrations. After=
 attending the Jayanti, my parents would go to my
father's village, Melvaya=
lamoor, which is about 20 miles from
Tiruvannamalai. I was taken to Sri Bha=
gavan when I was two years old. My two
younger sisters and I used to be tak=
en almost every year to Sri Ramanasramam
for the Jayanti celebrations. In o=
ur case we could say we were seen by Sri
Bhagavan first. We were conscious =
of seeing him much later.

My uncle, who looked after our lands in Melva-ya=
lamoor, was also a great
devotee of Sri Bhagavan and Nayana [Kavyakanta Gan=
apati Muni]. Both in my
house and in my uncle's house there was always a pi=
cture of Sri Bhagavan in
the puja room. If not every day, almost every week=
, there used to be some
discussion or the other about the life and teaching=
s of Sri Bhagavan. From
childhood I was brought up in a Bhagavan-charged at=
mosphere.

Viswanatha Swami visited our house and stayed with us for severa=
l days
together on numerous occasions. Later, when I was teaching at Madras=

Christian College, he stayed with me a couple of times. He used to spend
m=
uch of his time talking about the glory and grandeur of Sri Bhagavan and
Na=
yana. He taught us a number of devotional songs. He had a melodious voice
a=
nd could sing beautifully.

Hearing from my father, uncle and Viswanatha Sw=
ami that Sri Bhagavan used to
read the letters written by devotees to him, =
as a boy I used to write to him
occasionally, seeking his blessings. As the=
re was no high school in
Kodaikanal, my father sent me to study at Sir P.S.=
Sivaswami Iyer High
School, Tirukattupally. I studied there for four years =
between 1941-45, from
III Form to VI Form, and stayed in the hostel attache=
d to it.



Talking to Sri Bhagavan

In 1941, I was taken by my uncle to Sr=
i Ramanasramam. We had bought some
mangoes and my uncle said that I should =
put them on the small stool near Sri
Bhagavan's sofa. I went into the old m=
editation hall along with my uncle and
put the mangoes on the floor and pro=
strated before Sri Bhagavan and sat near
the window that now overlooks Sri =
Bhagavan's samadhi. My uncle sat next to
me. When I was looking at Sri Bhag=
avan, Sri Bhagavan asked my uncle, "Who is
this?" My uncle said, "He is my =
brother's son. He is studying in III Form."
Then Sri Bhagavan said, turning=
 to me, " So you are the person writing
letters to me." I had a strange fee=
ling of awe, coupled with great joy. I
said in a low voice, "Yes." Sri Bhag=
avan said, "Does your father send money
to you so that you can write letter=
s to me?" and laughed. I wasn't quite
sure whether Sri Bhagavan was being s=
arcastic or made the remark in a light
vein. I sweated for a while, continu=
ing to look at him. As it was early in
the morning, there were only two or =
three devotees in the hall. When we came
out of the hall after some time, m=
y uncle, who had been a frequent visitor
to the Ashram for several years, s=
aid, "You must consider yourself very
lucky. Sri Bhagavan usually does not =
ask `Who is he?' It is a rare thing."



Observing Sri Bhagavan

Till 1950,=
 I used to visit the Ashram a couple of times every year; the
frequency how=
ever increased between 1948 and 1950. I attended the
Kumbhabhishekam of the=
 Mathrubhuteswara Temple. It was an elaborate, solemn
affair. After the Kum=
bhabhishekam was performed, in the evening arati was
offered to the deity i=
n the temple and was brought to Sri Bhagavan by
Chinnaswami, Viswanatha Swa=
mi and President Venkataraman. I was sitting very
close to Sri Bhagavan in =
the meditation hall attached to the temple. It was
a moving sight when Sri =
Bhagavan extended his hands and touched the arati
with great reverence, clo=
sing his eyes.

Soon after each operation was performed on Sri Bhagavan's c=
ancer, I used to
visit him. Sometimes I used to cry uncontrollably looking =
at Sri Bhagavan
from a distance. As far as Sri Bhagavan was concerned, he w=
as ever the same
serene, blissful Self. He behaved as if the cancer belonge=
d to somebody
else.

The last time I saw Sri Bhagavan was on 7th April, 195=
0, exactly one week
before his nirvana. When I heard the news of Sri Bhagav=
an's nirvana at
Kodaikanal, on 14th April, 1950, I did not break down, nor =
did I feel
depressed. I felt a peace=E2=80=94a peace that was totally unexp=
ected. Viswanatha
Swami, whom I met a month later, also said that he enjoye=
d an indescribable
peace at the time of Sri Bhagavan's nirvana. He was one =
of the few who were
inside the room at the time Sri Bhagavan merged with Ar=
unachala.

I was taken to Sri Bhagavan as a small boy and I visited him man=
y times
later on, but I never put even a single question to him. I listened=
 to
others asking questions and Sri Bhagavan's replies to them, but I never=
 felt
inclined to ask a question even once. The only thing I used to do was=
 to sit
close to him and take leave of him after prostrating to him. Most o=
ften he
would nod his head or say in Tamil, "sari, sari" (O.K, O.K.).

Occa=
sionally I used to think that it would be good to read Sri Bhagavan's
works=
 in his presence. I tried a couple of times but I could not read
anything i=
n his presence. I was either looking at him or meditating.

Close Encounter=
s with Sri Bhagavan

Sometime in 1949, when Sri Bhagavan was still in the m=
editation hall, I sat
at the entrance looking at Sri Bhagavan from outside.=
 His shoulder was
bandaged because of cancer. I thought to myself: "I have =
been coming to the
Ashram so often. But I have had no experience of real me=
ditation. Sri
Bhagavan has not granted me this experience." Thinking along =
these lines, I
kept looking at Sri Bhagavan for a considerable time and the=
n closed my
eyes. I do not know how long I was in that state. When I opened=
 my eyes I
found that the meditation hall was empty. Sri Bhagavan was not t=
here on the
stone couch in the meditation hall. Sri Bhagavan and the devote=
es must have
gone past me as I was sitting at the entrance. When I realised=
 that I had
been sitting when Sri Bhagavan went past me, I was horrified. I=
 felt how
disrespectful I was. But suddenly, I realised that Sri Bhagavan, =
out of his
unbounded grace, granted me an experience whereby I was complete=
ly oblivious
of my surroundings.

Even today, I am unhappy that I did not g=
et up when Sri Bhagavan and his
devotees went past me. Sri Bhagavan gives u=
s rare experiences when we least
expect them.

On another occasion, when I =
was an 18-year-old student, around noon or so, I
was walking towards the me=
ditation hall. The new meditation hall was not
there then; the whole place =
was an open ground. I was thinking of something
and walking with my head do=
wn. When I neared the well, I looked up and saw
Sri Bhagavan standing at a =
short distance and talking to a devotee. I was
taken unawares as I did not =
expect Sri Bhagavan to be there. Sri Bhagavan
who was talking to the other =
person, looked at me sideways. I stood still,
as I did not want to disturb =
Sri Bhagavan in any way. When he looked at me
that way, I felt a powerful l=
ight penetrate me and engulf me. I experienced
a bliss that I had not exper=
ienced before. I was in that state for about
twenty days.

My uncle, V. S. =
Srinivas Iyer, did his Intermediate at Voorhese College,
Vellore and became=
 village Munsiff of Vailamoor village and worked in that
capacity for over =
forty years. He saw Sri Bhagavan even as a student. In the
early days, ther=
e used to be very few visitors to the Ashram, which was then
just a thatche=
d shed. Before he met Sri Bhagavan, my uncle had come under
the influence o=
f Kavyakanta and had taken upadesa from him. This fact is
mentioned in the =
Sanskrit biography of Kavyakanta, Vasishta Vaibhavam,
written by Kapali Sas=
try.

The first question that my uncle put to Sri Bhagavan as a young man w=
as, "Is
it true that Ravana had ten heads." Sri Bhagavan replied, "How does=
 it help
you to know whether he had ten heads or not?" My uncle said, "Naya=
na says it
is all false." Sri Bhagavan replied, "Nayana has studied a lot a=
nd has come
to certain conclusions. What do I know?" On another occasion my=
 uncle asked
Sri Bhagavan when he was going round the Hill, "Bhagavan, Naya=
na did tapas
for the freedom of this country. Do you think we will get free=
dom?" Sri
Bhagavan said, "Why do you ask me? Am I an astrologer?" After som=
e time, Sri
Bhagavan turned to my uncle and said, " Why do you worry? There=
 is a Supreme
Power which carries the whole burden. Our job is to do our wo=
rk and submit
to it."

Once an Ashram deer was attacked by some animal and =
the wounds turned from
bad to worse. Sri Bhagavan sat near the deer and hel=
d its face in his hands,
looking at its tearful eyes. Sri Bhagavan sat like=
 that for a couple of
hours. Chinnaswami asked my uncle who was standing cl=
ose to look after the
deer and relieve Sri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan heard thi=
s but did not make any
response. Sri Bhagavan sat there till the deer breat=
hed its last. That was
the compassion that Sri Bhagavan had for that deer. =
Soon after, Sri Bhagavan
went to the hall. There is a Samadhi for the deer =
in the Ashram.

When the Mathrubhuteswara Temple was being constructed, Sri=
 Bhagavan used to
help the construction workers by lifting the bricks and o=
ffering them to the
mason. When my uncle saw Sri Bhagavan doing this type o=
f work he was
astonished. Sri Bhagavan said to my uncle, "I am doing constr=
uction work."

He Said, "It is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, th=
at he is loved,
but for one's own sake that he is loved. It is not for the =
sake of the wife,
my dear, that she is loved, but for one's own sake that s=
he is loved. It is
not for the sake of the sons, my dear, that they are lov=
ed, but for one's
own sake that they are loved.... It is not for the sake o=
f all, my dear,
that all is loved, but for one's own sake that it is loved.=
 The Self, my
dear Maitrey, should be realized, should be heard of, reflect=
ed on and
meditated upon. When the Self, my dear, is realized by being hear=
d of,
reflected on and meditated upon, all this is known." =E2=80=94 Brhada=
ranyaka
Upanishad, Chapt. IV, verse 6

 tearful eyes. Sri Bhagavan sat like that for a couple of hours. Chinnaswam=
i asked my uncle who was standing close to look after the deer and relieve =
Sri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan heard this but did not make any response. Sri Bh=
