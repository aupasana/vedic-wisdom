Yes Sir, if this is the r=
eason then its understandable. Infact, There are several people close to me=
 have started reciting Chandi in regional lagnuages as suggested by me. hen=
ce practically, its the same as you suggested. However i feel that at some =
point its better to be able to recite Sanskrit verses.
***
You have already=
 written a very detailed account wherein i got some informations which i ne=
ver knew.

Only one opinion i wish to know from you is about "Satsanga". yo=
u have given the prime importance to that over everything else.
Narasimha G=
aru has few times repeated that "Pavaka" is a yogi and living god. when one=
 does Homam everyday, He/she actually gets a very effective Satsanga with a=
 Yogi called Agni-The Pavaka.
In that sense, Homam is also a ritual which a=
utomatically provides you with much required Satsanga as well. Whats your o=
pinion on this.

Please take your time!

Best Regards,

Utpal

summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand=
 the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a =
general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether init=
iation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answe=
r is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated=
 for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=
=80=93YES.
> >

hereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arise=
s the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context the=
re are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question =
I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion=
.

ritual)

iritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Trut=
hs of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and=
 techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experi=
ential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques em=
ployed by each of these paths.
> > For those who are predominantly oriented=
 to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessar=
y, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genui=
ne teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Di=
scernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmi=
nation of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhya=
ya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=
e practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for extern=
al practices.
> > 
> > Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by cons=
istent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu sch=
ools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself t=
owards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga =
emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.
> > 
> > =
Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara'=
s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis=
 in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in=
 actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga o=
f the Gita.
> > 
> > Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadh=
ana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the nece=
ssity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of cer=
tain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Va=
k. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereb=
y certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that exce=
pt Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bha=
kti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-=
Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the =
fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of aust=
erity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.
> > 
> > =
Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab=
-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniqu=
es that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhi=
kara is not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a=
 child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor=
 need experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper =
training and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety=
 measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one's own =
consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the indiv=
idual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a=
 topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion=
 on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will j=
ust elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.
> > 
> > Since we are talki=
ng about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tant=
ric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric contex=
t. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. H=
owever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living =
traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri S=
ri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to S=
rikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Bud=
dhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan B=
uddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajraya=
na shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its ap=
proach to sadhana.
> > 
> > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not tha=
t Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at=
 least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantr=
a, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of sy=
nchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the=
 full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage=
 of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TRE=
E with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch an=
d sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individ=
ual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another mo=
dern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Ta=
ntric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for=
 the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many b=
eautiful
 bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, w=
here there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the =
way up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Soun=
d (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.
> > 
> > As already stated Sakta sad=
hana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an i=
ntegrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Jap=
a and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehens=
ive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the =
One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it=
 is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is a=
lso simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The questi=
on of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and th=
us employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text=
 as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covere=
d extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Adv=
aitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful refl=
ections through its central message
 of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crown=
ing glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims i=
n full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying=
 "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Co=
mpare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the cen=
tral truth of Advaita.

s some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sad=
hana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to t=

tion is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara=

of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not requ=

Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chan=

; I am Satya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the las=
t 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to vario=
us reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet for=
um. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with=
 my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through =
some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far bett=
er and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed thro=
ugh this particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji's ques=
tion.<BR>> > <BR>> > Utpal ji has raised an important question =
regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing =
the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE que=
stion and the MANY answers
 possible. Firstly is the question a general or =
specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is a=
n absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. H=
owever if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra=
 sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.<B=
R>> > <BR>> > 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric adage g=
oes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus=
 arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian conte=
xt there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this que=
stion I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the disc=
ussion.<BR>> > <BR>> > a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)<BR>&g=
t; > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)<BR>> > c. Mantra marga (Tant=
ric)<BR>> > d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)<BR>> > e. Karma mar=
ga (Action- Ritual path and/or
 Selfless Actions)<BR>> > <BR>> >=
; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract =
Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods=
 and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an ex=
periential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ technique=
s employed by each of these paths.<BR>> > For those who are predomina=
ntly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is=
 not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experien=
ce of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods =
of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essent=
ially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practic=
e of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice=
. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal ro=
le for external
 practices.<BR>> > <BR>> > Yoga marga emphasise=
s Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivi=
ty or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswara=
pranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddh=
a and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscr=
ibe to nirishwaravada.<BR>> > <BR>> > Bhakti marga (Love/Devoti=
on) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will through total surr=
ender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Act=
ion as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachme=
nt to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.<BR>> > =
<BR>> > Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana whe=
re alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity o=
f a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain oc=
cult
 truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It =
presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby cert=
ain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bha=
kti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti pr=
edominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someey=
am'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire o=
f the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity,=
 and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.<BR>> > <B=
R>> > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak thr=
ough the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly power=
ful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on ad=
hikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification. Would=
 you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does
 t=
he supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab exper=
iment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart from c=
ertain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab =
is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti wit=
hin the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As =
this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from furth=
er discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details h=
ere, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.<BR>> > <=
BR>> > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextu=
alise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major =
river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sa=
kta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major school=
s that are full-fledged living traditions among the
 DashaMahaVidyas- Kalik=
ula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whils=
t Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more compl=
ete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those=
 who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21=
 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well=
 as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.<BR>> > <BR>> &g=
t; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at =
all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major miles=
tones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, =
etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies f=
or each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of th=
e practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The=
 Guru parampara can be compared to an
 INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at t=
he root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs=
 spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a bea=
utiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one c=
an use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that init=
iation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electric=
ity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at=
 each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long seri=
es of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.=
 It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sr=
i Sri Chandi.<BR>> > <BR>> > As already stated Sakta sadhana se=
eks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrat=
ed approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and M=
antra. Both Kalikula and
 Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive an=
d integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. S=
ri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is al=
so a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also si=
multaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of =
initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus emp=
loying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a =
yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered exte=
nsively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic =
path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflection=
s through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glo=
ry in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-=
fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alo=
ne exist in this
 universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare =
it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central t=
ruth of Advaita.<BR>> > <BR>> > The reason I advised the non-in=
itiate to read in English or any other regional language is because underst=
anding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repea=
tedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follow. The main ide=
a of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too a=
part from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also=
 equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hy=
mns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhit=
a are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi=
 *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will stra=
ightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even t=
he worship
 of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVE=
D from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.<BR=
>> > <BR>> > Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an inte=
gral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, =
there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as pe=
r the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as=
 per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Veda=
ntic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya,=
 or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth.=
 Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predomina=
ntly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of t=
hese approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the=
 living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as
 pr=
acticed originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace th=
emselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those p=
aths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<BR>> > <BR>> > In summ=
ary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the merthods/practices =
using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa=
, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. Howeve=
r depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., some of these met=
hods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One may progres=
s through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. However =
the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha t=
oo. It is this big picture against which the answer to the question has to =
be contextualised.<BR>> > <BR>> > Finally one last word. Irresp=
ective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the
 most effect=
ive methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followe=
d by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in =
a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FI=
RST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (t=
hough not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and=
 satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life.=
 Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, list=
ening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younge=
r days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their=
 spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivritti=
nath and Matsyendranath respectively.<BR>> > <BR>> > For those =
who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Sw=
ami Sivananda:<BR>> > QUOTE // "There is a
 complaint by householders=
 nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The compa=
ny of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere dema=
nd, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If =
you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You le=
ad a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. =
You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle g=
ossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passi=
on, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Sats=
anga.'... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shal=

 path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These "oversouls" or h=
igh souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas =
are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If
 you bring a charge, "There are no =
good Mahatmas." Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, "There are no real se=
ekers after Truth."." //UNQUOTE<BR>> > <BR>> > To a certain ext=

4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fi=

 this=
 analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a=
 fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good =
fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and th=
e spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is =
aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fru=
its on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be =
retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity=
 is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good=
 fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, V=
ishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spil=
lage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Nar=
asimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.<BR>>=

 that these fru=

good fruits!<BR>> > > ><BR>> > > > Nevertheless, on=
e unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoidi=

 If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your =

weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.<BR>> > > ><BR>> >=
