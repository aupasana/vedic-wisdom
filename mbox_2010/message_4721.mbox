 10th November, 1936

Talk 279.

D.: How long does it take a man to be rebo=
rn after death? Is it immediately
after death or some time after?

M.: You =
do not know what you were before birth, yet you want to know what
you will =
be after death. Do you know what you are now?

Birth and rebirth pertain to=
 the body. You are identifying the Self with the
body. It is a wrong identi=
fication. You believe that the body has been born
and will die, and confoun=
d the phenomena relating to the one with the other.
Know your real being an=
d these questions will not arise.

Birth and rebirth are mentioned only to =
make you investigate the question
and find out that there are neither birth=
s nor rebirths. They relate to the
body and not to the Self. Know the Self =
and be not perturbed by doubts.
