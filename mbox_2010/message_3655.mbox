Namaste,

One last thing and excuse me for the deviation from the subject.
=

I was thinking about Shri Krushna himself as an example (for the particula=
r verse of Bhagvad Gita) but i was engrossed in Aghora reading and postpone=
d to write.

In the morning i am seeing that Narasimha has given Shri Krish=
na's example much the same way as i thought during previous night.

Dear KK=
, Lord himself has given that verse in Gita but how many of us can literall=
y follow his *Actions* who has instructed this very verse. It is impossible=
. One will be very happy and excited to have many wives and sport with many=
 women in a pond while putting the blame on Krushna and Gopis but other tha=
n that nothing is possible to emulate willingly or unwillingly.
Many wise p=
eople have said and it's a common saying amongst Guajaratis (and perhaps in=
 whole of India) which goes like this - "Live your life as Rama lived and a=
s Krushna Instructed"

There are at least a couple of more verses in Bhagva=
d Gita which is like wise misunderstood by many of us today and can not be =
taken literally IMHO.

Best Regards,

Utpal

ic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew =
tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There wo=

 is extremely important.

 swami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested s=
