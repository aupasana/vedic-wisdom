Inner truths and truths within truths ar=
e the obstacles to people that refuse to see the outer truths that can be s=
een with open eyes. meditating with closed eyes and accepting everything th=
at is dished out by people a third of your age - It is the right of the agi=
ng to walk and talk - And that freedom would have been obtained if there wa=
s a proper grounding in study of your own language - sanskrit - from an ear=
ly age. you would have read the texts proper rather than pass the exam quic=
k study guides.

Dont blame the system - it is the you. If you are in your =
homes - good - thank your children that have not put you in some home for t=
he aged to sit in a corner and meditate until you are blue.

A few tips to =
the aging and aged - 

1. adhArmika mAdhyam for dhArmika ends is a joke. If=
 your computer has pirated microsoft windows or software get rid of it. Buy=
 legal copies.

2. If you have a legal copy then you have Accesibility tool=
s that are a must in all purchased software.

2a. The problem of eyesight s=
owly deteriorating with advancing age is common - this must be corrected - =
Your operating system Windows has a magnifier that you can use with remarka=
ble ease. If you feel shy then think of Stephen Hawkins - he uses more acce=
ssibility tools than most of us ever need.

Menu route - Start - All Progra=
ms - Accesories - Accesibility - Magnifier

2b. The problem of pain in the =
fingers and looking up and down to type from the plastic key board can beco=
me a deterrant for your work.
The On Screen Virtual Keyboard is answer 

Me=

board

It is not only sanskrit that has my interest - I hve the entire word=
 by word tolkappIyam in analyzable format - although this is not my mother =
tongue to see the real truths in the Aryan - Dravidian divide This should h=
ave been done by scholars or myself years ago - 

I have uploaded a file in=
 the files section - that has the following

My favourite quote is from Gro=
ucho Marx - "I dont want to member of any club that will have me" - yet I a=
m choosing to ignore warnings of my, heaven's sake attitude - And not walki=
ng out - like a sanyasin - I choose to ban groups from my list of vaidika g=
roups. That is the crux of the problem - fearful people trying to bend back=
wards... It definitely is physical impossibility to fold people that ways.

Akshara-the bases - of vyAkarNA- and veda vAk - 
Dedicated to the Adi sha~=
gkara that cheesed off me with is comment on vyAkarNa
his "ai giri..." cann=
ot be understand if you don't know what "ai" is
vAk has traditional origins=
 - para - paShyanti - mAdhyama and vAk
para is the seed of thought originat=
ing in the mahat - by grace of the universal forces - 
paShyanti is the act=
ual visualization of the growth and fructification of the the thought
mAdhy=
ama is the search that mahat - the brain does for expressing the thought
vA=
k is the final uttered speech
The expression and coinjoints of the elements=
 of vAk are bound by rules of grammar
And this is the reason why veda param=
para is the specific way of intonation of the
veda mantra - Saying it any o=
ther way destroys the intended meaning. Each veda mantra
has RuShi, Chandas=
, devata, khIlakam and a few other parameters - All of these are
are needed=
 to understand and use the veda mantra.

Some of these notably the RuShi, d=
evata and Chandas have been disappearing from the texts available
That each=
 mantra is dedicated to a specific deva is significant that Hinduism is abo=
ut multiple Gods and elements
that humans must respect - Book marked texts =
as PDF files are available to Indians and Hindus only on mailing
