So far it is fine.

to be initiated to chant a
stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with=
 most mantras. Mantras
containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of M=
ahavidyas etc need
initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from t=
he Veda Samhita are
not the same as these other mantras that need initiatio=
n, which are
generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you =
call these
mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts=
 of larger
and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in =
the case of
Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.
> 
> 5. Vishnusahasranama, Siva=
sahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need
initiation as they fall under s=
totra category only. Lalitasahasranama and
Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally=
 viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of
puranas. They have a larger statu=
s as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana.
Chanting them without initiatio=
n is not recommended especially when the
reader combines the navarna or sho=
dashi mantras too as an integral part of
the chanting.
>

personal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi
as well as Srin=
geri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of
Sri Sri Chand=
i and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND
SHODASAKSHARI ma=
ntras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the
sadhana. Acharyas=
 of both these traditions hold that one needs to be
initiated to chant the =
Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.
> 
> 7. Recapping my earlier sta=
nce, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an
independent status by itsel=
f as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a
Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as=
 well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the
Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidy=
a the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri
Chandi path***. Thus tradit=
ion holds that one needs to be initiated to chant
it. However if one wishes=
 to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth
aspects of the Devi Mahatm=
yam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular
has been recommended in my=
 write-up, as chanting the original along with the
navakshari amounts to pr=
acticing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it
is recommended to be i=
nitiated and go through the specialised sadhanas
properly under guidance.
>=
 
> 8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the
or=
iginal Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya,
=
it has an inherent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do =
a
parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that
=
most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or
stotr=
as such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.

Neither h=

mantras do not=
 have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak.
However it is recom=

while chanting it. Infact `artha' is the import, the

 tradition
makes a distinction between them.<br>

stotra or d=
hyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras
containing bija=
ksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need
initiation. This is=
 the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not
the same as th=
ese other mantras that need initiation, which are generally
referred to as =
Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the
actual idea is =
that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct
spiritual spec=
ialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such
as Kali or=
 Sri.<br>
> <br>

yam etc do not need initiation
as they fall under stotra category only. Lal=
itasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam
are traditionally viewed not MERELY as st=
otras or parts of puranas. They have a
larger status as integral parts of a=
 Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without
initiation is not recommended esp=
ecially when the reader combines the navarna
or shodashi mantras too as an =
integral part of the chanting.<br>
> <br>
> 6. I know from personal i=
nteraction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi
as well as Sringeri param=
paras recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of
Sri Sri Chandi and Sri =
Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND
SHODASAKSHARI mantras whic=
h are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the
sadhana. Acharyas of both t=
hese traditions hold that one needs to be initiated to
chant the Navarna as=
 well as shodashakshari mantras.<br>
> <br>
> 7. Recapping my earlier=
 stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an
independent status by i=
tself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a
Mahavidya, a Yogasastr=
a as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the
Upanishads. ***As a Maha=
vidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri
Chandi path***. Thus tr=
adition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant
it. However if one wi=
shes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects
of the Devi Ma=
hatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been
recommended i=
n my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navakshari
amounts t=
o practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is
recommended to =
be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly
under guidanc=
e.<br>
> <br>
> 8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi M=
ahatmyam in the
original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and no=
t as a Mahavidya, it
has an inherent problem in our times. The problem with=
 attempting to do a
parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without in=
itiation) is that most
readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navar=
na mantra or stotras such
as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain th=
e bijaksharas.<br>
> <br>
> 9. I you carefully peruse my write-up on =
the Devi Mahatmyam, forget
translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna m=
antra even in writing. Neither
have I attempted to write a commentary on it=
. Translations of mantras do not
have the power of the original mantra as S=
abda or Vak. However it is
recommended to know the essence or import (artha=
) of the mantra and its sadhana
while chanting it. Infact `artha' is the im=
port, the essence of `Vak', not a

those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without
initiation, there i=

it. Otherwis=

keep doing=
 whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana.
As Nara=
simha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana
