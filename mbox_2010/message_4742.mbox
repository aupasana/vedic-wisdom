 "Spiritual practice is the enquiry to find
out to whom all these doubts ar=
ise."

"Go within and find the route. You
cannot find it externally;
nor sh=
ould you seek it there."

"Misery is removed. That is our aim.
You do not a=
cquire happiness: your
very nature is happiness. Bliss is
not newly earned.=
 All that is done
is to remove unhappiness.
These methods suffice."

[from]=
 Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 30, 1936-

"Yes. Practice is ne=
cessary, too.
Practice means removal of pre-
dispositions.
Practice is not =
for fresh gain;
it is to kill the predispositions."

"Inquire into the Self=
.
That is all.
Fix the mind on the Self."

"Finding God within is the aim,
=
what else can there be?
Everything depends on one's practice."

[from Talks=
 with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 30, 1936-

"There is the absolute Sel=
f from which a spark
proceeds as from fire. The spark is called the ego.
In=
 the case of an ignorant man, it identifies itself
with an object simultane=
ous with its rise. It can
not remain independent of such association with
o=
bjects. This association is ignorance, whose
destruction is the objective o=
f our efforts.
If its objectifying tendency is killed, it remains
pure and =
also merges into the source. The
wrong identification with the body is the
=
I-am-the-body idea.
This must go before good results can follow."

[from] T=
alks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 18, 1936-

"Peace is your real na=
ture. Contrary ideas are only
superimpositions. This is true worship, true =
yoga,
and true wisdom.
You may say that this peace is acquired by practice.=

The wrong notions are given up by practice. That is
all. Your true nature =
always persists."

"The Heart is the Self. It is neither within nor without=
.
The mind is its active energy. After emergence of
the mind, the universe =
appears and the body is
seen to be contained in it.
All these are contained=
 in the Self
and cannot exist apart from It."

[from] Talks with Ramana Mah=
arshi

-recorded, Dec 13, 1936-

"Limitation is only in the mind.
Did you f=
eel it in deep sleep?
You exist in sleep. You do not
deny your existence th=
en. The
same Self is now and here, in
the wakeful state. You are now
saying=
 there are limitations.
What has happened is that
there are these differenc=
es
between the two states. The
differences are due solely to
the mind. Ther=
e was no mind in
deep sleep, whereas it is now
active.
The Self exists in t=
he absence
of the mind, also."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorde=
d, Dec 13, 1936-

"Ego is not an entity independent
of the Self in order th=
at it must be
created or destroyed by itself.
It functions as an instrument=
 of
the Self and periodically ceases
to function. That is to say it
appears=
 and disappears; this
might be considered to be
birth and death."

[from] T=
alks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 18, 1936-

"Peace is our real nat=
ure. It need not be attained.
Our thoughts must be obliterated. Whenever mi=
nd
strays, bring it back to meditation."

"Grace is the force that can help=
 you. Individually,
we are incapable because the mind is weak.
Grace is nec=
essary; serving God is meant for
only that."

"What there is
is only grace.=

There is nothing else."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov=
 27, 1936-

"There is no duality.
Your present knowledge
is due to the ego
=
and only relative.
Relative knowledge
requires a subject
and an object,
whe=
reas the awareness
of the Self is absolute
and requires no object."

Moksha is to know th=
at you were not born. =E2=80=9CBe still and know that I am God.=E2=80=9D

T=
o be still is not to think. Know, and not think, is the word.

"The person may call himself
my disciple or devotee. I do
not conside=
r anyone to be my
disciple.....if people call them-
selves my disciples, I =
neither
approve or disapprove. In my
view, all are alike. They con-
sider t=
hemselves fit for being
called disciples. What can I say
to them? I do not =
call myself a
disciple or a Guru."
