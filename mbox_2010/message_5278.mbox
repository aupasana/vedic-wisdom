Namaste Atul ji,

Thank you very much for this brilliant and matter of fact=
 free-wheeling thoughts. It made a very nice read really!

>Although at lat=
er stage Vivekananda achieved lot of Siddhi by >himself.

It may well be tr=
ue; however, one more thing i wish to point out that Thakur Ramakrishna tra=
nsferred all his power (probably it may mean all Siddhis attained by him) t=
o Vivekananda at the end while saying something like this: "Noren, I gave a=
way everything to you and now I became empty"

Warm Regards,

Utpal

 sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as his guru acknowledged that=
