Namaste,

Rajarshi, your whole experience seems like an important move in t=
he chess
game that is being played by Nature. Thanks to the exceptional nar=
rator in
you for describing it so well.

What is the importance of 3 days t=
hat many yogis pick it for events in their
saadhana? Notice Manish and Baba=
 Bhagwan Ram did it in this article. Is
there any important reason behind t=
his? Or is it a mere coincidence?

-Kishore

 of 3 days that many yogis pick it for events in their saadhana? Notice Man=

<div>Namaste =
All,</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>While re reading my mails after I sent them =
to the list, I found many silly errors of spelling and grammer. I was writi=
ng in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and =
read through them. As they say, "Bhavnayoko samjho!".</div>

<div=
>=A0</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>During the day time, we roame=
d around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any =
of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, "What about the temples? Won'=
t we visit them?". Manish retorted immediately, "=A0Aren't we=
=A0going to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?"! I silently=
 agreed. This is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters t=
emples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roa=
dside temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then r=
emark, "There is something here."</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Duri=
ng evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori=
 who lived in Kasi=A0during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sth=
al. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the =
Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong energies in here. =
Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=A0 pranam=A0at the samadhi of =
Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had =
entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Ma=
nikarnika Samshan.=A0 Manish, on being=A0questioned, said that many sadhana=
s have been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desi=
res. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashr=
am we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Mani=
sh called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to Engli=
sh, it read, "If you have to give your head
 off to get a sadguru, you=
 have=A0got it cheap".</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>By 8 PM we sat for di=
nner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before =
going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while perfor=
ming any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is=
 fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ide=
as/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the=
 subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to &quo=
t;digest" various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only increase when the=
 Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are ext=
remely focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget foo=
d, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and dec=
rease in Jathara Agni.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>As we sat eating our food=
 and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation men=
tioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Man=
ish, Arunisha and=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<=
div>Manish said, "It is the same set of=A0souls who come back=A0again =
and again in different bodies and personalities at different times, who=A0a=
re responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was=
 Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc." He con=
tinued, "They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is nec=
essary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected t=
o this land=A0which we call India=A0today.This land is connected to the Ris=
his. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.=A0Prithviraj=
 made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman =
who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently contemplated her fa=
te.=A0</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>"One very senior Rishi has decided t=
o=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=A0Ved=
=A0Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing=
, however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or=A0group,=A0can stand =
against the will of a Rishi."=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent question h=
ere. "What were the Rishis doing for=A0one thousand years?". Mani=
sh laughed and said, " A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years si=
mply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=A0one day=A0wake up from meditat=
ion=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=A0and all sorts of non-spiritual th=
ings going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create the=
 Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi=
 is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child's play for=
 Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so =
important to keep
 doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.</div>
<div>=
=A0</div>
<div>As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Mani=
karnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarni=
ka, for now. We walked long the=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if =
it is ok doing a=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=A0yes why not,=
 but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie=
 is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest c=
onsciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind su=
ch that it can hold shakti=A0for which=A0worshipping the divine Mother is t=
he best way.=A0That is why Vimalananda says, "Let the Mother show you =
the face of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said=
, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exis=
ts powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahaka=
la sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then staring at the pitch black gange=
s,
 Manish chuckled lightly and added, "That man was something." =
This was again an old conversation we had started=A0before which Mainsh con=
tinued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda=
 were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity=
 flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has cr=
eated a army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books=A0are like =
a Bible=A0for sadhakas,=A0arn't they?". "Yes" said Manis=
h. Later on I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, =
to which Manish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. Howev=
er, the important question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I =
fell silent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora seri=
es, Vimalanda does mention that a time will come when his "children&qu=
ot; would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things=
 run. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>We reached the samshan by half past twelv=
e. This time we sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of =
homa. The fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish sta=
rted the homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fi=
re. Now this did not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish=
 would slowly lift his=A0palm upwards=A0and with the next ahuti=A0immediate=
ly the fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=A0the fl=
ames were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on =
the samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was workin=
g on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". =
Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahadev". This homa was faster. H=
e did not use any "samputs", but a direct, straight Chandi homa. =
Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around som=
e of the coconut pieces to make them
 burn properly. I was enjoying it. A f=
ew people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a r=
ule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the=
 head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom R=
aja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram B=
aba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because o=
f this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. =
I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many people in the s=
amshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run=
 away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there are people h=
ere even so late in the night.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Once the final pu=
rnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster =
than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At on=
e point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across the l=
ength and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my ey=
es after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an =
hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. The=
n a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his=
 eyes. Manish remarked, " I could have just left my body and gone off.=
 It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything e=
lse. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought m=
e back." Smiling he added, "What a sight it would have been for t=
he people to see, how the body can be left at will".=A0 I did not know=
 what to say. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>We stood there watching another p=
yre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=
=A0red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick in=
serted it (the bamboo stick)=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the =
burning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in the midd=
le of the pyre. The smooth=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sti=
cking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=A0into the thin, dark, night-ai=
r reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=A0or veget=
ables, both dead -=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling=
, "Maza aya?". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commente=
d=A0that I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let peopl=
e know.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>By this time I remembered that when I wa=
s sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=A0had run off with one of my c=
happals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Leave the ot=
her chappal here as well." Manish said we had a rna with this samshan.=
 We had been here before, in some life.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>As we we=
re returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=A0of Shiva'=
;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "safe&qu=
ot; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. Th=
e trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary =
disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even=
 at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intent=
ions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.<=
/div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>While walking along the ghats=A0which were=A0tot=
ally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi w=
as becoming loose, I caught hold of it=A0with one=A0hand and kept moving fa=
st, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got som=
e smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of hee=
na. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of si=
milar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are=
 out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not mov=
e too close to the water=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the wate=
r. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protectio=
n of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba=
 (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges =
24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam=
 around
 naked. It is their city.</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>Next morning, a=
s we sat recollecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked about Ve=
das.=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=A0A=
ghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must get the in=
tonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=A0enquired that I =
had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be done before one=
 starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=A0laughed and replied,=A0"K=
arna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!".=A0I was dumbs=
truck.=A0</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>While talking about Ramayana with Arun=
isha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=
=A0"The color of Rama's body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=
=A0around him. Like a sun blazing. That=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by =
Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable=
. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=A0is so fast that a =
normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a f=
orest of Ashuras.=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=A0mantra shak=
ti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right=
 hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=A0command f=
rom his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<di=
v>And Rama removed even=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal hum=
an being when he defeated Ravana which=A0means; he even removed the last ve=
stige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder =
then, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the n=
ame of Sri Rama?". </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>He spoke with such an e=
nergy which cannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naa=
m Satya Hai.</div>

try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Ma=
nish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=A0I was only doing the Chandi =
Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try o=
ut this sadhana. </li>

<div>=A0</div>
<ul>
<li>Many people have a neg=
ative=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack =
of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadha=
nas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films etc of A=
ghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect.=
 They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts start wi=
th many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach th=
e same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. =
Some like it, some don't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path b=
ut at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great =
saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is consid=
ered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swa=
mi was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended=
 to give a first hand
 objective=A0account of how a powerful sadhana in the=
 samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.</li></ul>
<di=
v>=A0</div>
<ul>
<li>There are many people in this age who have a desire fo=
r these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have =
no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=A0people t=
hat these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of ima=
gination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years=
 ago. But to go about it and=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just li=
ke everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doi=
ng sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=A0and let Nature deci=
de. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the de=
sire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day mak=
e arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individual=A0because f=
or Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=A0kind.=A0 In the intruduction=
 to "Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimalanada says :</li>

<div>Back to the =
narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said i=
t is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this=
 night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking towards M=
anikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on =
any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of=
 dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering =
if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chantin=
g a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coin=
cidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who=
 chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, "Sometim=
es a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breech=
es".</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish sa=
id this is a wonderful place.=A0I did not think too much about it then sinc=
e my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. Th=
e next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting,=
 I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Ma=
nish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya an=
d the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I kne=
w that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did=
 not say anything.=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who wa=
s from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to=
 stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed i=
diot.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika a=
nd again it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went =
right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, =
again people started staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us t=
o pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle=
, with Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them=
 burning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a single minu=
te when there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of t=
he Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was =
observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next=
 to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Befor=
e I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the =
samshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but there is something else as well. I di=
d not ask him
 what. So we went to another side. The dom there came forward=
 and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate =
ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and as=
ked the people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. He sa=
id the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'=
;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space =
for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to d=
isturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Man=
ikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not here. Mani=
sh later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been do=
ne in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsle=
ves seen these things or heard from their families and thus they do not dis=
turb. </div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =
was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =
was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=
inutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=
 because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose thi=
s specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense=
 perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Eve=
ry now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently =
for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, =
everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the =
dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt =
a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being s=
uch an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of =
the Chandi
 path=A0I could hear chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and=
 relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. </div>
<div>=A0</di=
v>
<div>Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I s=
aw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at that. La=
ter Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and leavin=
g the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path=
 was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass=
 over=A0the pages of the=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was sta=
nding behind me.=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one=
 behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did =
not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quo=
t;all iz well"-:).=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity=
 often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=
=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this can=A0happen not just in a=
 samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing
 sadhana.</=
div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut=
 rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes us=
e to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=A0=
had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural st=
roking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=A0there was any =
company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily take it.=
 What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=A0Interest=
ingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconut while buy=
ing the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood why.</div>

<div>=
=A0</div>
<div>In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the=
 relatives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body=
 was in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to w=
ait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did not know wha=
t to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing =
evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the p=
erson was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of the re=
latives came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge=
". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the=
 homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the sk=
in on the corpse=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burn=
ing. It was a sight to see!</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>There is a tradition=
 of pouring Ganges water=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear t=
he domes telling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything=
 there without permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manis=
h and=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in =
a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won't die. They=
 poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. =
It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called th=
e people and said, " Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quo=
t;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fire. T=
hen they wanted to touch=A0Manish's feet, but Manish would not let them=
 do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals we =
had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly=
 the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had
 addressed earlier) came run=
ning with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Mani=
sh consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everythin=
g is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of the day =
he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person sudden=
ly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=
=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query asked h=
im where was he from, the person replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish advised h=
im to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary p=
eople of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our land and =
culture is still so alive. We city bred 'educated'=A0people are too=
 rational to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculatin=
g. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt=
 as if my body existed only from my
 head to my heart, there was nothing be=
low, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I=
 told Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one word reply, "Goo=
d".</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>As we were=
 walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "There is a forei=
gner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perfor=
m sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her w=
hile meditating." For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is pr=
actically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of g=
reat calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogin=
i, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I men=
tioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the b=
anks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had see=
n last night in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, but di=
rectionless. " At that time there was nothing more we could do. I gues=
s that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, in=
stead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=A0so that you are
 ready=
 when Nature decides to give you a push. </div>
<div>=A0</div>
<div>After p=
assing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika=
 from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Ma=
nish's camera hanging from his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish smiled a=
nd said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize =
us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering wh=
at is going on.</div>

<div>=A0</div>
<div>Thus ended my second day of obse=
rving a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kas=
