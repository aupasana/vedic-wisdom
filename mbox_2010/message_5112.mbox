Dear Satya Prakash ji,

Thank you for your beautiful=C2=A0analysis of Sri S=
ri Chandi. I read it and reflected 
on it, and in my limited understand I a=
gree to most of what you have said. 
Specially your explanation pertaining =
to=C2=A0Chand-munda and=C2=A0Sumbha-Nishumbh were 
awesome!

I have a quest=
ion about your following paragraph:

<<there are those who adhere to the Ta=
ntric approach and do the sadhana as per 
the mantra marga. It is this part=
icular approach that needs initiation as per 
its own principles. Initiatio=
n is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path 
of Viveka and Vichara, =
or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the 
Pauranic approach o=
f reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam 
too is not requ=
ired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice 
of Ritual=
/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri 
Ch=
andi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditi=
ons 
of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various=
 parts of 
the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and=
 hence the 
importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi =
or Sri Vidya.>>


1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to different p=
aramparas within the 
broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the initia=
tion in Chandi sadhana in 
required for not only the parayana but also (mos=
tly?) because of the main 
mantra. Normally we are accustomed with only the=
 navarna mantra, but there are 
various other mantras of the different aspe=
cts of the Universal Chandi, of which 
the navarna we know of, is probably =
the mildest. To chant one of these mantras 
and awaken the same needs initi=
ation. This, they said, is a part of the entire 
Chandi sadhana.=C2=A0What=
=C2=A0is your opinion on this?

2) As a corollary to your above paragraph, =
one can therefore read the text of 
the Chandi in a pouranik approach, as a=
 sacred myth? There are people, specially 
in Bengal, who do a Chandipath o=
n their own without having undergone any formal 
initiation. How good or ba=
d is this practise?

-Regards

<DIV>Dear Satya Prakash ji,</DIV>
<DIV> </=
DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for your beautiful analysis of Sri Sri Chandi. I r=
ead it and reflected on it, and in my limited understand I agree to most of=
 what you have said. Specially your explanation pertaining to Chand-mu=
nda and Sumbha-Nishumbh were awesome!</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I h=
ave a question about your following paragraph:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
><<there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadh=
ana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs init=
iation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts=
 the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and =
Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sac=
red Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the =
predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or=
 all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind=
 that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Sriku=
la as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally =
trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for=
 those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.>></DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to =
different paramparas within the broader subset of Kalikula. They said that =
the initiation in Chandi sadhana in required for not only the parayana but =
also (mostly?) because of the main mantra. Normally we are accustomed with =
only the navarna mantra, but there are various other mantras of the differe=
nt aspects of the Universal Chandi, of which the navarna we know of, is pro=
bably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras and awaken the same needs =
initiation. This, they said, is a part of the entire Chandi sadhana. W=
hat is your opinion on this?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>2) As a coro=
llary to your above paragraph, one can therefore read the text of the Chand=
i in a pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? There are people, specially in =
Bengal, who do a Chandipath on their own without having undergone any forma=
l initiation. How good or bad is this practise?</DIV>

</A><BR>> Subject: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Mea=
ning)<BR>> <BR>> Namaste friends,<BR>> <BR>> All Glories to the=
 Goddess!<BR>> <BR>> I am Satya Prakash, the author of the write-up p=
osted here. Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from int=
ernet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I inte=
racted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy =
of the original post with my write up
 to my inbox, I visited this forum an=
d quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general a=
tmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. H=
aving quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I migh=
t reply to Utpal ji's question.<BR>> <BR>> Utpal ji has raised an imp=
ortant question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it af=
ter summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to unders=
tand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the questio=
n a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether =
initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* a=
nswer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being initi=
ated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is YES.<B=
R>> <BR>> 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric adage goes; there=
by the necessity for multiple
 approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises t=
he inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there =
are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question I w=
ill restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.<B=
R>> <BR>> a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)<BR>> b. Yoga marga (P=
sycho-spiritual)<BR>> c. Mantra marga (Tantric)<BR>> d. Bhakti marga =
(Love/Devotion)<BR>> e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless=
 Actions)<BR>> <BR>> Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisati=
on of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPH=
ASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the=
 abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predo=
minant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.<BR>> For tho=
se who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even =
the external guru is
 not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from th=
e wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita em=
phasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection).=
 Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retain=
ed the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as =
an important practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big w=
ay with a marginal role for external practices.<BR>> <BR>> Yoga marga=
 emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (No=
n-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasi=
se 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too wh=
ile Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as t=
hey subscribe to nirishwaravada.<BR>> <BR>> Bhakti marga (Love/Devoti=
on) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will through total surr=
ender to the
 Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Ac=
tion as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachm=
ent to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.<BR>> <BR>=
> Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone =
the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru =
arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult trut=
hs via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presuppose=
s certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regula=
tions and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti marga =
most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantl=
y invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Amon=
g the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the inte=
llect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet a=
nother
 the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.<BR>> <BR>> Tantra'=
s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like p=
ractical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that=
 bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is=
 not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child =
to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need e=
xperience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper trainin=
g and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measur=
es, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one's own conscio=
usness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual c=
onsciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic =
for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the=
 Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just
 el=
aborate on initiation and Guru parampara.<BR>> <BR>> Since we are tal=
king about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Ta=
ntric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric cont=
ext. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively.=
 However there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged livin=
g traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri=
 Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to=
 Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the B=
uddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan=
 Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajra=
yana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its =
approach to sadhana.<BR>> <BR>> Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agn=
i (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula
 predominantly invok=
es Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey=
. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particula=
r set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initia=
tion is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spirit=
ual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an I=
NVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Eac=
h branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till =
the individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it.=
 Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is hel=
d by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit ne=
cessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Ima=
gine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of liv=
e wires, where there is a long series of
 sadhakas sitting in silent practi=
ce all the way up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakas=
a) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.<BR>> <BR>> As alrea=
dy stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual conscio=
usness through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana,=
 Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved int=
o highly comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously ho=
ld the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic a=
pproach. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the =
Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantr=
asastra. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the=
 Tantramarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those w=
ho explore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant =
which I have covered extensively
 in my write-up. For those who are already=
 inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for imm=
ensely powerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The cre=
st jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi =
Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one witho=
ut a second, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besi=
des me?" (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and=
 reflect on the central truth of Advaita.<BR>> <BR>> The reason I adv=
ised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is =
because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only=
 when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follo=
w. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Y=
ogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri=
 Chandi is also equally
 regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especi=
ally the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or=
 the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the pr=
actice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic =
method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice=
. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully base=
d on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the H=
indu temple.<BR>> <BR>> Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an=
 integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic appro=
ach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana =
as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiati=
on as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the=
 Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vair=
agya, or even the
 Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred=
 Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the pre=
dominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or al=
l of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind th=
at the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula =
as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally tra=
ce themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for th=
ose paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<BR>> <BR>> In summary, =
one can make spiritual progress through any of the merthods/practices using=
 Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vai=
ragya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However dep=
ending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods =
are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One may progress thr=
ough a
 combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. However the =
*full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. =
It is this big picture against which the answer to the question has to be c=
ontextualised.<BR>> <BR>> Finally one last word. Irrespective of the =
method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for=
 all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection=
 on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that=
 one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST ch=
oice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as po=
werful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alon=
e that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishn=
a attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and sp=
ending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days.
 Viveka=
nanda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their spiritual liv=
es after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsy=
endranath respectively.<BR>> <BR>> For those who complain about the s=
carcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:<BR>> Q=
UOTE // "There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no go=
od Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of =
supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at on=
ce. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you wi=
ll find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your=
 mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for high=
er divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly tal=
ks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. =
And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.'... Make
 yourself a des=
erving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet =
of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and elevate =
you to sublime heights. These "oversouls" or high souls are waiting to get =
hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers a=
re few. If you bring a charge, "There are no good Mahatmas." Mahatmas also =
bring a serious charge, "There are no real seekers after Truth."." //UNQUOT=
E<BR>> <BR>> To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity fo=
r Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a po=
tential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the great =
masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a=
 study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by=
 listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, =
by constant remembrance and reflection, by
 discernment of sat and asat, by=
 genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progres=
s truly.<BR>> <BR>> I may not interact regularly or reply at least fo=
r a while. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.<BR>&=

 (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccu=

 this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits f=
rom a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one =
good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently a=
nd the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the perso=
n is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotte=
n fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits wil=
l be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The =
deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a=
 good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapat=
hi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the=
 spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or
 Kali =
or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.<B=
R>> > ><BR>> > > At the end, remember that these fruits a=

you would've had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good =
fruits!<BR>> > ><BR>> > > Nevertheless, one unable to tak=
e some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deiti=
es such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made m=
andatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you =
realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad re=
sults occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and=
 the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, s=
