Namaste KK & Rajarshi,

>i mean is kunjika is a coded key to unlock many se=
crets present it >chandi further kunjika is saptashati in a condensed form =


I've recited Chandi along with Kunjika Stotra for quite some time in the =
past. Reciting "Kunjika Stotra" is an experience by itself. The sound patte=
rn generated by reciting typically arranged bijaksharas is wonderful. The r=
hythm generated, when recited a little loud, gives a kick to the mind! I en=
joyed it thoroughly and it was like waiting to recite that Stotra after fin=
ishing regular Chandi paath.

I like to believe the words of Shiva and I te=
nd to agree with what KK has mentioned above but in the same breath its dif=
ficult to explain and experience and get convinced. Probably, only very ver=
y advanced saadhakas can illumine us about the real importance of the "Kunj=
ika Stotra" or we can get the answer by self efforts :)

My 2 cent...

Best=
 Regards,
Utpal
