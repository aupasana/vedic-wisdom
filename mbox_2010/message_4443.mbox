After a devotee sent to Sri Bhagavan a Tamil translation of Shankaracharya=
=E2=80=99s
Atma Bodha, Bhagavan composed a new translation in Tamil. He did=
 this
translation very rapidly, working even at night, using a flashlight!
=

=E2=80=98Can Shankara, the enlightener of the Self, be different from one=
=E2=80=99s own
Self? Who but he, does this day, abiding as the inmost Self =
in me, speak
this in the Tamil language?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 Sri Bhagavan

1=
. This =E2=80=94 Atma Bodha =E2=80=94 is meant to fulfil the want of the se=
ekers of
liberation who, by their prolonged tapas, have already cleansed th=
emselves
of impurities and become mentally peaceful and free from desires.
=

2. Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one =E2=80=
=94 as
essential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gaine=
d.

3. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. On the ot=
her
hand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.

4=
. Owing to ignorance, the Self now appears to be covered up; on the removal=

of ignorance, the pure Self will shine forth of Itself, like the sun after=

the dispersal of clouds.

5. The jiva is mixed up with ignorance. By const=
ant practice of knowledge
the jiva becomes pure, because knowledge disappea=
rs (along with ignorance),
as the cleansing nut with the impurities in the =
water.But here is the world,
how can the Self alone be real and non-dual?

=
6. Samsara is full of likes and dislikes and other opposites. Like a dream,=

it seems real for the time being; but, on waking, it vanishes because it i=
s
unreal.

Because the dream is negated on waking, I know it to be unreal; =
but the
world persists and I find it only real.

7. So long as the substrat=
um of all, the non-dual Brahman is not seen, the
world seems real =E2=80=94=
 like illusory silver in a piece of mother-of-pearl.But
the world is so div=
erse; yet, you say there is One only.

8. Like bubbles rising on the surfac=
e of the waters of the ocean, all the
worlds arise from, stay in and resolv=
e into the Supreme Being (Paramesa) who
is the root cause and prop of all.
=

9. In the Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is all permeating, eternal
Vish=
nu, all these diverse objects and individuals appear (as phenomena) like
va=
rious ornaments made of gold.Yes, but what about the numberless individual
=
souls?

10. Just as the all-pervading akasa (ether) appears fragmented in d=
ifferent
objects (as in a pit, a jar, a house, a theatre hall, etc.) but re=
mains
undifferentiated on the limitations falling away, similarly with the =
single,
non-dual ruler of the senses (seeming to function as gods, men, cat=
tle,
etc.). But the individuals have different traits and function accordin=
g to
different conditions.

11. The traits, etc., are also superimposed. Pu=
re water (tasteless by
itself) tastes sweet, bitter, salty etc., according =
to the admixture in it
(upadhis). Similarly, race, name status, etc., are a=
ll superimposed on the
non-dual Self of all. What are these upadhis which p=
lay such tricks on the
Self? They are gross, subtle and very subtle as desc=
ribed here.

12. The gross body made up of the five gross elements (earth, =
water, fire,
air and ether) is meant to reap the fruits of past actions in =
the shape of
pleasure and pain.

13. The subtle body consisting of the five=
 airs, the mind,intellect, the ten
senses and made up of subtle elements is=
 also meant for enjoyment (as in
dreams).

14. Inexpressible and beginningl=
ess ignorance is said to be the causal body
(as in deep sleep). Know the Se=
lf to be other than these three upadhis.

If so, why is the Self not eviden=
t to me? On the other hand, Sruti says,
=E2=80=98This Purusha is made up of=
 annarasa (essence of food).=E2=80=99

15. Just as a clear crystal (itself =
colourless) appears red,blue, yellow,
etc., according to the background, so=
 also the Self, pure and untainted,
seems to be identical with the body,the=
 senses, the mind, intellect or
blissful ignorance (panchakosas) when in co=
ntact with them.

16. Just as husking the paddy exposes the grain within (t=
he rice), so also
should one judiciously separate the pure Atman from the s=
heaths covering it.

Atman is said to be everywhere. Why should it then be =
judiciously looked for
within the five sheaths?

17. Though always and ever=
ywhere present, the Self does not shine forth in
all places. Just as light =
is reflected only in a transparent medium, so also
the Self is clearly seen=
 in the intellect only.

18. The Self is realized in the intellect as the w=
itness of the activities
of, and yet separate from the body, the senses, th=
e mind, intellect and
gross nature (prakriti) as is a king in relation to h=
is subjects.

The Self seems to participate in their activities; so he cann=
ot be different
from them, nor be their witness.

19. Just as the moon seem=
s to move when the clouds around her move, so also
the Self seems to the in=
discriminating to be active, when actually, the
senses are active.

To be a=
ctive, the body etc., must also be intelligent; they are said to be
inert. =
How can they act without the intelligent Self participating in their
action=
s?

20. Just as men do their duties in the light of the sun (but the sun do=
es
not participate in them), so also the body, senses, etc., function in th=
e
light of the Self without its participating in them.

True, the Self alon=
e is intelligence. I know myself to be born,growing,
decaying, happy, or un=
happy and so on. Am I right?

21. No. The characteristics (birth, death, et=
c.) of the body and the senses
are superimposed on the Being- Consciousness=
-Bliss as is the blue in the sky
by those who do not discriminate.

22. So =
also the characteristics of the mind, such as agency, etc., are by
ignoranc=
e superimposed on the Atman, as are the movements of water on the
moon refl=
ected in it.

23. Only when the intellect is manifested, likes and dislikes=
, pleasure and
pain are felt. In deep sleep, the intellect remaining latent=
, they are not
felt. Therefore, they are of the intellect and not of the At=
man (the Self).
Here is the real nature of the Atman.

24. As light is the =
very sun, coldness the water, heat the fire, so also the
eternal, pure Bein=
g-Consciousness-Bliss is the very Self.

At some time or other, every indiv=
idual experiences, =E2=80=98I am happy=E2=80=99, and thus
Being-Consciousne=
ss-Bliss experience is plain. How can one make the
experience permanent and=
 unchanging?

25. Being-Consciousness is of the Self; the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99 mode or modification is of
the intellect; these are distinctly two.Howe=
ver, owing to ignorance, the
individual mixes them together and thinks =E2=
=80=98I know=E2=80=99 and acts accordingly.

26. Never is there any change =
(or action) in Atman nor knowledge in the
intellect. Only the jiva is delud=
ed into thinking itself to be the knower,
doer and seer.

27. Like the snak=
e in the rope, mistaking the jiva for the Self, one is
subject to fear. If,=
 on the other hand, one knows oneself not as a jiva but
as the supreme Self=
, one is altogether free from fear.

28. Only the Self illumines the senses=
, intellect, etc., as a lamp does
objects such as pots. The Self is not ill=
umined by them as they are inert.

If the Self cannot be made known by the =
intellect, there will be no knower
to know the Self and the Self cannot be =
known.

29. To see a light, no other light is needed. So also, the Self bei=
ng
self-effulgent, needs no other means of knowledge. It shines of itself.
=

If so, every one must be Self-realized, effortlessly, but it is not so.

3=
0. On the strength of the Vedic teaching, =E2=80=98Not this, not this=E2=80=
=99, eliminate
all the adjuncts (upadhis) and with the help of the mahavaky=
as, realize the
identity of the jivatman (individual self) with the paramat=
man (the supreme
Self).

31. The whole objective world such as the body, is=
 born of ignorance and
transient like a bubble on water. Know the Self to b=
e distinct from it and
identical with Brahman (the Supreme).

32. Being dis=
tinct from the gross body, birth, death, old age, debility,
etc., do not pe=
rtain to me. Not being the senses, I have no connection with
the objects of=
 the senses such as sound, etc.

33. The srutis declare: =E2=80=98I am not =
the vital air (prana), not the mind, (but)
pure (Being).=E2=80=99 Not being=
 the mind I am free from likes and dislikes, fear,
etc.

34. =E2=80=98I am =
free from qualities and actionless, eternal, undifferentiated,
untainted, u=
nchanging, formless, ever free and pure.
