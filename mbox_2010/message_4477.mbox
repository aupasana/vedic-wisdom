 16th May, 1936

Mr. C. relates how the reading of Patanjali Sutras in 1926=
 had greatly
impressed him. The first few sutras had convinced him of the t=
ruth of the
teaching, but unfortunately there was no one to give him proper=
 guidance
till he met Sri Bhagavan early in 1936.

Bh. Patanjali=E2=80=99s =
first sutras are indeed the climax of all systems of yoga. All
yogas aim at=
 the cessation of the vritti (modification of the mind). This
can be brough=
t about in the variety of ways mentioned in the scriptures
through mind con=
trol,which frees consciousness from all thoughts and keeps
it pure. Effort =
is necessary. In fact effort is itself yoga.

C. There seems to be nothing =
but awareness, for to know anything there must
be knowledge =E2=80=93 we ca=
nnot get over that.

Bh. Certainly. Subjective knowledge =E2=80=93 knowledg=
e knowing itself is jnana. It
is then the subject as the knower, the object=
 as the known and the knowledge
which connects them.

C. This last is not c=
lear to me in this case.

Bh. Why so? Knowledge is the light which links th=
e seer to the seen. Suppose
you go in search of a book in a library in pitc=
h darkness. Can you find it
without light, although you, the subject, and t=
he book, the object, are both
present? Light has to be present to unite you=
. This link between the subject
and the object in every experience is chit,=
 consciousness. It is both the
substratum as well as the witness of the exp=
erience, the seer of Patanjali.
