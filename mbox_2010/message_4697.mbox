 1st February, 1939

Talk 618.

A gentleman from Hardwar: When I go on anal=
ysing myself I go beyond the
intellect, and then there is no happiness.

M.=
: Intellect is only an instrument of the Self. It cannot help you to know
w=
hat is beyond itself.

D.: I understand it. But there is no happiness beyon=
d it.

M.: The intellect is the instrument wherewith to know unknown things=
.But you
are already known, being the Self which is itself knowledge;so you=
 do not
become the object of knowledge. The intellect makes you see things =
outside,
and not that which is its own source.

The intellect is useful thu=
s far, it helps you to analyse yourself, and no
further. It must then be me=
rged into the ego, and the source of the ego must
be sought. If that be don=
e the ego disappears. Remain as that source and
then the ego does not arise=
.

D.: There is no happiness in that state.

M.: =E2=80=98There is no happi=
ness=E2=80=99 is only a thought. The Self is bliss, pure and
simple. You ar=
e the Self. So you cannot but be bliss; being so,you cannot
say here is no =
happiness. That which says so cannot be the Self; it is the
non-Self and mu=
st be got rid of in order to realise the bliss of the Self.

D.: How is tha=
t to be done?

M.: See wherefrom the thought arises. It is the mind. See fo=
r whom the mind
or intellect functions. For the ego. Merge the intellect in=
 the ego and seek
the source of the ego. The ego disappears. =E2=80=98I kno=
w=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98I do not know=E2=80=99
imply a subject and an objec=
t. They are due to duality. The Self is pure and
absolute, One and alone. T=
here are no two selves so that one may know the
other. What is duality then=
?

It cannot be the Self which is One and alone. It must be non-Self.Dualit=
y is
the characteristic of the ego. When thoughts arise duality is present;=
 know
it to be the ego, and seek its source.

The degree of the absence of =
thoughts is the measure of your progress
towards Self-Realisation. But Self=
-Realisation itself does not admit of
progress; it is ever the same. The Se=
lf remains always in realisation.

The obstacles are thoughts. Progress is =
measured by the degree of removal of
the obstacles to understanding that th=
e Self is always realised. So thoughts
must be checked by seeking to whom t=
hey arise. So you go to their Source,
where they do not arise.
