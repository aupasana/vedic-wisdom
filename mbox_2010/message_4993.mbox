Namaste Parijat,

Let me tell you that I=C2=A0really "know" the answer to y=
our question and I guess 
nobody knows the answer to what you are asking fo=
r. But what can be said after 
some logical thinking is that if needs to "t=
est" her bhakts on some matter, then 
obviously she does not know her bhakt=
 becuase otherwise there would be no need 
for a test. And if she does not =
know her bhakt, how can she be the shakti to 
rule over all?

The tests whi=
ch people refer to are usually the hardships that one has to face 
while un=
dertaking a sadhana. When one performs a sadhana, it is only to achieve 
so=
me goal whether that be spiritual or material objective and the need for 
s=
adhana is becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be able 
t=
o=C2=A0achive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a sadhana is t=
o remove 
the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does n=
ot let anyone 
of the hook though. The harships that you face while perform=
ing a sadhana might 
appear like a "test" to a sadhaka but is essentially t=
he Lord bringing necessary 
hardships your way which creates the suffering =
in the sadhaka that lets the 
sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka w=
ill eventually be successful but 
the effort required and the hardships tha=
t are yet to be faced depends on the 
karmic burden.

If the karmic burden =
is less, suffering is less and success is obtained without 
much suffering =
(relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very heavy, you 
may suffer =
without seeing any success. Though you are now closer to your goal 
after t=
he suffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do not see the 
resul=
ts of your effort and feel the effort was a waste.

MA does not tests...the=
 hardships are brought to your way by her to purge you 
karmically to let y=
ou achieve what you want.

This is my belief, and this I use as a basis whe=
n performing a sadhana. I am 
sure others may have other views though.

Reg=
ards,
Bhupendra.

=C2=A0 
Namaste,
i am pari=
jat dutta from kolkata.there are some issues going on i need to 
discuss..
=

since i was 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma kali.bt =
i feel 
i had and may be have to face several tests....like initially...i r=
ead books on 
tantra....wich promise highly materialistically beneficial sa=
dhanas..
and alarmingly different dieties for each purpose...i fell for tha=
t...an my 
devotion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..
=

with time i realized all these have no value without a gurus guidance.....=
my 
astrologer told me....that time will be arnd 29-30 of my age.

then aga=
in...i was against krishna worship.....cuzz i thot fooshingly since he 
is =
only about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..
again since...=
all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship is the 
highest....
=
un
also...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked mostly=
 of 
devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....
undestanding others though=
ts n so on...as i have personally seen some tantrics 
who have this power..=


with time again i learnt bhakti is the highest.......i asked once a mahar=
aj who 
presides over the ashram where my mother was initiated ...
which is=
 more powerful ?? bhakti or mantras ??....

he said...in one word...bhakti =
is more powerful...without bhakti u wont have the 
urge to have a mantra...=


again in a book....i read...the love of gopis for krishna was such.....th=
ey 
forgot everything of mundane world..
they didnot want to know who krish=
na was.....dint care if he was god or 
not......jst loving for the sake of =
loving..
bhakti only for the sake of bhakti....

how wonderful !!!....all t=
hese made me realize.....how foolish i was.....all i 
used to have for maa =
was bhakti...i dint 

know any mantra nothin (not now as well) and i was ag=
ainst on the other hand 
.....of krishna and ramkrishnadev who were epitome=
 of bhakti...

at this time....i used to go to my mom's gurumaatas ashram..=
.once in a spiritual 
discussion they said..
get hold of only one ......he/=
she is antaryami...she understands wat ur inner 
needs her...like a parent
=
definitely she will fulfill them......

at the same time....narasimha ji to=
ld in one of the mails........"mother knows 
the best"...

these have remov=
ed the misconceptions i had ...

what i want to know is when one is devoted=
 to maa why does she test ??.....is it 
a way to bring one closer to her th=
rough realizations ??...

when shes the all pervading shakti....why thers a=
 need for test 
??....also...while testing does she give her child enuff 

=
strength to pass the test ??

i am looking forward to guidance from u peopl=
