Hi,
=C2=A0
This is a very nice read. To be honest i felt it a bit too ide=
alistic. 
Yes, i agree to many facts stated here but they seem to be soundi=
ng for someone who is far more realized=C2=A0 soul than an ignorant like me=
. The reference point seems to be from a different plane although good to k=
now such. What i mean by this is:
=C2=A0
As the article describes coupel of=
 examples like the Sage insisting on bed of grass denying the cot is attach=
ed to vairagya ...also..point on accepting fruits, mil,sumptuous meal etc .=
.
.i think practically speaking unless one practices attachment to vairagya=
 he may not acheive the real vairagya..just by accepting the cot whichever =
comes his way and keep indulging in the activities (at=C2=A0a stage where o=
ne is not in the state / capable of witnessing the likes and dislikes alike=
) is a path to doom.

Please correct me if i'm totally off the mark.
=C2=A0=

Cheers
KK

SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA (MESSAG=
E 4)

Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.

------------ --------- ---

=
Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of Tapas is highly deprecable. =
This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is condemned by Lord Krishna=
 in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It is an instrument fo=
r Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body is not kept stron=
g and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment to s=
ensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana of Sadhus and Sann=
yasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana of worldly person=
s.

Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult to get rid of the=
 Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. The feeling, "I am a=
 great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhimana. The body of a Sannyasi, who=
 has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a public property. He ha=
s no claim on it because he denies the existence of body and tries to feel =
always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public will take care of his body.

Lord=
 Buddha tortured the body, did severe austerities, gave up food and yet he =
was not able to attain the goal. He heard the song:

"Fair goes the dancing=
 when the Sitar's tuned, 

Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. 

And we=
 will dance away the hearts of men 

The string o'erstretched breaks and th=
e music flies,

The string o'erslack is dumb and music dies, 

Tune us the =
Sitar neither low nor high."

Then he ate food, adopted the middle path and=
 succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all necessary=
 for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya born of=
 strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of severe a=
usterities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of rigid =
Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a stron=
g, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to give i=
t up at any time for a noble cause.

The care-taker of the horse feeds it w=
ith proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. Then only i=
t is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be injected with pro=
per nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only it will soon=
 regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Work will suff=
er if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows old it must be =
well-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titiksha is prac=
tised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore of immortal=
ity and fearlessness cannot be reached.

O Ram, neglect not this body. The =
society and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract as much work as p=
ossible from those selfless workers who have dedicated their lives to the s=
ervice of humanity. They are yoked to service till the last breath leaves t=
heir bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, "My dear Prahlada! Enough of y=
our Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people now=
. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide." Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as a "Maha=
 Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced the idea of "I am a Tyagi" and =
"I am a Vairagi", who neither accepts nor rejects things that come by thems=
elves by identifying himself with the silent witness, the Immortal Atma, wh=
o feels always "I am Akarta (non-doer)", "I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) " even=
 while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, "But the disciplined self, mov=
ing among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction and repulsion mas=
tered by the Self, goeth to
Peace." Chapter II-64.

Some neophytes and raw =
aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" or "Maha Bhogins" and quote sc=
riptures also: "We eat without tongues; we see without eyes". The thief or =
the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like the people who cat=
ch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94=
"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo=
 na sosha-yati marutah"=E2=80=94"Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth h=
im, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away". Sublime philosophy indee=
d of perverted people with perverted intellects! The gilted ornaments canno=
t shine for a long time. The crow that shines under borrowed feathers of th=
e peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas will burst out=
 and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite without difficulty.

A Maha=
 Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup of mil=
k when they come by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He will not=
 say, "I have enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk." If an aspirant is s=
eriously ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a =
feeling of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to purchase mi=
lk, if any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk, he should n=
ot refuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his devotees by work=
ing through the minds of various persons.

The child sometimes eats food at=
 night while he is sleeping. If the mother asks the child in the morning. "=
Baby, you took food last night," he replies, "I have not taken anything las=
t night. You are playing and joking with me." Such is the condition of a Je=
evanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. =
He eats without a mouth and smells without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at=
 night when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes to waking consciousness=
, "O Prema! Do you know that you talked last night when you were dreaming?"=
 He replies "I do not remember anything." Such is the state of a Jeevanmukt=
a or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.

Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he =
said, "I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only=
", because he identified himself with the Atma who is always the witness an=
d the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though h=
e was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wif=
e, "My beloved! Say unto the river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, ha=
s commanded you to give path of way. She will at once yield and you can cro=
ss it without a boat." She repeated the words of her husband and crossed th=
e river immediately. She was quite amazed at the words of her husband and a=
sked him, "My Lord! You are living with me and yet you say that you are a N=
itya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain thi=
s philosophy." Tiruvalluvar replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have realised t=
his through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the sil=
ent witness. The senses,
body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am =
entirely distinct from them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife understood the nature of=
 the soul and then she became silent.

Ordinary aspirants with delicate hea=
lth should not take recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who=
 has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adam=
antine. If an aspirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live=
 on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts=
 of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtain=
ed by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.

If you have mastery over the pai=
r of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and inten=
se cold, if you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is hi=
ghly creditable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to st=
and before the sun in summer for some hours, if you throw off your clothing=
 in the Gangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneu=
monia. You should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. Wha=
t little you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, a=
nd you have lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by=
 your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.

An aspirant gave up his clothing=
 all at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died wi=
thin a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tem=
porarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a =
slave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not sup=
press them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.

An aspira=
nt said, "I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some yea=
rs. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, "I am immortal Atma". I ha=
ve got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive is pure. I=
 will attain self-realisation. " He actually committed the abominable act. =
Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. Thi=
s is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature of =
true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters for s=
ome time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taking =
to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot enterta=
in the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of committing the act. Horrible t=
houghts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obviou=
sly the fate of Pretas (ghosts).

The mind should gradually be weaned off i=
ts old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasure centres=
, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who take to t=
oo much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You should t=
rain the mind in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner bliss. Gr=
adually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you can get y=
ourself established in true Vairagya.

The more the Viveka, the more the tr=
ue Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the garden of Antahk=
arana from the understanding that the world is a mere appearance and full o=
f miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full of knowledge and=
 bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and association with t=
he realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all objects of the w=
orld appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or worthless things. =
He will not give up his new spiritual life even if the wealth of the whole =
world is offered to him.

Aspirants should give up those articles of food w=
hich they like best for some time. They should discipline all the Indriyas =
in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple life. They should alw=
ays eat simple food. But they should not become slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman=
 Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this in his devotees in order=
 to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.

May you all become Maha Ty=
agins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from the canker of Vairagya Abhi=
mana!

May you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya!!

May you all attain=
 Kaivalya or perfection!! !

Real Vairagya

There was a Sannyasi at Benares=
. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used t=
o stand in the sun for some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges=
 for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots=
.

On one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri=
 Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot.=
 He asked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. I=
t was extremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to =
get for the Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.

Sri Ram said: "Swa=
miji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents=
. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an a=
dvanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of gras=
s or on a cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I must have my usual bed o=
f grass only. You must bring it anyhow."

Attachment to Vairagya is as much=
 an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of =
the Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has nei=
ther Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is qui=
te satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk an=
d fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He al=
ways takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects. This =
is the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A wo=
rldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which =
he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised sou=
l has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.

Suka Deva was te=
sted by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some days. He=
 was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served him and =
gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.

Obviously, the=
 Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained equanimity o=
f mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even after several=
 years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from all sorts of =
attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not attain Sahaja-A=
vastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to all kinds =
of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the bed of grass or a beautiful=
 cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.

He who is endowed wit=
h equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi i=
n Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it is extremely diff=
icult to keep the evenness of mind.

Some Sannyasins who are working for th=
e public good make resolves: "We will not travel in trains. We will walk on=
ly. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not use fountain pens or wa=
tch." These are not desirable resolves. This is not the real nature of Vair=
agya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect. T=
hey want to do service. If they move in cars or trains, if they keep the bo=
dy strong and healthy, they can do more service in a short space of time. T=
hose who do much writing-work can turn out much work if they use a fountain=
 pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one kind. It does not leav=
e even educated persons or cultured Sannyasins.

Some Sannyasins practise V=
airagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God knows the mo=
tives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot deceive Him=
.

Where is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where the=
re is no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not ren=
ounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed t=
he objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the ob=
jects of the world even though he shows externally that he is a great Virak=
ta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden=
 bowl only in his hand?

Raja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People re=
ported that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affecte=
d. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a real great Virakta.

You=
ng aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take adva=
ntage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practise=
d only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginn=
ers should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vaira=
gya to the very letter and spirit.

May you all transcend Raga and Vairagya=
 and attain knowledge of the Self. May you all understand the true nature a=
nd Swaroopa of Vairagya.

Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable =
mind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and =
strong dispassion for anything other than Atma.

If one considers the posit=
ion and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has dev=
eloped a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairag=
ya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.

I=
t is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or=
 other. But by having dispassion for all objects at all times, one will get=
 knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Gur=
u, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.

Do not fall a=
 victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and well-ado=
red fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain Self-=
realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.

Devotion, dispass=
ion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Dispassion is d=
esirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and s=
o everybody has this Atma.

Light on Vairagya

Vairagya is born of Viveka, =
discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-eternal) , Sat and=
 Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes through disintere=
sted selfless service done in several births and through Puja and Aradhana,=
 and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vairagya. It gives =
spiritual strength.

A man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. It =
is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspiran=
ts. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates burni=
ng Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Release.=


Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, there=
 is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are on=
e. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Patan=
jali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism=
), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). First,=
 there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmita,=
 and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, th=
e clinging to this life.

Vairagya is of different types or degrees=E2=80=
=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate and intense). Intense Vairagy=
a only will help the aspirant to stick to this path. If it is of a dull typ=
e like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, the mind will simply be waitin=
g to get back the objects that were renounced previously, and the aspirant =
will get a downfall. He will not be able to climb again to the heights he f=
ormerly reached. So aspirants should be careful. Even though the Vairagya i=
s of a mild type, they should try to make it moderate; and then intense Vai=
ragya comes through looking into the defects of sensual life. Sensual pleas=
ure is not real happiness. It is illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mi=
xed with pain. So again and again by looking into the defects of sensual li=
fe, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened through study of spiritual bo=
oks, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.

Simply living in nudity and eating nee=
m leaves, and drinking cow's urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vaira=
gya should be born of discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mi=
nd is weaned from sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=
=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and ag=
ain you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudity and these external thing=
s will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry=
, Vichara. All these objects do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us=
 into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for=
 a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an =
aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. T=
his Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if th=
e mind runs towards objects, at once it will point out that there is pain t=
here, that sensual enjoyment is the cause
for rebirth and intense suffering=
. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually through intense practice, i=
t is established in real, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.

Vairagya i=
s of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes =
after one attains Self-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw=
. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.

Without Vaira=
gya there cannot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only =
vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will co=
me by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says "Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan ni=
rodhah"=E2=80=94"The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairag=
ya." They are the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of =
Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunte=
ya, vairagyena cha grihyate"=E2=80=94"The mind is controlled by practice an=
d Vairagya, dispassion, intense detachment." By Vairagya, the mind is detac=
hed. He who works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspiran=
ts' duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.

Vairagya=
 is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual gro=
oves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, a=
nd yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the w=
orld, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not aff=
ected in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she =
ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renou=
ncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached =
to the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any=
 one object.

You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he=
 will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. =
This is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that on=
e has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not belong to=
 this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the waist=
. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had tha=
t mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.

Lord=
 Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. "Karshayantah=
 sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham tan vidhy=
asuranischayan ."=E2=80=94"They torture all the elements in the body and Me=
 also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha also tortured his body, and late=
r on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and then he c=
ame to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the middle pa=
th always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisation. Especi=
ally in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should not torture=
 the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You should not =
expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you should practis=
e "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm in taking good, healthy food. Ev=
ery man has got a different physical constitution. You should use common se=
nse in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a long
time =
in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some fruits. You should=
 have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya internally and at the same time follow t=
he middle path externally.

Generally, aspirants say: "I have given up umbr=
ella."=E2=80=A6 "I take only one meal." Their whole Sadhana is: "I have giv=
en up shirt."=E2=80=A6 "I have given up sweater."=E2=80=A6 "I have given up=
 shoes."=E2=80=A6 "I live only on bread and dhal." Their Sadhana consists i=
n "giving up"=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real spiritual life does =
not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or taking. The o=
nly thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you are very hun=
gry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of milk. Vaira=
gya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It will hurl y=
ou down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.

At the present moment,=
 there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a great Vairagi. For the la=
st so many years he is living without clothing in the icy region and he sle=
eps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a very good description o=
f him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a wonderful man and made him=
 his Guru.

Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Rishi=
kesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Malavi=
aji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was rain=
ing, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. V=
airagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all over=
 the body and make the hair look golden, and they wear a very thick rope, o=
f the size used for drawing chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In Laksh=
man Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a phys=
ical body.

There is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Sw=
ami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves th=
at are thrown out by others after meals. "Avadhootas" are naked people. The=
y have no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his mind o=
f all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brah=
mendra Swami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha' s Guru and Swam=
i Krishnananda' s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food, a=
nd Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to make s=
evere tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong body a=
nd lived an austere life.

<DIV>Yes, i agree to many facts stated here but they seem to be sounding f=

such. What i mean by this is:</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As the article d=

 the cot is attached to vairagya ...also..point on accepting fruits, mil,su=

<DIV>.i think practically speaking unless one pra=

 accepting the cot whichever comes his way and keep indulging in the activi=

<DIV>SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA (=
MESSAGE 4)<BR><BR>Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.<BR><BR>----------=
-- --------- ---<BR><BR>Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of Tapa=
s is highly deprecable. This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is c=
ondemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord=
. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if th=
e body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an=
 evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abh=
imana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Ab=
himana of worldly persons.<BR><BR>Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It =
is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the b=
ody-idea. The feeling, "I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhiman=
a. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanit=
y, is a public
 property. He has no claim on it because he denies the exist=
ence of body and tries to feel always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public wi=
ll take care of his body.<BR><BR>Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe =
austerities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He he=
ard the song:<BR><BR>"Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar's tuned, <BR><BR=
>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. <BR><BR>And we will dance away the=
 hearts of men <BR><BR>The string o'erstretched breaks and the music flies,=
<BR><BR>The string o'erslack is dumb and music dies, <BR><BR>Tune us the Si=
tar neither low nor high."<BR><BR>Then he ate food, adopted the middle path=
 and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all neces=
sary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya bor=
n of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of seve=
re austerities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of ri=
gid
 Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a =
strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to g=
ive it up at any time for a noble cause.<BR><BR>The care-taker of the horse=
 feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. =
Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be inject=
ed with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only i=
t will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Wor=
k will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows old =
it must be well-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titik=
sha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore =
of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.<BR><BR>O Ram, neglect no=
t this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract =
as much work as possible from those selfless workers who have dedicated
 th=
eir lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service till the la=
st breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, "My dear Pra=
hlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi=
. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide." Yoga Vasishtha speaks=
 of one as a "Maha Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced the idea of "=
I am a Tyagi" and "I am a Vairagi", who neither accepts nor rejects things =
that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, the=
 Immortal Atma, who feels always "I am Akarta (non-doer)", "I am Abhokta (n=
on-enjoyer) " even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, "But the dis=
ciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction=
 and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to<BR>Peace." Chapter II-64.<BR>=
<BR>Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" or =
"Maha Bhogins" and quote scriptures also: "We eat without
 tongues; we see =
without eyes". The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are =
just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pala=
tes and quote Gita:=E2=80=94"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavak=
ah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=E2=80=94"Weapons cleave=
 him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him awa=
y". Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellects=
! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines u=
nder borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishna=
s and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite=
 without difficulty.<BR><BR>A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to a=
ccept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he wi=
ll not crave for them. He will not say, "I have enjoyed today good mangoes =
or good milk." If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not
 able to ea=
t solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he h=
as no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of hi=
s own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He=
 takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of various persons=
.<BR><BR>The child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If th=
e mother asks the child in the morning. "Baby, you took food last night," h=
e replies, "I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and jokin=
g with me." Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha=
 Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells=
 without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask =
him when he comes to waking consciousness, "O Prema! Do you know that you t=
alked last night when you were dreaming?" He replies "I do not remember any=
thing." Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha
 Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.=
<BR><BR>Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, "I am a Nitya Upavasi=
. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only", because he identified hi=
mself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Kri=
shna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini a=
nd Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, "My beloved! Say unto th=
e river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give pat=
h of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat." She =
repeated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She wa=
s quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, "My Lord! You are=
 living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am stru=
ck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy." Tiruvalluvar=
 replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognitio=
n (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the
 silent witness. The senses,<B=
R>body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct from =
them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife understood the nature of the soul and then she =
became silent.<BR><BR>Ordinary aspirants with delicate health should not ta=
ke recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kay=
a Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an asp=
irant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves a=
lone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts of gastro-intest=
inal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who=
 practise Tamasic Tapas.<BR><BR>If you have mastery over the pair of opposi=
tes, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, if=
 you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly credit=
able indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to stand before =
the sun in summer for some hours, if
 you throw off your clothing in the Ga=
ngotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You=
 should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. What little y=
ou will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, and you hav=
e lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by your fool=
ish practices or Tamasic Tapas.<BR><BR>An aspirant gave up his clothing all=
 at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died within=
 a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tempora=
rily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a slav=
e of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not suppres=
s them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.<BR><BR>An aspi=
rant said, "I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some y=
ears. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, "I am immortal Atma". I =
have got full Vairagya. No sin
 will cling to me, because my motive is pure=
. I will attain self-realisation. " He actually committed the abominable ac=
t. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. =
This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature =
of true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters fo=
r some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taki=
ng to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot ente=
rtain the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of committing the act. Horribl=
e thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obv=
iously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).<BR><BR>The mind should gradually be wea=
ned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasur=
e centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who =
take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You=
 should train the mind
 in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner=
 bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you=
 can get yourself established in true Vairagya.<BR><BR>The more the Viveka,=
 the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the =
garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a mere appea=
rance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full =
of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and as=
sociation with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all =
objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or wo=
rthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even if the weal=
th of the whole world is offered to him.<BR><BR>Aspirants should give up th=
ose articles of food which they like best for some time. They should discip=
line all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple=
 life. They
 should always eat simple food. But they should not become slav=
es of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this i=
n his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.<BR><=
BR>May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free fro=
m the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!<BR><BR>May you all possess true lasting =
Para Vairagya!!<BR><BR>May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !<BR><BR=
>Real Vairagya<BR><BR>There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titik=
shu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for=
 some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He us=
ed to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.<BR><BR>On one occasi=
on one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided hi=
m a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to=
 provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremely
=
 difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swa=
mi a bed of grass with great difficulty.<BR><BR>Sri Ram said: "Swamiji, it =
is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindly =
use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced S=
annyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on a=
 cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of grass o=
nly. You must bring it anyhow."<BR><BR>Attachment to Vairagya is as much an=
 evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of the=
 Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neithe=
r Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is quite =
satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk and f=
ruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He alway=
s takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects.
 This is=
 the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A worl=
dly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which he=
 likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised soul =
has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.<BR><BR>Suka Deva wa=
s tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some days=
. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served him =
and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.<BR><BR>Obvi=
ously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained eq=
uanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even aft=
er several years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from all=
 sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not attai=
n Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to =
all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the
 bed of grass or =
a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.<BR><BR>He w=
ho is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyag=
i or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it =
is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.<BR><BR>Some Sannyasins=
 who are working for the public good make resolves: "We will not travel in =
trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not =
use fountain pens or watch." These are not desirable resolves. This is not =
the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is an=
other kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars or trai=
ns, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more service in a=
 short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out much work=
 if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one=
 kind. It does not leave even educated persons or
 cultured Sannyasins.<BR>=
<BR>Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and=
 respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner=
 Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.<BR><BR>Where is the strength of Vairagya wh=
en one lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the stren=
gth of Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to=
 renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is =
no attraction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he shows=
 externally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a=
 gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?<BR><BR>Raja Jan=
aka was amidst regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila w=
as burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alon=
e can be called a real great Virakta.<BR><BR>Young aspirants should be very=
 careful and cautious. They should not take
 advantage of the liberty of a =
Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi=
 who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their =
resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and=
 spirit.<BR><BR>May you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledg=
e of the Self. May you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vaira=
gya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is restra=
ined. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispass=
ion for anything other than Atma.<BR><BR>If one considers the position and =
happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed a=
 real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It w=
ill not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.<BR><BR>It =
is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or o=
ther. But by having dispassion for
 all objects at all times, one will get =
knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Guru=
, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.<BR><BR>Do not f=
all a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and wel=
l-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain =
Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.<BR><BR>Devoti=
on, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Disp=
assion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the =
heart and so everybody has this Atma.<BR><BR>Light on Vairagya<BR><BR>Vaira=
gya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and=
 non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka =
comes through disinterested selfless service done in several births and thr=
ough Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is b=
orn Vairagya. It gives
 spiritual strength.<BR><BR>A man of Vairagya has no=
 attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, in=
exhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, =
Samadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberatio=
n or Emancipation, or Release.<BR><BR>Raga is attachment to objects. Wherev=
er there is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there=
 is dislike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the impor=
tant afflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are=
: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Ab=
hinivesha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidy=
a. From this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, a=
nd from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.<BR><BR>Vairagy=
a is of different types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild=
, moderate and
 intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to s=
tick to this path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava=
 Vairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that wer=
e renounced previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not b=
e able to climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants shou=
ld be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try =
to make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into t=
he defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is i=
llusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again =
by looking into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be s=
trengthened through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry=
.<BR><BR>Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow's=
 urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of
 discr=
imination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual e=
njoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and =
then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make en=
quiry. Physical nudity and these external things will not constitute real V=
airagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects=
 do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such =
deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, produces =
lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do=
 real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to=
 the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects,=
 at once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment=
 is the cause<BR>for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly=
 afraid, and gradually through intense practice, it is established in
 real=
, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is of two kinds als=
o: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains =
Self-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intense =
spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.<BR><BR>Without Vairagya there ca=
nnot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, funda=
mental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by themse=
lves. Patanjali Maharshi says "Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=E2=
=80=94"The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya." They =
are the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal A=
bode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairag=
yena cha grihyate"=E2=80=94"The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya=
, dispassion, intense detachment." By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He wh=
o works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants' duty t=
o
 cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is=
 doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual groove=
s. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and =
yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the worl=
d, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affect=
ed in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she rul=
ed a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renounci=
ng his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to =
the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any on=
e object.<BR><BR>You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but=
 he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairag=
i. This is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that=
 one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not
 belon=
g to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the w=
aist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had=
 that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.<B=
R><BR>Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. "Ka=
rshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham=
 tan vidhyasuranischayan ."=E2=80=94"They torture all the elements in the b=
ody and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha also tortured his body=
, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and=
 then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the=
 middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisati=
on. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should n=
ot torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You s=
hould not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you
 sho=
uld practise "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm in taking good, healt=
hy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. You should us=
e common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a=
 long<BR>time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some frui=
ts. You should have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya internally and at the same=
 time follow the middle path externally.<BR><BR>Generally, aspirants say: "=
I have given up umbrella."=E2=80=A6 "I take only one meal." Their whole Sad=
hana is: "I have given up shirt."=E2=80=A6 "I have given up sweater."=E2=80=
=A6 "I have given up shoes."=E2=80=A6 "I live only on bread and dhal." Thei=
r Sadhana consists in "giving up"=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real =
spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving=
 up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind.=
 If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a smal=
l cup of milk.
 Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the=
 mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.<BR=
><BR>At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =
a great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=
n the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=
e a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=
 wonderful man and made him his Guru.<BR><BR>Avadhoot Kesavananda is anothe=
r Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji.=
 He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused=
 to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for =
him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to=
 this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, a=
nd they wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This=
 is
 Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Pan=
chagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.<BR><BR>There is another great =
Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He=
 used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after m=
eals. "Avadhootas" are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real Av=
adhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are=
 destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere l=
ife. He was Poornabodha' s Guru and Swami Krishnananda' s Guru. Once in his=
 Ashram, they prepared very good food, and Brahmendra Swami ordered the foo=
d to be given to cows. He used to make severe tests. Sankarananda is also h=
is disciple. He had a very strong body and lived an austere life.<BR><BR>--=
