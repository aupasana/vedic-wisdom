Friends,

First of all how do you find your gotra Maharishi if you are not a hindu
or you are not able to trace your ancestory to the vedic times?

This is very Hindu specific,I can understand that,but I am also sure that
almighty Lord must have some plans for others also.
What happens to 80% of the world's population ,(add some more because all
hindus also don't know there Gotra Rishis-I know PVR has said if one
doesn't know ,one can just move on to the next step but it has to
remembered that human nature abhors vacum and specially if it concerns
the ancestory in case of Indians)

There has to be some way either by the Family Name or anyother name used
in place of Family name whcih maps to 12 Rashis or 27/28 nakashtras.May
be the Maharishis can be mapped to the Rashis/Nakastras.

Namaste

Each one of us comes from a specific Maha Rishi and accordingly
we have Gotra associated with us.

>From my perspective the only time I have used it is when doing some pooja
and making the sankalpa.

I am wondering if one should everyday worship or remember the MahaRishi.
May be with time we have either forgotten doing it.

Also like we have mantra for Gods and Goddess. It appears to me that
there should be also mantra to remember or thank or pray the MahaRishi.

How does one get about finding these mantras and other information
that is specific to a particular MahaRishi?

Best Regards
Mitesh
