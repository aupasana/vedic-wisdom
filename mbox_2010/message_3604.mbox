 KAVYAKANTHA Ganapathi Sastri, Kapali Sastri and his wife Parvathammal,
ent=
er the hall. They all bow before the Maharshi and take their seats. Many
ot=
hers are present.

Kapali: In respect of the Current working within me, I f=
ind a difference in
its strength according to the places in which I am in. =
Is that right?

Maharshi: Yes.

Kapali: I find it working in me more intens=
ely in Tiruvannamalai than
elsewhere; more strongly in this hall and in Bha=
gavan's presence (K. feels
thrilled as he speaks).

[After a pause]

Kapali=
: When after a long struggle and development (by sadhana) one attains
siddh=
i, is the attainment due to his effort or to the action of the Spirit
or Po=
wer which is the object of his upasana?

Maharshi: It is the action of the =
Current.

Kapali: So it is not the aspirant's actions that make him get sid=
dhi, but it
is the act of the Current?

M: Yes.

Then Kapali Sastriar point=
s to the Maharshi's own case of quitting home, and
being drawn to Tiruvanna=
malai as an instance of the above.

Kapali: Is it That which drew Bhagavan =
from Madurai to Tiruvannamalai?

M: Yes. You see in the letter left at home=
 at the time of leaving, I first
wrote "By His command." And then added abo=
ve it "In search of my Father." It
is He that drew me. I wrote that and lef=
t. Also, finding funds was not due
to my efforts. My brother of his own acc=
ord told me, "You had better take
and pay my school fees at the school," an=
d out of the five rupees given for
that I took three rupees for the train t=
o Tindivanam. Judging the distance
from an out-of-date atlas of India, Tind=
ivanam was the nearest railway
station to Tiruvannamalai. Again, the train =
which usually leaves at 11.45
a.m. was unusually late. I left home after 12=
 noon for the station and was
still there in time to catch it.

The correct=
 information about my destination was given to me by an old
Muslim with a s=
ilvery white flowing beard, one or two stations after we left
Madurai. "Whe=
re are you going swami?" he queried. "To Tiruvannamalai and so
I have gotte=
n a ticket to Tindivanam," I replied. "You are a strange
passenger to go to=
 Tindivanam in route to Tiruvannamalai. I am also going
there," he said and=
 added, "and we should change trains at Villupuram. You
should not go to Ti=
ndivanam at all." He informed me that he was going to
Tirukoilur, but stran=
gely I did not find him when after some time I looked
for him in the carria=
ge. After that, I did not think of him at all.

Kapali: That must have been=
 Siva. Why call him a Muslim?

[There was a pause in the conversation as Bh=
agavan remained silent.]

Kapali continued: Did Bhagavan come straight to t=
he temple?

Maharshi: Yes. The doors were all open then and I went straight=
 to the
garbhagraham (shrine). There was no one else present.

Kapali: And =
Bhagavan reported his arrival to Arunachaleswara.

Maharshi: As though Arun=
achala did not know of it otherwise...!

Kapali: Before Maharshi left, ther=
e was previous pan pakkam (process of
maturity) going on in his mind, was t=
here not?

M: Yes, for one whole month prior to my departure I had felt lik=
e I was a
dead man - like a corpse. I imagined to myself, "Now I am a corps=
e, they
will carry this away. I felt I was not the body. I was quite distin=
ct. My
ideas were quite transformed from what they were before a complete c=
hange.

Kapali: Had the chastisement, "What work is there here for a person=
 who is
like this?" been uttered to Bhagavan before the day he left Madurai=
?

Maharshi: Yes. But earlier it had produced no effect. On that day it was=

sufficient to make me leave home. The time had come for that.
