Dear Rajarshi,

"the brahmanas gained supremacy and they started marrying k=
ashtriya  women. This 
resulted, in ashuric forces being born in this mater=
ial  plane of existence"

Could you clarify this...brahmanas marrying kshat=
riya women is not exactly a 
crime...

Also, the reason I has posted the in=
itial e-mail was because it is said that we 
are attracted to a particular =
form of the diety because of previous samskaras 
but clearly Ravana did not=
 have this reason for his devotion to Shiva...

The other interesting thing=
 about the various births of Jaya and Vijaya is that 
they chose to be born=
 as enemies of Vishnu so that they could return to 
Vaikuntha sooner....it =
took them three yugas! food for thought for those wanting 
liberation in a =
lifetime!!!

e-manasaputras-jaya-vijaya/


Interestingly this blog writer is either a me=
mber of this group or is someone, 
who is familiar with Narasimhas's work, =
since he cites his tarpana manuals on 
this website!

Dear Utpal,
 
In the actual Ma=
habharata, before the actual story starts there are many parts 
and descrip=
tions of different things and spiritual lineages. There is history to 
the =
place of Kurukshetra it says. 
 
It is mentions that once there was a time =
when - due to the actions of Sri 
Parashurama - the brahmanas gained suprem=
acy and they started marrying kashtriya 
women. This resulted, in ashuric f=
orces being born in this material plane of 
existence. So all the deities c=
ame to Narayan asking for help. Narayan consoled 
them saying he will come =
down to earth himself and that they - the gods and 
rishis - too must sent =
down their own amsa along with him and chose which 
ashuras they must fight=
. 

 
Thus during the course of the Mahabharata, at many times Krishna made=
 Arjuna 
fight and destroy different cluster of ashuras and finally made su=
re Ashuras do 
not take birth in human forms. Aurobindo says these days an =
Ashura can influence 
the minds of people, not come down directly.

<div>Dear Utpal,</div>
<div> </div>
<=
div>In the actual Mahabharata, before the actual story starts the=
re are many parts and descriptions of different things and spiritual lineag=
es. There is history to the place of Kurukshetra it says. </div>
<div>=
 </div>
<div>It is mentions that once there was a time when - due=
 to the actions of Sri Parashurama - the brahmanas gained supremacy and the=
y started marrying kashtriya women. This resulted, in ashuric forces being =
born in this material plane of existence. So all the deities came to Naraya=
n asking for help. Narayan consoled them saying he will come down to earth =
himself and that they - the gods and rishis - too must sent down their=
 own amsa along with him and chose which ashuras they must fight. </div>
<d=
iv> </div>
<div>Thus during the course of the Mahabharata, at many tim=
es Krishna made Arjuna fight and destroy different cluster of ashuras and f=
inally made sure Ashuras do not take birth in human forms. Aurobindo says t=
hese days an Ashura can influence the minds of people, not come down direct=
ly.</div>
