Respected Sir,

My experience with Chandi homam has not been so good.I coul=
dn't withstand her tests and one needs to be very strong to face it. With a=
 weak mind I lost on her and in return she took away something I was very a=
ttached to. (BTW applaud to all those who chandi homam on a regular basis)
=
As goddess Chandi is the powerful form of Goddess Durga. I feel maybe Godde=
ss Durga might be a bit gentle. Can you guide me about this god and would i=
t be ok if I do her homam instead? In all your manuals you have explained n=
ature of various gods. Can you please tell me about Goddess durga in a simi=
lar fashion? Kindly correct me if I am wrong anywhere in my understanding. =
Thanks for your kind guidance always,

Regards,
Priya
