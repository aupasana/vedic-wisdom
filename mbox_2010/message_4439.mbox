Dear Rajarshi,

I don't think we need to throw out Astrology completely .=
.its a fantastic tool again having its own purpose..but as Narasimha says s=
urrender to god and do sadhana..then i guess everything in life opens up fo=
r=C2=A0us in life..including astrology in its tue sense.. than it is=C2=A0 =
being currently taught...

Dear friends,

Namaste!

=
Astrologers routinely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and poo=
jas and people spend a lot of money on them. Do they work? I will give my 2=
 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, stra=
ight-forward and blunt.

* * *

Though believers call priests and get pooja=
s done, in the hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today =
are incapable of producing any results. As a result, some believers got acc=
ustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remai=
n hungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in =
god and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then =
talk about what we should do.

In ancient times, caste system was not as ri=
gid as it is today. One's varna was decided based on one's aptitude. One pr=
imarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana.=
 One primarily interested in power, authority and control over others would=
 be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One p=
rimarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would star=
t off with the varna of one's father, as that is what one is exposed to in =
childhood. However, as one's vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would=
 get one's own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can late=
r turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Vi=
swamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi=
.

In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested=
 in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence,=
 money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated eno=
ugh spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable=
 of performing very effective poojas for people.

Today, people who have sp=
iritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to d=
evelop fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahman=
a families may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing f=
ully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatr=
iya/Vaisya/ Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are inter=
ested in power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleas=
ures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i=
.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done gen=
uine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.
=

* * *

If one has one million dollars in one's bank account, a check given=
 by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one's bank account is empty,=
 what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similar=
ly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual en=
ergy cannot bring one any benefits.

One important note: The power is not i=
n a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ri=
tual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables =
(mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated wh=
en mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. =
Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different ki=
nds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produc=
es anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just enga=
ging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priest=
s did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did ri=
tuals at the houses of people or in temples.

I did see priests who have do=
ne good sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But t=
hose are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not ban=
k on finding such a priest.

* * *

Given this, one is better off not depen=
ding on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against=
 the "Brahmana by birth" class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana fa=
mily myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the "Brahmana by birth" cla=
ss. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into =
true Brahmanas.

Instead of a Brahmana-by- birth who is possibly proud of h=
is skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your t=
rouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification =
with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be better than t=
he priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantr=
a/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.

* *=
 *

Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a t=
rained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite c=
omplicated over the time too!

However, complexity of rituals should never =
be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories every=
day, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have =
no access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a =
balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a=
 bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast ge=
t some energy.

Similarly, if you do not know the "perfect way" to do a man=
tra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start =
with what you know. It will only give you energy.

* * *

The fear to do ri=
tuals without "perfect knowledge" stems from the notion that some mantras/r=
ituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irr=
elevant today.

It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and ritual=
s and get specific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiri=
tual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific =
powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things=
 in this age.

I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be use=
d to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun nee=
ds to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use =
it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.

However, suppose the house l=
ord purposely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just=
 like a stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on=
 how to use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies wi=
th it.

"Ammunition" has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras =
and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect know=
ledge, one can start using them right away.

A lot of technicalities relate=
d to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to b=
e taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicaliti=
es one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be p=
laced on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one=
's devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come=
.

Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect =
specific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should jus=
t do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and =
what result should be given.

Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the=
 end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or t=
he other!!!

* * *

Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of=
 different shapes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a be=
gging bowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is impo=
rtant to start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spen=
ding years looking for the perfect begging bowl.

Instead of waiting for as=
trologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfec=
t mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an e=
lder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshar=
i mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman ch=
alisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu's shadakshari/ ashtakshari/ dwadas=
akshari mantra, Venkateswara' s ashtakshari/ dwadasakshari mantra, hare kri=
shna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahas=
ranaama stotra, Vyasa's navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtotta=
rashatanaam a stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purp=
ose.

Do not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect proce=
dure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sinc=
ere heart.

Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or yo=
u may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will=
 improve.

* * *

In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, t=
he sadhana of rishis.

Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unli=
ke the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies =
whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i=
.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending ti=
me worshipping god through fire purifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam =
is far more effective than most other sadhanas in improving one's focus, ch=
anging one's inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacle=
s. One need not take my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a fe=
w months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.

Vedic seers (rishis) p=
erformed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the =
Jyotish masterpiece "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the adve=
nt of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara=
 recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various proble=
ms in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. P=
arasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fir=
e and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main man=
tra to beused in homam. Parasara's clear teachings set to rest the notion t=
hat some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.

* * *

In Bhagavad =
Gita, Sri Krishna said, "yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi" , i.e. I am japa among =
all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation=
) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.

In the line j=
ust above that line, Sri Krishna also said, "I am Om among all mantras". Ho=
wever, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra "Om" and leave all other=
 mantras?

If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of cli=
mbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using va=
rious kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach th=
e pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.

Similarly, Om is the =
supreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may=
 require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and abso=
rbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but=
 it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of =
sacrifices (hama/yajna) .

When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in=
 external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the =
Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and =
contemplates) , one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is=
 far more effective.

* * *

Detailed manuals giving short procedures for d=
oing various types of homam by oneself are available on the website given b=
elow. You can use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of=
 short homam by yourself.

Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by=
 themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.

Wh=
en Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in messa=
ge 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=
dic- wisdom/message/ 3481) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before h=
im during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed=
 him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him t=
hat hundreds of thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a =
few years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it =
seemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.

However, just 4 years after =
the Mother's command, hundreds of people are already performing regular hom=
am. Though these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Som=
e of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do A=
NY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam ever=
yday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that so=
me people doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experi=
ence things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid i=
nternal transformation.

* * *

I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. =
I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just=
 freely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The =
rest is not in my hands.

I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invit=
e those who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! I=
f one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great p=
otential to transform one's life, materially and spiritually. .

 careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one =
should hurt oneself by accident.<BR><BR>However, suppose the house lord pur=
posely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a=
 stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to=
 use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.<=
BR><BR>"Ammunition" has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras a=
nd rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of
 waiting for perfect know=
ledge, one can start using them right away.<BR><BR>A lot of technicalities =
related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals ar=
e to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever techni=
calities one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis shoul=
d be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventual=
ly one's devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result ma=
y come.<BR><BR>Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we ca=
nnot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So w=
e should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who decid=
es when and what result should be given.<BR><BR>Bottomline is that no effor=
t is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the ot=
her, sometime or the other!!!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Different mantras and rit=
uals are like begging bowls of different
 shapes. They matter only so much.=
 Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given differe=
nt kind of alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging bow=
l or the other, instead of spending years looking for the perfect begging b=
owl.<BR><BR>Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conce=
ived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart=
 tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras l=
ike Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, =
Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vish=
nu's shadakshari/ ashtakshari/ dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara' s ashtak=
shari/ dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptash=
ati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa's navagraha stot=
ra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaam a stotra etc are *generic*=
 and can work for anyone for any
 purpose.<BR><BR>Do not waste time looking=
 for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and j=
ust do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.<BR><BR>Your effort w=
ill not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your situa=
tion and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.<BR><BR>* * *<BR=
><BR>In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of=
 rishis.<BR><BR>Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the =
elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whateve=
r it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. pur=
ifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time wors=
hipping god through fire purifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far =
more effective than most other sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing =
one's inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One =
need not take my words for
 granted. One can try for oneself for a few mont=
hs. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.<BR><BR>Vedic seers (rishis) p=
erformed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the =
Jyotish masterpiece "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the adve=
nt of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara=
 recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various proble=
ms in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. P=
arasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fir=
e and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main man=
tra to beused in homam. Parasara's clear teachings set to rest the notion t=
hat some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>=
In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, "yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi" , i.e. I am=
 japa among all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam=
 (meditation) is
 superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.<B=
R><BR>In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, "I am Om amo=
ng all mantras". However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra "Om" =
and leave all other mantras?<BR><BR>If one says that sitting on the pinnacl=
e is the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the proces=
s of climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs=
 that process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directl=
y.<BR><BR>Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source of a=
ll, but reaching the source may require using several mantras first to puri=
fy oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) ma=
y be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and preparation=
 by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna) .<BR><BR>When one do=
es homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely =
to reach
 samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified p=
erson does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates) , one may reach samadhi=
. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.<BR><BR>* * *<BR>=
<BR>Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of hom=
am by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the res=
ources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourself.=
<BR><BR>Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves either =
daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.<BR><BR>When Manish (my=
 spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of ve=
dic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. <A href=3D"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=
wisdom/message/3481" rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank>http://groups. yahoo.co=
m/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 3481</A>) told me that the Divine Mother ap=
peared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March=
 2006,
 directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world, =
and showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would be performing reg=
ular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Tru=
th on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.<BR><BR>Howeve=
r, just 4 years after the Mother's command, hundreds of people are already =
performing regular homam. Though these are just the early days, the develop=
ments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and di=
d not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people =
are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also k=
now personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years are actua=
lly starting to experience things within and outside and, more importantly,=
 going through rapid internal transformation.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I am neit=
her a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do
=
 I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know, what I saw an=
d what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.<BR><BR>I want t=
o respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of i=
nterest to check out the homam website! If one gets into the habit of perfo=
rming homam regularly, it has the great potential to transform one's life, =
materially and spiritually. .<BR><BR>Homam website:<BR><A href=3D"http://ww=
