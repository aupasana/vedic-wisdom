Namaste Sri Aashish,

Everything looks fine. Just keep reciting the Saptash=
loki, and why limit it once? It just takes 5 minutes (if you are not acquai=
nted), so you can do it 11 times or more!

You might also want to try Devi =
Kavacham from the same book Durga Saptashati or Chandi Path. This is basica=
lly the armour of the goddess, specifically designed to protect oneself fro=
m all evils, both mentally & physically.

Hope this helps.
Regards
Narayan
