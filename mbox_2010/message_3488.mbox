The Lord dwells in the temple of the human body. He knows our innermost tho=
ughts. If there is anything wrong in image worship, does He not know that a=
ll worship is meant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing that i=
t is for Him.=C2=A0=C2=A0

So true. If only people could understand this si=
mple logic stated above.

=C2=A0 




The disciple a=
sked: "Bhagavan, one may believe that God is with form, but surely He is no=
t in the earthen images that are worshipped?" Sri Ramakrishna replied: "My =
dear sir, why do you say earthen images? The image of the Divine Being is m=
ade of the spirit."=C2=A0

The disciple could not understand the meaning of=
 this, but answered: "Yet should it not be one's duty to make clear to thos=
e who worship images that God is not the same as the images and that at the=
 time of worship they should think of God Himself and not of the image made=
 of clay?"=C2=A0

The Bhagavan said: "The Lord of the universe teaches mank=
ind. He who has made the sun and moon, men and brutes; He who has created t=
hings for them to live upon, parents to tend and rear them; He who has done=
 so many things will surely do something to bring them to the light. [p. 63=
]

The Lord dwells in the temple of the human body. He knows our innermost =
thoughts. If there is anything wrong in image worship, does He not know tha=
t all worship is meant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing tha=
t it is for Him. Why should you worry yourself about things which are beyon=
d your reach? Try to realize God and love Him. This is your first duty. "Yo=
u speak of images made of clay.=C2=A0

Well, there often comes a necessity =
for worshipping such images and symbols. In Vedanta it is said, the absolut=
e Existence-Intellige nce-Bliss pervades the universe and manifests itself =
through all forms. What harm is done by worshipping the Absolute through im=
ages and symbols? We see little girls with their dolls.=C2=A0

How long do =
they play with them? So long as they are not married. After marriage they p=
ut away those dolls.=C2=A0Similarly, one needs images and symbols so long a=
s God is not realized in His true form.=C2=A0It is God Himself who has prov=
ided these various forms of worship. [p. 64]

The Master of the universe ha=
s done all this to suit different men in different stages of spiritual grow=
th and knowledge. The mother so arranges the food for her children that eac=
h one gets what is best for him. Suppose a mother has five children with on=
e fish to cook for all. She will make different dishes of it that she may g=
ive to each just what suits him,-- the rich pulao for one, soup for another=
, fried fish for a third, fish with sour tamarind for a fourth and so on, e=
xactly according to the power of digestion of each.
