The Fire Yogi

A documentary exploring the journey of a Yogi who has the
extraordinary ability to use a unique breathing technique to get into
union with Fire. This non-religious documentary portrays a rare and
unusual Fire Ritual performed by a Yogi from India and the subsequent
chemical analysis of his clothing and physical tests that examine this
supernatural phenomenon. The Yogi has performed this Fire Ritual for a
total of 1000 days over the last 45 years. The Yogi, weighing a mere
94 pounds around 43 kilos has been able to survive on only two bananas
and a mere glass of milk with a few drops of water twice a day for the
last 28 years. The ritual is performed for Universal Harmony , Global
Welfare and Individual Prosperity. Many aspects of the Yogi are on the
edge of unbelievability, while at the same time highlighting the power
and endurance of human mind, body and spirit.
