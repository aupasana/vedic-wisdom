Namaste Rajarshi

I appreciate your response, I respect Vimalananda like I =
respect others and his books. I also respect your views on him and his book=
s and also you.

Depending on the type of sadhana, one does find good liter=
ature that  does answer some questions or even more if one keeps doing sadh=
ana
with the questions in mind at some point those questions do get resolve=
d.

I am very happy to hear that you are well read please share things from=
 other books too. I submit here based on ones sanskars one does gravitate m=
ore towards certain books, certain types of sadhana. As the sanskars change=
 the gravitation also changes.

In fact in these times very hard to find li=
ving vimalananda or ramakrishna or lahiri mahashya or others of that catego=
ry.

There are some equally capable masters today, however either they have=
 a very big following or they are hidden.

Thanks for the name of Trilinga =
swami.

Best Regards
Mitesh
