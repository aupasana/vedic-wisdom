Brahmarpanam brahma havir brahmagnau brahmanahutam
Brahmaiva tena ganta=
vyam brahma-karma-samadhina


Namaste friends,


Firstly though the terms h=
oma and yajna are popularly used as synonyms, technically there is a differ=
ence. Havan and Homa are terms used to refer to small yajnas. Both havan an=
d homa can be performed by the individual and do not need a priest unlike a=
 yajna.  Yajna is medium to large scale and needs anywhere from 3 to 16 pri=
ests depending on the specificity of the ritual. Kratu is even larger in te=
rms of duration, complexity and scale. Now let me address the most importan=
t part of your query wrt certain verses of the 3rd chapter in B. Gita. I wi=
ll give an overview of Yajna in its various forms as embodied in Hinduism, =
tracing its evolution in the sastras.

 
In the Rig Veda it first appears a=
s an instrument and objective, more as a concept, as an outcome of will and=
 contemplation. In the Yajurveda it is clearly described as a ritual. The K=
alpa Sutras treat it as a conduct. The Upanishads as well as the B. Gita pr=
esent a vedantic version while the Puranas give it a literally embodied phy=
sical form in their characteristic mythological style. The Tantras reveal a=
n even more personal and internal version of yajna.
 
The word `yajna' is d=
erived from the root verb `yaj' which has three possible meanings:
 
1.	`to=
 worship', 
2.	`to unite or congregate' 
3.	`to give'         

Accordingly=
 `yajna' can mean:

1.	A ritual as in yaga    
2.	Unification or congregati=
on of people, sangatikaran
3.	Giving or offering

Whilst the Vaidik yajna a=
s a ritual has all these aspects to it, the Upanishads (whose spirit and es=
sence the B.Gita crystallizes most beautifully) and Tantras transform the c=
oncept of Yajna into an inner phenomenon.
  
Let us first examine Yajna as =
a universal phenomenon. All of nature is in a cyclic phenomenon wherein all=
 parts of the universe are interdependent for their sustenance and growth. =
For instance trees receive the essence required for their growth from the e=
arth and atmosphere apart from sunlight, but give their fruits to other sen=
tient beings. However this act of giving is not for oneself, not a calculat=
ed self-motivated act. Nor is it in return for what has been received. That=
 is why it is called a sacrifice. Be it the food chain or rain or anything =
else in nature, everything is in an interdependent, cyclic phenomenon of sa=
crifice. The rishis intuited the phenomenon of yajna and the spirit of sacr=
ifice both in the external universe as well as in the depths of their own c=
onsciousness. They realized that the spirit of yajna/sacrifice had to be th=
e foundation of all karmas whether they are for the creation of wealth or f=
or any other goal of life. Thus Yajna becomes not just a way of life but TH=
E way of life. Applying the spirit of sacrifice to human ACTIONS paves way =
to at least two versions.

 
1.	The first is an external emulation of the p=
rinciple of Yajna through Ritual based action. This is the external yajna o=
r Dravya Yajna, yajna as an actual ritual. This is the grosser level of yaj=
na

2.	The second is a more refined form of sacrifice that does not involve=
 physical oblations in the sacrificial fire. It involves discharging one's =
duties by interacting in the world keeping the spirit of yajna in the heart=
. Done with the spirit of yajna every action becomes an oblation in the Kar=
ma yajna.
  
By now we have examined three forms of Yajna.
 
1.	The Cosmic =
form of Yajna or Yajna in Nature- Paroksha yajna
2.	External yajna or Dravy=
a yajna or Ritual Yajna
3.	Karma yajna 

The picture is however not yet com=
plete. Yajna is revealed as a concept, as a phenomenon in the Veda Samhita.=
 It is perfected as a Ritual in the Brahmana texts. The Aranyakas which res=
ulted from the retired forest dwellers' secluded and introspective lifestyl=
e emphasise that external yajna can and should stimulate a parallel INTERNA=
L process (yajnasya antarangah). The Upanishads finally crystallize the ess=
ence of Yajna as a philosophy of life, nay as THE way of life as the B. Git=
a too upholds. This refinement inevitably paved way to the development of t=
he INTERNAL yajna. This is the fourth version of Yajna.
 
The Pranagnihotra=
 Upanishad establishes the equivalence between parts of the physical yajna =
and parts of the human body. There is a one on one equivalence of all parts=
: The atma is the yajamana, shraddha (faith) is the patni (yajamana's wife)=
, body is the fuel (samidha) and so on. In the Chandogya Upanishad, yajna b=
ecomes the journey of the soul in this life. The soul is of course the yaja=
mana. All the sense organs assemble or congregate in the body to help the y=
ajamana perform the yajna and are therefore the ritvijs (priests). The soul=
 can never be inactive as long as it is associated with a mortal body. Acti=
ons emanate inevitably from the mind, sense organs and body. Thus yajna mea=
ns the totality of actions performed by the individual throughout life. In =
other words the whole of life is a Yajna. In fact the Chandogya Upanishad e=
ven divides life into three parts and allocates specific objectives to the =
three parts, based on the three savannas of the srauta yajna. Even the life=
 span is calculated as 116 years based on the metres of the mantras used in=
 the three savannas. The Chandogya Upanishad exhorts us to undertake auster=
ities with the spirit of service to others as the basis of all actions. 


=
Yajna is undoubtedly one of the prescribed duties of religious life. In the=
 past generally it was the kings and wealthy people who used to perform yaj=
nas and kratus as it requires large amount of wealth as well as the service=
s of many people. But what about the common man? Moreover even if one can a=
fford to do yajnas and homas is it truly possible to do external yajnas con=
sistently on a regular basis in our times? Also can one limit the aim of ya=
jna to mere material prosperity and attaining the higher swargaloka, as aff=
irmed by the Purvamimamsakas? The vedic literature as an interrelated body =
answers all these questions progressively as one studies the Aranyakas as w=
ell as the Upanishads. In fact it is here that every idea and concept reach=
es its most sublime interpretation.


It is first affirmed that even if one=
 cannot actually do yajna karma as prescribed by the Vedas, one can still r=
eap the fruit of the yajna karma chanting the respective riks of the respec=
tive ritual -yam yam kratumadheete tena tenaasyeshtam bhavati (Taittiriya A=
ranyaka, 2. 15). It is thus the spirit of yajna that is more important than=
 the ritual itself, not withstanding the power of mantras. The Smrtis give =
us alternate options such as `Dana', whilst the Upanishads lay emphasis on =
the spirit of yajna, on the philosophy behind the phenomenon of yajna, thus=
 inculcating the attitude that our very life itself is a yajna. 

The B. Gi=
ta takes the phenomenon of Yajna to new heights by expounding Karma yoga in=
 the spirit of Yajna. Considering the difficulties of people in the difficu=
lt Kali yuga, Sri Krishna gives us the most pragmatic interpretation of Yaj=
na without compromising on its spiritual foundation. His interpretation is =
within the reach of the common man, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, ma=
n or woman. This form of yajna requires neither wealth nor external help fr=
om others. Each of us can perform it under all conditions of life. This Yaj=
na is none other than Karma Yajna presented as Karma Yoga. Nishkama karma o=
r selfless actions, actions performed without attachment to the results, se=
lfless service, these are the mainstay of this Maha yajna. Any work done wi=
th the constant remembrance of God is transformed into a sacred sacrifice. =
Any and every action of the worldly life can be transformed into a great ya=
jna if one follows the spirit of Karma yoga. Arjuna himself sublimated a bl=
oody war into a great yajna by keeping the Lord constantly in his heart. In=
 fact he had the great fortune of keeping the Lord in front of him. To the =
diligent and discerning student of the B. Gita the references are in abunda=
nce and the guidance quite clear. Krishna considers repetition of God's nam=
e, self-study of sacred texts, control of the senses and selfless service a=
s all various forms of yajna. 

In the fourth chapter (Jnana Yoga) Sri Kris=
hna clearly reveals the wide and varied sadhanas of Yajna (B. Gita, 4, 24-3=
3). He extends the application of the principle of yajna from its external =
ritualistic limited usage to its great and varied application as a way of l=
ife enabling each of us to take to the practices that are suited to our apt=
itudes, needs and capabilities. Please study the Gita completely and you wi=
ll find many references to various kinds of yajna- dravya yajna, indriya sa=
nyam yajna, tapo yajna, yoga yajna, prana yajna, swadhyaya yajna and jnana =
yajna. Revealing so many alternate ways to perform Yajna, Sri Krishna has e=
xpanded the scope of Yajna to such dimension and depth that it is not only =
comprehensive and spiritually uncompromising, but also pragmatic and within=
 the reach of everyone. What's more! The fruits of this mahayajna are not m=
ere material prosperity or heavenly abodes, but infinitesimally bigger. In =
a way yajnas performed for the fulfillment of desires lead to further bonda=
ge. But the Karma Yajna prescribed by Sri Krishna has the power to cut asun=
der the bonds of even karma. Anasakta or Nishkama karma yoga as a way of li=
fe can eventually raise us to the original state of awareness and freedom. =
                  

While there are other facets to Yajna that are not nece=
ssary at the level or context of this discussion, the picture presented so =
far is incomplete in so far as the various sadhana margas of Hinduism are c=
oncerned without at least a passing reference to Tantra marga. As already s=
tated in the other thread on initiation, mantramarga etc Tantra internalize=
s the whole journey within the lab of consciousness. The Agni of the Yajna =
becomes the Chidagni within the individual. In the internal yajna, the spin=
al cord becomes the arani. Just as fire is ignited at the bottom of the ara=
ni in external yajna, the internal fire is ignited at the bottom or at the =
root (mooladhara) where the reservoir or fire-pit or `kunda' exists. Those =
familiar with the Lalitasahasranama will identify `chit agni kunda sambhuta=
' as one of her names. She is none other than the Sakti within the individu=
al consciousness. Since the sakti resides in a dormant form in that kunda, =
she is referred to as Kundalini sakti. Thus the Kalagni (cosmic level) of t=
he Veda samhita becomes the Kundalini in the Tantras. Just as Kalagni, Lauk=
ikagni and Yajnagni are different levels of Agni, so too are the fire of in=
tellect/buddhi, the fire of speech, the fire of austerity etc various equiv=
alents of the functions of Agni in the internal yajna whilst Kundalini rema=
ins the internal Yajnagni. I will stop here as further intellectualization =
is neither required nor recommended in such matters.

                
Befo=
re wrapping up, I will recap the various meanings of the root verb `yaj'.
 =

1.	`to worship', 
2.	`to unite or congregate' 
3.	`to give'         

Thou=
gh I cannot trace in detail now, I will indicate this much. The all-importa=
nt `Satsangha' can be partly traced to the second facet/meaning of yajna as=
 a union or congregation. Likewise the third facet/meaning of yajna is take=
n up predominantly by the Puranas in fleshing out the practice of `Dana'. O=
ne has to bear in mind that each of these practices has the other facets of=
 yajna too inbuilt into it as all the three meanings are interrelated in th=
e larger phenomenon of Yajna.
