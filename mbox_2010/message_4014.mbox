My 2 cents.
- As in Bollywood Movies, the Socio-Religio-Moral mess is easil=
y worked out if Nityananda marries with the person in Video and thus make p=
eace with the agitated society. This would allow him to work freely in Soci=
ety.

veral Christians have returned to Hinduism by getting

into his organization. The swami himself has spoken
