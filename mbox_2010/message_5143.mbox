Namaste everybody
I want to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi =
Maha Sannidanam Sri
Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal
When Swamigal was s=
taying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the
learned persons m=
ale and female alike
requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNama=
m in kannada language
so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.
Swa=
migal didn't reply to this request which was made early in the morning.
Lat=
er in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Postman came to
c=
amp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was
serious=
ly looking at the cover
in front of the learned members and was looking at =
one line written as PIN
Code and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the=
 learned members to
explain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell t=
hat. But everyone
understood the significance of that number. Then swamigal=
 asked his crew
member to pick up one LIFCO's abbreviations book from his l=
ibrary and read
the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that =
even the meaning
of PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves =
the purpose and
people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowi=
ng the meaning of
Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of cha=
nting the stothsram
was he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring s=
ome clue to our
discussion forum

<div>Namaste everybody</div>
<div>I want to share one anecdote happened in =
front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal</di=
v>
<div>When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One da=
y all the learned persons male and female alike</div>
<div>requested Swamig=
al to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada language so that they ca=
n chant knowing the meaning fully.</div>
<div>Swamigal didn't reply to =
this request which was made early in the morning. Later in the day after th=
e days pooja etc were over as usual Postman came to camp to deliver the pos=
ts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was seriously looking at the cove=
r</div>

<div>in front of the learned members and was looking at=A0one line=
=A0written as=A0PIN Code and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the lea=
rned members to explain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that.=
 But everyone understood the significance of that number. Then swamigal ask=
ed his crew member to pick up one LIFCO's abbreviations book from his l=
ibrary and read the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that =
even the meaning of PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves =
the purpose and people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowi=
ng the meaning of Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of cha=
nting the stothsram was he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring s=
ome clue to our discussion forum</div>

<p>Namaste Girish,<br><br>I am not at all against knowing the meanin=
g, so that one can immerse oneself in what one is chanting. That is definit=
ely the ideal situation.<br><br>If that is not possible, what I am saying i=
s that reading something composed by an elevated being even without underst=
anding the meaning is very useful. Suppose someone does not understand what=
 Ganapathi Atharvaseersham means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapath=
i as the source of everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ga=
napathi. One can still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anythi=
ng, it is more likely because one does not have the correct attitude and su=
rrender and probably not because one does know the specific meaning of Gana=
pathi Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may als=
o experience nothing.<br>
<br>The words uttered by a realized soul have mea=
nings at many layers and literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Som=
e important layers are lost in translation. The most important layers of me=
aning are never understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.=
<br>
<br>Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm =
and relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a target=
 count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If i=
t is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the deity, it can=
 do something. The key to success with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If=
 a mind is filled with thousands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is =
just one of those thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most thought=
s subside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when=
 one experiences a mantra.<br>
<br>There are 4 levels of sabda. When one sa=
ys a mantra, physical vibration is accompanied in other layers by the image=
ry in the mind, the thoughts and instincts in the conscious and sub-conscio=
us mind etc. Some mantras composed by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (=
essentially beings with very stable and calm minds) are designed such that =
the physical vibration of the mantra can eventually cause the corresponding=
 imagery in the mind by resonance, when other mental activity subsides. Thu=
s, after repeating the mantra and calming the mind down, you can recreate a=
 certain imagery and thought system in your mind. That can permanently alte=
r the way your mind workd. But the key is to attain a reasonably stable, fo=
cused and calm mind.<br>
<br>Sant Dnyaneshwar's Marathi interpretation =
of BhagavadGita and Sant Tulsidas's Hindi compositions have a power of =
their own, as they were realized souls. In comparison, for examplle, Satyad=
evaashtakam composed by me, though in metrical Sanskrit, will not have a si=
milar power.

to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play ba=

 result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not many ar=

one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or =
Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik pat=

erial result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are c=
apable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an incr=
ease of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation =
or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.<=

 MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? =
Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute req=

question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as en=
joined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.<br>

as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches an=
d multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. I=
n the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the curre=
nt context of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that ar=
e relevant to the discussion.<br>

, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can=
 greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The d=
irect path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vi=
chara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vai=
dik system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regu=
lar self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practic=
es involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for externa=
l practices.<br>
> <br>> > > > <br>> <br>> > > &=
gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) an=
d Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additi=
onally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the =
Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise o=

emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will through total surr=

 the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of=
 initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana invo=
lves the practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sa=
bda through the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent =
to any lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. I=
t should be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or A=
gni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the referen=
ce here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke=
 Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire=
 of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fir=
e of the Yagnya and so on.<br>
> <br>> > > > <br>> <br>&g=

of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs hi=

asis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualificat=
ion. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervisio=
n? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other =
lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apa=

 the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening =
the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalin=

in from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needl=
