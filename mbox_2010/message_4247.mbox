Narayana Iyer was a devotee who came to scoff, but remained as a worshipper=
.
Before he met Bhagavan he was an out and out sceptic with no religion in
=
him. He considered sannyasins and sadhus to be impostors and parasites and
=
felt that no one, however great, had the right to accept the homage of
othe=
rs. But a chance meeting with Bhagavan wrought a complete transformation
in=
 this doubting Thomas and turned him into a staunch devotee.

Dr Ramakrishn=
a Iyer was his friend, philosopher and guide. Like Narayana
Iyer, this doct=
or was also working in Chetpet. He was well acquainted with
Bhagavan, being=
 the son of Lakshmi Ammal of Tiruchuzhi, one of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
childhoo=
d playmates. He invited Narayana Iyer to go with him to
Tiruvannamalai duri=
ng the Deepam festival, and his invitation was accepted,
even though Naraya=
na Iyer disliked crowds and temple festivals had no
attraction for him; he =
agreed on the condition that he would neither come
inside the ashram nor pr=
ostrate to the swami if perchance he met him.

Circumstances forced him to =
accompany his friend into the ashram. As they
were coming inside, a person =
clad only in a white loin cloth, a towel on his
shoulder, a kamandalu [wate=
r pot] in one hand and a walking stick in the
other stopped in his walk in =
the opposite direction when he saw them. He
spoke kindly to the doctor and =
enquired about his mother and brother. Though
Iyer guessed that this must b=
e the Maharshi, he did not look up, thinking
that, after all, he was a comp=
lete stranger to him. On being introduced as
the Sub-registrar of Chetpet, =
out of courtesy he looked up. Let us hear him
now in his own words:

=E2=80=
=98What a wonderful face and what a welcoming smile! Bewitching, fascinatin=
g
and a powerful look too! In a moment I was at his feet on the gravel
grou=
nd=E2=80=A6. He is not bogus=E2=80=A6. looks genuine=E2=80=A6. but has he s=
olved the mystery of
life, of the universe that we see around us? If not, I=
 withdraw my homage
and go my way=E2=80=A6. I tried to find out if he had w=
ritten any books. I got a
copy of Ulladu Narpadu [Reality in Forty Verses] =
in Tamil. It had just been
published.=E2=80=99

As he tried to read the fir=
st stanza he was confounded and filled with
dismay at the repeated use of t=
he word ulladu, which seemed too closely
packed. The pure language, embodyi=
ng the essence of absolute reality, would
drive even pundits of Tamil proso=
dy to despair. Someone nearby said that the
Maharshi himself would explain =
the forty verses that night. In anxious and
eager suspense Narayana Iyer wa=
ited for the night.

A solemn stillness pervaded the air. There was absolut=
e silence. The
Maharshi read the first stanza. The mere reading of it made =
the meaning as
clear as clarity itself. Stanza by stanza he read and explai=
ned in a voice
so sweet and melodious, it seemed to come from a transcenden=
t being.

The climax came when he said, after explaining a verse, =E2=80=98=
God cannot be seen
with our eyes and known by our senses. This is what is m=
eant by saying, =E2=80=9CTo
see God is to be God=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=99

It fla=
shed upon Narayana Iyer instantly that if He whom all religions
acclaim as =
God were to appear before him in flesh and blood, here He is.
Successive wa=
ves of bliss flooding from within shook his frame. He went out
to compose h=
imself.

He says, =E2=80=98I came, he saw, he conquered=E2=80=99.

The spel=
l was thus cast. Henceforth Bhagavan was his God. Bhagavan was the
way and =
the support on the way as well.

To Narayana Iyer the content of Ulladu Nar=
padu became a vedic truth and its
verses veritable mantras. He took to chan=
ting them as japa. From then on
nothing could stop him from frequenting the=
 ashram.

His job entailed frequent transfers; he was successively posted t=
o Arani,
Polur, and Shankagiri (Salem) for varying periods. However, there =
was no let
up in his regular visits. Never a Sunday passed without Narayana=
 Iyer
arriving at the ashram. He always had some delectable snacks with him=
 which
were prepared by his wife Lalitha Iyer, who believed that she was co=
oking
delicacies for God. These were savoured by everyone as Bhagavan would=
 never
accept anything unless there was enough for all. Very often Iyer wou=
ld bring
omappodi, [a snack made of gram flour and spices] which Bhagavan a=
ppears to
have been quite fond of, and occasionally he would bring other it=
ems in
quantities that would suffice for all in the hall.

Once when Shanta=
mmal enquired of Bhagavan whether she could prepare some
snacks in the ashr=
am, Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=98Tomorrow is Sunday. Narayana Iyer
will be ar=
riving and will surely be bringing something to eat.=E2=80=99

Such was the=
 certainty of his arrival and of the snacks that came with him.

In those d=
ays [the early thirties] the area surrounding the ashram was very
bare, wit=
h no trees or shrubs. The Mother=E2=80=99s Temple was yet to be
constructed=
. Anyone approaching the precincts of the ashram could be easily
seen from =
the old hall. Once, between two successive weekend visits by
Narayana Iyer,=
 the ashram administration, feeling that Bhagavan needed some
rest in the a=
fternoon after lunch, imposed a restriction that no one would
be allowed to=
 disturb him between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Neither Bhagavan nor
Narayana Iyer =
was aware of this new decree. The following Sunday afternoon,
as usual, Iye=
r arrived with omappodi in hand. As he approached the hall
those strategica=
lly positioned to deflect the would-be visitors until 2 pm,
the new receivi=
ng hour, apprised him of the rule. Iyer, though still at a
great distance f=
rom Bhagavan, made his customary prostration from where he
was, retraced hi=
s steps and waited until the appointed hour.

At 2 p.m. he came before Bhag=
avan. Bhagavan had spied him on his arrival and
noted his subsequent disapp=
earance.

As soon as he entered the hall Bhagavan asked him, =E2=80=98Didn=
=E2=80=99t you come at 1
o=E2=80=99clock? I saw you arriving through the wi=
ndow and was expecting you to come
to the hall at any moment. But you didn=
=E2=80=99t come. Did you have to go
elsewhere?=E2=80=99

Narayana Iyer, who=
 had no idea that Bhagavan was not supposed to know of the
new arrangement,=
 replied in all innocence, =E2=80=98My train arrived late and I
could come =
only at 1 o=E2=80=99clock. I was informed that Bhagavan nowadays rests in
t=
he afternoons and is not to be disturbed until 2 p.m. That=E2=80=99s why I =
have
only come in now.=E2=80=99

Bhagavan listened without any comment, oth=
er than his customary, =E2=80=98Oh! Is
that so?=E2=80=99

The next day afte=
r lunch, instead of going into the hall, Bhagavan sat
outside the hall. The=
 attendant very hesitantly suggested that he go inside,
as it was becoming =
very hot.

Bhagavan said, =E2=80=98Nobody is allowed to enter until 2 p.m. =
Is there also a rule
that I should not sit here until two?=E2=80=99

Then B=
hagavan, the very embodiment of compassion added, =E2=80=98People come from=

far-away places by various means, suffering innumerable hardships in order=

to get here. How can they be sure of the exact time of their arrival? When=

they come after all that trouble, how fair is it to deny them ready access=
?=E2=80=99

Hearing this, the management immediately revoked the new rule.
=

In due course, owing to the profound grace of Bhagavan, Narayana Iyer was
=
posted to Tiruvannamalai itself. He was the first in a long line of devotee=
s
to have had the rare privilege of establishing a residence near the ashra=
m
in order to be in the holy presence of Bhagavan on a regular basis. His
e=
ntire sadhana comprised of simply remaining with Bhagavan whenever
possible=
, in the hall or in the kitchen, cutting vegetables, grinding
chutney and p=
reparing breakfast in the wee hours of the morning. On any
given morning th=
e trio of G. V. Subbaramayya, Kalyana Sundaram Iyer of the
bookstall and Na=
rayana Iyer, would be found with Bhagavan.

One year, due to an unusual spe=
ll of drought, the ashram faced severe water
scarcity on the eve of Jayanth=
i. The devotees, organising themselves into a
long chain, passed vessels fi=
lled with water from hand to hand from the
Agasthya Teertham in Palakothu t=
o the kitchen. Narayana Iyer very
enthusiastically participated in this col=
lective endeavour.

An extensive area of twenty grounds [one acre] was the =
site of Narayana
Iyer=E2=80=99s residence where he grew a variety of fruit =
trees and fodder for his
cow. Whatever wild creatures found in that area we=
re left to themselves.
Occasionally, he had snakes caught and released in i=
solated spots on the
mountain.

Prior to constructing the house, Iyer took =
the plans to Bhagavan to have
them blessed. After careful perusal Bhagavan =
observed, =E2=80=98The plan is all
right, but where is the well?=E2=80=99

=
Though Iyer had a location in mind, it was not marked on the blueprint. Thi=
s
turned out to be a benediction as Bhagavan selected the site and marked t=
he
exact location. Later, one could see what a blessing it was; not only wa=
s
the water as sweet as tender coconut water, but the well never ran dry an=
d
was thus a source of succour for the entire neighbourhood in times of sev=
ere
drought.

His wife was a truly sattvic woman, given to dharmic ways and=
 scrupulously
adhering to the sastraic injunctions pertaining to a housewif=
e. She shared
her husband=E2=80=99s ways and views completely. Though born =
in a rich family, she
had no pretensions or airs about her. Simple, carefre=
e and unattached, she
ran the household with a contented mind and to the sa=
tisfaction of the
entire family, making optimum use of the resources availa=
ble to her. The
children, like the mother, were an uncomplaining lot and we=
re content in
doing what they were told to do by their father.

Iyer=E2=80=
=99s one passion was to chant Ulladu Narpadu unceasingly. Neither
conventio=
nal vedic duties nor extravagant ritualistic observances had any
attraction=
 for him. The constant chanting of Ulladu Narpadu was all the
religious obs=
ervance known to him. It would start right from the morning.

Dyed in brahm=
inical custom, Narayana Iyer looked forward to his invigorating
cup of morn=
ing coffee. The person who milked the cow used to turn up at 5.00
a.m., ann=
ouncing his arrival by ringing his bicycle bell. Iyer, who would
invariably=
 be chanting Ulladu Narpadu loudly, would open the gate for him.
The day wo=
uld, therefore, begin with Ulladu Narpadu, a routine so
predictable and pun=
ctual, the neighbour opposite him, an Andhra lady,
remarked that she could =
safely set her clock by his recitation in the
morning. His chanting continu=
ed throughout the day while he watered the
plants or gave the cow a bath.

=
If ever he were to hear a voice raised in argument among the children, he
w=
ould simply raise his voice and chant even louder. It was a wonder to see
t=
he children immediately quietened, as if the mesmerising spell of this
powe=
rful mantra made them aware of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s very presence.

Kanakamma=
l stayed in Iyer=E2=80=99s compound, occupying a small cottage for nearly
t=
en years. He looked upon me as his own daughter. He always made himself
awa=
re of my requirements when he procured groceries for his own household
and =
would always meet my needs.

Narayana Iyer and Venkataratnam used to narrat=
e to Kanakammal whatever
transpired in the hall during the nights and on da=
ys when Kanakammal was
unable to attend.

Subsequently Iyer was posted to P=
olur, but he did not move his residence
from Tiruvannamalai. Instead, he cy=
cled to the station, left his cycle
there, took the train to Polur and agai=
n cycled to his office from there.
His return in the evening was by the sam=
e route, but like an arrow he would
speed his way directly to the ashram in=
 order to be with Bhagavan. He was
like a calf rushing to its mother. By th=
en it would usually be 9:00 p.m.

One evening, as Iyer came from the statio=
n, Bhagavan enquired whether he had
eaten his dinner.

=E2=80=98Not yet Bha=
gavan.=E2=80=99

Bhagavan, compassion incarnate, was filled with concern an=
d said, =E2=80=98It is
already so late. Poor Lalitha will be waiting for yo=
u. Just think how late
it will be for her to go to bed after serving you di=
nner, eating herself and
then completing the domestic chores. From now on g=
o home first, have your
dinner and then come to the ashram.=E2=80=99

Thus =
ordered by Bhagavan, and also moved by his compassion, Iyer reached his
hou=
se and exclaimed to his wife, =E2=80=98How fortunate you are to be so graci=
ously
remembered by Bhagavan, despite remaining within the house. From now =
on I
will have my dinner straight away when I come home from the station. P=
lease
have it ready then.=E2=80=99

Sri Bhagavan had his head shaved once a=
 month on the full moon day. Natesan
was the barber who used to do this ser=
vice. Bhagavan sat on a stool and
Natesan would stand and shave him. Once S=
ri Bhagavan suggested to Natesan in
all seriousness that it would be more c=
omfortable for the barber to sit on
the stool while he himself would sit on=
 the floor!

It was past 8.30 one night when I came to the Ashram on one of=
 my visits.
Everyone had retired to rest after the night meal. I went to th=
e office.
Chinnaswamy was sitting in his place talking to some Ashramites. =
When he saw
me enter he said, =E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, don=E2=80=99t go near=
 Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s couch.He is
resting on the veranda near the well. H=
e had a fracture of his collar bone
and a plaster has been put on it. He sh=
ould not be disturbed. Prostrate at a
distance and come away noiselessly.=
=E2=80=9D I was shocked to hear the news. If any
other reason had been give=
n it could have restrained me, but the mention of
a =E2=80=98fracture=E2=80=
=99 made me eager and anxious to see Sri Bhagavan.
I went on tiptoe and pro=
strated quietly. He evidently saw me and said,
=E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, come=
, sit by my side on the couch.Only then can I see you
and talk. Otherwise t=
he bandage they have put might be disturbed and there
might be pain.=E2=80=
=9D Implicitly I obeyed when he said this, notwithstanding my
fear of Chinn=
aswamy=E2=80=99s reaction if he should happen to see me there. He said,
=E2=
=80=9CI was going up the steps. A dog was chasing a squirrel. I barred its =
way by
putting my walking stick in front of it. The stick slipped and I fel=
l down
and got hurt on the collar bone. They say it is a fracture and the n=
ative
bone-setter of the village, an old devotee, was sent for. He has put =
this
bandage with some green leaves and black gram paste and I am enjoined =
not to
move lest it be disturbed.=E2=80=9D

He narrated the incident as tho=
ugh it was someone else=E2=80=99s body that was
injured and was suffering!
=

As Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana approached, Narayana Iyer never moved aw=
ay from
the vicinity of Bhagavan. He was a witness to all that went on duri=
ng those
precious last days. At that time Bhagavan=E2=80=99s water pot [kam=
andalu] and
walking stick were in his room as he could not use them anymore=
. Iyer sensed
that several people had secret designs on them, wanting to ta=
ke them away
and preserve them as private, sacred relics. After the mahasam=
adhi of
Bhagavan, abhishekam, alankaram and arathi were performed and the h=
oly body
was taken in procession in a small ratha around the Mother=E2=80=
=99s Temple. Iyer
took this opportune moment, picked up the walking stick a=
nd kamandalu, and
slowly walked ahead of the ratha up to the samadhi chambe=
r where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
body would be enshrined. A small hand spun cloth=
 bag encasing Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
earthly frame was filled with vibhuti and =
camphor according to scriptural
procedure. It was then reverently lowered i=
nto the samadhi chamber. Iyer
himself descended into the chamber and placed=
 Bhagavan=E2=80=99s walking stick and
kamandalu on either side of the body.=
 The samadhi pit was then slowly filled
in. Anyone who nurtured hopes of ac=
quiring Bhagavan=E2=80=99s meagre possessions as
relics was disappointed.

=
In the aftermath of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana Iyer did not give up his=
 earlier
routine of having Bhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan daily. He had darshan=
 of Bhagavan at
the samadhi shrine and continued to visit the old hall. The=
 Iyers stayed on
in Tiruvannamalai, as did Chadwick who, for a time, took u=
p residence in the
Iyer compound in a small thatched-roof cottage until he =
was invited by the
ashram management to move back there again. Iyer and Cha=
dwick were spiritual
companions, their uniting bond being the love and devo=
tion they both had for
Bhagavan.

Later, when all their children had settle=
d in Madras, the Iyers, who were
beginning to feel their age, also moved th=
ere to be near their children and
grandchildren.

Narayana Iyer and his wif=
e were grihasta asrama [householders] and followed
that dharma meticulously=
. Yet mentally both had donned ochre robes. Their
lives, the way they lived=
, was a penance [tapas] that required no other
spiritual practice. Wherever=
 Iyer went, his continued recitation of Ulladu
Narpadu made the air around =
him vibrant with the holy presence of Bhagavan,
compelling an inner respons=
e from all.

no let up in his regular visits.<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=C2=A0Neve=
r a Sunday passed without Narayana Iyer arriving at the ashram. He always h=
ad some delectable snacks with him which were prepared by his wife Lalitha =
Iyer, who believed that she was cooking delicacies for God.</span>=C2=A0The=
se were savoured by everyone as Bhagavan would never accept anything unless=
 there was enough for all. Very often Iyer would bring omappodi, [a snack m=
ade of gram flour and spices] which Bhagavan appears to have been quite fon=
d of, and occasionally he would bring other items in quantities that would =
suffice for all in the hall.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Once=
 when Shantammal enquired of Bhagavan whether she could prepare some snacks=
 in the ashram, Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=98Tomorrow is Sunday. Narayana Iye=
r will be arriving and will surely be bringing something to eat.=E2=80=99<b=
r>

<br>Such was the certainty of his arrival and of the snacks that came w=
ith him.</span><br><br>In those days [the early thirties] the area surround=
ing the ashram was very bare, with no trees or shrubs. The Mother=E2=80=99s=
 Temple was yet to be constructed. Anyone approaching the precincts of the =
ashram could be easily seen from the old hall. Once, between two successive=
 weekend visits by Narayana Iyer, the ashram administration, feeling that B=
hagavan needed some rest in the afternoon after lunch, imposed a restrictio=
n that no one would be allowed to disturb him between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Ne=
ither Bhagavan nor Narayana Iyer was aware of this new decree. The followin=
g Sunday afternoon, as usual, Iyer arrived with omappodi in hand. As he app=
roached the hall those strategically positioned to deflect the would-be vis=
itors until 2 pm, the new receiving hour, apprised him of the rule. Iyer, t=
hough still at a great distance from Bhagavan, made his customary prostrati=
on from where he was, retraced his steps and waited until the appointed hou=
r.<br>

<br>At 2 p.m. he came before Bhagavan. Bhagavan had spied him on hi=
s arrival and noted his subsequent disappearance.<br><br>As soon as he ente=
red the hall Bhagavan asked him, =E2=80=98Didn=E2=80=99t you come at 1 o=E2=
=80=99clock? I saw you arriving through the window and was expecting you to=
 come to the hall at any moment. But you didn=E2=80=99t come. Did you have =
to go elsewhere?=E2=80=99<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Naraya=
na Iyer, who had no idea that Bhagavan was not supposed to know of the new =
arrangement, replied in all innocence, =E2=80=98My train arrived late and I=
 could come only at 1 o=E2=80=99clock. I was informed that Bhagavan nowaday=
s rests in the afternoons and is not to be disturbed until 2 p.m. That=E2=
=80=99s why I have only come in now.=E2=80=99<br>

<br>Bhagavan listened wi=
thout any comment, other than his customary, =E2=80=98Oh! Is that so?=E2=80=
=99</span><br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">The next day after lunch=
, instead of going into the hall, Bhagavan sat outside the hall. The attend=
ant very hesitantly suggested that he go inside, as it was becoming very ho=
t.</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan said, =E2=80=
=98Nobody is allowed to enter until 2 p.m. Is there also a rule that I shou=
ld not sit here until two?=E2=80=99<br><br>Then Bhagavan, the very embodime=
nt of compassion added, =E2=80=98People come from far-away places by variou=
s means, suffering innumerable hardships in order to get here. How can they=
 be sure of the exact time of their arrival? When they come after all that =
trouble, how fair is it to deny them ready access?=E2=80=99<br>

<br>Hearin=
g this, the management immediately revoked the new rule.</span><br><br>In d=
ue course, owing to the profound grace of Bhagavan, Narayana Iyer was poste=
d to Tiruvannamalai itself. He was the first in a long line of devotees to =
have had the rare privilege of establishing a residence near the ashram in =
order to be in the holy presence of Bhagavan on a regular basis. His entire=
 sadhana comprised of simply remaining with Bhagavan whenever possible, in =
the hall or in the kitchen, cutting vegetables, grinding chutney and prepar=
ing breakfast in the wee hours of the morning. On any given morning the tri=
o of G. V. Subbaramayya, Kalyana Sundaram Iyer of the bookstall and Narayan=
a Iyer, would be found with Bhagavan.<br>

<br>One year, due to an unusual =
spell of drought, the ashram faced severe water scarcity on the eve of Jaya=
nthi. The devotees, organising themselves into a long chain, passed vessels=
 filled with water from hand to hand from the Agasthya Teertham in Palakoth=
u to the kitchen. Narayana Iyer very enthusiastically participated in this =
collective endeavour.<br>

<br>An extensive area of twenty grounds [one acr=
e] was the site of Narayana Iyer=E2=80=99s residence where he grew a variet=
y of fruit trees and fodder for his cow. Whatever wild creatures found in t=
hat area were left to themselves. Occasionally, he had snakes caught and re=
leased in isolated spots on the mountain.<br>

<br>Prior to constructing th=
e house, Iyer took the plans to Bhagavan to have them blessed. After carefu=
l perusal Bhagavan observed, =E2=80=98The plan is all right, but where is t=
he well?=E2=80=99<br><br>Though Iyer had a location in mind, it was not mar=
ked on the blueprint. This turned out to be a benediction as Bhagavan selec=
ted the site and marked the exact location. Later, one could see what a ble=
ssing it was; not only was the water as sweet as tender coconut water, but =
the well never ran dry and was thus a source of succour for the entire neig=
hbourhood in times of severe drought.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:b=
old">His wife was a truly sattvic woman, given to dharmic ways and scrupulo=
usly adhering to the sastraic injunctions pertaining to a housewife. She sh=
ared her husband=E2=80=99s ways and views completely. Though born in a rich=
 family, she had no pretensions or airs about her. Simple, carefree and una=
ttached, she ran the household with a contented mind and to the satisfactio=
n of the entire family, making optimum use of the resources available to he=
r. The children, like the mother, were an uncomplaining lot and were conten=
t in doing what they were told to do by their father.</span><br>

<br>Iyer=
=E2=80=99s one passion was to chant Ulladu Narpadu unceasingly. Neither con=
ventional vedic duties nor extravagant ritualistic observances had any attr=
action for him. The constant chanting of Ulladu Narpadu was all the religio=
us observance known to him. It would start right from the morning.<br>

<br=
><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Dyed in brahminical custom, Narayana Iyer=
 looked forward to his invigorating cup of morning coffee. The person who m=
ilked the cow used to turn up at 5.00 a.m., announcing his arrival by ringi=
ng his bicycle bell. Iyer, who would invariably be chanting Ulladu Narpadu =
loudly, would open the gate for him. The day would, therefore, begin with U=
lladu Narpadu, a routine so predictable and punctual, the neighbour opposit=
e him, an Andhra lady, remarked that she could safely set her clock by his =
recitation in the morning. His chanting continued throughout the day while =
he watered the plants or gave the cow a bath.</span><br>

<br>If ever he we=
re to hear a voice raised in argument among the children, he would simply r=
aise his voice and chant even louder. It was a wonder to see the children i=
mmediately quietened, as if the mesmerising spell of this powerful mantra m=
ade them aware of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s very presence.<br>

<br>Kanakammal sta=
yed in Iyer=E2=80=99s compound, occupying a small cottage for nearly ten ye=
ars. He looked upon me as his own daughter. He always made himself aware of=
 my requirements when he procured groceries for his own household and would=
 always meet my needs.<br>

<br>Narayana Iyer and Venkataratnam used to nar=
rate to Kanakammal whatever transpired in the hall during the nights and on=
 days when Kanakammal was unable to attend.=C2=A0<br><br><span style=3D"fon=
t-weight:bold">Subsequently Iyer was posted to Polur, but he did not move h=
is residence from Tiruvannamalai. Instead, he cycled to the station, left h=
is cycle there, took the train to Polur and again cycled to his office from=
 there. His return in the evening was by the same route, but like an arrow =
he would speed his way directly to the ashram in order to be with Bhagavan.=
 He was like a calf rushing to its mother. By then it would usually be 9:00=
 p.m.<br>

<br>One evening, as Iyer came from the station, Bhagavan enquire=
d whether he had eaten his dinner.<br><br>=E2=80=98Not yet Bhagavan.=E2=80=
=99<br><br>Bhagavan, compassion incarnate, was filled with concern and said=
, =E2=80=98It is already so late. Poor Lalitha will be waiting for you. Jus=
t think how late it will be for her to go to bed after serving you dinner, =
eating herself and then completing the domestic chores. From now on go home=
 first, have your dinner and then come to the ashram.=E2=80=99</span><br>

=
<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Thus ordered by Bhagavan, and also mo=
ved by his compassion, Iyer reached his house and exclaimed to his wife, =
=E2=80=98How fortunate you are to be so graciously remembered by Bhagavan, =
despite remaining within the house. From now on I will have my dinner strai=
ght away when I come home from the station. Please have it ready then.=E2=
=80=99</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Sri Bhagavan had hi=
s head shaved once a month on the full moon day. Natesan was the barber who=
 used to do this service. Bhagavan sat on a stool and Natesan would stand a=
nd shave him. Once Sri Bhagavan suggested to Natesan in all seriousness tha=
t it would be more comfortable for the barber to sit on the stool while he =
himself would sit on the floor!</span><br>

<br>It was past 8.30 one night =
when I came to the Ashram on one of my visits. Everyone had retired to rest=
 after the night meal. I went to the office. Chinnaswamy was sitting in his=
 place talking to some Ashramites. When he saw me enter he said, =E2=80=9CN=
arayana Iyer, don=E2=80=99t go near Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s couch.He is rest=
ing on the veranda near the well. He had a fracture of his collar bone and =
a plaster has been put on it. He should not be disturbed. Prostrate at a di=
stance and come away noiselessly.=E2=80=9D I was shocked to hear the news. =
If any other reason had been given it could have restrained me, but the men=
tion of a =E2=80=98fracture=E2=80=99 made me eager and anxious to see Sri B=
hagavan.<br>

I went on tiptoe and prostrated quietly. He evidently saw me =
and said, =E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, come, sit by my side on the couch.Only th=
en can I see you and talk. Otherwise the bandage they have put might be dis=
turbed and there might be pain.=E2=80=9D Implicitly I obeyed when he said t=
his, notwithstanding my fear of Chinnaswamy=E2=80=99s reaction if he should=
 happen to see me there. He said, =E2=80=9CI was going up the steps. A dog =
was chasing a squirrel. I barred its way by putting my walking stick in fro=
nt of it. The stick slipped and I fell down and got hurt on the collar bone=
. They say it is a fracture and the native bone-setter of the village, an o=
ld devotee, was sent for. He has put this bandage with some green leaves an=
d black gram paste and I am enjoined not to move lest it be disturbed.=E2=
=80=9D<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">He narrated the incident a=
s though it was someone else=E2=80=99s body that was injured and was suffer=
ing!</span><br><br>As Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana approached, Narayana I=
yer never moved away from the vicinity of Bhagavan. He was a witness to all=
 that went on during those precious last days. At that time Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s water pot [kamandalu] and walking stick were in his room as he could n=
ot use them anymore. Iyer sensed that several people had secret designs on =
them, wanting to take them away and preserve them as private, sacred relics=
. After the mahasamadhi of Bhagavan, abhishekam, alankaram and arathi were =
performed and the holy body was taken in procession in a small ratha around=
 the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple. Iyer took this opportune moment, picked up th=
e walking stick and kamandalu, and slowly walked ahead of the ratha up to t=
he samadhi chamber where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body would be enshrined. A smal=
l hand spun cloth bag encasing Bhagavan=E2=80=99s earthly frame was filled =
with vibhuti and camphor according to scriptural procedure. It was then rev=
erently lowered into the samadhi chamber. Iyer himself descended into the c=
hamber and placed Bhagavan=E2=80=99s walking stick and kamandalu on either =
side of the body. The samadhi pit was then slowly filled in. Anyone who nur=
tured hopes of acquiring Bhagavan=E2=80=99s meagre possessions as relics wa=
s disappointed.<br>

<br>In the aftermath of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana=
 Iyer did not give up his earlier routine of having Bhagavan=E2=80=99s dars=
han daily. He had darshan of Bhagavan at the samadhi shrine and continued t=
o visit the old hall. The Iyers stayed on in Tiruvannamalai, as did Chadwic=
k who, for a time, took up residence in the Iyer compound in a small thatch=
ed-roof cottage until he was invited by the ashram management to move back =
there again. Iyer and Chadwick were spiritual companions, their uniting bon=
d being the love and devotion they both had for Bhagavan.<br>

<br>Later, w=

 to feel their age, also moved there to be near their children and grandchi=
