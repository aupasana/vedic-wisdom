Hello! Good Afternoon ,
=C2=A0
If i can add something.....as per the sanskr=
it gramar, whenever anusvara is succeeded by consonants, it remains as it i=
s and is pronounced as "An"...Example- "An" in "Anshumaan(name of Sun)" and=
 "An" in Sanskruta(language sanskrit)", "An" in "Anga(limbs), "An" in Ahamk=
aara"(ego). But when anusvara is succeeded by vowels or the word ending wit=
h anusvara happens to be the last word of the sentence then it is pronounce=
d as "Am"...Example- "Am" in Digambara(sect of Jaina). Another example migh=
t make it more clear...take the example of=C2=A0 "KIM" the neuter sanskrit =
word for "what". When i say the sentence "Kim Kaaranam"(english meaning- fo=
r what reason/purpose?).....since in the sentence the anusvara of the word"=
KIM" is followed by the consonant =C2=A0letter "Ka" of "Kaaranam" the anusv=
ara here will be pronounced as "An" and the word"KIM" will properly sound=
=C2=A0as the english word "KING". And when i say the=C2=A0sentence "Kim Udd=
eshyam"(english meaning- for what
 reason/purpose?)....since in the sentenc=
e the anusvara of the word "KIM" is followed by vowel "UU"=C2=A0 of=C2=A0"U=
ddeshyam", the anusvara here will be pronounced as "Am" and the word "KIM" =
will properly sound as the name of a girl "KIM". Note also that=C2=A0 in bo=
th the sentences since the sentence ends with the anusvara, hence the anusv=
ara will be pronounced as "Am" in "KIM"(name of a girl) and not as the engl=
ish word "KING", hence, the words shall be pronounced as "kaaranam" and "Uu=
ddeshyam" and not as "kaarang" and "uuddeshyang".
=C2=A0
So in the instant =
case since anusvara of "trayambakam" is followed by consonant "Ya" of "Yaja=
amahe", hence the anusvara shall be pronounced as "trayambakang" and not as=
 "trayambakam". Moreover as per the Sanskrit grammar there can never be san=
dhi between trayambakam and yajaamahe.
=C2=A0
I hope this clarifies your do=
ubt
=C2=A0
Regards

namaste,

Some scholars pronounce the anusvAra =
which precedes the ya-kAra as a
nAsalized ya-kAra. i.e. tryambaka{y} yajAma=
he. I suspect that this is
what the scholars were trying to say, but someth=
ing got lost in
translation.

bhavadiiyaH,

ajit
