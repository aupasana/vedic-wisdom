Biswajit,

I have added homam_precedure_shortmedium.pdf to the files sectio=
n.

I started homam in 2008 Jan. But, felt medium to be little longer that =
I could spare. Short was too short with out any mantras. I took medium and =
removed parts, took a printed out. I had originally taken Ganapathi homam m=
anual and later Narasimha pointed out the changes I have to do for other Go=
ds/Goddes. This file has Ganapathi/Narasimha/Lakshmi/Sadashiva/Sani.

Feel =
free to use it if you want. If you want to use it for another God/Goddess, =
you may have to make minor changes.

AHSzzLE68Qg/homam_procedure_shortmedium.pdf

I agree with Utpal. Remove the=
 feeling of "okay, this is too short" if you can. Use my file if it makes y=
ou feel good.

Best regards,
Vijay

 Currently the short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, yes I know th=
ere is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-verse a=
nd sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum.

ld you please suggest/mark the various steps with important Mantras on prio=
rity basis on the short-procedure of the Ganapati Homam, so that one could =
trim down the homam process in the case of time constraint but mind should =
be satisfy enough for the purpose...
