<p>Namaste Ashutosh and Rajarshi,<br><br>There are several technicalitie=
s like this, which apply when one does a ritual to ensure a specific materi=
al result. Some of them are meaningful to an extent and some of them are si=
mply made up over the last few millennia by intellectuals.<br>

<br>However=
, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the pleasure of a deity, one =
can and should ignore these technicalities.<br><br>There are some tradition=
al brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam everyday as a sadhana for=
 many generations and they do not look at these technicalities.<br>

<br>* =
* *<br><br>If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens (=
aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on earth. Y=
ou cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow of signa=
ls in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all times. Ev=
en during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainly
 capab=
le of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and making the=
m reach various deities.<br><br>* * *<br><br>If you want to get your father=
 (or mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you=
 may want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is=
 not tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of co=
urse, even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and =
your father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such=
 agendas and only want to tell your father "I love you" and take =
whatever he gives, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child=
 will be favored by parents over the long run and will get whatever the par=
ents have to give.<br>

<br>Similarly, if you want to get a specific materi=
al result, there are several technicalities to bother about. Even when you =
bother about them, you may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and
=
 then, there are many corruptions in our understanding of the technicalitie=
s and the art of getting specific material results through rituals is nearl=
y extinct. The best approach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or me=
ditation to express your love and surrender and take whatever you are given=
 in return as a prasad. Such a person will be favored by deities over the l=
ong run.<br>

<br>* * *<br><br>Namaste Ramakishore,<br><br>Different points=
 of space and different points of time have a different quality to them. Sa=
dhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girnar hills or Arunachala hi=
lls. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as sadhana on Pournima.<br>

<=
br>If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g. a monthly Satya Na=
rayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Krishna homam), it is n=
ot a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned with the energy of that de=
ity.<br>

<br>However, one can only make so much progress with occasional
 =
sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, more intense sad=
hana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/deity, one can=
 do it every day and at all times.<br><br>* * *<br><br>A lot of beggars may=
 be standing at the gate of a king's palace, waiting for the king to se=
e them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king=
 may be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every s=
o and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his ga=
te on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many=
 beggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the=
 other hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king's eyes may =
fall on you someday!<br>

<br>Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to t=
he deity, keep doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for th=
e deity's grace. That is a sureshot formula for success.<br><br>* *
 *<=
br><br>The issue of auspicious days and times is a double edged sword. Whil=
e a particular day may be more auspicious than other days, it may or may no=
t mean much to one. For example, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to=
 bat on, you cannot expect to go there and score a century. International c=
ricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there t=
han at other places, but you may still get out cheaply.<br>

<br>Instead of=
 helping, sadhana done on a particularly good day can sometimes bog one dow=
n with false pride and expectancy. I remember one incident.<br><br>A few ye=
ars ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted to spend the coming Satur=
day meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whole day. I got that intent=
ion from nowhere and did not look at anything like tithi, my horoscope etc.=
 I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Manish and he said, "=
excellent, go ahead". I meditated with Gayatri mantra from 5 am till
 =
9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks and having a fistf=
ul of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. When I finished in =
the night, I was in a nice state.<br><br>Next morning, I realized that the =
previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga=
 and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said that spiritual s=
adhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a normal =
day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to be an auspic=
ious day.<br>

<br>I mentioned it to Manish. He said, "I knew it was A=
kshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me". I asked h=
im why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, "knowing y=
ou were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and wou=
ld have instead distracted you."<br>

<br>He was right. As such, I was=
 a little "proud" of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japa=
m. There was a bit of
 excitement and expectancy that was present as an und=
ercurrent and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that =
I was doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more eff=
ective, that undercurrent of useless excitement would've been higher an=
d distracted me even more!<br>

<br>Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exi=
st. But what really matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a s=
adhana on an auspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distra=
ct one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to suc=
ceed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy. My 2 cents..<=
