Nagaraj Garu,

>why should the priest who slapped him die, because in my op=
inion, >anyone else would have done the same 

I thought exactly the same w=
ay when I recently read the book. If i would have been there, i would have =
done probably the same thing unless i knew Trailanga swami very well. 
But =
the matter is clarified in Aghora Part-2.
If i remember correctly, In Aghor=
a Part-2, Vimalananda has clarified the seemingly extreme behavior of Trail=
anga Swami. I don't remember the chapter now but it was said that Trailanga=
 swami, being a very advance Saadhaka exactly knew how to convert faces and=
 urine in to Nectar or some divine substance or else how he could have dare=
d to commit such act.

***
> 2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda=C2 equat=
es changing the=C2 >loyalty from diety to diety=C2 as akin to prostitution,=
 which I find >as an extreme view!

Beautiful...i find vimalananda's extrem=
e views, very appealing and full of wisdom. The underlying advise in those =
external rough words is same as Thakur Ramakrishna used to say "Dig at one =
place rather than digging at many places...". It does not require to disres=
pect or disbelive other deities or faith.

Jusr my 2 cents...

Regards,

Ut=
pal
