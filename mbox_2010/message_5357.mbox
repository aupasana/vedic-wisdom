Respected members,

Thanks for responding to my posts and thanks for having=
 a healthy discussion so far.

Please let me do an effort to simplify the d=
iscussion and remove some confusion from the discussion. Please point out m=
y mistakes I will make in this process.

We are trying to discuss three poi=
nts here

1) Choosing a dietary habit
2) Dependence of Human population on =
Non-veg sources of nutrition
3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg foo=
d.

I commented on two points 

1) Choosing a dietary habit 
2) Dependence =
of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition

1) Choosing a Dietary =
habit

One should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and=
 attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or other =
factor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his tra=
ining. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian=
 food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I a=
gree with Narasimha Ji about this point.

In some diseases Non veg sources =
play an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin de=
ficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Al=
bumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also r=
ecommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.

2) Dependence of Human populatio=
n on non veg sources of nutrition

I agree with the link provided in this d=
iscussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for =
switching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book referen=
ce which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every infor=
mation on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrolo=
gy. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.

By 'Pra=
ctically impossible' I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In I=
ndia (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people a=
re Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg =
sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including=
 gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (includ=
e almonds cashew etc - Costs needn't mention), Dairy products (Milk being 3=
0-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), =


In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by 4=
0-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete =
balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70=
 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along =
with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differen=
t sources may quote different quantities). There is average family size of =
5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the onl=
y thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there

Even at =
current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additional =
40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% and I=
 need not to explain what will happen at that time.

Sir, I am not advocati=
ng Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I prefer=
 a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no crueli=
ty even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yourself)
=

Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift all =
the population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is decre=
asing day by day because of many reasons)

3) Bioavailability or BV of diff=
erent sources

It is always a questionable point. because again sections su=
pporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which support veg food =
and vice versa. There are lot of  halfbaked researches. but if we think sci=
entifically we will find that for different sources different sources are b=
etter. For example calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for al=
bumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sour=
ces are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we can not say that on=
ly veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive o=
n Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values give=
n by Rajarshi ji.

Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But s=
o does the deep fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it =
will not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more =
energy is used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is=
 a scietific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed to =
intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is in=
creasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what on=
e want to become.

But still at last, I want to mention that I am not advoc=
ating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetar=
ian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realise th=
at it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.

Please point ou=
t my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned=
 here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and=
 not too much off the line.

Kind Regards
Atul
