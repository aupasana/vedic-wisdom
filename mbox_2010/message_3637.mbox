I reproduce Opinion of Great Vimalananda on 'Meat eaters' and
repercussion=
s from 'Aghora, from the left hand of God'

Choice is ours !

"Ma wants you=
 to learn your lesson. That is why you find a meat-eater
reborn either as a=
 predator or prey or as both in succession. Human
beings cry a lot at funer=
als of their own kind but they have absolutely
no thought for the suffering=
s of the animals they slaughter. They never
hesitate to kill and eat. Just =
think, first they kill the chicken. Often
they will cut its throat and let =
it bleed to death, which is a most
painful way to die. Then it will be clea=
ned, cooked and eaten, and if it
happens to be tough everyone will curse it=
 for not satisfying their
palates. How many humans would give beautiful ten=
der lean meat if they
were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?

Meat=
-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love their
children. Do=
 they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her
chicks are slain =
in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of
motherliness, do they con=
sider how much she suffers when she sees the
slaughter of her beloved calf =
whom she has grown in her own body and
nourished with her milk, whom she lo=
ves more than her own life?
Do these so called humans ever think of the ter=
rible pain they cause to
mother cow? Could they endure their own children b=
eing murdered before
their own eyes?

How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They=
 are not humans, whose intellect is
subtle enough to self-identify with ano=
ther being of a different species
and experience its personal joys and sorr=
ows. Ma has no alternative but
to make them suffer, allowing the animals th=
ey have tortured to torture
them in return. Fair's fair, after all. If I cu=
t your throat in this
birth you have every right to cut mine in the next or=
 some succeeding
birth. Experience is the best teacher and a fool will lear=
n from no
other."

Best Regards,

Utpal
