namaste,

Mothers in the world - nAri are the greatest linguists and sarvas=
va for every child. They are the greatest linguists and teach and communica=
te with us in the language of the universe since inception in an unparellel=
able ways. It is with her concurrence that her infant is named after birth.=
 And she already knows her child by more than a thousand names. Based upon =
the star positions or choice of the parents - mAta and pitA in that order a=
nd helped by vedanga jyotiShya
if parents so desire. 

One of the fascinati=
ng names of the Hindu universe is Narasimha.

nRu is is the dhAtu - How doe=
s it become nara? and how does the generic female and mother become nAri. T=
his happens in a very logical way and according to unchangeable rules of gr=
ammar. the dhAtu (unfortunately called root by western grmmarians - It ough=
t to be called element - nothing grows up from the root as any person with =
elementry knowledge of biology - roots and shoots are part of a living thin=
g that grows up from seeds) 

Why these rules are important - grammar is a =
boring subject - And if I were not bribed by my mother I would have run awa=
y from school at first opportunity. It is trust in her and not the teacher =
that kept me in school.

The most important reason for grammar is "communic=
ations". We are fortunate to live in the era of man-machine communications =
- first time in the known history of Mankind can man talk to and be underst=
ood by a machine. Our lives more or less are interlinked with machines in a=
lmost every aspect of life in a matter of just 20 - 30 years. And greater t=
hings are yet to come.

yantra - the closest Sanskrit word for machine - ha=
s ultimately the dhAtu "yam" - "yantru" ultimately meaning "restraint ""dea=
th" and "dharma" (yama dharma rAju) Why should a machine have these as the =
dhAtu? Most amazing and simple logic - the dhAtu of all machines is "restra=
int" and "caution" and "dharma" - This dhAtu manifests itself because that =
is th guNA and inescapable fact - satyaM in the universe - For humans - the=
 wheels and high powered engines and wings are as important as keeping cons=
tantly in mind the "yama dharma" in the machines that is bound to manifest =
inevitably - So, how to stop a machine is as important as how to build and =
keep a machine running... how to plan for parking space and prevent polluti=
on is as important as mass produce cars - And as recent experience - how to=
 stop the rocket from  exploding is as important is sending it up with chee=
rs.

lakShmi - the godess of weatlth and prosperity. The first part is [lak=
Sh] meaning objective . In this one word is the truth of finance and human =
endeavour. And the entire science of management.

Objective - first; Strate=
gy to achieve the objective, Tactics to implement the strategy- Operations =
to undertake activities according to some operational plan. Each of these l=
ayers have objectives or [lakShya]

In short without [lakShya] lakShmi may =
bid you good bye. Related also is taking your own inventory and not others.=
 Successful busines take their own inventory very well and get rid of junk =
as soon as possible.

One of the fascinating things about Narasimha avatAram=
 is fury of the avAtaram even after death of the dAnava for some thousands =
of years. I see this anamoly as probably reference to a geological upheaval=
 - that actually happened in the paurANika times. Our planet earth is a bil=
