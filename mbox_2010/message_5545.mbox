namaste,

True life facts,

1. In or around 1955 A jagadgur ShankarAcArya i=
s guest at my father's elder brother's house in Marredpally. I can remember=
 he drove up in a huge car that had no number plate but a big "sha~gku" - W=
e kids were supposed to take off our shits - and receive his blessings. The=
re were two queues - one for girls most of them wearing bright new silk "pa=
TTu" dresses. One of the sha~gkarAcarya's goons come up and asked  one litt=
le Punjabi girl  that was our neighbour age about about 10 or 11 that was w=
earing shalwar kameez to go out of the line. And the poor girl was in tears=
. I asked my elder brother (cousin) what was happening - he said - "I think=
 he thinks she is Muslim or God knows what" I slipped way from the line unn=
oticed and went over to a Billiard Saloon.

2. A couple of years later I ma=
de peace with Adi sha~gkarAcArya on a trip to Kedarnath with my Gujarati cl=
ass mate from a business family and My father - The three of us walked abou=
t 45 miles up and down stopiing at different "chaTTis" and cooking our own.=
 On reaching kedarnath, I told him about the incident of the punjabi dress.=
 He in his typical tone said - "dandho ni bAt ce .. we have come so far ...=
. anybody that has re built a shiva temple and that too bearing your name c=
annot be all that bad" We both had a laugh. My father asked us whether we w=
anted to have a dip in the river in biting cold... "both of us had one voic=
e ... are you joking"

3, Years later a "shankarAcarya" gets arrested and c=
harged with murder. My heart goes out to him The most surprising thing neit=
her his followers nor the brave community whimper. 

4. 2 of my labour boys=
 18 and 19 were from Nalgonda - They were working on daily wages doing hard=
 work. They told me they were H.Sc. passed - I said "ruZu - proof" In a mat=
ter of a week they brought their certificates  - Both of them had marks tha=
t I never even imagined was possible. Immediately - we started working on "=
demarcations", "contour survey" and plants inventory of our place - and all=
 mapped on graph paper note books. and graph sheets. How do you draw a perf=
ect square on the ground? Simple you might think all sides must be equal. T=
ry it for a 10,000 sq yard area. This is where my young friends were taught=
 the vedic wisdom that the sides don't matter at all. It is the diagnols th=
at are important and that can be obtained by formula - discovere centuries =
befor in India what we are dished out in schools.

Next on their own money =
- I dont believe in donations of any sort. They were told , I was dismissin=
g them - Unless they went after work to a nearby computer training class an=
d put all our data in spreadsheets Excel - and email it to me in one month =
they can continue to lift stones elsewhere. They did all sorts of "nAtak" i=
n their typical teenage way - They took 2- 1/2 months shedding crocodile te=
ars sometimes. Next, I dismissed them - I had been pestering an IAS officer=
 that I want an evaluation of these two boys. I was asked whether  they wer=
e my relatives... I didn't answer.. They had an appointment fixed and the o=
fficer said (1) First time warning (2) Next time suspension (3) Next time j=
ail - understood. They nodded their heads. I have not seen these boys again=
 although they try to meet me sometime. 

So, lengths and breadths and dept=
hs - you better save for people that are absolute unhygienic morons getting=
 wounds and infections and worms when right next door is a primary health c=
entre.

4. One of my favourite movies is Rambo - I will not pollute a Vaidi=
ka Wisdom group with the true story of how the Adi sha~gkara is supposed to=
 have obtain in depth knowledge of the kAma shAstra.
