Namaste Krishna Kanth,

Here is copy of an email that I had received separa=
tely that concerns with the 
day you (and other people) may regard as the b=
irthday of Lord Siva. As you read 
this, you will be clear on the true sign=
ificance of the day and why this is not 
really the birthday of Lord Siva b=
ut could be mistaken by people to be so.

Here it is...

Thiruvaadhirai is =
one of the famous vradhas celebrated. This is the 
thiruvaadhirai nakshatht=
hram in the month of Maarkazi (Maargasira). 
Thiruvaadhirai is considered a=
s the nakshaththram of Lord n^ataraja. Though the 
Lord never takes birth a=
nd hence no nakshaththram to celebrate, on 
Thiruvaadhirai He appeared to t=
he holy saints pathanychali and vyaagra paadha.
Once when Mahaa Vishnu was =
lying down on the great serpent Adhi seesha, Adhi 
seesha felt Mahaa Vishnu=
 was quite heavy that time. He asked Mahaa Vishnu what 
was the reason. Mah=
aa Vishnu said that he was remembering and enjoying the Dance 
of Lord Shiv=
a. The answer developed the desire in Adhi seesha to see the Great 
Dance o=
f Lord Shiva. He asked Mahaa Vishnu how his desire could be fulfilled. 
Mah=
aa Vishnu asked him to go to Chithamparam and do "tapas". Adhi seesha came =
to 
Chithamparam and prayed the Lord for a long time.
There was another mun=
i and devotee of Lord Shiva in that place, called viyaagra 
paadha. He pray=
ed to God to get the legs of tiger, so that he can pluck flowers 
early in =
the morning to offer to the God, before any bee touches the flower. He 
was=
 also praying God to see His Great Dance for a long time.
Pleased with thei=
r prayer the God appeared on the Thiruvaadhirai day and danced 
in Chithamp=
aram. The Nataraaja image of the Lord is prayed with great devotion 
this d=
ay. In Chithamparam and other temples it is celebrated as Arudraa 
dharshan=
am. In this festival abhisheeka (holy anointing) of Lord Nataraaja takes 
p=
lace early in the morning and then He comes around the town. A sweet 
calle=
d=C2=A0kaLi=C2=A0and multi vegetable=C2=A0thALakam=C2=A0are offered and eat=
en to celebrate this 
great joy of seeing the dance of the Lord
.
When obse=
rved
ska.ndha purANam describes about this vratam. When the sun shines in t=
he dhanur 
rAsi that is in the month of mArkazi, in the day of thiruvAdhira=
i for which 
rudra is the devata this vratam is observed.
Way of observing
=
In the morning of thiruvAdhirai one gets up early in the morning and salute=
s the 
Dancing Lord. After bathing goes to the abode of Lord shiva and ther=
e worshiping 
the Lord by abhishekam and offerings, lights up the ghee lamp=
s to illuminate the 
abode. Fasting for the whole day, the next day salutin=
g the Three-eyed Lord 
serving food for the devotees one has the food.
Glor=
y
munychakEchar, vyAgrapAdhar and the serpant kArkOtakan observed this vrat=
am and 
saw the blissful dance of the Lord. Saint vyagra pAdhar got austero=
us upamanyu 
as his son. A brahman called vipular observing this vratam wen=
t to kailash with 
the body by a splendid divine carrier and returned back.=
 Later he got 
liberation. As the Lord is dancing blissfully and gracefully=
 on this day this 
vratam is considered quite auspicious to please the God.=
