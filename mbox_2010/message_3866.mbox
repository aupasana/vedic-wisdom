I am shocked as well with the news of the scandal. But please do not be has=
ty to judgement. The genuineness of the video has not been proven. In the p=
ast Kanchi Paramcharya was targetted the same way by christian missionary g=
roups because he was doing exemplary work in integrating many of the downtr=
odden sections . I distincly remember Narasimha ji's message of asking peop=
le to maintain restraint.

The video could very well be a doctored video wi=
th 64 bit processing and multicore processors it is not hard in 2010 to gen=
erate a doctored video and this has been done in the past by a group lead b=
y a missionary in tamilnadu called Lenis Karuppan. The Times of India artic=
le has more information.

Scandals have erupted in the past also for many n=
otable gurus.I do not wish to name them all since it serves no purpose exce=
pt to hurt the feelings of the followers who might have learnt some nice th=
ings from their teachings even though they themselves might not have follow=
ed it.

The messenger might be imperfect ..and by judging them we will incu=
rr the karma of the judgement as well.
