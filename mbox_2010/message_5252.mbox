Respected Bhupendra ji and Narasimha ji,

I am not able enough to say anyth=
ing and still an ignorant flick but I want to add my two cents with a hope =
that you will forgive me for my mistakes.

As you know that sadhna increase=
 flow of spiritual energy in our subtle body and for accomodating that incr=
eased intensity and flow of spiritual energy we need clean and open channel=
s. ( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if those channels are not=
 clean then that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences like increas=
ed anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.

Rishis have=
 clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and blessings =
they give are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord vishnu by =
sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav vansh and=
 king prikshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy except f=
ew times when he was markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where one of h=
is female disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front of h=
im to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that=
 his student did not learnt well what he taught to her. 

On other side peo=
ple with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be able to handle th=
at energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like ravana an=
d sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe that this is also=
 part of divine will. 

Please forgive me for my mistakes

Regards
Atul
