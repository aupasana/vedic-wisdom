Dear Shiva,
=C2=A0
Here is a quote from Sri Aurobindo's own writings on Sup=
ramental Descent mentioned in his book on Integral Yoga.
=C2=A0
"The change=
 of consciousness is a necessary thing and without it there could be no phy=
sical siddhi. But the fullness of the supramental change is not possible, i=
f the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain, uncons=
ciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to remain th=
e descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of consciou=
sness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the Overmi=
nd is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramental Desce=
nt is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital and body=
. This would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of the unconsci=
ousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disease. Tha=
t would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which death c=
omes. If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the will of th=
e inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical
 immortality. If someon=
e wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the complete si=
ddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the body w=
ithout supramentalization. "
=C2=A0
Again at another place Sri Aurobindo st=
ates that immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Descent, but one of the=
 possibilities.
=C2=A0
I did not quite understand, what exactly is this Sup=
ramental Descent, if it has nothing to do with physical immortality.Because=
, connecting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity a=
nd functioning from that sphere is something that most self realized Yogis =
do. Then how is "Supramental Descent" so unique?
=C2=A0
Again if, as we see=
 from the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken of=
f, that would mean also a transformation of the body. 
=C2=A0
Well, the Nat=
hs(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane. Is t=
hat what Supramental Descent is?
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

T=
here are some inaccuracies in the below description of Sri Aurobindo Ashram=
 by Shri. Balram Reddy. Moreover, his understanding of Sri Aurobindo's work=
 seems to be very superficial and mistaken. It is surprising to see that af=
ter being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo's teachings with physical=
 immortality.

It is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobin=
do and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy see=
ms to confuse his imaginations for facts.

There were several instances whe=
n Mother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying =
they are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yog=
a. I know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Maharis=
hi sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path o=
f Integral Yoga. 

It is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have sai=
d something specific to Balaram Reddy to help him come out of his guilt con=
sciousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his =
Guru. We need to take Balaram Reddy's recollections and opinions (especiall=

sdom@ yahoogroups. com</A>, Prasanth Jalasutram <jvrsprasanth@ ...> w=
rote:<BR>><BR>> In 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also =
hearing about him from<BR>> others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pond=
icherry. Immediately upon my<BR>> arrival I was struck by the spiritual =
atmosphere of the place. On August<BR>> 15th of that year, I had my firs=
t darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of<BR>> three times in a year t=
hat he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother<BR>> to be
 powerf=
ul spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability<BR>> to w=
ork on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible<BR>>=
 manner. All of Aurobindo's philosophical writings cannot convey his or the=
<BR>> Mother's power as spiritual embodiments.<BR>> <BR>> While I =
was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed<BR>> discip=
le of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then<BR>> visi=
ting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his<BR>>=
 ashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.<BR>&=
gt; Narasimhaswami' s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first =
visit<BR>> to Ramanasramam in 1933.<BR>> <BR>> Before this second =
visit to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan's<BR>> biography. In it=
 I found a passage relating to the possibility of changing<BR>> one's gu=
ru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it to the
 Maharshi. He<BR>> =
told me, "Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What of that?"<BR>> <=
BR>> In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulat=
ed and<BR>> controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into to=
wn we had to<BR>> obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam i=
t was totally<BR>> different. I experienced a liberating feeling of free=
dom, informality and<BR>> spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at =
the same time elevating.<BR>> <BR>> Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disci=
ples were generally permitted to visit all<BR>> other saints and ashrama=
s, with the exception of the Maharshi and Sri<BR>> Ramanasramam. It was =
believed that the Maharshi had the power to undo years<BR>> of spiritual=
 preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo were effecting on the<BR>> ps=
yche of their followers. In other words, they considered the Maharshi too<B=
R>> powerful an influence. Bhagavan was
 aware of this and once when I w=
as alone<BR>> with him he told me, "Yes, I know of that place. They are =
afraid of me."<BR>> <BR>> Leaving Aurobindo Ashram<BR>> <BR>> I=
 had been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years<=
BR>> they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the sp=
iritual<BR>> path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obta=
in their<BR>> permission and blessings before leaving. This turned out t=
o be much more<BR>> difficult than I imagined.<BR>> <BR>> In Aurob=
indo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or<BR>>=
 questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the<=
BR>> letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit =
with the<BR>> Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writi=
ng. Sometimes we<BR>> would see the lights burning all night as they wer=
e engaged in this work.<BR>>
 <BR>> Upon my return from Ramanasramam =
I wrote a letter stating my desire to<BR>> receive their blessings and p=
ermission to live at Ramanasramam. In the<BR>> letter to Aurobindo I wro=
te that since your yoga begins with<BR>> Self-realization, kindly permit=
 me to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes<BR>> only Self-realization, =
a state I have not attained, or may not even be<BR>> worthy of attaining=
. Aurobindo's reply was affectionate, but negative in<BR>> regards to my=
 leaving his ashram. He wrote, "Both Self-realization and the<BR>> supra=
-mental state can be simultaneously developed and achieved here. There<BR>&=
gt; is no need for you to go there."<BR>> <BR>> I was extremely disap=
pointed at his response and consequently became<BR>> frustrated, restles=
s and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights<BR>> and felt d=
istraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same<BR>> =
request. Again I was
 denied permission. It took a long five months and a<B=
R>> third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving =
me their<BR>> permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was dete=
rmined to go and<BR>> they saw no other recourse but to grant my request=
.<BR>> <BR>> In Aurobindo's final letter to me he wrote, "Since you a=
re determined to<BR>> follow a path in which you can achieve only partia=
l realization, we give you<BR>> our blessings, though we believe it woul=
d be better if you stayed on here<BR>> and pursued your sadhana where bo=
th the Mother and I can help you."<BR>> <BR>> It was the rule in Auro=
bindo Ashram that any letter written to or received<BR>> from Aurobindo =
should not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this<BR>> rule,=
 I burnt all my letters, except the final letter I received from<BR>> Au=
robindo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; Settling
 at Sri Ramanasramam<BR>> <BR>> During the early years t=
here were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it<BR>> was mostly jung=
le or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a<BR>> brahmin's ho=
use near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would<BR>> someti=
mes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere<BR>&g=
t; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.<BR>> <BR>=
> Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in t=
he<BR>> hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back a=
gain to the<BR>> ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on=
 like this during the<BR>> first year. If possible, I would always sit c=
lose to Bhagavan so I could<BR>> hear all of his precious utterances.<BR=
>> <BR>> S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, d=
ecided that the<BR>> Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness.
 Co=
nsequently, one day he<BR>> travelled to Pondicherry and while there wro=
te a note to Aurobindo<BR>> describing who he was, what he wanted from l=
ife (Self-realization) and where<BR>> he was then residing (Sri Ramanasr=
amam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he<BR>> got from Aurobindo. It s=
aid, in brief, that all his aspirations could be<BR>> fulfilled at Sri R=
amanasramam, where he was then living.<BR>> <BR>> I remember during m=
y second visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day<BR>> reading a l=
engthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was<BR>> Au=
robindo's Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of<=
BR>> this newspaper was Bhagavan's devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seeme=
d to take<BR>> great interest in the review and would occasionally stop =
reading and comment<BR>> on what he had just read to those sitting aroun=
d him. When he had concluded<BR>> reading it, someone who was
 aware tha=
t I had that very book with me, said to<BR>> Bhagavan, "This man has com=
e from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book<BR>> with him." Bhagava=
n turned to me and said, "Oh, is that so? Let me have a<BR>> look at it.=
"<BR>> <BR>> I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it o=
ver to Bhagavan.<BR>> Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He=
 kept on reading it well<BR>> into the night, with the help of a small o=
il lamp, until he finished it.<BR>> <BR>> When I came into the hall t=
he next day he began discussing the book with me,<BR>> telling me that a=
 certain term used in the book might look like something<BR>> new, but i=
t is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and<BR>> su=
ch ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing<BR>>=
; Aurobindo's philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood<BR=
>> Aurobindo's philosophy both intellectually and also
 from the standpo=
int of<BR>> experience.<BR>> <BR>> One evening I said to Bhagavan =
that the major attraction of Aurobindo's<BR>> teachings is that it profe=
sses that immortality of the body can be achieved.<BR>> Bhagavan made no=
 comment.<BR>> <BR>> The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall =
and sat down, Bhagavan<BR>> looked at me and began saying, "In Kumbhakon=
am there was one yogi, C. V. V.<BR>> Rao, who was proclaiming to all, hi=
s doctrine of the immortality of the<BR>> body. He was even so bold as t=
o declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a<BR>> distinguished public and spiritu=
al personality in India) would have to come<BR>> to him to learn how to =
make her body immortal. But, before he had a chance<BR>> to meet Dr. Ann=
ie Besant, he died." This brief story clearly illustrated his<BR>> point=
.<BR>> <BR>> On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ram=
anasramam, I<BR>> approached Bhagavan when no
 one was in the hall and s=
howed him that last<BR>> letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan =
asked me to give it to him to<BR>> read. I told him he would be unable t=
o decipher Aurobindo's handwriting, as<BR>> it was very illegible and on=
ly those who have studied it for sometime could<BR>> read it. He said, "=
Give it to me. Let me try."<BR>> <BR>> After looking into it and real=
izing he could only make out a few words, he<BR>> returned it and asked =
me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came<BR>> to the senten=
ce, "Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can<BR>> ach=
ieve only partial realization . . .", Bhagavan stopped me and said,<BR>>=
 "Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it i=
s<BR>> realization, it is not partial."<BR>> <BR>> This was the fi=
nal blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this<BR>> letter,=
 like all the rest. And because of all the
 discussions I had had with<BR>&=
gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a c=
lear<BR>> understanding of where the Maharshi's path and Aurobindo's pat=
h diverged and<BR>> went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts a=
nd distractions<BR>> dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then kn=
ew that I understood and<BR>> the foundation work had been done. The pur=
pose of all our discussions were<BR>> served and so they stopped automat=
ically.<BR>> <BR>> I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagav=
an was the power of his<BR>> presence. Much of what he taught had alread=
y been transmitted to the masses<BR>> down through the ages. In Bhagavan=
 we found a being that was surcharged with<BR>> the Reality to such an e=
xtent that coming into his presence would effect a<BR>> dramatic change =
in us.<BR>> <BR>> Sources:<BR>> <BR>> a) <A
