 1st October, 1936

Talk 253.

Mr. F. G. Pearce, Principal, Scindia School,=
 Gwalior: Bhagavan has stated
[in Sad Vidya Anubandham (Supplement) sloka 3=
6]: =E2=80=9CThe illiterates are
certainly better off than the literates wh=
ose egos are not destroyed by the
quest of the self.=E2=80=9D This being so=
, could Bhagavan advise a school master
(who feels this to be true) how to =
carry on education in such a way that the
desire for literacy and intellect=
ual knowledge may not obscure the more
important search for the Self? Are t=
he two incompatible? If they are not,
then from what age, and by what means=
, can young people best be stimulated
towards the search for the Real Truth=
 within?

M.: Pride of learning and desire for appreciation are condemned a=
nd not
learning itself. Learning leading to search for Truth and humility i=
s good.
