Dear KK,
=C2=A0
Nice question. I was also t=
hinking that.
=C2=A0
Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is =
the staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in e=
ating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on =
the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man=
 came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna s=
aid first leave "Kamini" and "Kanchana", then think of food. =C2=A0Also a s=
imilar examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a =
certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish ea=
ting and rather just focus mind on God.
=C2=A0
When I tried to reason with =
them that if these people were to come back again on planet earth they may =
not recommend non veg eating - considering the state of the world today - I=
=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is som=
ething wrong in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
=
Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to w=
hich I was told, "no", because based on a whole plethora of such examples e=
ven today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve f=
ish. This statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many=
 Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the mon=
ks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarad=
a better than us ordrinary people. 
=C2=A0
I could make no further argument=
s and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents =
that I have quit non veg food. 
=C2=A0
A lot of Bengalis may not have been =
able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, howeve=
r they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by "Thakur" and "S=
ri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".
=C2=A0

Dear KK,

Correction in m=
y earlier message =E2=80=93 It should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God=
'

A sincere suggestion from me- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. Ho=
wever, you are free to address me as you feel like and I'll happily accept =
it hence forth.

I just came across Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He say=
s (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (B=
inding to one) when one self-identifies with it.
Although, it may seem easy=
 to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to ach=
ieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely important statement to answer our que=
ries.

Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know only ye=
sterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day pas=
sed in his life when he didn't do smoking except on the final day of his de=
parture from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco' frequently an=
d occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed ou=
t (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thought=
s crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Agh=
ori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says and =
not try to do what he does.

Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to=
 answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind yo=
u, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to =
nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or=
 Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forge=
t that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritua=
l realization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe=
. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. =
In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Rele=
vant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke=
 cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are =
doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every actio=
n of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind their e=
ach action and
 moreover their self identification is missing from the acti=
on and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a specia=
l purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakrishna used =
to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from ot=
hers. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume =
anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat a=
nything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food=
 intake is extremely important.
If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in =
west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for major=
ity of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He migh=
t be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that h=
e can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate t=
heir habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also po=
ssible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha wi=
th the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have s=
howered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It=
's possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural=
 inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother=
 Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in=
 USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. Whe=
n the boy, after some
 years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, =
swami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested sw=
ami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him =
that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silv=
er Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda an=
d after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda w=
hich literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.

Sw=
ami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.

So moral of my who=
le writings is that it's unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of=
 the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalanan=
da, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and ju=
stify our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actio=
ns.

Utpal

Ma wants you to learn your lesson. That is why you find a meat-eater reborn=

<DIV>Dear KK,<BR><BR=
>Correction in my earlier message =E2=80=93 It should read `Aghora, at the =
left hand of God'<BR><BR>A sincere suggestion from me- No need to address m=
e with `Ji' suffix. However, you are free to address me as you feel like an=
d I'll happily accept it hence forth.<BR><BR>I just came across Vimalananda=
' s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) tha=
t Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it=
.<BR>Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is =
multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely import=
ant statement to answer our queries.<BR><BR>Important information about Vim=
alananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smok=
er and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn't do smok=
ing except on the final day of his departure from physical body. He used to=
 as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally
 ate meat. I gave this =
information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an in=
teresting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please=
 also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to al=
l his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.<BR><BR>No=
w whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked=
. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unr=
ealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example =
cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such ack=
nowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized so=
uls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower =
of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfe=
ctly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they =
are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'.
 Relevant to our topic of discussio=
n, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or kill=
ed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a=
 specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said,=
 they know complete background behind their each action and moreover their =
self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature =
operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them =
in any cause-effect chain.<BR>Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his=
 disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiri=
tual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A f=
ood restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spir=
itually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely importa=
nt.<BR>If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have s=
ome subtle purpose which is not
 possible for majority of us to comprehend =
unless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' fr=
om the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by the=
m as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eati=
ng and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time =
that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose me=
at he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen bless=
ings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there w=
ere no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We=
'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way=
 Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still =
in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some ye=
ars actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told hi=
m to stay away from water
 and when he requested swami to accept him as his=
 disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru =
and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That m=
an later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was=
 actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled=
 what swami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.<BR><BR>Swami Vivekananda wa=
s all knowing and most of us are NOT.<BR><BR>So moral of my whole writings =
is that it's unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconve=
ntional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana=
 Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our co=
mpletely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.<BR><BR>B=

eings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no t=
hought for the sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitat=

 cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which
 is a most painful way to =

 would give beautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, p=
repared and served?<BR>> Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mot=
hers too love their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes th=
rough when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodim=

but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture=
 them in return. Fair's fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth=
