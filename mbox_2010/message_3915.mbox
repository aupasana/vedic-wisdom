Pranam,

i totally agree to Narayan ji and Utpal ji as i had a similar kind=
 of experience just before the time when i was getting ready to start of wi=
th my homams..when i was very worried and had many confusions inside me reg=
arding whether i'll be able to do homams or not, how would i even meet up w=
ith the costs of daily homams (since i was having some problems financially=
) etc, i thought of reading Aghora to calm myself down and seek for the ans=
wers..
now comes the surprise,

i had opened just the page 177 Aghora 2 . t=
hat's the chapter of *GANESHA* ! 

now i am continuing with my Homams *Dail=
y* and even when i get sufficient time i have done 6 homams continuously wi=
thout stopping..in a single day..All by the Grace of guru..
therefore if a =
lay man like me can get the grace of Vimalanda and Gurus.. i guess he is al=
ready there with a wide open-arms for all of us...

talking of material ben=
efits ...as much as i have learnt from my seniors and realized myself..*We =
really don't know whats the best for us..* hence it is always better to lea=
ve it to the All-mighty..

i beg of mercy and forgiveness if at any point i=
 was wrong ...
plz do correct me ...

regards Sayantan.

JAI MAA!
