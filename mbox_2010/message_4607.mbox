Hello Narasimha

On pronounciation, I agree with you 100%,they do it in a w=
ay that suites them, it is the bhava that is  important, focus and concentr=
ation of mind is important. 

And that is a the beauty even with that prono=
unciation they have progressed a lot. 

Both the mother and swamiji are fin=
e people who have made difference in many peoples lives. We must look at ma=
ny other qualities.

So does the pronounciation matter?

In my humble opion=
ion teaching is done silently or the best teachers do it silently, they rem=
ove all confusion within the disciples mind silently. What is a silent pron=
ounciation?

Lord Dakshinamoorty silently imparted a lot of teaching too.

=
I also agree with Manish on the count, If I recall correctly they have done=
 this 1000 homas on more than one occassion, in Napa Valley and before that=
 in a place they had near LA area. Prior to that they both lived in India a=
nd may have done there too. The number is not of great importance They dono=
t brag at all. I mentioned it with different angle.

My point on the count =
was in  their place i.e. their ashram where they have done some many chandi=
 homas, the place should be very special i.e. good vibrations etc, so from =
that perspective it is good to go and see it and experiance it.

In my humb=
le opionion they teach a good methodical process. They have a very varied d=
isciple slate. I am sure they adjust accordingly.

We live in a very impure=
 hybrid time and place and accordingly they have good process for learning =
chandi paath and other things, I have a very positive opionion about them a=
nd recommend them.

Best Regards
Mitesh
