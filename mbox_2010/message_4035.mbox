Hello!

I am an American Hindu, living in Houston, Texas.  (Texas is in the=
 far southern US, bordering Mexico, the country south of us, for anyone unf=
amiliar.)  My devotion has had its ups and downs for many years, but I am t=
rying now to get firm in my practice.

I lived near a Smarta temple in Ohio=
 (a far northern state in the USA, bordering Canada, the country to the nor=
th of us) where I used to go to worship on occasion, and had a teacher ther=
e who was teaching me some Sanskrit and a little theology along the way.  T=
hat was several years ago.  Since moving to Texas, I have just discovered t=
hat there is a Vedanta center not very far from where I live, and I plan to=
 go there when I can.

Philosophically, I hold to advaita vedanta, worshipi=
ng Siva as Ishvara.  (I may use some words in the wrong way, so please excu=
se and correct me!)  I have done a good bit of reading, and meditate on a r=
egular basis, but I do lack good grounding in some of the actual day-to-day=
 worship and understanding of mantras and such.

Having been told that this=
 group could help me with some of that, I immediately joined.  I trust that=
 you will forgive my ignorance on many, many matters!

Davyd
