Namaste

Each one of us comes from a specific Maha Rishi and accordingly
we=
 have Gotra associated with us.

>From my perspective the only time I have u=
sed it is when doing some pooja and making the sankalpa.

I am wondering if=
 one should everyday worship or remember the MahaRishi.
May be with time we=
 have either forgotten doing it.

Also like we have mantra for Gods and God=
dess. It appears to me that
there should be also mantra to remember or than=
k or pray the MahaRishi.

How does one get about finding these mantras and =
other information
that is specific to a particular MahaRishi?

Best Regards=

Mitesh
