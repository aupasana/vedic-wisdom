 Sri Chelam from Andhra Pradesh interviewed a number of devotees of Sri
Bha=
gavan who had long-standing association with Him and compiled their
reminis=
cences. Some of these were translated and published by Sri
Ramanasramam in =
Ramana Smriti in 1980. The following is another from this
collection that w=
as translated from Telugu by 'SRJ' and published in Ramana
Jyothi, a journa=
l of the Sri Ramana Kendram of Hyderabad. Rangaswamy was an
attendant of Bh=
agavan and can be seen walking behind the Maharshi in the
archival film foo=
tage.

My parents were farmers and my village is thirty miles from Tiruvann=
amalai.
Yearning for male progeny my mother and father offered prayers to L=
ord
Vinayaka. Thereafter, I and my younger brother were born.

In my twenti=
eth year, I came to know that the Kartikai Festival in
Tiruvannamalai was a=
 grand affair. I became restless with a longing to see
it and left home for=
 Arunachala. The night before I left I had a dream of a
sannyasin clad in o=
nly a loin cloth and surrounded by brahmacharins.
Adjacent to the hill was =
his hermitage where he gave me darshan seated on a
tiger's skin.

The next =
day I started off for Arunachala, but was not used to walking long
distance=
s. I stopped in a village on the way and went to the house of a
family I kn=
ew. When they saw my haggard looks they restrained me from
continuing. I wa=
s locked in a room.

The time of the festival was running out. Because of m=
y persistent demands I
was finally released. Only two hours were left befor=
e the lighting of the
deepam (light) on the hill and I had yet fifteen mile=
s to cover. In a
frenzy, totally unconscious of my body, I ran. I felt as i=
f I floated in the
air. I reached Arunachala at 5:30 p.m. and had darshan o=
f the deepam when it
was lit at 6 p.m. Afterwards I went to the Esanya Mutt=
 and the people there
welcomed me and asked me to stay.

The next morning I=
 started off for giripradakshina of Arunachala. Sri
Ramanasramam was on the=
 way and, as everyone was going into the Ashrama to
have darshan of Bhagava=
n, I followed. The moment I saw him I was overcome
with emotion and cried o=
ut, "When will I be rid of this bondage?" I was
visibly shaken. Bhagavan ki=
ndly gestured to me that I should sit. I sat down
for an hour and was uncon=
scious of my body. I had an urge to stay on there
and asked Chinnaswami (th=
e Ashrama manager) for permission. He said, "You
are young. What can you do=
? Go back home." But I did not leave. I said,
"Please give me any work. Bha=
gavan will give me the strength." As I would
not leave,Chinnaswami relented=
 and finally asked me to remove the weeds from
the flower garden. With much=
 enthusiasm I did the work of two people.
Bhagavan also praised my work.

I=
 would daily attend to the work given to me and when free would sit in
medi=
tation. That was my only routine. One day I asked Bhagavan, "Swami, what
is=
 the way to salvation?"

"The way you came," was his simple reply.

The mom=
ent I heard him say this my mind froze. He then asked me to read a
verse fr=
om Upadesa Saram.

Later I was given the job of making garlands for the tem=
ple deities. Around
the same time they were constructing a platform in the =
Ashrama. All of us
were carrying stones. Sri Bhagavan too carried them with=
 us. My finger got
crushed under a stone, and until the finger healed, Bhag=
avan made the
garlands on my behalf.

Later I was made an attendant to Bhag=
avan. Me and Madhavaswami were his
attendants. One time both of us were giv=
en damaged copies of Ramana Vijayam
for reading. My copy did not contain al=
l the pages. Bhagavan asked me to
hand copy those pages, but I could not fi=
nd the time to do it. One day he
asked me, "Have you copied those pages?"

=
"I am not finding time," I said.

"What are you doing now?" he asked.

"I a=
m going to Pallakottu to wash your loin cloth."

"All right. You do my work=
 and I will do your work." Saying this he copied
all the pages for me.

Tho=
se days when any offering was made it was distributed then and there.
Ants,=
 squirrels, cats, dogs, cows, children and adults were fed. There was
no co=
ncept of storing for the morrow.

One day, Bhagavan, while cooking in the k=
itchen, asked me to put some oil in
a ladle. Some of the oil spilled out on=
to the floor. He massaged all that
oil on my body and said, "Go have your b=
ath."

Another day the district collector came from Vellore to see Bhagavan=
. The
little squirrels were close by in their nest. A cat swallowed their m=
other. The
responsibility of looking after them now fell on Bhagavan. He sa=
id, "These
children do not know that it is to their advantage if they confi=
ne
themselves to their nest. All the problems are outside, but they cannot
=
resist the temptation of going out. Similarly, if the mind settles down in
=
the Heart without straying out, there is no problem. But it cannot help
goi=
ng out."

"What is the method of restraining it?" I asked.

"Just the same =
as I am doing here: Whenever the squirrels come out, I put
them back. The m=
ore we put them back they stay put. Then we can relax."

My parents began t=
o search for me since I did not return the day after
Kartikai Deepam. After=
 a year had passed, they finally found me at Sri
Ramanasramam. They came an=
d wept before Bhagavan.

"If he goes with you, then take him. Why cry befor=
e me?" said Bhagavan. But
I refused to go.

"We did a lot of penance to beg=
et him. The same Lord who gave him to us took
him back again for his servic=
e," they said, and then left the place.

After a few years I had an urge to=
 go to Kashi. When I mentioned this to
Bhagavan, he said, "'Ka-shi' -- if y=
ou forget those two letters, this itself
is Kashi."

"I am unable to forget=
, Swami" I said.

"All right, fulfil your desire," said Bhagavan.

But Chin=
naswami refused to allow me to go, but I still went. Devotees
contributed f=
unds for my expenses. I returned after three months, but
Chinnaswami refuse=
d to admit me into the Ashrama.

"He is like that," Bhagavan said to Chinna=
swami. Then he admitted me.

One evening Bhagavan was coming down the hill.=
 I was walking behind him. A
janitor offered his salutations to Bhagavan. B=
hagavan said, "If you do your
work with care, that itself is salutations." =
When Bhagavan went into the
hall all the people stood up and some prostrate=
d. When all of them settled
down, Bhagavan asked me to relate what had happ=
ened on the hill and what he
told that janitor.

Bhagavan then said, "These=
 sittings, standings and salutations are not real
marks of respect. Doing o=
ne's job with the utmost care is the real
salutation."

Shantamma was a coo=
k in the Ashrama. She derived satisfaction only when she
served Bhagavan wi=
th her own hands. She used to serve Bhagavan before
serving everyone else. =
Bhagavan was patient with her for a long time. Finally
he said, "Swamy does=
 not reside just in this body. He is present in every
one of the devotees. =
This Swamy will be happy if he is served only after
everybody else is serve=
d."

One evening me and Bhagavan were going up the hill. Mr. Chadwick was r=
ocking
on a chair in his verandah when he called out to me by clapping his =
hands.
Bhagavan inquired as to what the matter was about. I briefly explain=
ed. In
reply he said, "This is how the Westerners increase their needs. How=

comfortable it will be if we spread a mat and squat on it."

Once the othe=
r attendant, Madhavaswami, had to undergo surgery in one of his
ears. At th=
at time I had to do the all the work of giving Bhagavan a bath,
distributin=
g offerings, going up the hill with the Swamy, keeping vigil in
the night, =
etc. Consequently, because of the strain, I became unwell. I
explained this=
 to Bhagavan. Then, soon after, I was massaging Bhagavan's
feet.Bhagavan th=
en massaged my abdomen with his foot. Immediately, my
illness vanished and =
I was infused with unusual strength. Henceforth, I was
enabled to do the en=
tire work effortlessly until Madhavaswami recovered.
