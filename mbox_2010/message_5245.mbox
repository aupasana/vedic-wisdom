Namaste,

I agree with all your sentiments but what could be done about the=
se people? I 
myself do not like ISCKON. And I do not visit their temples e=
ither nor do 
I=C2=A0visit their forumns. The best would be to ignore them.=
 As for Utpal Ji, rather 
than going to such puja's and getting boiled up, =
the best would be to turn down 
your firends invitation to attend the puja.=
..I mean, after you have been through 
it once, why go there again?

Regard=
s,
Bhupendra

Dear Utpal
In Iskcon they use word Prabhu for other devotees,exampl=
e if I am Iskconite and 
if I meet you that I shall call you hello Prabhu n=
ow the story behind this(from 
their own words)that when they call you prab=
hu means you are under their Radar ! 
Means be watchful,careful from them!
=
I honestly did not want to start this discussion because of one reason and =
that 
is this our very group is free from such topics and even Shri Satya P=
rakashji 
indirectly also pointed to this plus point of this group but I co=
uld not stop 
myself even in past and in present and my blood start boiling=
 when they use word 
Demi God for my shivji,who are they to use such barome=
ter for our devi and 
devatas?
Further there are numerous examples of such =
devotees giving pravachanas when you 
visit some temples,here I am omitting=
 the names of those temples and one devotee 
who came from USA,a white man =
from Iskcon recently visited one temple and he 
unfortunately was present i=
n some pravachana given there by some lady from 
Bangalore,he then wrote se=
veral posts in many groups with his views and 
objections on such theories.=
T
This hard path was one of the reason why they had to close their own disc=
ussion 
forum called India Divine recently as there were some stupid commen=
ts on 
Shiva,Durga etc..thing is they just cannot neglect Shiva because Shi=
va has a 
special place in Hinduism and nothing will move against his will.=

If anybody has soft corner for Iskcon,I shall NOT say sorry for them for w=
hat I 
have=C2=A0written and said here,truth is a truth and let it be bitte=
r for them.Glad 
to know that you controlled your self,its indeed a very ve=
ry difficult job after 
listening to their pravachana(thats what they say e=
lse it is a hopeless speech 
in real).I agree totally with your views that =
after listing to those lines even 
Shri Krishna must have run away from tha=
t place.If you go to Dwarka there is a 
huge gate made by them(Iskcon)and l=
ocal people just take no notice of that gate 
what so ever till this date a=
nd this what they deserve.
regards and pranams,no sympothies to those who a=
re really blind.
Aksha Rudra

<DIV>Dear Utpal</DIV>
<DI=
V>In Iskcon they use word Prabhu for other devotees,example if I am Iskconi=
te and if I meet you that I shall call you hello Prabhu now the story behin=
d this(from their own words)that when they call you prabhu means you are un=
der their Radar ! Means be watchful,careful from them!</DIV>
<DIV>I honestl=
y did not want to start this discussion because of one reason and that is t=
his our very group is free from such topics and even Shri Satya Prakashji i=
ndirectly also pointed to this plus point of this group but I could not sto=
p myself even in past and in present and my blood start boiling when they u=
se word Demi God for my shivji,who are they to use such barometer for our d=
evi and devatas?</DIV>
<DIV>Further there are numerous examples of such dev=
otees giving pravachanas when you visit some temples,here I am omitting the=
 names of those temples and one devotee who came from USA,a white man from =
Iskcon recently visited one temple and he unfortunately was present in some=
 pravachana given there by some lady from Bangalore,he then wrote several p=
osts in many groups with his views and objections on such theories.T</DIV>
=
<DIV>This hard path was one of the reason why they had to close their own d=
iscussion forum called India Divine recently as there were some stupid comm=
ents on Shiva,Durga etc..thing is they just cannot neglect Shiva because Sh=
iva has a special place in Hinduism and nothing will move against his will.=
</DIV>
<DIV>If anybody has soft corner for Iskcon,I shall NOT say sorry for=
 them for what I have written and said here,truth is a truth and let i=
t be bitter for them.Glad to know that you controlled your self,its indeed =
a very very difficult job after listening to their pravachana(thats what th=
ey say else it is a hopeless speech in real).I agree totally with your view=
s that after listing to those lines even Shri Krishna must have run away fr=
om that place.If you go to Dwarka there is a huge gate made by them(Iskcon)=
and local people just take no notice of that gate what so ever till this da=
te and this what they deserve.</DIV>

 be slippery=

r spiritual sadhana, the
 deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash c=
an and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be so=

ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.<BR>> > > > <BR>>=

iests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a=
 brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a br=
ahmana oneself. One's aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-li=
ke. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of mon=
ey or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. =
They are not
 really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas =
on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for ot=
hers only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influe=
nce, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.<BR>> >=

Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahma=
na if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karma=
s of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again,=
 to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmana=
s by conduct.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > The above will=
