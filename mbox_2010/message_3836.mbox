Namaskaar Biswajeet,

Meditating for a sufficient time, i suggest to use *f=
ull dry coconut or One coconut Half* as Poornaahuti offering. offcourse, af=
fordability needs to be checked. In this case you may end up using all in a=
ll 2 to 3 coconut halves. Checkout!

Once Manish suggested me to burn as mu=
ch day coconuts as possible and suggested to offer Supari as Poornaahuti. J=
ust for Informations of all members of the list.
Initially Supari was remai=
ning half burnt most of the times. Then after a few days, one idea clicked.=
 I started keeping Supari (Supari used in Pujan i.e. smaller in size) in a =
Dray coconut half and started offering that as Poornaahuti. Thence on, Supa=
ri and everything else in Homa Kundam is getting completely burnt (which is=
 a preliminary requirement for all the homas that all the offerings should =
get burnt completely).

***
For Brahmacharya, if i may suggest, keep a vow =
for some time period. Say 12 days or 40 days or 108 days or such duration w=
hich you can sustain. A resolve (vow) helps in strengthening the will power=
. Initial failures are inevitable for most so do not worry and start again =
and again and again..... Eat less during Dinner. Let the stomach be filled =
only 3/4th. That should also help a lot. Prayer to chosen god is almost ind=
ispensable in the case of Brahmacharya.

Best wishes!

Utpal
