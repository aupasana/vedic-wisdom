Namaste Charan Sparash PVR JI

I am doing GaneshJi and Vishnu Ji Homam from last one year. On Sunday Rath
saptami
I got a desire to do devi/chandika homam including above ones.but as I am
not good at reading durga saptasati
so I decided to read the ratri devi suktakm [ as in chapter 5 of durga sapta
sati] and also given in the end of gita press book in the last. and I am
putting savaha with each of that mantra.

Please guide me is this OK.

I am reposting this. I do not know but I wrote to this group four times.

1- One for myself to you  - I did not get any reply.
2- Wrote for my friend quest - I got the reply.
3- Wrote about manish ji article in TOI
4- Again the above mail I posted 15 days back - I did not get any reply

So whenever I am writing for myself getting no reply.

hope this time.............
Regards
vishal Sharma
