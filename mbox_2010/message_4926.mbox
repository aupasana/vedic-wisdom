Narasimhaji and other Gurujan,

1.  During the Homam, it is ok to stir the=
 contents of the Homa Kunda to
get better combustion of ingredients and dis=
tribution of fire or that
should only be done at the end of the homam?  Rea=
son I am asking this
question is that recently I was talking to a priest an=
d he mentioned
that you are inviting all these devatas into the Homam Agni =
so why do
you keep disturbing them by prodding a tong into the fire on a re=
gular
basis in the middle of the homam?  Your thoughts please

2.  What are=
 some of the recommended  Samputs that can be added for
Chandi Homam?  I so=
metimes add the navarana mantra after each shloka of
the Chandi during Homa=
m as Samput as I find that makes the Homam more
powerful but have been told=
 that other Samputs can be taken also such as
"namo devyai mahadevyai..." a=
nd "sarva-mangal maangalyai..." after each
shloka

3.  If one is taking a S=
amput in the Chandi Homam, then in Chapter 5,
should the Samput be taken af=
ter each "namastasyai"?  Example do we have
to go "ya devi sarvabhuteshu bu=
ddhirupena samsthita, namastasyai (swaaha
+ samput and swaaha), namastasyai=
 (swaaha + samput and swaaha),
namastasyai namo namah (swaaha + samput and =
swaaha) or just go with the
regular swaaha and then one samput at the end f=
ollowed by swaaha?

4.  While taking a Samput some people take the samput t=
wice for each
shloka.  Is that the recommended norm?

5.  Do you have some =
guidance on offering specific ingredients for each
chapter of the Chandi?  =
There are several books which offer guidance for
specific offerings during =
the 13 chapters but they are not consistent. 
I realize that everything bel=
ongs to her so why get too fancy but
sometimes it is nice to get into the p=
lay and offer different things out
of love.

Regards

Sumeet
