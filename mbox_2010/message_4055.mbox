Baba did this fire ceremony every day at noon every day without fail

"I do=
 not want peace for myself. For the sake of my own peace I can do
japa. I w=
ill have my own benefit. What will come from doing Hom?

The fragrance will=
 rise up, high in the sky. It will mix with the
atmosphere.And mixing, ther=
e will be water, and that water will become
rain. From that all beings will=
 become holy, consecrated. There will be
good food. Good food will be grown=
."
"The Hom fire has no discrimination. There is no discrimination for a
fi=
re. Give it poison, it will burn it. Give it dry wood, it will burn
it.

Ho=
m is the Jathara Agni, the fire in the belly. Here in the stomach the
true =
Hom is burning.

The Hom fire makes a breeze, a beautiful fragrance goes up=
. It's like
when you burn incense before the gods.

Maybe you cannot do the=
 Hom fire so you light incense, that is also Hom.
You light a lamp or candl=
e, that is also Hom."
"It is for the sake of the whole world's welfare some=
 Hom must be done.
Since I have come to America, so for the sake of America=
's peace I say
to God "Om! Swaha!" and offer these things. In our India, Ho=
m is
important."

Lighting a candle is also Hom. Arati is also Hom. Underst=
and? If I don't
do Hom I won't be fit to receive God. One must do Jogya.

B=
ut not all rishis do it. I am not reproaching them, They don't want to
wast=
e time collecting wood and other things. Instead of that they eat
and sleep=
 and take the Lord's name. That's enough."

"The fire of Hom still hasn't g=
one out. Its fragrance has risen. Open,
open the gateway of Hom. Its fragra=
nce still is rising.

The fire of Hom is burning still. The fire of knowled=
ge is burning
still. The fire of Hom never burns out. In its fragrance ther=
e is great
Life.
Everyone in the world is sitting to do Hom. To get the gre=
at Nirvana."





Baba on love...

"Love is the main thing. You can do japa=
, chant mantras,or do worship,
but if you do not have love then all these t=
hings are worthless. I ask
Satchidananda Guru to give you peace.

I pray to=
 my Guru that in the same way that I have received blessing
from him, so al=
l of you shall have the power of Guru in you, and that
all the darkness of =
ignorance will be removed, and that your hearts will
become pure, and that =
you will see that inner being."





Baba on the guru...

"By true Satsang =
the mind is purified and the intelligence is clear
about the inner being. I=
f intelligence is clear, then Divyagyan or God's
true self is revealed. By =
Divyaguan we can have darshan of God, who is
within us all. But remember th=
at even though I keep saying that I am the
one who is saying all this, it i=
s an illusion.

If you want to have some coconut, first you have to remove =
the husk,
then break through the hard shell to find the coconut. This illus=
ion of
self has been with us for a long time, so it is hard to break. But w=
e
all have to try very hard to do this. When the ego is removed, then in
it=
s place we will have devotion. Devotion means complete love. This
devotion =
is what we are looking for.

Guru is the one who removes the darkness of ig=
norance and the dirt of
illusion that we have accumulated over the years. B=
ut following the path
of a Guru is very hard. It takes absolute faith. If o=
ne believes with
absolute faith that a piece of wood is the Guru then it wi=
ll certainly
become the Guru. One cannot buy this faith with money or get i=
t by
reading books. Pride in the self is what brings people down."
"This gu=
ru of my life, this heart, this body is the temple of guru. So
what is left=
 then, who am I? If always I remember guru, think about
guru, and completel=
y have faith in guru's words, then certainly we will
see God. Seeing guru a=
nd seeing God is the same."

"This word of ours, "guru", it means from deep=
 darkness by giving light,
the one who lightens the darkness inside me, he =
is "guru." Again the
meaning of the word guru is: after falling in a dark w=
ell, to save one
from that deep dark well, the one who saves is guru. Remov=
ing the
darkness of ignorance, by lighting the lamp of knowledge, one who g=
ives
peace to our life, he is guru."
