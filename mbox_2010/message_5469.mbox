Respected Sri Ji,

Respected Vemparla Ram Kishore has answered your queries=
 well. I am not as able enough to add anything new. But I will like to add =
my two cents here. Please ignore if you think they are not worth considerin=
g.

Sir, All atheists are not prosperous and all spiritual persons do not l=
ead miserable life.

It is all matter of our past Karma which are yielding =
fruits to us. Our Deities or Guru, no doubt, test us from time to time. The=
se tests are very much needed to ensure that we are learning well and to ma=
rk an "achieved" point. These tests serve many purpose. failing these tests=
 tell us what our short comings are and what we need to improve and passing=
 these tests give us confidence and open up next step of challenges for us.=
 And many more purposes. More than we can actually think or imagine.

But, =
I believe, that these tests are not put to us like we think. These tests ca=
n manifest in many many different forms. I think it is not your problems wh=
ich are your 'test paper'. But the thought "Is spirituality a correct path?=
" instilled in your mind. You are experiencing problems as per your Karma-F=
ruit account. But the thought in your mind has been put as a test paper. To=
 check what is the strength of your faith. Nothing remains for ever. Neithe=
r good times nor bad times. We should be balanced minded in all the times. =
These bad times will check your this aspect also.

Deities usually do not g=
ive us new problems to face. They just speed up the process of experiencing=
 Karma. and sometimes re-arrange the order in which fruits are experienced.=


Just keep faith and face the bad times with a deep faith on your deity. A=
nd Believe me that you will cross these bad times and will succeed.

Sorry =
if I hurt
regards
Atul
