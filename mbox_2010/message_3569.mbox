Narasimhaji and other Gurujan,

In the Chandipath, the name of the King is=
 Surath (a good charioteer)
and he is obviously skilled in administration a=
nd leading people on the
right path but due to circumstances or some past k=
armas his kindom is
snatched away from him by the Kolavidhwamsis (Kola is t=
ranslated as a
barbaric tribe but is also related to Saturn representing pa=
st Karmas). 
When he does Devi Araadhana in the end he is given the boon of=
 getting
his kindgom back and ruling it with a sense of detachment (like Ra=
ja
Janaka), which will never again be taken away as well as he is made the
=
Manu in the next Manvantara.

However, I wonder what is the significance of=
 the Vaishya being named
Samadhi?  Unlike Suratha who gets a boon related t=
o his natural
abilities, the Vaishya does not get a boon to get his family =
back or a
boon to become the best merchant who is detached from the fruits =
of his
work but rather he is given the boon of getting the knowledge which
=
leads to final emancipation.  Is the message simply here that we need to
st=
ep away from a business oriented mind into a spiritual mindset?

Veenu
