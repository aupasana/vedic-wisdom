Dear Rajarshi,



Needless to say that it was very well written account wh=
ich reminded me
of 'M' and i can understand the efforts you would have take=
n to compile
all the 3 messages.



What made me most happy in the message =
was following lines:





"One very senior Rishi has decided to change this=
 land back to a Rishi
bhoomi. And so shall it happen. Ved Dharma will be re=
 established here
along the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful o=
r mighty, be it
an individual or group, can stand against the will of a Ris=
hi."



Sanatan Dharma and the Land of Rishis were for long (over 1000 year=
s) in
downslide and depleted condition. It is heartening to know that Some
=
Rishi has come out from Samadhi to put it back on track to glory.



Best R=
egards,



Utpal

we fou=

The amount of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests f=

child's play for Him." Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly.
Therefor=

the other.

a=
gain. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika,
for n=
ow. We walked long the=C2 deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if
it is ok=
 doing a=C2 homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2 yes
why not, but w=
ithout Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the
divine feminie is th=
e most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the
state of highest conscio=
usness, and to reach that stage one must develop
his body and mind such tha=
t it can hold shakti=C2 for which=C2
worshipping the divine Mother is the b=
est way.=C2 That is why
Vimalananda says, "Let the Mother show you the face=
 of the Father". The
topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, "Kala Bhair=
ava is very strong
in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in t=
he cremation
grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in=

Manikarnika." Then staring at the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled
ligh=
tly and
> added, "That man was something." This was again an old conversati=
on we
had started=C2 before which Mainsh continued, "All these babas of tod=
ay
would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them.
Thos=
e three books have the power of a deity flowing through them.
Without being=
 physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of
sadhakas!". I interj=
ected, "The books=C2 are like a Bible=C2 for
sadhakas,=C2 arn't they?". "Ye=
s" said Manish. Later on I asked him if
it was possible for someone to meet=
 Vimalanada, to which Manish replied
that yes it was, if one does serious s=
adhana. However, the important
question is whether one will be able to reco=
gnize him. I fell silent
hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of th=
e Aghora series,
Vimalanda does mention that a time will come when his "chi=
ldren" would
spread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep thi=
ngs run.
> =C2
> We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we s=
at at the
same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire wa=
s low.
Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As=

usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this
did =
not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would
slowly lif=
t his=C2 palm upwards=C2 and with the next ahuti=C2
immediately the fire wo=
uld leap higher. He did this quite a few times,
when=C2 the flames were get=
ting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi
path and passing on the samagri t=
o him as and when he required anything.
One dom who was working on a pyre n=
earby, came towards us and
exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded ba=
ck, "Jai Mahadev". This
homa was faster. He did not use any "samputs", but =
a direct, straight
Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked th=
e pyre a bit,
pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn p=
roperly. I
was
> enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening =
to the path.
In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is =
the
property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further
cla=
im on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an
Aghori=
 and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise
the dead ba=
ck to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that
Manikarnika is such =
an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point
mentally wondering why =
are there so many people in the samshan. The
Manish said, if a Nath came he=
re in his garb, everyone will run away
from the samshan scared. But there i=
s a reason why there are people here
even so late in the night.
> =C2
> Onc=
e the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this
homa go=
t over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened,
for me, was=
 superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst
forth and expan=
d across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus
was good, but I had=
 to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish
continued meditating =
for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from
him. Nothing. Still lik=
e a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged
Manish on his feet. That mad=
e him open his eyes. Manish remarked, " I
could have just left my body and =
gone off. It did not matter that I had
a flight to catch the next day, or a=
nything else. I was on the verge of
death. Just at that moment the cow and =
brought me back." Smiling he
added, "What a sight it would have been for th=
e people to see, how the
body can be left at will".=C2  I did not know what=
 to say.
> =C2
> We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body wa=
s half
burnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2 red patches all over.=

The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo
st=
ick)=C2 from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso
into the =
air and placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the
pyre. The smo=
oth=C2 motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking
out from one end=
 of the bamboo stick,=C2 into the thin, dark, night-air
reminded me of how =
we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2 or
vegetables, both dead -=
=C2 from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked
me smiling, "Maza aya?". I =
smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he
commented=C2 that I should write ab=
out this experience in the coming
days. Let people know.
> =C2
> By this ti=
me I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi
path, one dog=
=C2 had run off with one of my chappals. I informed
Manish. He exclaimed, "=
 Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as
well." Manish said we had a =
rna with this samshan. We had been here
before, in some life.
> =C2
> As we=
 were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three
peaks)=C2 of Shiva=
's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore,
it is a "safe" samsha=
n. Anyone who tries anything negative here will
face troubles. The trishul =
of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will
cause any unnecessary disturbanc=
e inside the samshan. That is also why
there are people here even at 2 am i=
n the morning. There is safety in
numbers. As long as ones intentions are g=
enuine and good, Manikarnika is
a wonderful place to do sadhana.
> =C2
> Wh=
ile walking along the ghats=C2 which were=C2 totally deserted,
Manish instr=
ucted me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming
loose, I caught=
 hold of it=C2 with one=C2 hand and kept moving fast,
trying to keep pace w=
ith Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got some
smell. I thought and re=
collected that yes, I did get a faint smell of
heena. Twice. Manish told me=
 it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of
similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshi=
ni. Once the ritual is over, and
you are out of the samshan, do not wait al=
ong the banks, he instructed.
Do not move too close to the water=C2 late in=
 the nightt. There are
things in the water. Generally they may not do anyth=
ing, but why take a
chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Mani=
karnika Ghat.
Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) u=
sed to live
in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. He=
re
God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is their city.

al pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2 sadhana, and
it is not entirely risk free. I=
nfact, in many paramparas it is said=C2
only someone who has a direct agya =

this procedure, or someone who has ag=

Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahut=

Aghoris. This is party du=

philosophy and efficacy of t=

TV channels too have made film=

d day was Astami Tithi of Krishna
Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful nigh=
t for chita homa. Various
shaktis are available on this night which can des=
troy Ashuras.=C2 Past
midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along th=
e ghats. Not a
single person was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitud=
e of ghats
which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting amo=
ng each
other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any
al=
ternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I
knew a=
nd praying to the deity to make our journey smooth.
Coincidentally, just at=
 that moment we saw a man coming from the other
side who chased the dogs aw=
ay.=C2 Without looking at me=C2 Manish
said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can=
 work wonders but never become to
big for your breeches".
> =C2
> As we pas=
sed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful
place.=C2 I did not thi=
nk too much about it then since my mind was
already pre occupied with the t=
houghts of what is to come. The next day
morning when we again came to the =
Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I
suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and t=
hen everything became calm.
Manish smiled at me and said this is where Tril=
anga Swami did his
tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little s=
keptical
mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a=

different ghat, however I did not say anything.=C2 Later on returning
to M=
umbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person
confirmed tha=
t indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and
do his sadhana.=
 Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.
> =C2
> Back to midnight. We reached M=
anikarnika and again it was filled with
people. But this time we did not wa=
it. We went right inside, and Manish
kept looking for a suitable chita. As =
we came in, again people started
staring at us, but they respectfully made =
way for us to pass through to
the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly a=
t the middle, with Manish
observing the different chitas. There were about =
8/10 of them burning.
It is said in thousands of years there has not been a=
 single minute when
there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it=
 is one of the
Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which=
 Manish was
observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stan=
d right
next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked
dang=
erous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the
other =
side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2  but there is
something else =
as well. I did not ask him what. So we
> went to another side. The dom ther=
e came forward and said to Manish,
"Baba,aap log=C2 kaun se chita me baithn=
a chahate ho?". Manish
indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead a=
nd asked the people
standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. =
He said the heat
from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'll=
 sit here
itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space for=
 us to
sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to dist=
urb
the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about
Manika=
rnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not
here. Manish =
later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas
have been done =
in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have
either themsleves=
 seen these things or heard from their families and
thus they do not distur=
b.

previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind
w=
as much calmer than the previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack
of =
dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange because=C2
there were =
at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose this
specific pyre for so=
me inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler
sense perception than avera=
ge humans like me. This homa was extended
longer. Every now and then Manish=
 would suddenly look at a certain
direction intently for a few second. I to=
o would turn and look that way
but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looke=
d at a specific direction or
made some gestures, the dogs too would start b=
arking at that direction.
At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the d=
ogs, they could
see/sense things which I=C2  - being such an=C2 ordinary pe=
rson -=C2
obviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2 =
I
could hear
> chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relatives wailing as new b=
odies were
being brought in.
> =C2
> Suddenly to my right there was a sound=
 and quite abit of smoke, I saw
a transformer bursting. The dogs immediatel=
y started barking at that.
Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around,=
 entering the fire and
leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer ha=
d a link to this. As
the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right han=
d - I saw a human
shadow pass over=C2 the pages of the=C2 book. I thought i=
t was some
relative who was standing behind me.=C2 I looked back and was a =
shocked
to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my b=
ook
once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more=

vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=C2  Manish later said, as
one=
 does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her
presence fe=
lt, even if slightly.=C2 It is not an imagination but
reality and this can=
=C2 happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana
anywhere. The idea is t=
o keep doing sadhana.
> =C2
> While offering coconuts into the fire, one co=
conut rolled off from the
pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the dom=
es use to stroke the
fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if=
 I=C2 had been a
dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natu=
ral stroking
the pyre=C2 the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2 there =
was any
company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily =
take
it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=

Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra
coconut =
while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood
why.
> =C2
> =
In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives
who =
was standing nearby and told him=C2 that the person whos body was
in the py=
re has just left and that=C2 they (relatives) do not have to
wait any more.=
 It was already late in the night. The person did not know
what to say. Sud=
denly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is
nothing evil or bad b=
eing done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I
guess the person was men=
tally wondering about what is going on. Then
another of the relatives came =
forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad
leke hi jayenge". So Manish said =
ok and asked them to sit down and
continued with the homa. In the middle of=
 the homa suddenly Manish asked
me to observe the skin on the corpse=C2  I =
saw the skin on the face had
caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to=
 see!
> =C2
> There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2 at the end to=
 finsh
the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to po=
ur
water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish.
Fi=
nally at the end they came to Manish and=C2 asked if they could pour
some G=
anges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing
will happen=
 to the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash
full of water bu=
t nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After
some times, after so=
me more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, "
Devi=C2 samne khadi ha=
i. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people
came forward and revential=
ly bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to
touch=C2 Manish's feet, but Manis=
h would not let them do so. They asked
for his blessings. He distributed so=
me flower petals we had and told
them to go home, since it was very late in=
 the night. Suddenly the man,
who had some doubts (whom Manish had addresse=
d earlier) came
> running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for=
 having
doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has don=
e no
wrong, everything is all right.=C2  Later Manish said, if it was some
=
other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of
tea.=
 Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a
certain s=
aint (a famous saint)=C2 who used to live in Kasi. Manish
without respondin=
g to his query asked him where was he from, the person
replied interior=C2 =
Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was
late in the night. The =
faith of the ordinary people of this land is what
makes India so unique, th=
at is why our land and culture is still so
alive. We city bred 'educated'=
=C2 people are too rational to understand
these things. God loves the simpl=
e and uncalculating. By this time I too
stood up to do pranam to the fire. =
Immediately I felt as if my body
existed only from my head to my heart, the=
re was nothing
> below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2 as if=C2 I was simply floa=
ting on
thin=C2 air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2 curt on=
e
word reply, "Good".
> =C2
> =C2
> =C2
> As we were walking back from Mani=
karnika Manish suddenly said, "There
is a foreigner lady who lives close to=
 Manikarnika, who has a lot of
desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan bu=
t does not know how to go
about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woma=
n to come and perform
these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible=
, unless she is a
Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people wou=
ld not be able
to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning,=
 when we
came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frai=
l,
looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to=

me that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation
at=
 the samshan. "She has desire, but directionless. " At that time there
was =
nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to
keep do=
ing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating
which is of n=
o good,=C2 so that you are ready when

=

> After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2 we stood and
obse=
rved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other
tourist, s=
pecially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck=C2 and
the=C2 tripod. M=
anish smiled and said let us not go too close to
Manikarnika, what if the d=

seeing us dressed as tourists=

the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2 d=
uring the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Ma=
nish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became =
silent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we meditated fo=
r sometime, Manish did=C2  pranam=C2 at the samadhi of Baba Bhagw=
an Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Ni=
rvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika =
Samshan.=C2  Manish, on being=C2 questioned, said that many sadha=
nas have been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane de=
sires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the As=
hram we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Ma=
nish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to Eng=
lish, it read, "If you have to give your head off to get a sadguru, you<BR>=
> have=C2 got it cheap".<BR>> =C2 <BR>> By 8 PM we sat f=
or dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time be=
fore going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while p=
erforming any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the bo=
dy is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digest=
s ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists i=
n the subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to=
 "digest" various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jath=
ara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremel=
y focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we=
 do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease=
 in Jathara Agni.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> As we sat eating our food and t=
alking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned=
 here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, A=
runisha and=C2 me) had before coming to Kasi. <BR>> =C2 <BR>&g=
t; Manish said, "It is the same set of=C2 souls who come back=C2 =
again and again in different bodies and personalities at different times, w=
ho=C2 are responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanaky=
a, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc."=
 He continued, "They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is n=
ecessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected=
 to this land=C2 which we call India=C2 today.This land is connec=
ted to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed=
.=C2 Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what hap=
pened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?".I silently cont=
emplated her fate.=C2 <BR>> =C2 <BR>> "One very senior Rish=
i has decided to=C2 change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so sh=
all it happen.=C2 Ved=C2 Dharma will be re established here along=
 the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an ind=
ividual or=C2 group,=C2 can stand against the will of a Rishi."=
=C2  Arunisha asked a pertinent question here. "What were the Rishis d=
oing for=C2 one thousand years?". Manish laughed and said, " A Rishi c=
an very well spend a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then sud=
denly=C2 one day=C2 wake up from meditation=C2 and see that =
Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2 and all sorts of non-spiritual things going on=
 here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi=
. You guys have no clue about=C2 what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is eno=
ugh to change a universe, changing a country is child's play for Him." Wow.=
 I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to kee=
p doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> As =
night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manikarnika again. Thi=
s was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We wa=
lked long the=C2 deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doi=
ng a=C2 homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2 yes why not,=
 but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie=
 is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest c=
onsciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind su=
ch that it can hold shakti=C2 for which=C2 worshipping the divine=
 Mother is the best way.=C2 That is why Vimalananda says, "Let the Mot=
her show you the face of the Father". The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Man=
ish said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala e=
xists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mah=
akala sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then staring at the pitch black ganges,=
 Manish chuckled lightly and<BR>> added, "That man was something." This =
was again an old conversation we had started=C2 before which Mainsh co=
ntinued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda wer=
e to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flo=
wing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has create=
d a army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books=C2 are like a Bible=
=C2 for sadhakas,=C2 arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I =
asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manis=
h replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the import=
ant question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent he=
aring this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda =
does mention that a time will come when his "children" would spread homas. =
Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. <BR>> =C2 =
<BR>> We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at th=
e same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. M=
ost of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, =
all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surp=
rise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=
 palm upwards=C2 and with the next ahuti=C2 immediately the =
fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=C2 the fla=
mes were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on t=
he samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was working=
 on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too =
responded back, "Jai Mahadev". This homa was faster. He did not use any "sa=
mputs", but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up an=
d stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make=
 them burn properly. I was<BR>> enjoying it. A few people came and sat n=
ear us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes =
in the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one h=
as any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom=
. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could=
 raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Ma=
nikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point menta=
lly wondering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said,=
 if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan s=
cared. But there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the =
night.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat=
 for meditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, the m=
editation that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my m=
ind would just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of the =
Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes=
 or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest m=
ovement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly=
 nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, "=
 I could have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had =
a flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of dea=
th. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back." Smiling he added, "Wh=
at a sight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can be le=
ft at will".=C2  I did not know what to say. <BR>> =C2 <BR>>=
; We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. T=
he torso had become black with deep=C2 red patches all over. The dom c=
ame forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2&nb=
sp;from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air a=
nd placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=
=C2 motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one e=
nd of the bamboo stick,=C2 into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me =
of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2 or vegetables, b=
oth dead -=C2 from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, =
"Maza aya?". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2 th=
at I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let people know=
.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> By this time I remembered that when I was sitti=
ng and doing the Chandi path, one dog=C2 had run off with one of my ch=
appals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Leave the other ch=
appal here as well." Manish said we had a rna with this samshan. We had bee=
n here before, in some life.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> As we were returning=
, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2 of Shiva's trishul=
 passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a "safe" samshan. Anyone =
who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva g=
uards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturbance inside t=
he samshan. That is also why there are people here even at 2 am in the morn=
ing. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions are genuine and=
 good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.<BR>> =C2 <BR=
>> While walking along the ghats=C2 which were=C2 totally dese=
rted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becomi=
ng loose, I caught hold of it=C2 with one=C2 hand and kept moving=
 fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got =
some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of =
heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of similar l=
evel as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of=
 the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too c=
lose to the water=C2 late in the nightt. There are things in the water=
. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection=
 of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba =
(I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 2=
4/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam =
around naked. It is their city.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Next morning, as =
we sat recollecting the previous night's homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=
=C2 Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=
=C2 Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must =
get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2 =
enquired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be=
 done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2 laughed =
and replied,=C2 "Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aat=
a!".=C2 I was dumbstruck.=C2 <BR>> =C2 <BR>> While tal=
king about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He=
 voice became slow and heavy,=C2 "The color of Rama's body is deep blu=
e with a golden tinge all=C2 around him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2&n=
bsp;was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two=

 had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2 mantra shakti he had acquired t=

efore my mails.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> <BR>> Caveat: A homa on a fune=
ral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2 sadhana, and it is not entirely risk f=
ree. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=C2 only someone who has a d=
irect agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone=
 who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (=
giving ahutis)=C2 I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by read=
ing this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. <BR>>=
; =C2 <BR>> <BR>> Many people have a negative=C2 bias towar=
ds Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or un=
derstanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in =
recent time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying =
them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue=
 what they are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconciev=
ed biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Sel=
f-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some=
 don't. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time ha=
ve a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual g=
iants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori.=
 The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. =
Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand =
objective=C2 account of how a<BR>> powerful sadhana in the samshan =
is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.<BR>> =C2 <BR>&=
gt; <BR>> There are many people in this age who have a desire for these =
sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue =
how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2 people tha=
t these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagi=
nation. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years a=
go. But to go about it and=C2 actually be able to do this sadhana, jus=
t like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep=
 doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=C2 and let N=
ature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience.=
 If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will o=
ne day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individual=
=C2 because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2 kind=
.=C2  In the intruduction to "Aghora - At the left hand of God", Vimal=
anada says :<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> "Publish this book after I am gone. =
Let people know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands=
 who may read it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn mor=
e, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as=
 She did for me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. T=
he progression will go on; there is nothing to fear".<BR>> Therefore hav=
e faith, do sadhana.=C2  <BR>> <BR>> =C2 <BR>> Back to t=
he narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish sai=
d it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on t=
his night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2 Past midnight we were walking =
towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen any=
where on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found =
a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, w=
ondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentall=
y chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smo=
oth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other=
 side who chased the dogs away.=C2 Without looking at me=C2 Manis=
h said, "Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=
 for your breeches".<BR>> =C2 <BR>> As we passed the Lalita Ghat=
 Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2 I did not think too much ab=
out it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of wha=
t is to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat fo=
r some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything=
 became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did=
 his tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical menta=
lly, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different gha=
t, however I did not say anything.=C2 Later on returning to Mumbai I s=
poke to someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed =
Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusi=
on, I am a confirmed idiot.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Back to midnight. We =
reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we d=
id not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable c=
hita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfu=
lly made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood =
exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There we=
re about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has n=
ot been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. The=
refore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my ri=
ght which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come=
 and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull lo=
oked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to t=
he other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2  but there is s=
omething else as well. I did not ask him what. So we<BR>> went to anothe=
r side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, "Baba,aap log=C2&nbs=
p;kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish indicated one at the end, t=
he dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to m=
ake space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but M=
anish said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There were many curious onlooker=
s, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instr=
ucting others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something=
 very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have object=
ed, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor=
 sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the dom=
es have either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families an=
d thus they do not disturb. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> The homa, as usual w=
as awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was v=
ery strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previou=
s night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this p=
yre. This was strange because=C2 there were at least ten pyres burning=
, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Do=
gs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This ho=
ma was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a =
certain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that=
 way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction =
or made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. =
At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense =
things which I=C2  - being such an=C2 ordinary person -=C2 o=
bviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2 I coul=
d hear<BR>> chants of "Ram Nam Satya Hai" and relatives wailing as new b=
odies were being brought in. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> Suddenly to my righ=
t there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. =
The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess=
 was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of=
 the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi =
was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=C2 the pages of =
the=C2 book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me=
.=C2 I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind m=
e. And the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look =
back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"=
-:).=C2  Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes =
to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=C2 It is =
not an imagination but reality and this can=C2 happen not just in a sa=
mshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.<BR>&g=
t; =C2 <BR>> While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut rol=
led off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes use to=
 stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2&nbs=
p;had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural =
stroking the pyre=C2 the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2 =
there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would ha=
ppily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarki=
na!=C2 Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one ext=
ra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understood wh=
y.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish cal=
led one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2 that =
the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2 they (r=
elatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. T=
he person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do no=
t worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying =
to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is going =
on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahs=
irwad leke hi jayenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and co=
ntinued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me t=
o observe the skin on the corpse=C2  I saw the skin on the face had ca=
ught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!<BR>> =C2 <BR>>=
 There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2 at the end to finsh t=
he fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water=
 on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at=
 the end they came to Manish and=C2 asked if they could pour some Gang=
es water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to=
 the fire, it won't die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but n=
othing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some =
more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, " Devi=C2 samne khadi =
hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/15 people came forward and reventi=
ally bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2 Manish's feet, bu=
t Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distrib=
uted some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very =
late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had a=
ddressed earlier) came<BR>> running with tears in his eyes asking for fo=
rgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worr=
y, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2  Later Manish sai=
d, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the man along=
 for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if =
he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2 who used to live in Kasi. M=
anish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, the pers=
on replied interior=C2 Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it=
 was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is wh=
at makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so aliv=
e. We city bred 'educated'=C2 people are too rational to understand th=
ese things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stoo=
d up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed onl=
y from my head to my heart, there was nothing<BR>> below, no legs, no st=
omach ,=C2 as if=C2 I was simply floating on thin=C2 air! I =
told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2 curt one word reply, "Goo=
d".<BR>> =C2 <BR>> =C2 <BR>> =C2 <BR>> As we wer=
e walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, "There is a foreigner=
 lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sa=
dhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her while=
 meditating." For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practically=
 difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great cali=
bre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said M=
anish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned ab=
ove), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Man=
ish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen last ni=
ght in his meditation at the samshan. "She has desire, but directionless. "=
 At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is=
 so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely con=
templating which is of no good,=C2 so that you are ready when<BR>> =
Nature decides to give you a push. <BR>> =C2 <BR>> After passing=
 the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2 we stood and observed Manikarnika=
 from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Ma=
nish's camera hanging from his neck=C2 and the=C2 tripod. Manish =
smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms re=
cognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wond=
ering what is going on.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> Thus ended my second day =
of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats=
 of Kashi.<BR>> =C2 <BR>> -Regards<BR>> Rajarshi<BR>> =C2&=
