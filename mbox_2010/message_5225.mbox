Namaskar,

> Thus, a person still afflicted by undesirable conditioning may=
 acquire enough purity to get some results.

    How much purity is enough =
and for what purpose ? Ravana brought the Shiva linga from Shiva himself, B=
aidyanath Jyotirlinga, whose sacredness is sufficient proof of purity of Ra=
vanas' sadhana and his success with mantras.

   There is a list of Ravanas=
' works:
http://www.ancientindianastrology.com/cmsa/index.php?option=3Dcom_=
content&view=3Darticle&id=3D99:ravanas-contributions&catid=3D31:general&Ite=
mid=3D70

   While Ravana is portrayed as a villain in an ethical sense tha=
n any other, he certainly wielded more power, by virtue of his knowledge of=
 Veda and Mantra, than all other characters in the story combined except Ha=
numaan who was Rudra Avatara and used all his divine powers to turn the fac=
e of war.

> But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in the end!

=
   Even the city of dwarkapuri fell after Krishna, and Krishna succumbed to=
 a mortal wound, but nobody decries his folly that led to this fall. Rama i=
s no different than parashurama - because on earth, a great person is one w=
ho subdues his enemies by force.

regards,
Aryama
