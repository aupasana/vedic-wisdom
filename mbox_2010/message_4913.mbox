Namaste,
 
It means "without kavacha, without argala stotra, without keelak=
a, without rahasya, without sookta, without dhyana, without nyasa and witho=
ut an archana, one gets the result of Durgapath with just Kunjika". Please =
note that the saptashati itself was not mentioned. In other words, Kunjika =
stotra is mentioned as an alternative for all other supplmenets (kavacha, a=
rgala, keelaka, ratri sooktam, nyasa, dhyana, devi sooktam and rahasyam and=
 a formal archana) and not to the main saptashati itself.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha
