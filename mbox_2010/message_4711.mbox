Dear Narasimha,

>When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul,=
 it can >become a trap.

Off late, i realised exactly this and even lost mu=
ch of interest in this *sensational* topic.

You said 2 good saints claimed=
 to be reincarnation of Ramakrishna. I have also read that and certainly it=
 adds to the confusion.

You have mentioned and Rajarshi has seconded the l=
ogic that none of the claimants of recent times have those close associates=
 of the caliber which can match those inner circle disciples of Ramakrishna=
. My doubt is that how do we know caliber of close associates of any saints=
, Sadhus, Babas etc?...

This is a very tricky field which has almost no sa=
tisfying answer. The Only answer can be found by realising by one self and =
even then one will not be sure if one is being deluded or not.

yours,

Utp=
al

 similar work or have much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to "re=

d Ravana in the biggest war of his times. Krishna was a key player in the b=
iggest war of his time, but did not take a weapon at all. The game can be d=
iffent in each coming..

hna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back after 100 years and t=

 Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a choice=
! Even Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, "I have to come back once more. =
The Master said I am to come back once more with him". When questioned "you=
 have to come back because Shri Ramakrishna says so", he replied, "souls li=
ke that have great power, Madam". On another occasion, Ramakrishna said tha=
t people would get liberated en masse during his next coming and that would=
 be the last opportunity for a long time to come.

> Interestingly, two =
good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna since then. One of=
 them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint suggested that she is=
 the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said that he identified =
a particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami Vivekananda. Ramakrish=
na was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty disciples of a very h=
igh caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly moulded the dire=
ction of spiritual India for the next century. None of the claimants of reb=
irthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the bill.

 whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X and Y are different and play a d=

> For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn a=
s Muslim emperor Akbar (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the ot=
her was a Muslim. However, both were very brave, unafraid of death, inheren=
tly spiritual, had a refined taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. Th=
e previous connections with rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised=
 when his mother was hiding at a rajput household, before moving to Delhi. =
Despite being a Muslim, he actually helped the Hindu causes (to the extent =
possible at that time) by putting an end to barbaric practices like killing=
 defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in conquered places. He promote=
d acceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage taxes on Hindus and even =
came up with his own religion of humanity towards the end of his life by in=
tegrating various religions. In one life, he tried to save India from invad=
ing barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured man amid barbarians a=
nd tried to save India by changing the ways of his own people. There is a s=
ubtle continuity in the agenda at a deeper level!
