Thanks a lot; I understood that it is to with the time; thanks for posting =
how many minutes each ghadia and vighadia is.
What does "rendu ghadiala nal=
abhai vighadialaku aaru vela hamsa japamu jarugunu" mean?  Just by breathin=
g (hamsa - uchvAsa and nisvAsa) will some one be able to realize the chakra=
s or the adhipathi at those chakras ?

Thanks again.

rAma
