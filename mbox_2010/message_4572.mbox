Dear Gopal Narayan,
                    My reply was specific to the questi=
on asked and was to help the person who asked the query.If it helps her, th=
at is enough. I dont want to get into any debate on what I have or have not=
 or may or may not have read or practiced.In any case, all this is meant to=
 be experienced and not understood..

As the Hathayoga pradipika(4th chapte=
r) says '.............as long as the mind does not assume the shape of the =
Divine without contemplation, all talk of wisdom and knowledge is like the =
rambling from imagination of a mad man'.

So while I remain in that state o=
f madness, it is not good for me to engage in debate and feed my ego.

By H=
er grace may all the divine upasakas attain siddhi.

Namaste
