 FOUR blind men went out to see an elephant. One touched the leg of the
ele=
phant and said, "The elephant is like a pillar." The second touched the
tru=
nk and said, "The elephant is like a thick club." The third touched the
bel=
ly and said, "The elephant is like a big jar." The fourth touched the
ears =
and said, "The elephant is like a big winnowing basket." Thus they
began to=
 dispute hotly amongst themselves as to the shape of the elephant.

A passe=
r-by, seeing them thus quarrelling, said,"What is it you are
disputing abou=
t?" They told him everything and asked him to arbitrate. The
man said: "Non=
e of you has seen the elephant. The elephant is not like a
pillar, its legs=
 are like pillars. It is not like a winnowing basket, its
ears are like win=
nowing baskets. It is not like a stout club, its trunk is
like a club. The =
elephant is the combination of all these=97legs, ears, belly,
trunk and so =
on."

In the same manner, those who quarrel (about the nature of God) have =
each
seen only some one aspect of the Deity.
