Namaste S

Truth needs to be experianced, again one needs grace of a Sadgur=
u who is self realized, other wise it is like one blind man showing way to =
another blind way.

Generally this happens when kundalini rises in a native=
 and after that
a sadhaka starts experiancing many interesting things.

"Ch=
it Vritti Niruttah" I thought was different Patanjali indicates this in yog=
a sutras and then further goes on to say "Gyanam Bandah"

"Chir Vritti Niru=
ttah' is controling the mind whether you have read books or not, in general=
 it applies to any state of mind.

all the knowledge accumated in mind with=
out true expieriance is the reason for bandhan". Knowledge needs to be expe=
rianced.

Unfortunately in the world we live neither we sadhaks are ready f=
or this nor we have readily available self realized master, who by showing =
mercy can give those type of initiations.

Best Regards
Mitesh

 you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that =
reference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you=

those actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very imp=

But you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don't =
you? In the previous example where one lost a job, won't one look for a new=
 job?

tely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you d=

 suffering) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you k=
now in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you u=
se your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order=
 to achieve the desired outcome. However, given that you don't know what go=
d willed and what will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desir=
ed outcome WILL happen. So do not cry later if it doesn't. Do the best you =
can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.

 emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up family and their=
 welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma you are doing now,=
 but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachment to a result =
does not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety regarding whethe=
r the desired result will happen or not will decrease one's focus and stop =
one from operating at one's best. Decide your actions based on a desired ou=
tcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may not be achieved=
 even though your actions seem at this point of time to be the best possibl=
e actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.

Spiritual progress essentially means realizing this and focusing the mind, =
its thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather than receiving. Eve=
n as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive some things. But =
exactly what they are is based on what you gave in the past, which is water=
 under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it now. This is true =
irrespective of whether you are attached to what you receive or not.
