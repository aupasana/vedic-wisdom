Namaste narasimha Rao ji 

What you have mentioned about not needing to und=
erstand Sanskrit text is interesting. I would like to narrate my experience=
 and hopefully you can help me out regarding what happened.

For nearly 2 y=
rs, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning, because I was not very flue=
nt, I would pay attention to the pages I was reading. As months passed by, =
I could chant without reading, I remembered it all in my head. What happene=
d as a result was that Rudram chanting no longer required any focus on my p=
art, I could be doing anything while chanting this and as a result, my chan=
ting began to lose focus. While chanting, my eyes would be paying attention=
 to other things...the view outside the window, the clock, ghee left in the=
 diya etc. My attention was everywhere else except on my chanting. I would =
try to chant with my eyes closed but because I was chanting aloud, doing th=
at was proving difficult...my eyes would keep opening and rover. I also not=
iced that because I didn't understand what I was chanting, concentrating be=
came even more difficult.

Today, I am no longer doing that chanting. I sto=
pped doing that several months ago and Iam afraid that the skill I had mast=
ered in chanting is slowly getting lost....

I repeated the same with Durga=
 suktam. While I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chanting. =
As I became fluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue what =
I was chanting.

My sadhana is more simple now, consisting of mental mantra=
 recitation but to me, it feels much more better doing that than chanting s=
omething I do not understand.

After reading your message, I am wondering w=
hy the words of rishis, the Rudram or the Suktam did not translate into ene=
rgy for me. Please do not misunderstand, I am not trying to question you, I=
 am just trying to find an answer to something that keeps troubling me.

Th=
anks,
Bhupendra

 The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one's attitude and =
what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be car=
eful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a par=
ticular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not =
many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specific=
 material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints ar=

Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic path is f=
or self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path ma=
y chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for long=
evity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substa=
nce in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that "all is Brahman" an=
d to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.

humbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, you ne=

n the current context of this question I will restrict myself to only the f=

ual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths o=
f the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and tec=
hniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experienti=
al level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employ=
ed by each of these paths.
> > > > For those who are predominantly oriented=
 to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessar=
y, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genui=
ne teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Di=
scernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmi=
nation of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhya=
ya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=
e practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for extern=
al practices.
> > > > 
> > > > Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching=
 by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). H=
indu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting o=
neself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yo=
gamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.
>=
 > > > 
> > > > Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional accep=
tance of Iswara's will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contr=
ary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad G=
ita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay =
of Karma marga of the Gita.
> > > > 
> > > > Finally I will address the Tan=
tric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiat=
ion and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the=
 practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda thro=
ugh the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any l=
ab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should=
 be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at v=
arious levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here =
is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one p=
ath invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, =
another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yag=
nya and so on.
> > > > 
> > > > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with=
 the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra =
employs highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays =
great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about =
qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any =
supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like =
any other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the pro=
cedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment to=
o. However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awak=
ening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Ku=
ndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will=
 refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other=
 needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru paramp=
ara.
> > > > 
> > > > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to=
 contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is o=
ne major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the =
entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three maj=
or schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidya=
s- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kaliku=
la whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture mo=

To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to th=
e the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook=
 as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.
> > > > 
> > > >=
 Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at al=
l) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milesto=
nes in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, et=
c are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for=
 each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the =
practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The G=
uru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the =
root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs sp=
read out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a beauti=
ful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can =
use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiat=
ion not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity=
 but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at ea=
ch point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series =
of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself. It=
 is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri S=
ri Chandi.
> > > >

 Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated approach t=

pproaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi =
seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fled=

relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the tex=

e esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my =
write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri =
Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its =
central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text=
 is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanis=
hadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alone exist in th=
is universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it with the oth=
er Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita=
.
> > > > 
> > > > The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English=
 or any other regional language is because understanding the meaning and co=

 language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to ex=
plore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obvious sta=
tus as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Srut=
i just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard all t=
he applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible wi=
th Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is a=
cquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify that Ya=
gnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha=
 in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on one mappin=
g of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.

in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Ta=

a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a bank account =
in a son's name with a starting balance of one million dollars. Similarly, =
a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disci=
ple. However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank =
account with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one's own hard w=
ork. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous man=
tras and build one's own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate =
you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise,=
 just go ahead and do it.

ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the =

there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilize=
d the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantr=
as and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever material res=
ults god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do=
 rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or others o=
r society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements for one to ge=
t correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start w=
ith the attitude of (ii).

> > > > > >

owly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but th=
ere may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a p=
erson is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garb=
age and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is=
 gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floo=
r will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and ther=
e may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit st=

our karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw=
 them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spilla=
ge. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to =
get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity li=
ke Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the =
good fruit comes out faster.

 Without sadhana, you would've had to eat each of those rotten fruits befor=
e eating the good fruits!
> > > > > >
> > > > > > Nevertheless, one unable =
to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce=
 deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if =
made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. I=
f you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some =
bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actio=
ns and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hear=
ted, stick to gentler deities.

      <p>Namaste friends,<br>
 <br>
I w=
ill give my 2 cents on a few points.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br=
>
I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu i=
n poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to=
 read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can read =
the Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.=
 He asked me, "who do you think you are?" He said that it could be consider=
ed later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.<br>
 <br>
Please no=
te that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras an=
d prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. The=
y are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouse=
s of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the p=
ast.<br>
 <br>
An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right =
mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra=
 that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.<br>
 <br>
I=
n fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can =
be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person=
 that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not w=
orrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras c=
oming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 =
<br>
If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman ma=
y read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the bal=
l from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of t=
he ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and wh=
en to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good bat=
sman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some ba=
sic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is mor=
e important than bookish knowledge.<br>
 <br>
Similarly, some conceptual un=
derstanding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is m=
ore important.<br>
 <br>
The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sa=
dhanas, all paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions=
 that we are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of u=
s. The divine acts through each being based on one's conditioning and gives=
 corresponding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes th=
e notions of "I am doing", "this is mine", "I like this and I dislike that"=
 etc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one ma=
y be deluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this=
 understanding fully and overcome the instincts of "I am doing", "this is m=
ine" etc.<br>
 <br>
So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not in=
tellectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of script=
ures is at the back of one's mind, one is constantly contemplating and watc=
hing over one's own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thought=
s, one's sadhana will yield results.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br=
>
This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scri=
ptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or =
virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a =
theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of o=
ne's instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.<br>
 <br>
On=
e doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what a=
nd what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead =
of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical =
understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mounta=
in, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.<br>
 <br>
*  =
      *        *<br>
 <br>
Regarding the statement that initiation is impor=
tant in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.<br>
 =
<br>
Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a=
 continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.<br>
 =
<br>
The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one's attitude =
and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be=
 careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a=
 particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and =
not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for spec=
ific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraint=
s are fewer and options more.<br>
 <br>
Some may sub-consciously have a not=
ion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic =
path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedi=
c path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam=
 for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gro=
ss substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that "all is Br=
ahman" and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.<br>
 <br>
*=
        *        *<br>
 <br>
My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a=
 specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which n=
ot many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progres=
s and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana withou=
t initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mi=
nded people.<br>
 <br>
After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need c=
lear and precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to=
 north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervis=
ion helps there too, but you can do without it!<br>

one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolut=

 the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana =
as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.<br>

thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus aris=
es the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context th=
ere are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question=
 I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussio=
n.<br>

can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. Th=

 Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the =
Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular s=
elf-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices in=
volve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for external practices.<=
br>
> > > <br>

coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attach=
ment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (ori=

ls of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwar=
avada.<br>

hana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the nec=
essity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of ce=
rtain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of V=
ak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and there=
by certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that exc=
ept Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bh=
akti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni=
-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the=
 fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of aus=
terity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.<br>
>=
 > > <br>
> > > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with =
the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra e=
mploys highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays g=
reat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=
ualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=
upervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=
ny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=
edure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=
.  However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awak=
ening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Ku=
ndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will=
 refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other=
 needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru paramp=
ara.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Since we are talking about Sri =
Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context t=
oo. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha =
Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there =
are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions am=
ong the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sad=

dhana.<br>
> > > <br>

okes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantl=

journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a pa=
rticular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages.=
 Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular=
 spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared =
to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk aris=
es. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downwar=

lise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. I=
t is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the ci=
rcuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circ=
uit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tre=
e of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent=
 practice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light=
 (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.<br>

eric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my write-=
up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi=
 provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its centra=
l message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is th=
e Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic =
fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alone exist in this uni=
verse. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it with the other Mah=
avakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.<br>

> > > <br>
> > > The reason I advised the non-initiate to=
 read in English or any other regional language is because understanding th=
e meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly rea=
ds the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the=
 writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart fro=
m its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally=
 regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In =
that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are eq=
ually possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*=
. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway=
 identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worsh=
ip of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a =
one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.<br>
> &g=
t; > <br>

ntegral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approac=
h, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as=
 per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation=
 as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the V=
edantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairag=
ya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred My=
th. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predom=
inantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all o=
f these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that =
the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as =
practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace =
themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those=
 paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.<br>

ods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswaraprani=
dhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all eff=
ective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., som=
e of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. O=

life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves M=

ally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATS=
ANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular se=
lf-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the tex=
ts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As f=
or SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya i=
s the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not poss=
ible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid pr=
ogress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state b=
y virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhu=
s and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  =
made a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsan=
gha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.<br>

Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:<br>

UOTE  // "There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no g=

 supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at o=
nce. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you w=
ill find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, you=
r mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for hig=
her divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly ta=
lks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame.=
 And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.'... Make yourself a des=

you to sublime heights. These "oversouls" or high souls are waiting to get =
