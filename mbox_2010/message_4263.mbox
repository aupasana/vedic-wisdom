 6th March, 1949

One afternoon, the attendants brought in sweetmeats, give=
n in large
quantities to the Ashram by devotees, and sought permission of B=
hagavan to
distribute them amongst the people in the hall as there were lot=
s of them
and it would be difficult to dispose of them otherwise.

Just the=
n an old woman arrived,feeling her way with the aid of a walking
stick, and=
 brought with her two or three dosais (pancakes) enclosed in a
banyanleaf b=
owl. As soon as she entered the hall, she went straight to
Bhagavan and of =
her own accord said, =E2=80=9CSwami,take these dosais. I am sorry, I
had no=
thing better to bring.=E2=80=9D

So saying, she tried to hand them over to =
Bhagavan direct.People nearby
tried to prevent her from doing so by saying,=
=E2=80=9CPlease put them somewhere
else.=E2=80=9D She got angry and said,=
=E2=80=9CYou had better keep quiet. Who are you to
tell me? You have all co=
me here yesterday or the day before. What do you
know? Was it not I that go=
t this platform built for Swami and made him sit
here? You say I should not=
 go near him.

Enough, enough.=E2=80=9D All were taken aback by her authori=
tative attitude.
Bhagavan stretched out his hand and accepted her offerings=
 with the greatest
kindness, saying, =E2=80=9CGrandma, they are little chil=
dren, who do not know what
is what. Please do not take it otherwise. With w=
hat flour did you prepare
these dosais? Are none of your brother=E2=80=99s =
sons looking after you properly?
How are you able to maintain yourself? Did=
 you come walking, or in a cart?=E2=80=9D

Thus enquiring about her welfare=
, Bhagavan began eating the dosais. They
were not properly roasted but he a=
te them with great relish as if they were
equal to nectar.

The old woman s=
at there overwhelmed with joy and unimaginable happiness.
Bhagavan afterwar=
ds asked for some sweetmeats, took a little of each
variety, said that was =
enough for him and instructed his attendants to
distribute the rest amongst=
 themselves and the people there, giving the rest
of his share to the old w=
oman.

She got up, prostrated before Bhagavan, took her share of the sweetm=
eats as
prasadam and left saying, =E2=80=9CWhat does it matter how others l=
ook after me,
Swami? By your grace I am selling dosais and making a living =
out of the
business. It is enough if I could pass the rest of my life thus.=
=E2=80=9D

After she left, the attendants asked, =E2=80=9CInstead of eating=
 those dosais which
are not properly roasted, why not give them to us and e=
at the sweets?=E2=80=9D Bhagavan
said, =E2=80=9COh! Those sweets, you think=
, will be much more tasty than these
dosais? If you want, you eat all the s=
weets. These dosais are enough for
me.=E2=80=9D The attendants could say no=
 more.

Looking at me, Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CPoor old woman, what can she=
 do? She brought
what she had. When I was on the hill, she and her husband =
used to come to
me. She used to bring me something to eat now and then. Aft=
er her husband
passed away, she lived with her brother. Even he passed away=
.

As her brother=E2=80=99s sons did not look after her properly and turned=
 her out,
she has been staying somewhere else and has been living by sellin=
g dosais it
seems. It is she that had a platform constructed near Mother=E2=
=80=99s Samadhi where
I used to sit and had it covered by palm leaves.

Til=
l then, I used to sit under a tree. =E2=80=98Aye! Swami is sitting on the f=
loor
and is exposed to the sun!=E2=80=99 So saying, she got the platform bu=
ilt. It is her
brother=E2=80=99s son that has repaired Draupadamma=E2=80=99=
s temple.

Having grown old, she does not come here often. See how she has =
come here
all this distance, with great effort, helped by the walking stick=
!=E2=80=9D He ate
all the dosais without leaving even a crumb.
