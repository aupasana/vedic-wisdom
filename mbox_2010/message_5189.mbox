Dear All,


I came across some=A0references by some indologists say that co=
w sacrfice and/or 
beef eating was prevalant in ancient=A0India. Obviously =
this sounds incorrect, but 
I will still provide the references here for di=
scussion.

The verse quoted here is from Vyaasa Mahabharata, Book 3 (BOOK O=

3-199-6, 3-199-7, 3-199-8, Sanskrit Verse

English gist
In old days 20=
00 cattle used be killed in the court of Ranti Deva. Everyday he

King and 
Brahmins when the animals are killed in a sacrifice.
