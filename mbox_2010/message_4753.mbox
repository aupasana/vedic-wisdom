] Seek Guidance on Devi Mahatmyam










        

















Dear =
Narayana, namaste.
 
Please find below some lines on Devi Mahatmyam (aka Ch=
andi Path, Durga Saptashati)written by the Guru who taught me this procedur=
e. There is a seven part procedure (saptaha) butone can read it in 3 parts =
on 3 days: Chaps 1-4, Chap 5 - 10, Chaps 11 - 13. In addition, Narasimha ha=
s written a elaborate note on this in the same forum; you can find it from =
the archives.

 
best regards
Hari 
|Om Gurave Namah|
|Om Saraswataye Namah=
|
 
A very good account and explanation of Saptashati has been presented by=
 Sri Narasimha. The deeper meaning is something very thought provoking. Whi=
le I agree to all that is given, I wish to add a few things which were taug=
ht and told to me by my late father Pandita Shastri Gita Ram, who was an ar=
dent believer in the shakti of Chandi and was a learned man in vedas, shast=
ras and puranas (he studied at Lahore). 

 
1. He always addressed the sapt=
ashati as Bhagavati which as per the Vaikritika Rahasyam (1st shloka) is th=
e satvika rupa of the Goddess. The other rupas are triguni (chandi rupa) an=
d tamasi (Durga rupa). 
 
2. For general well being, it is always better to=
 concentrate on satvika rupa. However other rupas have their own significan=
ce.

 
3. Chandi patha is chanting of triguni rupa and must be done with du=
e procedure as given below, particularly for shanti karma:
          (a) Sh=
apodhara - Beeja mantra 7 times
          (b) Utkeelna - 21 times

        =
  (c) Kavach patha
          (d) Argala stotram
          (e) Keelkam
     =
     (f) Tantrokte Ratri Suklam
          (g) Navarna (Dhyana, nyasa, japa =
(108))
          (h) Patha (1st to 13th chapter)

          (i) Navarna (Dh=
yana, nyasa, japa (108))
          (j) Devi suklam
          (k) Rahasya tr=
ayam - Pradhamtrau Rahasyam, Vaikritika Rahasyam, Murty Rahasyam
          =
(l) Shapdhara - 7 times
          (m) Utkeelna - 21 times

 
4. The above p=
rocedure is one chandipatha.
 
5. Done 9 times, it is Nav chandi; done 100 =
times, it is shat chandi; done 1000 times it is sahasrara chandi.
 
6. On c=
ompletion of the patha (9, 100 or 1000 times as the case may be), the follo=
wing be performed

       (a) Homam 1/10th of patha (1, 10, 100 patha with =
every shatoka)
       (b) Tarpana 1/10th of homam
       (c) Marjanam 1/10t=
h of tarpana
      (d) Brahmana bhoga 1/10th of marjana
 
7. A a regular ro=
utine (without elaborate procedure), saptashati may be chanted as under:

 =
   
   (a) if sufficient time (1.5 - 2 hours) - full patha (1 to 13 chapter=
s)
   (b) if less time ( < 1 hour) - 1st adhyaya & 3rd adhyaya
   (c) if ve=
ry less time (1/2 hour) - Madhyama adhyaya (2nd chapter)

 
8. Every shloka=
 of saptashati is to be treated as mantra
 
9. Chandipatha is the ultimate =
remedy in shanti karma
 
||saptajanmarjite ghore brahmhatyasame api patha m=
atren mantranam uchyate savekilvishe||

 
" sanchita papakarma from last se=
ven births (even if like brahmahatya) can be remedied by chandipath mantra"=

Tamoguna Mahakali - Dasabhuja/dasavaktra (10 arms/organs=

Triguna Mahalakshmi - Astadasabhuja (18 arms)

Satviki Mahasaraswati - As=

All above with respective aayudhas as explained in Vaikr=
itika Rahasyam.
 
11. I have lot of other information for which I shall rev=
ert later.
