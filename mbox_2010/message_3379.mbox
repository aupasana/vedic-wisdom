Dear Utpal,
=A0
Realization comes in many levels. I will broadly classify i=
t in 3 groups:
=A0
(1) Dual Realization: One can experience closeness to de=
ities, oneness to deities etc and realize aspects of Self from a dual persp=
ective.
=A0
(2) Non-dual Realization: One can merge in non-dual Self. This =
is Nirvikalpa samadhi.
=A0
When one goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may eit=
her come back and deal with duality again or merge in it forever. If it is =
the latter, that (i.e. realization of non-dual Self) is the "final realizat=
ion" for *that being*.
=A0
(3) Realization of Non-difference between Dualit=
y and Non-duality: This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality=
 after merging in non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality=
 is the simple underlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is imp=
erceptible and reached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is percep=
tible, but its challenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued thr=
ough an I-ness and its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive and realizing th=
e oneness of the two is an infinite process with no single event signaling =
a "perfect" realization. Rishis and deities are pursuing it constantly.
=A0=

When some gods or rishis are back on earth, they may come back to duality =
after Nirvikalpa samadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of duality or=
 non-dual Self. When some other classes of beings reach Nirvikalpa samadhi,=
 they do not come back. As Ramakrishna says, this is like a salt doll that =
goes to survey the depth of the ocean merging in ocean before reaching the =
ocean bed.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
One cann=
ot question why some characters in one's dream last for the entire dream an=
d some characters last a short time. It is the prerogative of the dreamer. =
Similarly, we are all dream objects in Supreme Cosmic Being's long dream ca=
lled Creation and we cannot question why some beings are meant to merge in =
non-dual self and some are meant to last further.
=A0
When Adwaita teaches =
the universe is unreal, it is correct. We are just dream characters. But th=
en, it is also correct that different dream characters have different roles=
 to play *within* the dream. Some take part in the dream till the end knowi=
ng it is a dream. Some exit the dream once they realize it is immaterial. S=
ome take part in the dream without knowing it is a dream and become quite w=
orried. And so on.
=A0

Narasimha

 There are various types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadh=
is have been classified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been br=
oadly categorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or =
qualities and samadhis without attributes or qualities.

th Isha Yoga, people go into different types of samadhis. Here it is common=
 to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain state=
 of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond its normal function of discr=
imination. This, in turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi st=
ates, one becomes loose inside the body or there is a space between what is=
 you and your body. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significanc=
e in terms of Realization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does not=
 mean you are released from Existence. It is just a new level of experience=
.

 are a way of getting high without any external chemicals. Now, by going in=

vikalpa, we always keep them in protected states as their contact with the =
body has become very minimal. The smallest disturbance, like a sound or a p=
inprick would dislodge them from their body. These states are maintained fo=
r certain periods to establish the distinction between you and the body. It=
 is a significant step in one's spiritual evolution, but still not the Ulti=

<table cellspacing=3D"0" cellpadding=3D"0" border=3D"0" ><tr><td valign=3D"=
top" style=3D"font: inherit;">Dear Utpal,<br> <br>Realization comes in=
 many levels. I will broadly classify it in 3 groups:<br> <br>(1) Dual=
 Realization: One can experience closeness to deities, oneness to deities e=
tc and realize aspects of Self from a dual perspective.<br> <br>(2) No=
n-dual Realization: One can merge in non-dual Self. This is Nirvikalpa sama=
dhi.<br> <br>When one goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may either come =
back and deal with duality again or merge in it forever. If it is the latte=
r, that (i.e. realization of non-dual Self) is the "final realization" for =
*that being*.<br> <br>(3) Realization of Non-difference between Dualit=
y and Non-duality: This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality=
 after merging in non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality=
 is the simple underlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is
 im=
perceptible and reached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is perce=
ptible, but its challenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued th=
rough an I-ness and its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive and realizing t=
he oneness of the two is an infinite process with no single event signaling=
 a "perfect" realization. Rishis and deities are pursuing it constantly.<br=
> <br>When some gods or rishis are back on earth, they may come back t=
o duality after Nirvikalpa samadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of =
duality or non-dual Self. When some other classes of beings reach Nirvikalp=
a samadhi, they do not come back. As Ramakrishna says, this is like a salt =
doll that goes to survey the depth of the ocean merging in ocean before rea=
ching the ocean bed.<br> <br>*      &nbs=
p; *        *<br> <br>One cannot qu=
estion why some characters in one's dream last for the entire
 dream and so=
me characters last a short time. It is the prerogative of the dreamer. Simi=
larly, we are all dream objects in Supreme Cosmic Being's long dream called=
 Creation and we cannot question why some beings are meant to merge in non-=
dual self and some are meant to last further.<br> <br>When Adwaita tea=
ches the universe is unreal, it is correct. We are just dream characters. B=
ut then, it is also correct that different dream characters have different =
roles to play *within* the dream. Some take part in the dream till the end =
knowing it is a dream. Some exit the dream once they realize it is immateri=
al. Some take part in the dream without knowing it is a dream and become qu=
ite worried. And so on.<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>--------=
