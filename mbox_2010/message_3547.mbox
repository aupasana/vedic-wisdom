ist - Part 3

   
CHAPTER VI

Of inordinate affections

Whensoever a man de=
sireth aught above measure, immediately he
becometh restless.  The proud an=
d the avaricious man are never
at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart a=
bide in the
multitude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self=
,
is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters.
It is har=
d for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part
carnal and inclined to t=
he pleasures of sense, to withdraw
himself altogether from earthly desires.=
  And therefore, when he
withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, a=
nd easily
angered too if any oppose his will.

2. But if, on the other hand=
, he yield to his inclination,
immediately he is weighed down by the condem=
nation of his
conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet=
 in
no way attained the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of
heart =
is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it.
And therefore t=
here is no peace in the heart of a man who is
carnal, nor in him who is giv=
en up to the things that are without
him, but only in him who is fervent to=
wards God and living the
life of the Spirit.

CHAPTER VII

Of fleeing from =
vain hope and pride

Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in =
men or in
any created Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others
fo=
r the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this
life.  Rest not=
 upon thyself, but build thy hope in God.  Do what
lieth in thy power, and =
God will help thy good intent. Trust not
in thy learning, nor in the clever=
ness of any that lives, but
rather trust in the favour of God, who resistet=
h the proud and
giveth grace to the humble.

2. Boast not thyself in thy ri=
ches if thou hast them, nor in thy
friends if they be powerful, but in God,=
 who giveth all things,
and in addition to all things desireth to give even=
 Himself.  Be
not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for =
with
only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain
of t=
hy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from
whom cometh every =
good gift which we have.

3. Count not thyself better than others, lest per=
chance thou
appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  =
Be
not proud of thy good works, for God's judgments are of another
sort tha=
n the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes
displeasing to Hi=
m.  If thou hast any good, believe that others
have more, and so thou mayes=
t preserve thy humility. It is no
harm to thee if thou place thyself below =
all others; but it is
great harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Pea=
ce is ever
with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is
envy=
 and continual wrath.

CHAPTER VIII

Of the danger of too much familiarity
=

Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise
and feare=
th God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers.  Be
not a flatterer of=
 the rich; nor willingly seek the society of
the great.  Let thy company be=
 the humble and the simple, the
devout and the gentle, and let thy discours=
e be concerning things
which edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but co=
mmend all good
women alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His=

Angels only, and flee from the notice of men.

2. We must love all men, bu=
t not make close companions of all.
It sometimes falleth out that one who i=
s unknown to us is highly
regarded through good report of him, whose actual=
 person is
nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes
th=
ink to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease
them the more=
 by the faultiness of character which they perceive
in us.

CHAPTER IX

Of =
obedience and subjection

It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, =
to be under
authority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it =
to
live in subjection than in a place of authority.  Many are in
obedience =
from necessity rather than from love; these take it
amiss, and repine for s=
mall cause.  Nor will they gain freedom of
spirit, unless with all their he=
art they submit themselves for
the love of God.  Though thou run hither and=
 thither, thou wilt
not find peace, save in humble subjection to the author=
ity of him
who is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them
h=
ave deceived many.

2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his ow=
n bent,
and is the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if
Chris=
t is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes
yield up our own op=
inion for the sake of peace.  Who is so wise
as to have perfect knowledge o=
f all things?  Therefore trust not
too much to thine own opinion, but be re=
ady also to hear the
opinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good,=
 yet if for
the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of anothe=
r,
thou shalt the more profit thereby.

3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is=
 safer to hearken and to
receive counsel than to give it.  It may also come=
 to pass that
each opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others =
when
reason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or
wilfulness.

CH=
APTER X

Of the danger of superfluity of words

Avoid as far as thou canst =
the tumult of men; for talk concerning
worldly things, though it be innocen=
tly undertaken, is a
hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled b=
y vanity.
Many a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone
amo=
ngst men.  But why do we talk and gossip so continually,
seeing that we so =
rarely resume our silence without some hurt
done to our conscience?  We lik=
e talking so much because we hope
by our conversations to gain some mutual =
comfort, and because we
seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of t=
houghts.  And
we very willingly talk and think of those things which we lov=
e or
desire, or else of those which we most dislike.

2. But alas! it is of=
ten to no purpose and in vain.  For this
outward consolation is no small hi=
ndrance to the inner comfort
which cometh from God.  Therefore must we watc=
h and pray that
time pass not idly away.  If it be right and desirable for =
thee
to speak, speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and
negl=
ect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of
watching over our l=
ips.  Nevertheless, devout conversation on
spiritual things helpeth not a l=
ittle to spiritual progress, most
of all where those of kindred mind and sp=
irit find their ground
of fellowship in God.
