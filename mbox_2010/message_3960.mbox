Sri Oruganti Ramachandraiah, was the son of Oruganti Venkata Subbaiah, of
K=
avali, Andhra Pradesh.

Subbaiah and his wife were great freedom fighters a=
nd they had gone to jail
many times.As a young boy Ramachandraiah shouted a=
nti-British slogans on the
streets and was kept in minor's jail! He was stu=
dying B.A. Hons. in Andhra
University and at that time he was falsely impli=
cated in the famous Kakinada
Bomb and he was running between courts and jai=
ls for three years, after
which he was acquitted.However,he pursued his B.A=
. Hons and came first in
the University.After education, he could not find =
a job,since no one was
eager to take him because of his past history.At las=
t he joined Birla Trust
School in Pilani as a teacher of history.However, t=
hings turned well
afterwards and he was a lecturer and later the Head of De=
pt. of History and
Archeology in Andhra University.He has contributed in th=
e team of
investigators of Harappan civilization.

The marriage was another=
 turning point in his life.He was married to
Kamakshi,the daughter of the f=
amous compiler of Talks, Munagala
Venkatramaiah with Bhagavan Ramana's cons=
ent.The couple moved to
Tiruvannamalai after Ramachandraiah's retirement,in=
 1972.Throughout their
lives, they stood closely devoted to Ramana and Rama=
na devotees. Kamakshi
was given the mantra "Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya =
Namah" by Bhagavan
Himself in a piece of paper,in 1940s.

Kamakshi's health=
 later deteriorated and she was diagonized to have bone
cancer. On seeing h=
er condition Sri V. Sundara Ramanan of the Asramam said
with flowing tears:=
 "O Auntie! why has Bhagavan let you down like this?"
Eyes flashing and wit=
h sudden energy flowing Kamakshi responded: "How dare
you say Bhagavan has =
at any time failed to take care of me?" She passed away
after sometime.

Ka=
makshi almost raised her hand to slap the present president when she was
in=
 her death-bed.This was told to me by the president himself during my last
=
visit to the ashram.He added that she was a brave lady and how she used to
=
command everyone in ashram to do their work.

Kamakshi though not well qual=
ified in academics knew much about veda
mantras.She visited temples in chol=
avandan the temple priests used to shiver
since she would openly reprimand =
them if they went wrong.

Ramachandraiah continued to live in Tiruvannamala=
i. Mr. Dwarakanatha Reddy's
daughter Sandhya, who was herself a child-frien=
d of Bhagavan became his
spiritual daughter and she was taking care of him,=
 when Ramachandraiah took
ill. In 1994, he was admitted to Rangammal Hospit=
al in Tiruvannamalai.While
opening the door of the room,Sandhya on seeing t=
he Hill, said: "Ayya,
Arunachala is behind you!" Ramachandraiah said in ten=
der voice,"Amma,
Arunachala has always been behind me!" He passed away late=
r.

Ramachandraiah has done a pure Telugu translation of Talks.He has also
=
rendered in Telugu, Sri Ramana Stuti Panchakam, Maha Yoga and Guru Ramana
V=
achana Mala.Incidentally Oruganti Krishnayya author of Telugu Sri Ramana
Le=
ela, is his brother!

Sri Ramachandriah garu house which is like an asram a=
nd he used to tell his
personal experiences with Bhagawan and he wrote many=
 poems on Bhagawan and
he used to tell the meaning of those to some of us.H=
e left the body without
much pain and he is fully conscious while dying.Pas=
t president of
Ramanasramam Sri T.N.Venkata Raman used to invite him for lu=
nch by saying
"Alludu garu randi" in Telugu which means respected son-in-la=
w,kindly come
and have your meal because he is considered son-in-law of asr=
am because it
is Bhagawan who fixed the marriage for him and Bhagawan atten=
ded the
marriage and stayed till the function is over.Ramachadriah is a luc=
ky soul
having direct connection with Bhagawan.
