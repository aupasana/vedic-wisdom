ssarily mean other person is not right.



My views are there on this subje=
ct in archives. I wanted to stay away but still inspired to write at least =
one message on the same.



1) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so man=
y of researches and plenty of informations available on the Internet, One w=
ill never be able to come to a definitive conclusions.



2) I never argue =
with people (even when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea of ve=
getarian food) with the above basis.

Whatever said and done, people will c=
ontinue eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as =
well. I have, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing=
 with people giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, =
own sets of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.



3) Instead =
I appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topic comes=
 up, only one simple thing - "I dont want to kill for filling up my Stomach=
" and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on your o=
wn Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now realize the =
Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., Suf=
focate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few seconds, h=
ow you pent for the Air and Now realize the "Chhatpataahat" of a fish force=
d out of water.



And all these, because one wish to fill the stomach or s=
atisfy cravings of a habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians have their c=
ravings of spice and other food stuff but the very vital difference is that=
 such craving does not need killing!



4) Just to give a result, One of co=
lleagues, who is a Srilankan, has left eating meat since 6 Months now and s=
urely, one of the reasons for his leaving meat is because I told my views h=
im a few times when such discussions came up and I even told him that you a=
re a Buddhist, the religion of Non-Injury and see what has happened to that=
 very Idea. Hats-off to him for he really seems to have thought about it an=
d dared to change his swabhava which is so very difficult.

Just to clarify=
, I do not hesitate to express my views even to Muslims and others and at l=
east, this idea is appreciated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core me=
at eaters are also taken a back with this idea. All though they know from t=
heir hearts of hearts, it comes as a shock even to them when somebody boldl=
y brings that up. Most of us are like a cat that drinks the milk with close=
d eyes. The Idea would have gone in their mind and that is enough. One day =
probably it will germinate.



5) Finally, The point is not to say that thi=
s side is good and that side is bad. It'll be a foolish and unpalatable con=
clusion. It is to just appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to=
 appeal the rational Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the hea=
rt of a person and if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then =
a final reminder of "Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma" at least to=
 those of us who believe in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the f=
inal Idea.



Best Regards,



Utpal

, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram soyabean, pu=

 again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which=
 support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of  halfbaked researches. b=
ut if we think scientifically we will find that for different sources diffe=

ding milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for pr=
oteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we c=
an not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans=
 can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree wi=
th the values given by Rajarshi ji.

> 

> Yes, I agree Non veg food increa=
ses tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian food, although les=
s but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Na=
rasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, less energy is av=
ailable for brain. it is a scietific fact that after food, significant bloo=
d supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee,=
 coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. S=

2) I never argue with people (even when I was aggressive and passionate=
 about the Idea of vegetarian food) with the above basis.<br>
Whatever said=
 and done, people will continue eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and =
probably Human flash as well. I have, with experience, understood that ther=
e is no point in arguing with people giving various Data. Each side will ha=
ve their own arguments, own sets of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove the=
ir point.<br>
<br>
3) Instead I appeal their conscious! I tell people aroun=
d me, whenever the Topic comes up, only one simple thing - "I dont want to =
kill for filling up my Stomach" and I say it from my heart. I tell people t=
hat Put a knife edge on your own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel=
 the pain and now realize the Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a =
cow or a buffalo or a...., Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth a=
nd see after only a few seconds, how you pent for the Air and Now realize t=
he "Chhatpataahat" of a fish forced out of water.<br>
<br>
And all these, b=
ecause one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a habitual palat=
e or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other food stu=
ff but the very vital difference is that such craving does not need killing=
!<br>
<br>
4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan,=
 has left eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for=
 his leaving meat is because I told my views him a few times when such disc=
ussions came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion o=
f Non-Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him f=
or he really seems to have thought about it and dared to change his swabhav=
a which is so very difficult.<br>
Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to exp=
ress my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea is appreci=
ated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are also taken a=
 back with this idea. All though they know from their hearts of hearts, it =
comes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up. Most of =
us are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea would hav=
e gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will germinate=
.<br>
<br>
5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and t=
hat side is bad. It'll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to ju=
st appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the rational=
 Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and i=
f that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of =
"Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma" at least to those of us who bel=
ieve in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.<br>

; By 'Practically impossible' I meant the cost factor and demand/supply fac=

 people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by=
 Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (=
including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nut=
