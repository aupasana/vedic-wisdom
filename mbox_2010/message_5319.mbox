Namaskar,
   The aim of my mails is only to free the minds of the reader fr=
om biases, caused by dominating propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see t=
he Physical body as something to be ignored for spiritual pursuit.  Consequ=
ently, Vedantists themselves never found out the truth about the Physical b=
ody consciousness as an expression of divine consciousness. The Bhagavad Gi=
ta, is a text, not from a Vedic Rishi, but a Vedantist Vishnu Avatara.
   T=
here is a need to bring the Vedas to the mass consciousness, to uplift the =
Physical consciousness from where it is now.

   Rishis wouldn't put the me=
thod for divinizing the Physical body in plaintext, to disallow its misuse.=
 It is for the persevering soul to find it out for himself or through the u=
pliftment of mass consciousness through Vedas.

   Why Vedic Rishis wouldn'=
t do it themselves, or if they did it, nobody would know, but they didn't l=
ive in Kaliyuga when the Physical body consciousness is largely in focus, a=
nd therefore the need to divinize it as well. Truth, however, is not limite=
d to the Yuga when it is perceived, and is equally applicable to all Yugas =
and Veda is that Truth.

> Because if one is immortal in the physical body,=
 one must survive in it till the end of creation.
   OTOH, a soul liberated=
 in Physical body, is no longer bound by the rules of creation as applicabl=
e to mortal beings, who have to die despite all the jnana they attain.

reg=
ards,
Aryama
