Narasimhaji,

Which homam would you recommend to perform on the day of the=
 eclipse? 
Would homam with Sri Rudram/Chamakam be a good choice for that d=
ay?

Should the homam be performed during the time the eclipse starts in
Af=
rica/Asia?  On the east coast in the US it would be between 2:30-3 am
if I =
calcuate correctly.

Veenu
