Namaste friends,
 
I will give my 2 cents on a few points.
 
*        *    =
    *
 
I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Te=
lugu in poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complica=
ted to read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can=
 read the Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discourag=
ed me. He asked me, "who do you think you are?" He said that it could be co=
nsidered later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.
 
Please note=
 that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and =
prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They =
are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses =
of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the pas=
t.
 
An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, righ=
t frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was =
used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.
 
In fact, the words =
of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be more effective =
for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person that one can inte=
llectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not worrying about whet=
her one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras coming from great r=
ishis/yogis/sadhakas.
 
*        *        *
 
If I were to give an analogy =
in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of scholarly analysis=
 on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of the bowler, how=
 to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to play it with a str=
aight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back foot etc. But that=
 does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one practices, THAT can m=
ake one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding of principles is=
 needed. But, above that, practice is more important than bookish knowledge=
.
 
Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spirituality a=
lso, but above that, sadhana is more important.
 
The essence of all script=
ures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. It is that we sh=
ould overcome the notions that we are doing things and realize that the div=
ine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each being based on one=
's conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes through the cyc=
le until one overcomes the notions of "I am doing", "this is mine", "I like=
 this and I dislike that" etc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures=
 and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There is no magic fo=
rmula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome the instincts of=
 "I am doing", "this is mine" etc.
 
So, even if one practices a mantra tha=
t one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic =
essence of scriptures is at the back of one's mind, one is constantly conte=
mplating and watching over one's own thoughts and instincts, to root out un=
desirable thoughts, one's sadhana will yield results.
 
*        *        *=

 
This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scr=
iptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or=
 virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a=
 theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of =
one's instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.
 
One doing=
 sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and what=
 we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of clim=
bing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical underst=
anfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but=
 keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.
 
*        *        =
*
 
Regarding the statement that initiation is important in tantric path bu=
t not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.
 
Whether Vedic and tantrik =
paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There =
are a lot of inaccurate notions today.
 
The issue is not really Tantrik vs=
 Vedic. The issue is one's attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants s=
pecific material results needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. =
Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a particular result is not easy. It requ=
ires supervision of a good guru and not many are left anyway. On the other =
hand, if one is NOT looking for specific material results and is looking fo=
r spiritual progress, the constraints are fewer and options more.
 
Some ma=
y sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific=
 material results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect=
. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in l=
itigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in th=
e Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforc=
e the notion that "all is Brahman" and to remove the mental repulsion towar=
ds some objects.
 
*        *        *
 
My thumbrule is this. If you are l=
ooking for a specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervis=
ion, which not many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiri=
tual progress and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sa=
dhana without initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and o=
ther like-minded people.
 
After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you ne=
ed clear and precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to g=
o to north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supe=
rvision helps there too, but you can do without it!

atya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 ye=
ars I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reaso=
ns. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. Howe=
ver after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my writ=
e up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some pos=
ts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and m=
ore sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this=
 particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji's question.

> > 
> > > Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessit=
y of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that n=
eeds to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY ans=
wers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? Generally=
 speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement =
for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question =
is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by=
 *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.
> > > 
> > > 'Munde munde matir =
bhinna' as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple appro=
aches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspec=
tives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in t=
he current context of this question I will restrict myself to only the five=
 that are relevant to the discussion.

/Vedantic)
> > > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)
> > > c. Mantra marga (Ta=
ntric)
> > > d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)
> > > e. Karma marga (Action- =
Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)
> > > 
> > > Spiritual life is nothing=
 but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each =
of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its atte=
mpt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us br=
iefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these=
 paths.
> > > For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, st=
rictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can gre=
atly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direc=
t path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichar=
a (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik =
system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-stu=
dy of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices involve t=
he 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for external practices.
> > > 
=
> > > Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) =
and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga addi=
tionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Suprem=
e Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only th=
e first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.
> > > 
> > > Bhakti marga =
(Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will throug=
h total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma mar=
ga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions with=
out attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.
>=
 > > 
> > > Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where=
 alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of =
a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occu=
lt truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It pre=
supposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain=
 regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti=
 marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predo=
minantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'=
). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of t=
he intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, an=
d yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.
> > > 
> > > Tantr=
a's method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like=
 practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques th=
at bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara =
is not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a chil=
d to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need=
 experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper train=
ing and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety meas=
ures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However the lab is one's own cons=
ciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individua=
l consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a top=
ic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on =
the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just =
elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.
> > > 
> > > Since we are talki=
ng about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tant=
ric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric contex=
t. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. H=
owever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living =
traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri S=
ri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to =
Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Bu=
ddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan =
Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajray=
ana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its a=
pproach to sadhana.
> > > 
> > > Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (no=
t that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Som=
a, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The =
yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set =
of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation i=
s the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual li=
neage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTE=
D TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each bran=
ch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the in=
dividual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Anot=
her modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by =
the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessa=
ry for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine =
many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wir=
es, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all=
 the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) an=
d Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.
> > > 
> > > As already stated=
 Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness th=
rough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, =
Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly =
comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the ma=
ny in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. =
However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishad=
s. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. =
The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantrama=
rga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explor=
e the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I h=
ave covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined =
to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely pow=
erful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, =
the crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself pr=
oclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a secon=
d, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (=
10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect o=
n the central truth of Advaita.
> > > 
> > > The reason I advised the non-i=
nitiate to read in English or any other regional language is because unders=
tanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repe=
atedly reads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main i=
dea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too=
 apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is al=
so equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four =
hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samh=
ita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chan=
di *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will st=
raightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even=
 the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIV=
ED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.
>=
 > > 
> > > Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of =
Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are tho=
se who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra =
marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its own =
principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of =
Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the =
Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Hom=
am too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik p=
ractice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approach=
es to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and b=
reathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced origin=
ally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Ta=
ntra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sr=
i Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.
> > > 
> > > In summary, one can make spiritual =
progress through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhy=
aya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, S=
akshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending on the individua=
l temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods are more suited relativ=
ely to different practitioners. One may progress through a combination of a=
ny of these methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrate=
d approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture a=
gainst which the answer to the question has to be contextualised.
> > > 
> =
> > Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA a=
nd SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is reg=
ular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in =
the texts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant wit=
h. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swad=
hyaya is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is n=
ot possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make r=
apid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted =
state by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company o=
f sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorak=

 a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get i=
nitiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.

ras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific materi=

 case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. O=

 destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest=
 doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever =
material results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is=

o do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the a=
ttitude of "I have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfi=

ual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever g=
od gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual p=

ut there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine tha=
t a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in=
 garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the pers=
on is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the=
 floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and=
 there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fru=
it stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala=
 of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and =
throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some s=
pillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more tim=
e to get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce dei=
ty like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but=
 the good fruit comes out faster.

that these fruits are not deity's creations, but fruits of your own actions=
. Without sadhana, you would've had to eat each of those rotten fruits befo=
re eating the good fruits!

take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce de=
ities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if mad=
e mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If y=
ou realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad=
 results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions =
and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted=
, stick to gentler deities.

 now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first t=

 of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.
