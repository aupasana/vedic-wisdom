Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
It is your dream and what you saw were *your* dream obj=
ects. It is a reality made up by your mind, based on its conditioning. What=
 they were doing in that line is better answered by your mind than by any o=
ther person.
=C2=A0
Seriously, however, Savikalpa samadhi, Nirvikalpa samad=
hi, Sahaja samadhi etc are not things you can obtain or buy, by standing in=
 a line. Moreover, spiritual experiences never occur when one is expecting =
or anticipating them. Various spiritual experiences occur when most thought=
s cease in the mind and mind is focused on something specific, such as a de=
ity, a name, a mantra, a thought etc. The desire or pre-occupation with a s=
amadhi or a spiritual experience will often work as a barrier blocking one =
from good focus and concentration.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

      Hello,

=A0 Few days ago I had a dream. I saw Narasimha and Rajarshi standing in a =
line/queue together. I had no difficulty in recognising Narasimha as he had=
 appeared in my room at night several years ago and his picture is on video=
. I knew immediately in dream that other person is Rajarshi although I do n=
ot know him.

Hay guys, what you were doing in that line? Were you queueing=
 for nirvekalp or sahaja samadhi or similar hocus pocus or just mundane new=
 years sale?

I saw Rajarshi so clearly that I would have recognised him am=
ong several persons in physical world but now the image has become very dim=
 in my memory. 

It was good to see=C2=A0 you both.
LaxmiNarayan
