Namaste,
   
   Recently I happened to see a few 'Paranormal State' episode=
s and observed that the so called entities/beings identified or located are=
 left alone mostly even when there is priest around.
  
  This brought to m=
y mind a similar incident which i remember vaguely of having read long time=
 back in one of 'Ramakrishna' books (dont remember the name), where Ramakri=
shna and Rakhal was one day staying late at Gopaler Ma's place and in the n=
ight  Sri Ramakrisha was visited by some entity/being in a sad state who ca=
me to him and requested him to leave the place as Sri Ramakrishna's presenc=
e was making the entity/being miserable. Ramakrishna immediately woke up Ra=
khal and left the place, avoiding giving any reasons to people in the house=
.

Gopalers Ma was somebody who was immersed in god and still had such enti=
ties/beings around?

Also brings the question why is it that the entities/b=
eings in sad state left alone by psychics and spiritual persons without doi=
ng anything for their upliftment? 

Is it that such beings/entities cannot =
be helped or is it just wise to leave them alone if they do not want to be =
disturbed?

Is their any Vedic explanations/suggestions on such situations =
as above?

Best Regards
Shashi
