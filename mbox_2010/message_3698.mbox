Namaste Narasimhaji and Other Respected members,
I purchased a copy of the =
Devi mahatymam by Gita Press a few days back. While I was going through it =
I noticed that there are quite a few instances where some words are marked =
with a * or a number and at the bottom of the page there is a "Paathantar:"=
 for each of these words. The translation (using some web based tool )of "P=
aathantar:"  into english means "Version". 
My query is which words should =
I use, the original one or the words mentioned at the bottom of the page. 
=

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
