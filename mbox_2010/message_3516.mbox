The following is extracted from his site.He gives a detailed analysis of th=
e savitur gayatri mantra.

	


The Gayatri mantra is the oldest ,the root a=
nd the most powerful of Sanskrit mantras. In my experience  chanting the Ga=
yatri mantra and firmly establishing it in the Hridaya can lead to knowledg=
e of the Atman.(Soul)

Only one who is a knower of the Gayatri is a Brahman=
,the rest are simply dependant one their credentials at birth and intellige=
nce .Whilst they like themselves to be called as brahmanas they are actuall=
y in a worse position than anybody else in society.Why should I say this wi=
th authority?Because I know this truth having experienced it.



Yes ,as lo=
ng as they are willing to follow the caveats of Yama,niyama,which include n=
onviolence (ie no meat),purity of the body and mind (Shaucha) and pronounce=
 the mantra properly with the swaras.For manasika japa there is no restrict=
ion on the swaras but better results are got if the mantra swaras embedd th=
emselves in the mind.



The Gayatri should be recited at either the Khanda=
 Sandhya(Early morning -an hour before and an hour after sunrise) or /and t=
he Shuddha Sandhya(an hour before and an hour after sunset) or the Turiya S=
andhya(an hour before and after midnight). The minimum number is 10 or 28 t=
imes but to have anubhava try this .Starting at an auspicious time ,use a r=
udraksha mala(5 mukhi will do,it must be small beads ideally),a woollen whi=
te or red blanket to sit upon(Darbhasan is ideal),and facing east in the mo=
rning start japa of Gayatri.Finish a mala at least and chant in a way that =
only you can hear yourself.Increase this to 2 or 3 malas at both sandhyas.
=

The word "Gayatri" itself explains the meaning of this mantra. It has its =
origin in the Sanskrit phrase Gayantam Triyate iti, and refers to that mant=
ra which rescues the chanter from all adverse situations that may lead to s=
piritual death. 

Goddess Gayatri is also called "Veda-Mata" or the Mother =
of the Vedas =97 Rig, Yajur, Saam and Atharva =97 because it is the very ba=
sis of the Vedas. It is the basis, the reality behind the experienced and t=
he cognized universe. 

The Gayatri mantra is composed of a metre consistin=
g of 24 syllables =97 generally arranged in a triplet of eight syllables ea=
ch. Therefore, this particular meter (tripadhi) is also known as the Gayatr=
i Meter or "Gayatri Chhanda." 

The Mantra

Aum
Bhuh Bhuvah Svah(give a fra=
ction of a second halt here)
Tat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of a sec=
ond halt here)
Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second halt he=
re)
Dhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat

~ The Rig Veda (10:16:3)



Tat, says Woodrof=
fe, refers to the first cause of all substance, as fire in the circle of th=
e sun and is supreme Brahman. Savituh is the source of all living beings. V=
arenyam is the excellent one who receives adoration. Bharga destroys sin, D=
evasya means it is full of light, while Dhimahi refers to knowledge being g=
olden and always within the sun. Dhiyo means Buddhi, Yo stands for energy (=
tejas). The mantra is divided into three sections of eight letters and four=
 sections of six letters. A dhyana (meditation) in the same chapter describ=
es Gayatri as having four faces, which are white, yellow, red and black. 

=
Yet the tantrik tradition has different views of the Gayatri. For example, =
in the Matrikabhedatantra, there is a couplet which says a person who knows=
 the Brahman (the absolute), is a brahmin. 

In the tantrik tradition, each=
 aspect of devata has her or his own form of the Gayatri and it is often pr=
onounced at the four junctions of the day, including midnight. 


The tantr=
a based Gayatri is  known as  the Ajapa japa.

Sooo is the sound created wh=
ilst inhalation and Hummm whilst exhalation.This method of chanting the man=
tra whilst the root of the uvula is pressed upon by the tip of the tongue o=
r whilst concentration is made upon either the breath,the Hridaya,the Ajna =
chakra or the Sahasrara brings about dissolution of the sensation of the St=
hula Sharira(physical body) and a tremendous perception that one is the Atm=
an.It destroys the attachments and rids one of the Shad Ripus(the six enemi=
es of man).It gives a clear idea of what ones previous births are ,etc.But =
one should be forewarned.The practise of mere physical mudras without the l=
earning of Atman tattwa will only give Siddhis and bind one to the material=
 world by increasing karmas.

This  Ajapa is recited by every living being =
unconsciously 21,600 times a day as she or he breathes. Half are the  breat=
hs  which go through the channel of the Sun and half are breaths which go t=
hrough the channel of the Moon.ie.The Pingala and Ida nadis. It consists of=
 the letters Ha and Sa.

Fools like to say that these nadis exist within th=
e physical structures in the body but they are simply gassing about.The tru=
th is that these channels and the Kundalini Shakti exist in the Sookshma sh=
arira .These have an association with the Stula sharira and can when concen=
trated upon result in the flow of Prana through the nadis .

Recitation of =
the Gayatri brings about spiritual change from within.It invokes the Suprem=
e energy Gayatri mata which the Christians call as the Holy spirit and brin=
gs the glory of the Atman forth.
