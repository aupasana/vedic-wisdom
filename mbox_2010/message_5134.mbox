Honoring Life: The Principle of Vegetarianism in Sanatana Dharma

By Sri Dh=
arma Pravartaka Acharya 


"One of the central tenets of Sanatana Dharma ph=
ilosophy is the concept of ahimsa, or non-violence. While many ethical syst=
ems espouse some form of non-violent ethic or another, what makes the Vedic=
 practice of ahimsa radically unique from other systems is the universal sc=
ope of its concern. For most ethical schools of thought, the concept of eth=
ical concern extends no further than the human race. The criteria for wheth=
er or not a being is worthy of being the object of compassion is determined=
 by the species of the being involved. For Dharmis (followers of Sanatana D=
harma), on the other hand, all living creatures are worthy of respect, comp=
assion and ethical concern, regardless of whether they are human or non-hum=
an.  The entire realm of living beings thus falls within the scope of moral=
 concern. It is in keeping with this ethic of valuing all life that thought=
ful Dharmis follow a strict vegetarian diet, a diet which seeks to reduce s=
uffering to its minimal level...."
