Each being in the un=

 and not to be=C2=A0kept at home. =C2=A0These days animals live with humans=
 
inside the house. Hence the owners have to feed it meat. As a result the =
owners 
will get some=C2=A0karma for feeding meat.=C2=A0=C2=A0But will this=
 karma get cancelled with 
the good deed of giving the dog/cat a good life =

I don't have a pet. I personal=

Namaste Narasimha,
=C2=A0
I disgr=
ee with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with 
=
the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained right at=
 the 
beginning).
=C2=A0
(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (=
National Public Radio) several 
months back. They conducted an experiment o=
n gorillas. One set of gorillas was 
fed with meat. The other set was fed w=
ith nuts, fruits etc. After several 
months, researchers found a gap in the=
 intelligence of the two sets. The ones 
fed with meat were duller.

If=C2=
=A0you have any references for this, in terms of whether they published any=
 
paper on the same, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I=
 am 
open to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine =
evidence.
=C2=A0
Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more ener=
gy. Gorillas fed with 
nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy toward=
s the development of brain. 
Though they were not sure if the same thing ap=
plies to human beings or not,=C2=A0=C2=A0a 
balanced vegetarian diet perhap=
s can maximize one's intellectual development.
=C2=A0
This is a wrong theor=
y as far as human nutrition=C2=A0is concerned, because human 
stomach struc=
ture (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products 
far ea=
sier to digest than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have 
q=
oted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and 
=
dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C2=A0take a few da=
ys since I 
have to get them from people who deal with these topics profess=
ionally, but time 
is not a problem.=C2=A0All the papers are=C2=A0from the =
most accepted and reputed 
scientific=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion.=
 Which is why I said, it is myth 
that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0foods are=C2=A0=
easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. 

=C2=A0
Further, in my=
 experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any more 
dull or =
smarter than traditional omnivores. 

=C2=A0
(7) Regarding Priya's question=
: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. 
If an animal can surviv=
e on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor 
fellow whatever he/sh=
e needs.
=C2=A0
An animal has a specific physical=C2=A0structure and needs =
to maintain the same. But 
if trained they can 'adjust' to any kind of meal=
s. I have seen people feeding 
vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically spea=
king, an animal whose whole body 
structure is designed to be a carnivore, =
may adjust to any food for the sake of 
survival, but will become internall=
y weak and susceptable to disease and 
weaknesses. Who takes the karma for =
the disease and weakness that may result 
from an unnatural diet to an anim=
al? 

=C2=A0
Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being disease=
d, but the chances 
increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cance=
r, but smoking makes one 
susceptible to cancer. It increases the probabili=
ty. Therefore my personal 
opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it sh=
ould taken care of in the best 
way possible, providing it with whatever ma=
ybe needed, including the right diet.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
_______________
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
A question for you.
=C2=A0
Scientists studying evolution and human b=
ody structures have concluded that meat 
eating along with cropping and fru=
its has been prevelant since at least 4 
million years. That, without a die=
t which was omnivorous, the structure of the 
human stomach (lack of a deve=
loped=C2=A0caecum),=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C2=A0brain 
size (fr=
om archeological evidences)=C2=A0could never have been what it is today. 
W=
hich means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C2=A0natural process, so ingraine=
d that it 
has changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be=
 done 
consciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you =
want, I will 
provide relevent research=C2=A0papers to prove my claim).
=C2=
=A0
What is your take on this? 
=C2=A0

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat

=
=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,

There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few=
 quick comments.

(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in =
our body and their 
interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what=
 we eat has a profound 
impact on us.

(2) Much has been written on the mat=
erial benefits from vegetarianism. But that 
is not all. There are spiritua=
l and subtle reasons as well.

Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal =
that strongly identifies with the 
physical body entails a karma. Self-iden=
tification of plants with their physical 
body is much subtler and the karm=
a entailed in eating plant-based foods is much 
smaller.

Especially these =
days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by 
corporations and =
animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their 
suffering go=
es to the ones benefiting from their meat.

(3) I heard an interview with a=
 scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several 
months back. They conduc=
ted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was 
fed with meat. The =
other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several 
months, researchers=
 found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones 
fed with meat w=
ere duller.

Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. =
Gorillas fed with 
nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards th=
e development of brain. 
Though they were not sure if the same thing applie=
s to human beings or not, a 
balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize =
one's intellectual development.

(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel=
 dull or sleepy and cannot focus well 
on work that requires alertness and =
skill. That is because the digestive process 
is using up a lot of energy (=
also known as agni or fire) and there isn't much 
agni available for other =
activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that 
happens in the min=
d. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also 
requires agni =
and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after 
a heavy=
 meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before 
eatin=
g.

(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fr=
ied food 
with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are=
 consumed more 
frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often a=
nd there is less agni 
available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritua=
l ideas and experiences. If 
one eats saattwik food that is very easy to di=
gest (simple grains, simple 
lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cook=
ed with mild spices, and fruits), 
less agni is diverted towards digestion =
and more agni is available for 
assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ide=
as and experiences.

(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But hu=
ge stacks of dry grass may 
be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little b=
it of internal fire may be enough 
to assimilate spiritual ideas and experi=
ences in a person with excellent 
vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass)=
. A lot of internal fire may be needed 
in a person with poor vaasanas and =
many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all 
depends on vaasanas and impuri=
ties in nadis and chakras.

One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, s=
pend a lot of agni on digesting 
them and yet make excellent spiritual prog=
ress. Another person may eat saattwik 
food, maximize the agni available fo=
r spiritual transformation and yet struggle 
to progress spiritually. Howev=
er, the best course of action for one is to ignore 
counter-examples and be=
 a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that 
maximizes the agni avail=
able for spiritual progress.

(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have =
their own vaasanas and their needs. 
If an animal can survive on vegetarian=
 food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor 
fellow whatever he/she needs.

(8) O=
ne should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough 
fo=
od to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharma in the material 
=
world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food=
 is 
not good for spiritual sadhana.

Instead of overeating most of the tim=
e and fasting on specific days, it is 
better to eat limited amount always.=
 Regular practices are more important for 
transformation and success, than=
 occasional practices.

(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all =
actions or considering food 
to be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karm=
a involved. It depends on how 
deeply ingrained that thought is and how dee=
ply one feels so. If one internally 
feels 100% that god is acting through =
one and whatever one is doing (e.g. 
eating) is just god's prasad to one, t=
hen one is free.

Best regards,
Narasimha

not burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be burnt by just =
one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal
 fire may be enough to assimil=
ate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent vaasanas and=
 few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed in a pe=
rson with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all dep=
ends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.<BR><BR>One person may=
 eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting them and y=
et make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik food,=
 maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle =
to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to i=
gnore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, t=
hat maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.<BR><BR>(7) Regardi=
ng Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an=
 animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fell=
ow whatever he/she needs.<BR><BR>(8)
 One should eat to live and not live t=
o eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one can=
 fulfil one's dharma in the material world using physical body and make spi=
ritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.<BR=
><BR>Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, i=
t is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more import=
ant for transformation and success, than occasional practices.<BR><BR>(9) B=
y merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food t=
o be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how =
deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one intern=
ally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e=
.g. eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.<BR><BR>Best rega=
