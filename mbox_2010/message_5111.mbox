osted here. Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from int=
ernet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I inte=
racted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy =
of the original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and=
 quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general at=
mosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Ha=
ving quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might=
 reply to Utpal ji's question.
> 
> Utpal ji has raised an important questi=
on regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizi=
ng the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE =
question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general o=
r specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is=
 an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO.=
 However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mant=
ra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2=96YES.
> 
> 'Mu=
nde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity fo=
r multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of =
multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for s=
adhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself =
to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.
> 
> a. Gnana marga (=
Advaitic/Vedantic)
> b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)
> c. Mantra marga (Ta=
ntric)
> d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)
> e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual p=
ath and/or Selfless Actions)
> 
> Spiritual life is nothing but the practic=
alisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above pat=
hs EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practical=
ise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at th=
e predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.
> For th=
ose who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even=
 the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from th=
e wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita em=
phasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection).=
 Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retain=
ed the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as =
an important practice. All of these practices involve the 'self' in a big w=
ay with a marginal role for external practices.
> 
> Yoga marga emphasises =
Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity=
 or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapr=
anidhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha =
and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscrib=
e to nirishwaravada.
> 
> Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditi=
onal acceptance of Iswara's will through total surrender to the Supreme. On=
 the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the =
Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the=
 mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.
> 
> Finally I will address the Tantr=
ic path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiatio=
n and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the p=
racticalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda throug=
h the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab=
 experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should b=
e remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at var=
ious levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is=
 to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one pat=
h invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, an=
other the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagny=
a and so on.
> 
> Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with the fire of V=
ak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly=
 powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis=
 on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification.=
 Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision? D=
oes the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab =
experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart f=
rom certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However th=
e lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sak=
ti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti=
). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from=
 further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless det=
ails here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.
> 
> Sin=
ce we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within =
the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the=
 Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas com=
prehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are full-=
fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and =
Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadh=
ana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayan=
as among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familia=
r with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Ta=
ra Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sa=
dhanas in its approach to sadhana.
> 
> Kali kula *predominantly* invokes A=
gni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invo=
kes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journe=
y. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particul=
ar set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initi=
ation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiri=
tual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an =
INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Ea=
ch branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till=
 the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise i=
t. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is h=
eld by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit =
necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. I=
magine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of l=
ive wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent pract=
ice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light (Prak=
asa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.
> 
> As already stated =
Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness thr=
ough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, B=
hava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly c=
omprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the man=
y in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. H=
owever it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads=
. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. T=
he question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramar=
ga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore=
 the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I ha=
ve covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined t=
o the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powe=
rful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, t=
he crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself pro=
claims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second=
, saying "I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (1=
0.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on=
 the central truth of Advaita.
> 
> The reason I advised the non-initiate t=
o read in English or any other regional language is because understanding t=
he meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly re=
ads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of th=
e writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart fr=
om its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equall=
y regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In=
 that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are e=
qually possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM=
*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightawa=
y identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the wors=
hip of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a=
 one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.
> 
> Just =
as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sa=
dhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to =
the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this=
 particular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initi=
ation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichar=
a, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach=
 of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not req=
uired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual=
/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Cha=
ndi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditio=
ns of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various p=
arts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and he=
nce the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or S=
ri Vidya.
> 
> In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of t=
he merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Isw=
arapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are=
 all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude e=
tc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practiti=
oners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in sp=
iritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA in=
volves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer t=
o the question has to be contextualised.
> 
> Finally one last word. Irresp=
ective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effecti=
ve methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed=
 by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a=
 language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIR=
ST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (th=
ough not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and =
satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. =
Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, liste=
ning to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger=
 days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum leap in the=
ir spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrit=
tinath and Matsyendranath respectively.
> 
> For those who complain about t=
he scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:
> QUO=
TE  // "There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no goo=
d Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of s=
upply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at onc=

> 
> To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. =
Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsa=
ngha though not comparable to the actual company of the great masters. By s=
