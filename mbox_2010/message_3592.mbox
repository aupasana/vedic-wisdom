Namaste,

Manish blessed me that I can think of him and answer questions on=
 spiritual matters that I feel like answering and I will end up giving good=
 answers. I am an instrument of my guru.

As the volume increases, I may ha=
ve to leave it out some questions unanswered. But remember that sincere que=
stions will always get answers. Nature uses someone or the other as an inst=
rument to answer a sincere seeker's questions. I am only one of MANY instru=
ments Nature has at disposal.

(1) I get up early and do Chandi homam in th=
e morning before going to work. My Chandi homam takes 1.25-1.5 hours. I fin=
ish homam and meditation and go to work.

People say that they are busy and=
 have no time. But people usually have a lot of time and waste a lot of it =
knowingly or unknowingly.

(2) The conventional understanding is that Gayat=
ri chhandas has 3 padas with each having 8 aksharas (syllables).

The word =
chhandas comes from the root "chhad" which means "to cover". The word "aach=
chhaadana" comes from the same root. Chhandas is a cover for a mantra. At a=
 higher level, there is a rhythm that works as a cover for a meaning. When =
you hear a verse, you first notice a rhythm in it. Under the covering of th=
at rhythm lies a meaning. At a finer level, there are different deities rep=
resented by various aksharas or other forming units of the mantra and they =
serve as a cover for the mantra. Under the covering of those deities repres=
enting those syllables lies the actual mantra and its deity. There are 24 d=
eities working as a cover in mantras composed in Gayatri.

(3) What we see =
now is faaaaar from the peak. When Kali is at peak, nobody will remember or=
 know about god at all. People will be completely taken over by sense pleas=
ures and become totally immoral. Such a time is still far away.

However, d=
ecline of dharma happened too fast on earth in the last few centuries and e=
specially decades. Thus, some brakes have to be applied to slow it down arr=
est this decline in dharma. There will be a temporary increase in dharma. A=
gain, adharma will catch up and there will be a rapid decline. When that on=
e goes too far, again there may be some reversal. It may go on like this, i=
nstead of dharma declining at a uniform rate.

(4) I think those books are =
wonderful. The three works I like the most are Yoga Vaasishtham, Jnaneshwar=
i (Bhagavad Gita free translation by Sant Jnaneshwar) and Aghora series. I =
see them as slightly different perspectives, using different abstractions, =
on the same ultimate knowledge.

Vimalananda may not be conventional, but h=
e is a person of immense understanding and wisdom.

Best regards,
Narasimha=

      Dear Narasimhagaru, 



I =
really appreciate your contribution on this forum. It is pretty much that I=
 started looking forward for your posts which are filled with so much convi=
ction, knowledge of our scriptures and clarity. In the mean-while some more=
 questions. Some of these questions were asked previously in different thre=
ads on this forum, but probably you didn't have a chance to look at them, w=
ith all the activity that is happening over here. 



1. I understand from =
different messages that you do Chandi Homam everyday. How do you manage to =
do that? It should be taking at least 2.5 to 3 hours to perform this, right=
? Do you do this in the evenings?



2. What exactly is Gayatri Chandas? (I=
 have asked this previously). I find that Savitru Gayatri Mantra has 24 let=
ters, Brihaspati Gayatri has 21 letters (Vrishabham Charshaneenam) , Ganapa=
ti Moolamantram (aum Shreem hreem kleem gloum Gam Ganapathim.. ..) having 2=
8 letters. 



3. With only 5000+ years into a length of 432,000 years of K=
aliyuga, are we at a point that we can say that Kali is deepening? I shudde=
r to think what would happen when kali really deepens fully, say a few thou=
sand years more from now. 



4. I have really heard great praises on this =
forum on Yogi Vimalananda and read great reviews on the Aghora Series books=
 by Dr. Robert Svobodha. I have also read the great narratives by Mr. Rajar=
shi with a great interest. He is a fantastic narrator. I would like to know=
 your opinion on those books. The subject is fascinating for me. 



Regard=
s, 



Nagraj Kota
