Namaste,

 The size of the fire matters. Doing homam with a small fire =
using 3-4 small dry coconut pieces is also definitely good and useful, but =
doing homam with a bigger fire has a stronger effect on one's consciousness=
. With either practice, of course, the key to success are regularity and pe=
rsistence.

 If someone has an apartment in a western country without any f=
ireplace or balcony and doing homam with dry coconut pieces next to a windo=
w in a room is also not possible due to strict fire rules, I want to sugges=
t an option that enables a mini-homam. Such people can do a "deepa homam" (=
homam in a lamp). Pour some melted ghee in a small mud/copper/silver/bronze=
/brass/golden pot (or lamp stand). Put in a wick in it. Treating it as a ho=
ma kundam, do homam normally. When it is time to install fire, light the wi=
ck. With each swaahaa, pour a drop of melted ghee in the pot. Do everything=
 else as in the procedure.

 As I said, homam with a big fire is better, bu=
t something is definitely better than nothing. Do deepa homam with a lamp a=
nd then meditate after poornaahuti. BTW, poornaahuti can be a spoonful of m=
elted ghee.

 One point I forgot to make earlier:

 If someone is buying a =
new house and looking for guidance, one more small factor. If homam is done=
 in the northeast or east or southeast corners of the house, it is better. =
One can look for a house that has a fireplace or balcony in those sides. Of=
 course, those who already have a house and doing homam elsewhere need not =
worry. The key is to do it. Guidelines in shastras are for enhancing the ex=
perience a little and not for blocking it out of fear of breaking guideline=
s.

 Best regards,
 Narasimha
