Dear Rajarshi,

It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urg=
e should be considered as Initiation at least in this age.
I know a person =
who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost for=
 a year. He didnt have formal Guru then but he started oneday on regular ba=
sis without any initiation. later he ispired few people to start reading CP=
.

If one looks at this group, many have started CP and homam just by posit=
ive influences and no formal initiation.

You are probably very right in yo=
ur assumption when you say Adhikara to recite CP may be sprung up due to Ch=
andi is Ugraatiugra.

However, Chandi is also Mother and though she may be =
Ugraatiugra, she is also Sumyaatisaumya. In this age of Kali, She has becom=
e the later and she'll be happy if someone just prays with *slightest* of d=
evotion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this is a strong convi=
ction developed in me. Jo Dar gaya vo samjo mar gaya!

Best Regards,

Utpal=
