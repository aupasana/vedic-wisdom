Dear Dr. Satya Prakash, 
=C2=A0
I do see your points and do understand that=
 Sankara peethams discourage the practise of mahavidyas=C2=A0without the In=
itiation. But here are a couple of questions. Since you seem to be deeply k=
nowledgeable, please clarify these questions. 
=C2=A0
1. In the devi mahaat=
myam, mother is saying in sloka 11 of chapter 12, that she would be happy=
=C2=A0if one does this with or without knowledge. Could you please comment =
on that. My understanding/interpretation could be wrong.
=C2=A0
2. I heard =
from one of the pundits that since Gayatri Mantra is considered the greates=
t of all mantras, one who has initiation in Gayatri Mantra (which is given =
as part of upanayanam) need not have any other initiation.=C2=A0You could g=
ive your valuable opinion on the same. 
=C2=A0
Regards,
=C2=A0

Namaste friends,

Essentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matter=
s in this discussion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one =
can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion =
on translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be som=
e unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:

1. There are various sacred chant=
s embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sac=
red chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. =
Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita p=
ortion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.

2. Undoubtedly mantras =
and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is no=
t even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.

3. Wh=
ilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes=
 a distinction between them.

4. As per the traditional view one doesn't ne=
ed to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same w=
ith most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras o=
f Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras fro=
m the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initia=
tion, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever y=
ou call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral pa=
rts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as =
in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.

5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivas=
ahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall under st=
otra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally =
viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger status=
 as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation=
 is not recommended especially when the reader combines the navarna or shod=
ashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.

6. I know from perso=
nal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri =
paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and=
 Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras=
 which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of b=
oth these traditions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navar=
na as well as shodashakshari mantras.

7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi=
 Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part=
 of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as =
an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Nav=
akshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds=
 that one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one wishes to benef=
it from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , re=
ading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up=
, as chanting the original along with the navakshari amounts to practicing =
the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated =
and go through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.

8. Arguab=
ly if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskr=
it as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inh=
erent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of=
 Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers =
inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as th=
e Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.

9. I you carefu=
lly peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere d=
o I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted t=
o write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power o=
f the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know th=
e essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it=
. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! 

=
10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation,=
 there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level =
of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. =
Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please ke=
ep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana.=
 As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadh=
ana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will re=
duce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accord=
 in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. 

Hope t=
he above pointers help in clearing any confusion. 

Regards,
Satya Prakash =

<DIV>I do see your points and do understand that Sankara peethams =
discourage the practise of mahavidyas without the Initiation. But here=
 are a couple of questions. Since you seem to be deeply knowledgeable, plea=
se clarify these questions. </DIV>

that. My understanding/interpretation could be wrong.</DIV>
<DIV> </DI=

<DIV>2. I heard from one of the pundits that since Gayatri Mantra is con=
sidered the greatest of all mantras, one who has initiation in Gayatri Mant=
ra (which is given as part of upanayanam) need not have any other initiatio=
n. You could give your valuable opinion on the same. </DIV>

<DIV><BR><BR>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Essentially I agree with Nar=
asimha garu in most matters in this discussion. The only major point where =
I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. =
The rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs some clarificatio=
n as there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:<BR><BR>1=
. There are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agama=
s etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, s=
totras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahama=
ntras and mantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as m=
antras.<BR><BR>2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the=
 original. Reading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the ori=
ginal chant. So far it is fine.<BR><BR>3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha=
 are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between
 them.<B=
R><BR>4. As per the traditional view one doesn't need to be initiated to ch=
ant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantra=
s containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need in=
itiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are n=
ot the same as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generall=
y referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras th=
e actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distin=
ct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidya=
s such as Kali or Sri.<BR><BR>5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya=
 hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall under stotra category only=
. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY =
as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts=
 of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is
 not recommend=
ed especially when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too =
as an integral part of the chanting.<BR><BR>6. I know from personal interac=
tion that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas =
recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya =
along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are =
treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these t=
raditions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well =
as shodashakshari mantras.<BR><BR>7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Maha=
tmyam is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part of a=
 Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Ad=
vaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navaksha=
ri is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that=
 one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one
 wishes to benefit f=
rom the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , readin=
g the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as=
 chanting the original along with the navakshari amounts to practicing the =
sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and =
go through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.<BR><BR>8. Argu=
ably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sans=
krit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an i=
nherent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana =
of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most reader=
s inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as =
the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.<BR><BR>9. I yo=
u carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, n=
owhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in
 writing. Neither have I at=
tempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have th=
e power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended t=
o know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while ch=
anting it. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a transl=
ation! <BR><BR>10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path with=
out initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a=
 certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. W=
e all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiat=
ion). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do =
sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to j=
ust do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude=
 itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on t=
heir own accord in the natural flow.
 Leave the rest to the compassionate G=
oddess. <BR><BR>Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. <BR=
