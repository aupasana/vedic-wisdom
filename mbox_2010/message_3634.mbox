Namaste Narsimhaji,

>>One's beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shap=
e the imagery >>one's mind visualizes.

i have asked this question earlier =
also but somehow it is not very clear.If these things shape our visulaisati=
ons then what is the difference between this sort of visualisation/hallucin=
ation and the DARSHAN of deity. Kindly explain in detail. i have read your =
analogy on that sun in dirty mirror  but this is not quite clear.Whenever y=
ou get time please exlain this.

Regards
Jitender

(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience =
of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I s=

n my dad's funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as per the no=
te). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar hom=

think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan =
bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body.=
..especially

Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible el=
ement to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame see=
ds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at=
 my request) - and he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10=
 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee.

the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT trying to be f=
