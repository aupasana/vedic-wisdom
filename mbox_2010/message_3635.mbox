Adesh!

I am new here (hi!) so I'll jump right in and offer my opinion. I h=
ave had
experiences like you mention. In my case, I have found that she sou=
nds like
Aidevi (the goddess of one of the Natha panths). I was told this b=
y someone
very familiar with this particular face of Goddess.

There are a =
couple of problems that spring to mind: first, MIND. It may be a
darshan, i=
t may just be your mind. If you follow it, it could lead you down
an empty =
path. However, it really is your choice, you must follow your
karmas as the=
y lead you. In my case, I accept her as a sort of "guardian"
and leave it a=
t that. Other things shape your visualizations too, including
pure randomne=
ss, and passing images that float by. If you feel like
accepting it as dars=
han, then do so. Just don't stake your claim on it. Your
ego may possibly c=
ling to it and distract you from the One.

Hope this helps.

fully (after struggling with renal failure and other complications) at our =
home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father's body to the smashaan=
 bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant n=
otes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experie=
nce of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and=
 I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhu=
mi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a hom=
am on my dad's funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as pe=
r the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a sim=
ilar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding =
to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the s=
mashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over =
my body...especially<br>


>  in/around the abdominal region. As taught =
in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as equanimously as I could=
, and told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon after, a thou=
ght came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I =
should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I s=
till wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he co=
uld procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, th=
is friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he =
would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in ad=
dition he bought some ghee. <br>

other - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in the direction o=
pposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a =
stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on eit=
her side, told them that I would like to meditate, and requested them to le=

ontinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough.=
 I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the p=

#39;mangalmayee' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thr=
ill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing.=
 I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "=
;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Eve=

my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desire that h=

to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his fe=
