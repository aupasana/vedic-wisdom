Namate Jagmeet

Good Question, thanks for bringing it up.

You are very co=
rrect in your point that many donot know their
Gotram and Rishi. What  I ha=
ve also observed is if one does not have a gotram but say starts following =
a Sadguru, than they can use their
Sadguru's Gotram and Rishi. Many times I=
 have Swamiji Ganapati Sacchidanandaji, the rare living avatar of Datta eve=
n say this himself, i.e. use his gotram. This also means he has accepted th=
em as spiritual children.

Please note that there is no relationship with R=
ashi, Nakshatra
and Gotram and Rishi or Kula Devi or Kula Devta. These are =
orthogonal concepts.

I am pretty sure there is a way for all indian to fin=
d thiir Gotram and Rishi.

For instance I would hope that since The sikh re=
ligion came from
direct lineage of Lord Rama, so all the followers in that =
would have gotram of Lord Rama and also the Rishi. If I am wrong here pleas=
e pardon my ignorance.

Best Regards
Mitesh
