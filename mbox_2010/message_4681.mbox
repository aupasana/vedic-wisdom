 Turn your vision inward
and then the whole world
will be full of Supreme S=
pirit.
The world is said to be illusion.
Illusion is really truth.
Even sci=
ence traces the origin
of the universe to one primordial matter;
Subtle, ex=
ceedingly subtle.
God is the same to those who say
the world is real and th=
eir opponents.
Their outlook is different.
You need not entangle yourself
i=
n such disputations.
The goal is one and the same for all.
Look to it.

The=
re is only one consciousness.
Without consciousness,
time and space do not =
exist.
They appear in consciousness.
It is like a screen on which these are=
 cast as pictures,
and move as in a cinema show.
The absolute consciousness=
 is our real nature.

Bliss is concurrent with
Being-Consciousness.
All the=
 arguments relating
to the eternal being of that Bliss
apply to Bliss, also=
.
Your nature is Bliss.
Ignorance is now hiding that Bliss.
Remove the igno=
rance,
for Bliss to be freed.

The perception of an "I"
is associated with =
a form,
maybe the body.
There should be nothing associate
with the pure Sel=
f.
The Self is the unassociated,
pure Reality
in whose light the body,
the =
ego, etc, shine.
On stilling all thoughts,
the pure consciousness remains.
=

Even though the world is seen,
the Seer remains unaffected.

Because you a=
re accustomed to identify with the body
and sight with the eyes, you say yo=
u do not see anything.
What is there to be seen? Who is to see? How to see?=

There is only one consciousness which,
manifesting itself as "I"-thought, =
identifies itself with the body,
projects itself through the eyes and sees =
the objects around.
The individual is limited in the waking state
and expec=
ts to see something different.
The evidence of his senses will be the seal =
of authority.
But he will not admit, that the seer--the seen,
are all manif=
estations of the same consciousness.
Namely, "I-I"
Contemplation helps one =
overcome the illusion
that the Self must be visual. In truth nothing visual=
 exists.
How do you feel the "I" now?
Do you hold a feeling in front of you=
rself to know your being?
The awareness is the "I". Realize it and that is =
the truth.

The mind is only a bundle of thoughts.
The thoughts arise becau=
se there is the thinker.
The thinker is the ego.
The ego, if sought, will v=
anish automatically.
The ego and the mind are the same.
The ego is the root=
-thought
from which all other thoughts arise.
Dive within.
You are now awar=
e that the mind rise up from within.
So sink within and seek.

Seek the min=
d
on being sought
it will disappear.

Everyone wants only happiness.
Happin=
ess, too as found
in the enjoyment of the senses.
This question was asked o=
f a Guru,
and the latter answered, "Quite so,
That happiness which is a res=
ult of the
enjoyment of the senses
is the same as that of liberation.
That =
desire of such liberation is one
of the four requirements for Liberation
Th=
is is common to all.
So all are eligible for this knowledge;
Self- knowledg=
e."

Pursuit of Self-knowledge
should not be abandoned.


Bhagavan replied,=
 "Happiness is possible only if the mind is right. If the
mind is not right=
, whatever else may be, there is no peace. The mind becomes
ripe according =
to each person's fitness. A nastik (an agnostic) becomes an
astik (a believ=
er), an astik becomes a bhakta, a bhakta becomes a jignasu
(one desirous of=
 Knowledge) and a jignasu becomes a Jnani. This refers to
the mind only.Wha=
t is the use of saying it refers to the body? If the mind
is happy, not onl=
y the body but the whole world will be happy.So one must
find out the way o=
f becoming happy oneself. One cannot do this except by
finding out about on=
eself by Self-enquiry.

To think of reforming the world without doing that =
is like thinking of
covering the whole world with leather to avoid the pain=
 caused by walking on
stones and thorns when the much simpler method of wea=
ring leather shoes is
available. When by holding an umbrella over your head=
 you can avoid the sun,
will it be possible to cover the face of the whole =
earth by tying a cloth
over it to avoid the sun? If a person realises his p=
osition and stays in his
own self, things that are to happen will happen.Th=
ings that are not to
happen will not happen.The shakti that is in the world=
, is only one. All
these troubles arise if we think that we are separate fr=
om that shakti."

Nagamma: Letters, 17.05.1947

In the beginning one has to be =
told
that he is not the body, because
he thinks that he is the body only.
W=
hereas he is the body and all else.
The body is only a part.
Let him know i=
t, finally.
He must first discern consciousness
from insentience
and be the=
 consciousness only.
Later, let him realize that insentience
is not apart f=
rom consciousness.
This is discrimination [viveka]
The initial discriminati=
on
must persist to the end.
It's fruit is Liberation.

D.: Is not dhyana on=
e of the efficient processes for Realisation?

M.: Dhyana is concentration =
on an object. It fulfils the purpose of keeping
away diverse thoughts and f=
ixing the mind on a single thought, which must
also disappear before Realis=
ation. But Realisation is nothing new to be
acquired. It is already there, =
but obstructed by a screen of thoughts. All
our attempts are directed for l=
ifting this screen and then Realisation is
revealed. If a true seeker is ad=
vised to meditate, many may go away
satisfied with the advice. But someone =
among them may turn round and ask,
"Who am I to meditate on an object?" Suc=
h a one must be told to find the
Self. That is the finality. That is Vichar=
a.

D.: Will vichara alone do in the absence of meditation?

M.: Vichara is=
 the process and the goal also. 'I AM' is the goal and the
final Reality. T=
o hold to it with effort is vichara. When spontaneous and
natural it is Rea=
lisation.

Effortless and choiceless awareness is our Real State. If we can=
 attain It
or be in It, it is all right. But one cannot reach It without ef=
fort, the
effort of deliberate meditation. All the agelong vasanas (latent =
tendencies)
carry the mind outwards and turn it to external objects. All su=
ch thoughts
have to be given up and the mind turned inward. For most people=
 effort is
necessary. Of course, everybody, every book says summa iru (be q=
uiet or
still). But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessar=
y. Even
if you find one who has effortlessly achieved the mouna (silence) o=
r Supreme
State you may take it that the effort necessary has already been =
completed
in a previous life. Such effortless and choiceless awareness is r=
eached only
after deliberate meditation.
