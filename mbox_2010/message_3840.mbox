Namaste,
 
> How to achieve it effectivey?
 
If it can be achieved easily, =
we will not have so many spiritual paths and so many sadhanas. All spiritua=
l paths, scriptures, teachings and spiritual sadhanas are meant for this on=
ly.
 
Vasishtha teaches in Yoga Vaasishtham that one can read scriptures, c=
ontemplate their teachings, spend time in the company of spiritual people a=
nd engage in one's natural activities with dispassion, in order to progress=
 fast.
 
*        *        *
 
Let me quote something from Ramakrishna. Loo=
k at your belongings (spouse, children, job, house, cars, wealth, name, fam=
e, and even body) as the property of god. Imagine that you are a temporary =
caretaker, just as a servant may be living in a rich person's house as the =
caretaker as that person stays away. Think of all that is in your hands as =
the sacred property of your master and take care like a committed servant. =
A servant takes the best care of his master's property, but does not get at=
tached. Do not be attached anything and yet take the best possible care. If=
 something goes wrong, do not worry too much and tell yourself that the mas=
ter will take care of it when he gets a chance to look at it. Think for a m=
oment how a servant taking care of the properties of a master living away t=
hinks and behaves.
 
If one can attain the spirit and mental state of the s=
ervant in this analogy, one's life will be made.
 
*        *        *
 
Re=
ad what Manish wrote below:
 
<<<<Once you take Time out of the equation (b=
ecause a deity has a different time space frame which runs in thousands of =
years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiting with patience, then wh=
ere will God go? God has to come, He can't escape.>>>>
 
Take time out of t=
he equation, i.e. do not put a time limit or say "I have done this sadhana =
for XYZ years. Why is God not coming?" Wait patiently. After all, if you ha=
ve truly surrendered, why is it a problem then to wait, let us say, 1000 ye=
ars for Her grace? If you say "I want Her to come in 1 year or 10 years and=
 not 1000 years", that means you have not fully surrendered.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
> How to measure it?
 
One can measure it by seeing how one is in=
ternally reacting to challenging circumstances that would earlier provoke l=
ust, anger, greed, jealosy etc inside one.
 
However, what will one do by m=
easuring? It is not like one can turn a knob based on the measurement to co=
rrect it.
 
In fact, when surrender is completeone you will stop measuring =
or even thinking about how to measure it.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
