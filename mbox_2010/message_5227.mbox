Namaste,

Is there a deeper significance to Ravana being such a great devot=
ee of Shiva? 
After all, he and Kumbakarana were Jaya and Vijaya, dwarapala=
s (doorkeepers) of 
Vaikunta and worshipers of Vishnu,  who had to take bir=
th 3 times to experience 
the curse of the four sons of Brahma!

How much purity is enough and for what purpose ? Ravana brought the Shi=
va linga 
from Shiva himself, Baidyanath Jyotirlinga, whose sacredness is s=
ufficient proof 
of purity of Ravanas' sadhana and his success with mantras=
.

There is a list of Ravanas' works:

/cmsa/index.php?option=3Dcom_content&view=3Darticle&id=3D99:ravanas-contrib=
utions&catid=3D31:general&Itemid=3D70


While Ravana is portrayed as a vill=
ain in an ethical sense than any other, he 
certainly wielded more power, b=
y virtue of his knowledge of Veda and Mantra, 
than all other characters in=
 the story combined except Hanumaan who was Rudra 
Avatara and used all his=
 divine powers to turn the face of war.

> But, people like Ravana, Hiranya=
kashipu etc fell in the end!

Even the city of dwarkapuri fell after Krishn=
a, and Krishna succumbed to a 
mortal wound, but nobody decries his folly t=
hat led to this fall. Rama is no 
different than parashurama - because on e=
arth, a great person is one who subdues 
his enemies by force.

 The instinct of self-preservation is another aspect of ego. A person with =

. I am a strong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate answ=
ers to things not in our control. Thank you for sharing this simple mantras=
 with the readers; literally hundreds would benefit from this as they seek =
their solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on internal strengths =
(of individuals) and become stronger to overcome difficulties.<br>
