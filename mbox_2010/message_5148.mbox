But it is not easy to find what exactly one's dharma is! Arjuna was lucky
a=
nd had a guru like Krishna, who told him his dharma was to kill those
armie=
s of relatives, gurus, elders etc. Shankaracharya was lucky to have a
guru =
like Govinda Bhagavatpada, who told him he had to write commentaries on
Ved=
ic literature and debate. Vivekananda was lucky to have a guru like
Ramakri=
shna who begged him not go to Himalayas and asked to spread the
knowledge o=
f Sanatana Dharma in India and abroad.

* * *

How do we find what *our* dh=
arma is? It is not easy! If you have a trusted
guru, follow him/her. Otherw=
ise, follow the internal guru, i.e. the
instincts from your conscience. Unf=
ortunately, one sees one's dharma clearly
only if one is pure. And, one bec=
omes pure only if one fulfills most of
one's dharma. This is a catch-22 sit=

Although this is not jyotish forum...still, it is connected ---  =
maybe you
have time/will to answer this: as jyotishi, one should be able to=
 see
exactly one's dharma in birth chart. Is there some clear procedure to =

dharma in this way?

 <br>
The=
 word yajna (or even the word homa) means an act of offering a sacrifice. T=
he fire ritual in which physical materials are offered to deities in fire i=
s dravya yajna (material sacrifice).<br>
 <br>
The real yajna is one where =
various actions that are performed based on one's dharma are sacrificed=
 in the internal fire of wisdom (i.e. the knowledge that God acts through u=
s). Of course, if one says "god is doing this through me" as a me=
re formality, but secretly entertains thoughts like "I am doing this&q=
uot;, "I did it" etc, then one is not really *sacrificing* the ac=
tion. It is akin to pretending to throw some material into fire in a fire r=
itual, but not really throwing it or throwing it outside of the fire. It do=
es not burn and does not reach god. Only materials thrown inside the fire a=
nd burnt fully will be considered to have been sacrificed to gods. Similarl=
y, only if the sense of doership and ownership over an action is completely=
 surrendered to god can we say that one has sacrificed that action in the i=
nternal fire of wisdom.<br>

 <br>
Lord is essentially saying below that ac=
tions performed without surrendering the doership to Lord completely become=
 bondages and actions performed and completely sacrificed to Lord in the in=
ternal fire, i.e. completely surrendered to Lord, do not bind one. Whether =
you do a good act and a bad act, it binds you as long as you think that you=
 are doing it.<br>

 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
Depending on your d=
harma, what you do may vary. You may be teaching spiritual knowledge. You m=
ay be doing rituals for establishing sanatana dharma. You may be doing ritu=
als for the victory of a ruler. You may be fighting an election to be a pre=
sident. You may be fighting a physical war with enemies. You may be doing b=
usiness and making money to build a temple. You may be begging on the stree=
ts and living with dogs. You may be doing anything. But, the key is to give=
 up the doership to the Lord and erase the notion that "I am doing&quo=

 <br>

 <br>
In order to kindle the internal fire=
 and make it burn well, we use an external fire as a symbol in the beginnin=
g. As we spend time with external fire, the internal fire is kindled by res=
onance. That is why an external fire ritual is recommended to sadhakas.<br>=


 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
Regarding swa-dharma, two points:<br>=

 <br>
First point: One's varna may or may not be shown by the family o=
f birth. One's varna is to be determined by one's aptitude and the =
direction in which one's conditioning pulls one.<br>
 <br>
Second point=
: A brahmana's job is not just to do rituals. A brahmana's job is t=
o pursue knowledge and self-realization and become a beacon of knowledge fo=
r the society. One can do that by engaging in rituals for dharma in the soc=
iety or teach people or just do tapascharya or so many other things.<br>

 =
<br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
Though Krishna's directive to Arjuna=
 has been interpreted in the context of varnashrama or, loosely speaking, c=
aste system, it is not so simple. Krishna asked Arjuna to follow "swa-=
dharma", i.e. one's own dharma, and avoid paradharma, i.e. other p=
eople's dharma. It is not that there are four kinds of dharma in the wo=
rld. Each person has one's own dharma, that is decided based on who one=
 has been in previous lives, what karmik debts one has, what desires and co=
nditioning one has, and what abilities one has. Each person has a unique dh=
arma.<br>

 <br>
But it is not easy to find what exactly one's dharma i=
s! Arjuna was lucky and had a guru like Krishna, who told him his dharma wa=
s to kill those armies of relatives, gurus, elders etc. Shankaracharya was =
lucky to have a guru like Govinda Bhagavatpada, who told him he had to writ=
e commentaries on Vedic literature and debate. Vivekananda was lucky to hav=
e a guru like Ramakrishna who begged him not go to Himalayas and asked to s=
pread the knowledge of Sanatana Dharma in India and abroad.<br>

 <br>
*   =
     *        *<br>
 <br>
How do we find what *our* dharma is? It is not ea=
sy! If you have a trusted guru, follow him/her. Otherwise, follow the inter=
nal guru, i.e. the instincts from your conscience. Unfortunately, one sees =
one's dharma clearly only if one is pure. And, one becomes pure only if=
 one fulfills most of one's dharma. This is a catch-22 situation.<br>

=
 <br>
The simplest algorithm is to listen to your trusted guru (an external=
 person or internal conscience), discharge the dharma as said by guru and t=
ry to increase surrender and detachment in actions. As detachment increases=
 and some dharma gets fulfilled, purity increases and clarity on what one&#=
39;s dharma is increases. As that happens, one can become more detached. An=
d so on. If one keeps doing this patiently and keeps doing sadhana and cont=
emplation, one will eventually break through into right track.<br>
