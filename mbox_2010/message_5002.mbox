Pranams to all
I feel better we compare such tests with chemistry,for examp=
le a litmus test.Feel yourself as a solution and tests are like Litmus pape=
r,if solution is acidic litmus will turn blue and if it is basic then it wi=
ll be pink,tests will go on untill solution(we)become neutral and then ther=
e will not be any color on litmus paper.
Before we paint our house we apply=
 sandpaper to make surface little rought,same logic is applicable here,reme=
mber new coating one cannot apply on smooth surface hence a need for sand p=
aper.

Dear Lear=
ned members,
=C2=A0
Humble namaskaram to all of you!! Although I am inferio=
r to all of you but still I would like to offer my two cents.=C2=A0 I belie=
ve the karmic blockages one suffers are not tests. The real tests are the o=
ne that God takes to check on our internal enemies.=C2=A0 It is easy to tac=
kle the=C2=A0karmic blockage=C2=A0but not easy to pass these tests .
=C2=A0=

There have been examples where members quoted how they were standing in a =
stall and suddenly a woman came up to him asking for money. We are hesitant=
 to give money the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil mi=
nded etc comes in our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because of o=
ur attachment towards money? Who cares give the money and let God take care=
 of it. There are similar tests Mother takes and they become difficult as o=
ne progresses. Also be warned mother punishes those who fail. Hence the fac=
t that one need not fear mother and keep praying is wrong. Just like a kid =
that won't listen until a fear is instilled in his mind similarly sadhakas =
won't reform the ways if there is no fear instilled in our mind. Hence fear=
 is needed,=C2=A0Keep praying her with devotion, 100% surrender=C2=A0to her=
 at the same time fight the internal enemies=C2=A0is what I have learned so=
 far. 
=C2=A0
Also I disagree with the fact that one should ignore the test=
s. These tests are similar to the one we take in college exams. One has to =
be prepared for it mentally. Without preparation one will keep failing and =
make no progress. 
=C2=A0
Coming to the point why tests are needed ...they =
are needed to cleanse our souls.=C2=A0Only with soul cleansing one can come=
=C2=A0closer to God. =C2=A0
=C2=A0
Like I said I am very inferior in my thi=
nking and maybe wrong. Hence kindly don't take my words as disrespectful bu=
t its just my opinion and members may feel free to correct my thinking. 
=
=C2=A0
Thanks and Regards,
Priya

Dear KK and All

Thank you very much for agreeing with=
 my small explanation about "test" by Shakthi.
To put more more clearly, on=
e performs the spiritual sadhana keeping in mind=C2=A0 one's
"ishta devata"=
 to enhance one's soul to the higher self.=C2=A0 It is only fringe benefits=
 if one
come across materialistic benefits in the process.=C2=A0 The main a=
im and success is only to enhance one's soul to the higher plane.=C2=A0 Any=
 test or sufferings by the physical body in no way affect the enhancement o=
f the soul.=C2=A0 The physical body suffers because the Karma
one has done.=
=C2=A0 But it is to be understood, any spritual sadhana has got great poten=
tial
not only to enhance the soul; but also bestow the materialistic benefi=
ts, just like that.

Hence it is absolutely necessary to continue the spiri=
tual process instead of diverting the 
energies by thinking about 'test' an=
d 'problems which will automatically grant the material
benefits also.

=C2=A0Hi,


"Regardi=

I tend to agree =
with this explanation...in my view..testing a is a very over rated activity=
..i guess since the ultimate goal is to reach the mother/shakti/narayana/sh=
iva/ whatever that highest form that one can=C2=A0visualize..and if the=C2=
=A0deity=C2=A0is responding and trying to take us there..it is our own weak=
nesses that is pulling us from reaching the ultimate..and this we perceive =
it as test.....


test is what we have it in our mind....we need to overcom=
e our=C2=A0weaknesses to really reach the ultimate and its a process... we =
should not be worried if its a test or something else... honestly..how many=
 of us can really withstand if the deity really wishes to test us...its our=
 our own innate fears of loosing our valued/loved things makes us think tha=
t its a test..






Bottomline: probably as what i have understood from Na=
rasimha's guidance through this forum is =C2=A0Forget all those fears of te=
st etc..try to develop an attitude to surrender to god as mush as possible.=
..everything will be inline...


i'm not sure if i could put across this in=

Dear All

According to me, Shakthi worship is =
the most appropriate for the present day.=C2=A0 Our legends say that Devi P=
