Dear Shiva,

I will try to get the books you have mentioned. Though I=
 do have some confusions regarding some aspects of his writings, however I =
agree that I have never come across anyone who has such clearly demarcated=
=C2=A0the different layers of consciousness.

Dear Rajarshi,

Sri Aurobindo's yoga is I=
ntegral, which means it _also_ includes material existence which is nothing=
 but condensed consciousness. It is a different path from most others which=
 call the world as maya and body consciousness as something to be forgotten=
 or gotten rid of. 

Our physical body as such is not plastic enough. The n=
ature of Universe or the expression of consciousness (Divine Mother) is con=
stant change / progress. So the body has to die and soul housed in a new fo=
rm as time progresses. All Rishis / Naths do not live for ever in the same =
material body as ours. Either their body is transformed or they will have t=
o lose their body after some time. By power of yoga one can prolong existin=
g body into several centuries or even few thousand years, but that body wil=
l still be mortal. The necessary condition for that is the matter that form=
s the body regaining its consciousness and becomes totally fluid - a body o=
f light can be immortal as it can modify itself as per the flow of the guid=
ing consciousness. So there will not be a necessity to break that form and =
create another new form. It can simply transform. That is the essense (atle=
ast in my understanding) of what Sri Aurobindo refers to as physical immort=
ality. He and
 the Mother have explained it more clearly in some other plac=
es but I am not able to find it now. 

As per Sri Aurobindo, there has been=
 few being who might have attained Supramental descent and even partial tra=
nsformation personally but not the full supramental transformation. Besides=
, as per him, unless the transformation is collective, individual transform=
ation is not perfect. 

Supramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja=
 Samadhi. In Sahaja Samadhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brah=
man, but body still is unconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature=
 and they remain mostly detached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Ma=
harishi). A person in Sahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk=
. His/her body will also be transformed to some extent to host the immense =
shakthi and vibration of the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from=
 what Sri Aurobindo calls as Supramental transformation. 

However, in Supr=
amental transformation, the matter of the body _also_ is transformed to exp=
ress the Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too =
other than body transformation. 

If you have time and are interested, I wo=
uld suggest you read "Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness" by S=
atprem. It is a not a large book but may take a loong time to read and assi=
milate. It very lucidly and clearly delineates different stages of consciou=
sness from a very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to=
 vital, mental, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a u=
nique biography which deals not with mundane life details of the subject, b=
ut his journey through consciousness and while doing that explains various =
finer stages and aspects of consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biogr=
aphies of other Masters are written in that way, it would be amazing. 

Wha=
t ever I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the =
topic at all. I really mean it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the p=
ost. This topic needs a very subtle and sublime treatment stemming at least=
 in part from corresponding inner experiences & realizations which I am not=
 capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have done =
it. Once "Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness" is read, then all of=
 Sri Aurobindo's works and what he says about Supramental descent and trans=
formation can be comprehended more easily. Alternately one can start with t=
he works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit's writings are very lucid, pr=
ofound and illuminating.

BTW, I read with interest your thread "Rama Nam S=
atha Hai". Thanks for sharing.

Warm regards,
Shiva.

<DIV>Dear Rajarshi,=
<BR><BR>Sri Aurobindo's yoga is Integral, which means it _also_ includes ma=
terial existence which is nothing but condensed consciousness. It is a diff=
erent path from most others which call the world as maya and body conscious=
ness as something to be forgotten or gotten rid of. <BR><BR>Our physical bo=
dy as such is not plastic enough. The nature of Universe or the expression =
of consciousness (Divine Mother) is constant change / progress. So the body=
 has to die and soul housed in a new form as time progresses. All Rishis / =
Naths do not live for ever in the same material body as ours. Either their =
body is transformed or they will have to lose their body after some time. B=
y power of yoga one can prolong existing body into several centuries or eve=
n few thousand years, but that body will still be mortal. The necessary con=
dition for that is the matter that forms the body regaining its consciousne=
ss and becomes totally fluid - a body of light
 can be immortal as it can m=
odify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousness. So there will no=
t be a necessity to break that form and create another new form. It can sim=
ply transform. That is the essense (atleast in my understanding) of what Sr=
i Aurobindo refers to as physical immortality. He and the Mother have expla=
ined it more clearly in some other places but I am not able to find it now.=
 <BR><BR>As per Sri Aurobindo, there has been few being who might have atta=
ined Supramental descent and even partial transformation personally but not=
 the full supramental transformation. Besides, as per him, unless the trans=
formation is collective, individual transformation is not perfect. <BR><BR>=
Supramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja Samadhi. In Sahaja Sama=
dhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but body still is u=
nconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they remain mostly =
detached from the body consciousness
 (Eg. Ramana Maharishi). A person in S=
ahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her body will als=
o be transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi and vibration o=
f the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri Aurobindo cal=
ls as Supramental transformation. <BR><BR>However, in Supramental transform=
ation, the matter of the body _also_ is transformed to express the Sat-Chit=
-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too other than body t=
ransformation. <BR><BR>If you have time and are interested, I would suggest=
 you read "Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness" by Satprem. It =
is a not a large book but may take a loong time to read and assimilate. It =
very lucidly and clearly delineates different stages of consciousness from =
a very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to vital, men=
tal, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a unique biogr=
aphy which deals not with
 mundane life details of the subject, but his jou=
rney through consciousness and while doing that explains various finer stag=
es and aspects of consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biographies of =
other Masters are written in that way, it would be amazing. <BR><BR>What ev=
er I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the topi=
c at all. I really mean it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the post.=
 This topic needs a very subtle and sublime treatment stemming at least in =
part from corresponding inner experiences & realizations which I am not=
 capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have done =
it. Once "Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness" is read, then all of=
 Sri Aurobindo's works and what he says about Supramental descent and trans=
formation can be comprehended more easily. Alternately one can start with t=
he works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit's writings are very lucid, pr=
ofound and
 illuminating.<BR><BR>BTW, I read with interest your thread "Ram=
a Nam Satha Hai". Thanks for sharing.<BR><BR>Warm regards,<BR>Shiva.<BR><BR=
