Yes, even I think one ha=
s to follow Dharma. But again Dharma is personal. One's Dharma gets refined=
 by following detachment in actions.

------
Here is a repost of PVRji on D=
harma and Attachment:


As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Kri=
shna clearly says in
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is dangerou=
s to follow someone
else's dharma".

Following the path of dharma basically=
 means engaging in the right
action/duty. Right action varies from person t=
o person, from time to time
and from place to place. It is dependent on wha=
t nature expects from you,
which in turn is based on who you have been in t=
he past, what actions you
did in the past while identifying with the action=
, who you affected in the
past (and how) with the actions that you identifi=
ed with, what debts you
created in the process, and what mental tendencies =
you accumulated until
now.

If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic=
 debts, nature wants a person
to kill evil persons, that becomes one's dhar=
ma. If, based on one's mental
tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a p=
erson to spread the message of
uniformity of all religions, that becomes on=
e's dharma. If, based on one's
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=
ants a person to spread the
ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one'=
s dharma. If, based on one's
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=
ts a person to make a lot of
money and construct a temple, that becomes one=
's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a being may change from one life to anothe=
r.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his guru=
s,
elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much wei=
ght
on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremend=
ous
destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great ext=
ent,
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great war=
rior,
it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and=

respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.

When=
 the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of
Ramakrishna P=
aramahamsa's sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a
previous life, a=
ccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this
new time and pl=
ace. He was born to renounce material life despite his
aristocratic upbring=
ing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire
generations to embrace a=
 simple life of mental detachment and service to
others. When he is born ag=
ain (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna
said), his dharma based on th=
e time and place may be something else.

* * *

The tricky question is: How=
 does one decide what is one's dharma?

Some people have interpreted Krishn=
a's words saying "follow your own dharma
and not someone else's dharma" in =
the light of castism. Though the concept
of caste (varna) has been there in=
 Hinduism for a long time, the concept of
caste mobility was very much ther=
e. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by
killing birds. He became a brahmana an=
d a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a
kshatrita and a powerful king. He bec=
ame a brahmana and and a maharshi
later. Basically varna shows one's aptitu=
de. One starts off with the varna
of father, because that is what one is ex=
posed to in childhood. As one
develops in life, one gets one's own varna ba=
sed on what one does.

Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which=
 tells you to know your
dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there ar=
e not just 4 dharmas in
the world. Each person has individual dharma.

Know=
ing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure
enough=
, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our
mind =
that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of
noise fr=
om other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get
confused.=


We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition a=
nd
decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but do=
ing
the best we can is all that we can do!

More than following dharma, wha=
t is of utmost importance is to engage in
actions without identification. *=
That* alone ensures that we are not
accumulating new karmas, i.e. not incre=
asing the load. We should not build
too much attachment to what we are doin=
g. We should engage in the best
possible actions (based on our best judgmen=
t on what our dharma in the given
situation is), with as little attachment =
and self-identification with the
action as possible. When the action is fin=
ished, we should leave the result
to god. We should not think "I did it", "=
what will happen now", "will it
work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma=
 yoga (unfication through
untached action) will simplify our ego and purify=
 our consciousness slowly.
As we become purer, our mind will work sharper a=
nd tell our dharma clearer.
There is a positive feedback here. This will sl=
owly enable us to see our
dharma clearly and follow it without incurring ne=
w karmas. This is not easy,
but not as difficult as people think.

The bott=
omline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of
"this =
is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in action with
little a=
ttachment.

* * *

In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition =
are the inputs.
Another external input is the words of scriptures and learn=
ed men. One can
derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to =
one's spiritual
master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can ta=
ke the words of
the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerel=
y.

When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing =
gurus
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified =
his
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dh=
arma
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadh=
ana,
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=
terial
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One who is not in tune wit=
h nature and does not know who one is, what one's
debts are and what nature=
 expects from one can err in the judgment of what
one's dharma is. If one's=
 guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into
one's inner core, such =
a guru can give perfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline is that I (or anybody)=
 cannot outline a set of principles and
declare that as the dharma. No, dha=
rma changes from person to person, from
time to time and from place to plac=
e. Also, there are no thumbrules to find
out what one's dharma is. But, one=
 can refine one's understanding of one's
dharma by increasing internal puri=
ty. By doing various kinds of spiritual
sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=
 engaging in actions without much
attachment, one can slowly purify oneself=
 and refine one's understanding of
one's individual dharma.

br>destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great exte=
nt,<br>to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great w=
arrior,<br>

it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lo=
ved and<br>respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill t=
hem.<br><br>When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one =
of<br>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in=
 a<br>

previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different=
 in this<br>new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despi=
te his<br>aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and in=
spire<br>

generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and se=
rvice to<br>others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ram=
akrishna<br>said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something =
else.<br>

<br>* * *<br><br>The tricky question is: How does one decide wha=
t is one's dharma?<br><br>Some people have interpreted Krishna's words sayi=
ng "follow your own dharma<br>and not someone else's dharma" in the light o=
f castism. Though the concept<br>

of caste (varna) has been there in Hindu=
ism for a long time, the concept of<br>caste mobility was very much there. =
Valmiki was a shudra who lived by<br>killing birds. He became a brahmana an=
d a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a<br>

kshatrita and a powerful king. H=
e became a brahmana and and a maharshi<br>later. Basically varna shows one'=
s aptitude. One starts off with the varna<br>of father, because that is wha=
t one is exposed to in childhood. As one<br>

develops in life, one gets on=
e's own varna based on what one does.<br><br>Thus, the misinterpretation of=
 Krishna's words which tells you to know your<br>dharma from your caste is =
wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in<br>

the world. Each perso=
n has individual dharma.<br><br>Knowing what one's dharma is is very very v=
ery difficult. If one is pure<br>enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In f=
act, all of us have a part of our<br>mind that tells us what our dharma is,=
 but it is surrounded by a lot of<br>

noise from other parts of our minds =
which tell other things. Thus, we get<br>confused.<br><br>We should make th=
e best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and<br>decide what i=
s our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing<br>

the bes=
t we can is all that we can do!<br><br>More than following dharma, what is =
of utmost importance is to engage in<br>actions without identification. *Th=
at* alone ensures that we are not<br>accumulating new karmas, i.e. not incr=
easing the load. We should not build<br>

too much attachment to what we ar=
e doing. We should engage in the best<br>possible actions (based on our bes=
t judgment on what our dharma in the given<br>situation is), with as little=
 attachment and self-identification with the<br>

action as possible. When =
the action is finished, we should leave the result<br>to god. We should not=
 think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it<br>work" etc. Such adhe=
rence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through<br>

untached action) will=
 simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.<br>As we become pure=
r, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.<br>There is a po=
sitive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our<br>

dharma cle=
arly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,<br>but n=
ot as difficult as people think.<br><br>The bottomline is: Even if one is n=
ot following one's dharma, one's sense of<br>"this is my dharma" gets refin=
ed with time if one engages in action with<br>

little attachment.<br><br>*=
 * *<br><br>In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the=
 inputs.<br>Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned m=
en. One can<br>derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to o=
ne's spiritual<br>

master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one ca=
n take the words of<br>the master to determine one's dharma and follow it s=
incerely.<br><br>When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and tho=
ught killing gurus<br>

and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Kris=
hna who clarified his<br>dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was =
confused about his dharma<br>and wanted to renounce the world and go to a s=
ecluded place to do sadhana,<br>

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevail=
ed upon him to stay in the material<br>world and do the work of Mother for =
him.<br><br>One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is=
, what one's<br>debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the j=
udgment of what<br>

one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul wit=
h a clear insight into<br>one's inner core, such a guru can give perfect gu=
idance.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outlin=
e a set of principles and<br>

declare that as the dharma. No, dharma chang=
es from person to person, from<br>time to time and from place to place. Als=
o, there are no thumbrules to find<br>out what one's dharma is. But, one ca=
n refine one's understanding of one's<br>

dharma by increasing internal pu=
rity. By doing various kinds of spiritual<br>sadhana (like homam, japam etc=
) and engaging in actions without much<br>attachment, one can slowly purify=
 oneself and refine one's understanding of<br>

one's individual dharma.<br=
