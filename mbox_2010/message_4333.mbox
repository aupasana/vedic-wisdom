 =E2=80=98Be still and know that I am God=E2=80=99. To be still is not to t=
hink. Know, and
not think, is the word! (Talks, 131).

Solitude is in the m=
ind of man. One might be in the thick of the world and
maintain serenity of=
 mind; such a one is in solitude. Another may stay in
the forest but still =
be unable to control his mind. He cannot be said to be
in solitude. Solitud=
e is a function of the mind. A man attached to desire
cannot get solitude w=
herever he many be; a detached man is always in
solitude. (Talks, 20).

You=
 can never find the mind through mind. Pass beyond it in order to find it
n=
on-existent. (Talks, 473).

All thoughts are inconsistent with realisation.=
 The correct state is to
exclude thoughts of ourselves and all other though=
ts.Thought is one thing
and realisation is quite another. (Talks, 30).

It =
must be clearly understood that meditation is not prohibited in the
absence=
 of asanas or prescribed times or any accessories of the kind.
(Talks, 17).=


There is no jnana as it is commonly understood. The ordinary ideas of jna=
na
and ajnana are only relative and false.They are not real and therefore n=
ot
abiding. The true state is the non-dual Self. It is eternal and abides
w=
hether one is aware
or not. (Talks, 499).

Jnana, once revealed, takes time=
 to steady itself. The Self is certainly
within the direct experience of ev=
eryone, but not as one imagines it to be.
It is only as It is. (Talks, 141)=
.

Experience is said to be temporary or permanent. The first experience is=

temporary and by concentration it can become permanent. In the former the
=
bondage is not completely destroyed; it remains subtle and reasserts itself=

in due course.But in the latter it is destroyed root and branch, never to
=
appear again. (Talks, 95).

There is no investigation into the Atman. The i=
nvestigation can only be into
the non-Self. Elimination of the non-Self is =
alone possible. The Self being
always self-evident will shine forth of itse=
lf. (Talks, 78).

Jnana-marga and bhakti-marga are one and the same. Selfsu=
rrender leads to
realisation just as enquiry does. Complete self-surrender =
means that you
have no further thought of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.Then all your=
 vasanas are washed off and you
are free. You should not continue as a sepa=
rate entity at the end of either
course. (Talks, 31).

Surrender unreserved=
ly. One of the two things must be done: either surrender
because you admit =
your inability and also require a Higher Power to help
you; or investigate =
into the cause of misery, go to the source and merge
into the Self. Either =
way you will be free from misery. God never forsakes
one who has surrendere=
d. (Talks, 363).

Surrender is to give oneself up to the original source of=
 one=E2=80=99s being. Do
not delude yourself by imagining such source to be=
 some God outside you.
One=E2=80=99s source is within oneself.Give yourself=
 up to it. That means that you
should seek the source and merge in it. (Tal=
ks, 111).

If on the other hand you merge in the Self there will be no indi=
viduality
left. You will become the Source itself. In that case...what is s=
urrender?
Who is to surrender and to whom? This constitutes devotion, wisdo=
m and
investigation. (Talks, 208).

The =E2=80=98Gita=E2=80=99 starts sayin=
g that you are not the body, that you are not
therefore the doer. So one sh=
ould act without thinking that oneself is the
actor. The actions go on desp=
ite this egolessness.The person has come into
manifestation for a certain p=
urpose.That purpose will be accomplished
whether he considers himself the a=
ctor or not. (Talks, 643).

How do we know that actions are ours or not?...=
 If the fruits of actions do
not affect the person, he is free from action.=
 (Talks, 40).

The one infinite Unbroken Whole (plenum) becomes aware of It=
self as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.
This is the original name. All other names,e.g=
., OM, are later growths.
Liberation is only to remain aware of the Self. T=
he Mahavakya =E2=80=98I am Brahman=E2=80=99
is its authority.Though the =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99 is always experienced, yet one=E2=80=99s attention
has to =
be drawn to it. Then only knowledge dawns. Thus the need for the
instructio=
n of the Upanishads and of wise sages. (Talks, 92).

The ultimate Truth is =
so simple. It is nothing more than being in the
pristine state. This is all=
 that need be said. (Talks, 96).

Reality is one only. How can it be realis=
ed? Realisation is thus an
illusion. Practice seems to be necessary. Who is=
 to practise? Looking for
the doer, the act and the accessories disappear. =
Moreover, if Realisation is
not present here and now,how can it, newly got,=
 be of any use? Realise what
is present here and now. The sages did so befo=
re and still do that
only.Hence they say that it looks as if newly got. Onc=
e veiled by ignorance
and later revealed, Reality looks as if newly realise=
d.But it is not new.
(Talks, 439).
