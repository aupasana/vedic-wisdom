The Tamil Poet Muruganar came to Sri Ramana in 1923.

Once he said about Sr=
i Ramana, =E2=80=9CHe is the robber chief. He has taken three =E2=80=93
my =
body, my mind and life itself =E2=80=93 and given in return one only, that =
One,
Indivisible Supreme!=E2=80=9D

In 1932, M.A. Piggot was the first West=
ern woman to visit him. More
Westerners followed, such as Maurice Frydman a=
nd the famous film star
Mercedes De Acosta. In 1938 Mercedes De Acosta spok=
e with Sri Ramana about
the spiritual Heart. He pointed to the right side o=
f her chest and said,
=E2=80=9CHere lies the Heart=E2=80=9D. This made such=
 a deep impression on her that she gave
her autobiography the title =E2=80=
=98Here lies the Heart=E2=80=99.

Paramahansa Yogananda and Swami Ramdas we=
re also among the visitors. A
meeting with Mahatma Gandhi almost took place=
, when one day Gandhi gave a
talk in Tiruvannamalai. But as his car drove p=
ast the Ashram gate, his
companion gave a sign to the driver to drive on an=
d so it did not happen.
Later Krishnaswami visited Mahatma Gandhi in Madras=
. When he introduced
himself as a resident of Ramanashram, the Mahatma repl=
ied, =E2=80=9CI would love to
come and see Bhagavan but I don=E2=80=99t kno=
w when the time will come.=E2=80=9D

When a devotee brought a nice walking =
stick with a silver handle for Sri
Ramana he said jokingly, =E2=80=9CGood. =
It is very nice. Please use it carefully.=E2=80=9D
The disciple replied, =
=E2=80=9CBut it is not for my use. I have brought it thinking
that Bhagavan=
 would use it.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhat an idea!=E2=80=9D, said Ramana. =E2=
=80=9CA nice walking
stick with a silver handle should be used only by offi=
cials like you. Why
for me? Look, I have my own walking stick. That is enou=
gh.=E2=80=9D

At the beginning of the forties a devotee brought an electric=
 table fan for
Ramana. The answer was as usual, =E2=80=9CWhy this fan? The =
ordinary fan is there.
We have hands. I will fan myself with it whenever ne=
cessary. Why do I
require all these things?=E2=80=9D But the devotee would =
not leave it at that and
argued, =E2=80=9CIs it not some trouble? If the el=
ectric fan is used there is no
trouble whatsoever.=E2=80=9D But Ramana repl=
ied, =E2=80=9CWhat is the trouble? If the
ordinary fan is used we get just =
as much breeze as we want. The electric fan
blows too much breeze and with =
a whizzing noise. Moreover, some electric
current is consumed. For that, th=
ere will be a bill. Why should we make the
office bear that expense on our =
account?=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana repeatedly complained about the many things w=
hich were offered to
him and which he did not actually need, =E2=80=9CI am =
a poor man. For my status,
even what I now have is too much. This sofa, the=
se mattresses, these pillows
=E2=80=93 why all these? You people
do not agr=
ee, but how happy would it be if I could spread out this towel and
sit on t=
he floor!=E2=80=9D Mudaliar replied, =E2=80=9CYou say even that towel shoul=
d be no
bigger than the present one!=E2=80=9D Ramana replied,=E2=80=9D Why =
a bigger one? It is
half-a-yard broad and three-quarters of a yard long. It=
 is sufficient for
drying the body after bath, for spreading over the head =
if you walk in the
sun, for tying round the neck if it is cold and for spre=
ading on the floor
to sit on. What more could we do with a bigger one?=E2=
=80=9D

All his life Sri Ramana resisted being venerated as a Guru. The dis=
ciple
shows his veneration, for example, by touching the feet of the master=
.
However this was strictly forbidden at Ramanashram.

When Roda McIver fel=
t a deep longing to touch Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s feet,he answered,
=E2=80=9CW=
hy do you want to touch these feet? Bhagavan=E2=80=99s feet are over your h=
ead.=E2=80=9D And
to another devotee who expressed the desire, to lay his h=
ead on his feet, he
put the question, =E2=80=9CWhich is the foot and which =
is the head?=E2=80=9D The devotee
knew not what to answer. After a while Ma=
harshi said, =E2=80=9CWhere the self
merges, that is the foot. It is in one=
=E2=80=99s own self. The feeling =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, t=
he
ego, is the head. Where that ego dissolves, that is the foot of the Guru=
.=E2=80=9D

Prostration (namaskaram) is also widely used as an expression o=
f veneration
for Guru and God. With hands folded above the head the devotee=
 throws
himself flat on the ground, face downwards.When devotees entered th=
e Hall,
they used to do namaskaram to Sri Ramana and occasionally they also=
 overdid
it. But the Maharshi repeatedly stressed that the real namaskaram =
is in the
heart. When a man prostrated innumerable times to him, he said, =
=E2=80=9CWhere is
the need for all these gymnastics? It is better to show y=
our devotion by
keeping quiet!=E2=80=9D

Likewise the water with which he w=
ashed his hands after meals was sought
after. Not even his bath water was s=
afe from devotees.It is again Suri
Nagamma who reports the following fantas=
tic incident,=E2=80=9CIn the room where
Bhagavan takes his bath, there is a=
 hole through which the water that is
used drains out. Below that, a gutter=
 was constructed to drain off the
water. At the time of his bathing,some de=
votees used to gather at that
place, sprinkle on their heads the water that=
 came out of the room, wipe
their eyes and even use it for achamaniyam (sip=
ping drops of water for
religious
purpose). That was going on quietly and u=
nobserved for some time. But in due
course people began bringing vessels an=
d buckets to gather that water and
soon there was a regular queue. That nat=
urally resulted in some noise which
reached Bhagavan=E2=80=99s ears. He enq=
uired and found out the facts. Addressing the
attendants, he said, =E2=80=
=98=E2=80=A6 What nonsense! Will you get this stopped or shall I
bathe at t=
he tap outside? If that is done, you will be saved the trouble of
heating w=
ater for me, and there will be no trouble for them either,to watch
and wait=
 for that tirtha [holy water]. What do I want? Only two things, a
towel and=
 a koupina. I can bathe and then rinse them at the tap and that
completes t=
he job. If not the tap, you have the hill streams and the tanks.
Why this b=
other? What do you say?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D As a result, Chinnaswami immediat=
ely put
an end to these practices.

Once a devotee from the West was cleari=
ng away the leaf plates in front of
the dining hall, which was a completely=
 useless occupation,as the used
leaves were in any case meant to be thrown =
away.When Ramana saw him, he
asked him why he was doing it. The devotee ans=
wered that he had not found
any means to be of service since his arrival at=
 the Ashram, so he wanted to
do this work.But Ramana replied indignantly, =
=E2=80=9CIs sweeping the used leaf
plates the means to get salvation? Is it=
 to perform this tapas that you have
come here all the way from abroad. Go!=
 Go! Enough of doing this kind of
service! Go inside, sit to one side, turn=
 your mind inward and find out he
who wants to be saved. The service of pur=
ifying your heart is alone the
highest service. That alone can truly redeem=
 you.=E2=80=9D

Sri Ramana made no distinctions between his devotees. Wheth=
er they lived
with him, came to visit now and then or even if they never sa=
w him at all in
the body, his grace flowed and continues to flow for all of=
 them. He would
say, =E2=80=9CTo me there is no distinction.Grace is flowin=
g like the ocean ever
full. Every one draws from it according to his capaci=
ty. How can one who
brings only a tumbler complain that he is not able to t=
ake as much as
another who has brought a jar?=E2=80=9D
