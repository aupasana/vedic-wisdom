Shri Narsimhaji
Thanks for your inputs.
I too belive that close mindedness =
is acceptable but (with a view)if I while walking on my paths tell to other=
s that my path is superior than yours,it is a sin !Same happens with Iskoni=
tes where they sometimes dont belive that Shri Krishna was an avatara of Sh=
ri Hari and ...............better not to speak much on this divine day of T=
ulsi Vivah.
Actual example I am giving you,I know many vaishnavas who simpl=
y say NO NO when someone offer them prasadam,do this happens with other pat=
hs?(mostly not)
And I have also seen many Vaishnavas who are really keen to=
 help others and in my views they are the real devotees of Shri Hari/Shri K=
rishna,Vaishana should be simple and nirmal with no egos(Recall Gujarati fa=
mous Bhajan which Mahatma Gandhi loved too much)=C2=A0and this is their fir=
st sign of being a vaishnava,see an example of=C2=A0 ShriMeerabai and Shri =
NarsinhMehta or even Shri Hanumanji.Troubles should end once they realise y=
our line "Vishnu's incarnations such as Rama and Krishna worshipped Shiva".=

Many of them consider Shri ShivaMahapurana filled with Tamasic taste-well =
no comments I want to make on them who are tasteless ! I sometimes wonder w=
here ShriKrisna saw no difference in Gopi,Gwalas,Animals etc..why his many=
=C2=A0devotees are so narrow minded?Perhaps that was the reason Shri Krishn=
a was very unhappy in his last days=C2=A0before he said goodbye to this mat=
erial world near=C2=A0Shri Somnath in Prabhas patan in Gujarat(Saurashtra).=

=C2=A0
In reply to your last para,I always love to use word Bhakti instead=
 of Sadhna because Bhakti is nirmal and pure with a single goal to serve Go=
d where Sadhana has some mottos including to get some material gains.In sho=
rt Bhakti is superior to Sadhana.
Om Namo Narayanaya.

=C2=A0 



N=
amaste,

While appreciating your viewpoint, I want to add my 2 cents of a p=
erspective.

* * *

Vishnu's incarnations such as Rama and Krishna worshipp=
ed Shiva. Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each oth=
er. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as =
love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and dep=
endence.

The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga=
 are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-=
mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some progress =
with one's own belief system.

* * *

One climbing a mountain has to choose=
 one of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain=
 paths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path =
one has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is c=
limbing the mountain in one's chosen path, one is doing alright!

After all=
, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths o=
n the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If=
 one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one's ow=
n path, that does no harm.

As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and on=
e may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nea=
rby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are l=
eading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there.=
 After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of=
 course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have s=
ome snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may=
 have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on.=
 But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths,=
 if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.

L=
et people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach =
the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about yo=
ur path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just wal=
k your path and reach the top!

* * *

The problem is that some people are =
doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgment=
s on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base =
of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enrol=
l them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They st=
ay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.

But, p=
eople with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They =
are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishn=
a bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their ma=
ntra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventu=
ally make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even w=
orship Ganesha as he is "from Shiva's family" and worship Vishvaksena at th=
e start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone,=
 try to see all human beings as Vishnu's forms, try to serve all and keep t=
heir austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will e=
ventually make progress.

Let us not worry about people who are doing some =
sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be ad=
dressed in due course.

The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to bur=
n the conditioning and keep making progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others.=
 Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavata=

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>While appreciating your viewpoint, I want to add =
my 2 cents of a perspective.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Vishnu's incarnations such=
 as Rama and Krishna worshipped Shiva. Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional l=
ove and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and =
their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty n=
otions of superiority and dependence.<BR><BR>The Shaivite-Vaishnavite disti=
nctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am wil=
ling to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as l=
ong as one is making some progress with one's own belief system.<BR><BR>* *=
 *<BR><BR>One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths.=
 Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain =
top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the =
top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in
 one=
's chosen path, one is doing alright!<BR><BR>After all, there may be many p=
aths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of t=
he mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think m=
uch of those paths and focuses on climbing in one's own path, that does no =
harm.<BR><BR>As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the o=
ther paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one=
 is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. W=
hen one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-real=
ization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, differ=
ent paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One p=
ath may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling r=
ocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on th=
e top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if
 they are c=
ommitted to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.<BR><BR>Let peopl=
e follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top =
in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path.=
 It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your p=
ath and reach the top!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>The problem is that some people =
are doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judg=
ments on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the b=
ase of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to e=
nroll them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. The=
y stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.<BR>=
<BR>But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are=
 ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so m=
any Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower
 demigod may be doi=
ng their mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they =
will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do=
 not even worship Ganesha as he is "from Shiva's family" and worship Vishva=
ksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm=
 to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu's forms, try to serve all=
 and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana=
 and will eventually make progress.<BR><BR>Let us not worry about people wh=
o are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their underst=
anding will be addressed in due course.<BR><BR>The bottomline is: Keep doin=
g enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.<BR><BR>=

M<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Namaste,<BR=
>> <BR>> No written or spoken words can ever capture something perfec=
tly. If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able to capture all=
 of its
 details well. If you read thousands of books on an elephant withou=
t having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant. More=
over, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like some a=
nd dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like.=
 If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books t=
hat seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.<BR>>=
 <BR>> Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad with=
out even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, =
to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requir=
es tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attra=
cted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them=
.<BR>> <BR>> My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar's take on Bhagav=
ad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara's commentary overall. However, Srila
=
 Prabhupada's commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with cert=
ain samskaras.<BR>> <BR>> Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic i=
deas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially,=
 people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions n=
eed simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be int=
erpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and inter=
preted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups =
of people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.<BR>> <BR=
>> My philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you ar=
e able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the start=
ing point. In addition, search actively and try to actually see the elephan=
t oneday.<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasimha<BR>> --------=
