24th January, 1935
Talk 17.

D.: If everything be illusion, then one can ta=
ke lives?

M.: To whom is illusion? Find that out! In fact everyone is a =
=E2=80=9Ckiller of the
Self=E2=80=9D (atmahan) every moment of his life.

D=
.: What is Jnana Marga?

M.: Concentration of the mind is in a way common t=
o both Knowledge and
Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the un=
iversal,the Reality.
This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now,and=
 it does exist.

Therefore the Path of Knowledge tries to find out how viyo=
ga (separation)
came about. The separation is from the Reality only.

D.: W=
hat is illusion?

M.: To whom is the illusion? Find it out. Then illusion w=
ill
vanish.Generally people want to know about illusion and do not examine =
to
whom it is. It is foolish. Illusion is outside and unknown. But the seek=
er
is considered to be known and is inside. Find out what is immediate,
int=
imate, instead of trying to find out what is distant and unknown.

D.: Some=
 people are attracted to one place of pilgrimage and others to
another. Is =
it according to their temperaments?

M.: Yes. Just consider how all of you =
born in different places and living in
other lands are gathered here today?=
 What is the Force which has attracted
you here? If this is understood the =
other Force is also understood.
