Jesus: The Dharma Master

A New Video Discourse by
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ac=
harya


"Jesus himself was never a Christian, nor is he the mere possession=
 of any Christian denomination", proclaims Sri Acharyaji, "Jesus was a perf=
ect Dharma Master!"

In this inspiring video discourse, Sri Acharyaji revea=
ls some of the highest teachings of Jesus by showing who Jesus actually was=
 and what he taught from the unique perspective of Sanatana Dharma. Jesus t=
aught in the Gospels that his followers should follow his personal example =
and not just worship him from afar. The path of devotion (bhakti) and surre=
nder (prapatti) to God is the highest path taught by all the greatest gurus=
 and Rishis. This was also the real message of Jesus.

This amazing two par=
t talk by Sri Acharyaji took place in December 2008 and is now freely avail=
able on video to the public for the very first time!

Watch this 28 minute =
video here:
