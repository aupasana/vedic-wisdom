 SRI M.S. NAGARAJAN, a staunch devotee of Bhagavan,comes from Mambattu, a
v=
illage in the Polur Taluk of the North Arcot District of the state of Tamil=

Nadu. Even as a young boy he used to accompany his parents when they came =
to
TiruvannamaIai for the yearly Deepam festival, at which time and on simi=
lar
occasions, his father, who was a devotee of Bhagavan, used to take him =
to
the Ashram. Thus he came to know Bhagavan in his childhood. When he was =
ten
years old, his friend, who was a nephew of Echammal, spoke to him about=
 the
greatness of Bhagavan. He and this friend used to practise dhyana and =
yogic
asanas (sitting postures) every day in the early morning. In the even=
ing
they meditated on Bhagavan.

Sri Nagarajan used to have frequent vision=
s of Bhagavan and Lord Murugan in
his dreams. At about this time Ranga Rao,=
 an old devotee of Bhagavan, now no
more,had set up an ashram at Polur name=
d Indra Ashram, to which other
devotees of Bhagavan used to go and talk abo=
ut Bhagavan and other spiritual
matters. In 1930, when Sri Nagarajan was 15=
 years old Ranga Rao brought him
to Sri Ramanansramam.

Here he was allotte=
d the work of doing puja, and helping in the bookstall
etc. But what he val=
ued most was the privilege of cutting up vegetables and
grinding the pulses=
 and coconut gratings for chutney in the kitchen with
Bhagavan. But most of=
 the time he was in the hall attending to some minor
work or other. He had =
thus the opportunity of listening to the replies which
Bhagavan gave to the=
 questions put to him by visitors and devotees. As a
result of this he beca=
me a firm believer in the path of Self-enquiry taught
by Bhagavan.

At the =
end of six months Sri Nagarajan went home but soon returned and
stayed on f=
or four years. Jobs were offered to him but he was not interested
in them s=
ince the acceptance of a job would mean parting from Bhagavan. But
one day =
a letter came from his mother informing him that a job had been
found for h=
im. This letter came to the hands of Bhagavan along with the
Ashram post. A=
fter reading it Bhagavan said,=E2=80=9CLook here, a job has been found
for =
you. Go and accept it immediately.=E2=80=9DTears came into the eyes of Sri
=
Nagarajan at the thought of parting from Bhagavan. But Bhagavan said again,=

=E2=80=9CYou can go on Wednesday and join duty on Thursday.=E2=80=9D Unwil=
lingly he left the
Ashram. Thereafter he came to the Ashram as often as he =
could get leave.

While Sri Nagarajan was employed at Sattur from 1955 to 1=
958 he organised a
Ramana Mandali where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s songs like The M=
arital Garland of Letters
were sung and devotees meditated every day. Talks=
 were given periodically at
this Mandali =E2=80=94 Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Jayan=
ti and Aradhana were also celebrated in a
fitting manner. Sri Nagarajan als=
o established a school named Sri Ramana
Vidya Mandiram Elementary School at=
 Sattur in memory of Bhagavan.

After holding several important posts in th=
e firm of Burmah Shell, Sri
Nagarajan has now retired. Since then he has li=
ved for some time in Tambaram
and later joined the Ashram to render his ser=
vice.
