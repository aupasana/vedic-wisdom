 The Maharshi was available to all. The management may have put limits on
l=
ength of stays in the ashram, but anyone could live outside the ashram and
=
daily come and visit the Maharshi. The women devotees did that. Since no
wo=
men were allowed in the ashram at night, they all had to leave after the
ev=
ening meals.

One day about 7 P.M., when it had already turned dark, an ind=
iscreet
incident between a man and woman occurred. When Bhagavan came to kn=
ow of it,
he said that the woman devotees should be fed their evening meal =
by 6:30
P.M. and then sent home.

In Bhagavan's Hall

Once T. M. P. Mahadev=
an had just returned from a trip to the West. He
delivered lectures whereve=
r he went and a number of those lectures were
about Bhagavan and his teachi=
ngs. A few of the resident devotees wanted to
hear an example of how he lec=
tured on Bhagavan. He offered to give one right
then and there. But before =
he could do this, permission had to be taken from
the office. Without undue=
 delay it was given. T. M. P. Mahadevan then gave a
lecture. Except for thi=
s lecture I don't ever remember anyone giving a
lecture in the hall, althou=
gh there were those whose very questions were the
equivalent of a lecture. =
Usually, such visitors wanted to show off their
knowledge.

There was one D=
aivarata, a devotee of Bhagavan who had been living in the
north for some y=
ears and who had just returned to the ashram for a visit
after a long absen=
ce. Among other things, he was known for his enthusiastic
kirtan and dancin=
g. He used to do it in earlier years before the Maharshi
and while doing pr=
adakshina of Arunachala. Some of the devotees expressed a
desire to see him=
 perform. It was arranged in the dining hall. Bhagavan sat
where he usually=
 did at mealtime and we all sat in rows. Daivarata began
singing and dancin=
g up and down the rows with great enthusiasm. He also sang
Ganapati Muni's =
"Chatvarimsat" in his own melody, dancing with the tune.

The attendants us=
ed to spread various sheets over Bhagavan's couch, changing
them frequently=
. Occasionally they would place a tiger's skin on the couch
and Bhagavan wo=
uld sit on that too, just like it was any other sheet. Once I
was sitting n=
ear the end of Bhagavan's couch facing him. That day a tiger's
skin had bee=
n spread on the sofa and the head of the tiger was hanging over
the armrest=
 and, seemingly, staring straight at me.

Chadwick was also sitting in the =
hall at the west end. He would usually
follow a punctual schedule and at ex=
actly 7 P.M. he rose to leave. On his
way out he walked up behind me and wh=
ispered in my ear, "Do you see? There
is Chinnaswami, the ashram tiger, sta=
ring straight at you." We both chuckled
at the joke. When Chadwick went out=
, Bhagavan asked me what Chadwick had
said to me. When I repeated it, Bhaga=
van enjoyed the humor and we both
laughed.

Gandhians and Service

On one o=
ccasion, a prominent leader for the advancement of the lower classes
came o=
n a visit. She asked Bhagavan a number of questions concerning her
work and=
 ideals. Bhagavan simply listened and remained silent. The lady
left. Short=
ly after her visit, an article written by this lady was found in
a Madras n=
ewspaper. She wrote that she had discussed all her plans with
Bhagavan and =
he agreed with them. When Bhagavan saw this, he commented, "What
can I do? =
Even if I am silent, such statements are printed in the
newspapers."

Adi S=
hankaracharya writes that karma yoga is useful for purifying the mind.
But =
the purified mind has to be harnessed to some technique of spiritual
practi=
ce. Only then will the sadhana be effective. Bhagavan has said that
only a =
true jnani can be a true karma yogi. It is not that doing good works
and gi=
ving to others is wrong. But only a jnani knows that there are no
others; t=
here is only the Self. Who is to give to whom?

Bhagavan's whole life was s=
imply an offering to the world. Everything he did
was for others only. The =
scriptures say that a jnani has no will of his own
and whatever he does is =
prompted by Ishwara, or God.Bhagavan knew that
social service could tempora=
rily relieve suffering to some extent. He also
knew that the same person wh=
o was helped, would some day come to grief
again, not only later in this li=
fe but in life after life. To remove all
suffering, to completely extinguis=
h the cause of all suffering, the Maharshi
was born. He wanted to liberate =
us from the mistaken belief that we are this
frail body, mind and ego. To d=
o this he gave the method of Self-Enquiry,
showed us how to practice it and=
 effectively aided seekers by his powerful
presence and grace.

But even wi=
th all that he taught us, there were many who came to him, stayed
for some =
time and then went astray. Such was the case with the pious
attendant of Bh=
agavan, Madhava.

He worked in the ashram for about ten years, mostly servi=
ng Bhagavan as a
personal attendant. At one point he seemed to have become =
restless, or
perhaps he felt that he required rest somewhere away from the =
ashram. At
this juncture, he came to me one day and asked if I could help h=
im with the
travel fare to Yogi Ramaih's ashram in Andhra Pradesh.

Up to t=
his point Madhava was considered a model devotee. Everyone praised
his virt=
ues of steadiness, devotion and service to Bhagavan. So I was a
little surp=
rised when he told me he desired to leave the ashram. I asked him
what Bhag=
avan and Chinnaswami said about his plans. He told me that they
both approv=
ed of them. Later I discovered it was not so. Bhagavan had
recommended that=
 he simply cease working for some time, take his meals in
the ashram and re=
st, free from all responsibilities. Apparently he did not
heed Bhagavan's a=
dvice and as a result had to suffer.

Madhava left the ashram as planned, b=
ut returned after a short time. His job
as one of Bhagavan's attendants had=
 already been given to someone else.
Consequently, he had nothing to do whe=
n he returned and I would often see
him sitting in Bhagavan's hall. His res=
tlessness persisted and it wasn't
long before he left the ashram again. Whe=
n he returned a second time he was
wearing ochre robes, which means he must=
 have been initiated into sannyas by
some swami during his travels. Yet he =
was still unsettled and he went away
again. Then, all of a sudden, we heard=
 he had died in Kumbhakonam under
strange circumstances.

It is not altoget=
her uncommon for aspirants to deviate from the prescribed
path after coming=
 to Bhagavan. It is only those who persist to the end with
their spiritual =
practice, devotion and faith that succeed. Of course,
Bhagavan's helping ha=
nd is always there for those sincere sadhakas who
strive and reach out for =
it.

Once the Sarvadhikari asked me to set my alarm so I could wake up at 2=
 A.M.
It was discovered that Bhagavan was rising at this time every night a=
nd
walking to the latrine near the goshala. The attendants were sleeping ri=
ght
through this and, of course, Bhagavan probably took special care not to=

disturb their sleep when he rose. When the Sarvadhikari discovered what wa=
s
happening he became concerned that if Bhagavan should fall, or some other=

mishap should occur, there would be no one to help him.

So at 2. A.M. I a=
woke and walked over and stood near Bhagavan, who was then
reclining on the=
 couch outside on the verandah. When Bhagavan saw me
standing there he quie=
tly slipped off the couch and walked to the latrine
with the aid of a flash=
light. I followed. No words passed between us. There
is no doubt that Bhaga=
van understood why I was there and who requested me to
come at this hour of=
 night, yet everything transpired in silence.

On such occasions, when sile=
nce prevailed, we would assume that Bhagavan
approved or was pleased. When =
he was displeased, we could easily know, for
he did not hesitate to correct=
 us. In this way, we were always on our guard
and alert to his will.

One d=
ay I received a letter from my family informing me that they were
traveling=
 to Thirupati. They requested me to leave the ashram and meet them
there. W=
hen Bhagavan was returning from his walk and was near the well, I
mentioned=
 the details of this letter to him. He made no reply. Now, how
could I just=
 leave? Normally he would indicate his approval of the plan by
asking quest=
ions or commenting, and in some manner make it clear to me that
it was all =
right to go ahead. In this instance he said nothing and just kept
walking.
=

The very next day I received another letter from my family informing me th=
at
the trip was cancelled. How can we explain this? Is it a siddhi, a mirac=
le,
or what? Everything happened naturally in Bhagavan's presence, and he w=
as
always so unassuming.

IT WAS IN FEBRUARY of 1949 that a small growth wa=
s noticed just below the
elbow on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s left arm. When it was =
first noticed it looked similar to
the size, color and shape of a black gra=
m (pigeon pea).

The Maharshi was vigilantly watched and attended to twenty=
-four hours a day.
Therefore, any irregularity in his health was closely sc=
rutinized by his
cadre of devoted attendants. But how and why the tumor beg=
an where it did
cannot be established with any certainty.

When it was firs=
t noticed by the attendants, Dr. Shankar Rao, a retired
district surgeon wh=
o was then serving as the ashram doctor, was summoned to
examine it. Dr. Sr=
inivasa Rao, another devotee living near the ashram, was
also called. After=
 consultation these two doctors decided that surgical
removal of the small =
growth should be performed. Without much fanfare, and
without the use of an=
 anesthetic, the growth was removed. Perhaps everyone
thought that this min=
or nuisance was now eliminated. The doctors did not
realize then that they =
were tampering with a fatal type of cancer called
sarcoma.

In March of 194=
9, the wound from the surgery seemed to be healing
satisfactorily when anot=
her growth, a little higher up the arm, appeared.
Dr. Raghavachari, an emin=
ent surgeon from Madras, came to the ashram with
all his instruments and re=
moved the new growth on March 27. A local
anesthetic was used. About a mont=
h after this surgery, when the doctors
realized that the tumor was sarcoma =
cancer, radium treatments began. Also,
in May, herbs prescribed by an ayurv=
edic physician were applied to the
wound. During all these treatments Bhaga=
van=E2=80=99s health was slowly
deteriorating.

Bhagavan moved into the New=
 Hall, which is connected to the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple.
What is now calle=
d the Nirvana Room had been built near the New Hall for
Bhagavan to rest be=
tween darshan periods. A bathroom was also built onto the
Nirvana Room, all=
eviating the strain he experienced by walking all the way
to the latrine ne=
ar the goshala. After his final surgery in December of
1949, the Nirvana Ro=
om became his full-time residence.

As time passed, Bhagavan was becoming i=
ncreasingly weaker. Sometimes after
getting up from the couch he would shak=
e violently and everyone feared he
would fall. At such alarming times, Bhag=
avan would make a light comment,
such as, "Oh! Look at me. I am dancing." I=
n this manner, he would soothe the
anguish of his devotees. Never would he =
take his illness or weakness
seriously, even though most of us did.

Once t=
he doctors were about to cut some tissues from the tumor so that
testing co=
uld be done on them. When they were about to inject a local
anesthetic to d=
ull the pain, Bhagavan refused itand told the doctors to
simply cut and tak=
e what they wanted. The doctors protested, explaining to
Bhagavan that the =
pain would be severe without the use of the injection. But
Bhagavan again r=
efused and told them just to do it. They cut into the tumor
and Bhagavan wi=
nced in pain. The doctors said, Bhagavan, we told you it
would be painful.
=

Bhagavan replied, "Yes, the body experienced pain. But am I the body?"

Th=
ere was a large team of physicians attending to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s needs du=
ring
this surgery and throughout his illness. When so many specialists came=
 to
certain conclusions about his illness and took up procedures, surgical =
or
otherwise, to cure him, Bhagavan normally went along with the treatment.=
 But
when the tumor appeared again after the third surgery, and the doctors=

concluded that only by amputating the entire arm would there be any hope o=
f
a cure, Bhagavan flatly rejected the option.

On the evening of December =
19th, I was one among a group of devotees
standing north of the Nirvana Roo=
m waiting to hear news about Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
condition. The fourth and f=
inal operation had been executed on that day,
once again in the dispensary.=


Doraiswamy Iyer, who had been influential in bringing together prominent
=
physicians for the two major surgeries on Bhagavan, came to where we were
s=
tanding and informed us about his condition. "Whether or not the surgery
wa=
s successful, can be determined only after three months," he said.
Bhagavan=
 remained in the dispensary for eighteen days recovering from the
operation=
. Then around midnight, he shifted to the Nirvana Room.

When Bhagavan was =
in the last stages of his illness he insisted on giving
darshan twice a day=
. A reclining chair was placed in the small passage in
front of the Nirvana=
 Room. He would repose there facing west towards the
verandah of the Mother=
=E2=80=99s Temple, and the devotees would sit or stand on the
verandah sile=
ntly looking at him, or sit meditating with closed eyes. Those
devotees who=
 were permitted to have a bedside meeting with him would come
around from e=
ast of the Nirvana Room and enter. At this time, because of the
severity of=
 his illness, the Sarvadhikari rarely gave permission for
separate meetings=
 with Bhagavan.

In February of 1950, a new cancerous growth appeared. Many=
 devotees began to
lose all hope that his life would be spared. On the othe=
r hand, there were
others that resolutely declared that Bhagavan would neve=
r die from this
disease, as if it was inadmissible that a sage like Bhagava=
n could succumb
to a common mortal affliction.

One day I received a messag=
e from the office that I should accompany the
doctors to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=
 room when they go again to clean his wound and change
his bandages. I do n=
ot know why I was asked to do this. Perhaps Bhagavan
didn=E2=80=99t see me =
at darshan time and inquired about me, or possibly for some
other reason th=
e Sarvadhikari felt I should go to Bhagavan in his room.

When I walked int=
o the Nirvana Room Bhagavan simply rested his benevolent
gaze on me and sai=
d nothing. Then he slowly stretched out his left arm and
the doctors began =
their work. The bandage was drenched with blood; the wound
was large and pi=
tiful to look at; the pain must have been extreme. Bhagavan
calmly turned h=
is head to the side and the doctors went about their
business. I was amazed=
 to observe his total detachment. It seemed to me that
he looked on this pa=
inful affair as if it was happening to a body other than
his own. I can nev=
er forget that sight. Bhagavan always told us that he was
not the body. Dur=
ing his last days, in the midst of tremendous suffering, he
demonstrated it=
.

Bhagavan=E2=80=99s tumor had grown to the size of a cauliflower, blood w=
as oozing
between the buds and his whole arm was blackened. A doctor friend=
, who was
experienced in all aspects relating to this type of cancer, told =
me that the
pain associated with it at this stage of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s ill=
ness would be similar
to the suffering experienced if a fully-loaded lorry =
ran over your arm.

Doctors also decided that Bhagavan should be allowed to=
 eat whatever food he
desired. Throughout the course of his treatments, eac=
h discipline of
medicine he was under had certain dietary restrictions. Oft=
en Bhagavan was
required to consume items he would not ordinarily eat, or p=
refer to eat. But
in spite of the doctors=E2=80=99 decision about his diet,=
 Bhagavan was not allowed
to eat the iddlies and chilly powder he requested=
 during the last month of
his life.

Out of all the doctors attending on Bh=
agavan, it was only the allopathic
doctors that didn=E2=80=99t boast they c=
ould cure Bhagavan. The doctors from other
disciplines would confidently an=
nounce that Bhagavan could be cured. Of
course, during the final stages of =
his illness, when all hope was lost,
there was little boasting. All the dif=
ferent systems of medicine, all the
best doctors and surgeons and all of th=
e latest medical treatments and
technologies failed.Throughout it all, Bhag=
avan remained what he always was:
a spectator in this world drama, ever rev=
eling in the Self.

On April 14th, a bulletin was released to the news serv=
ice from the office,
stating that Bhagavan was no longer giving darshan.By =
broadcasting this
information the management thought the pressing throng of=
 devotees would
disperse. When this news reached Bhagavan, he immediately o=
rdered the
Sarvadhikari to withdraw the bulletin. In no way would he discon=
tinue giving
darshan. Even on this last day, when Bhagavan was in the throe=
s of death, he
insisted on giving darshan as usual between the hours of 5 a=
nd 6 p.m. He
demanded that the devotees should not be prevented from seeing=
 him.

After the Mahasamadhi

ON APRIL 16, the day after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=
 body was buried, I gathered all my
belongings and left on the noon train f=
or Madras. At that time, I didn=E2=80=99t
know when, or if, I would be retu=
rning to the ashram. Many prominent
devotees also began leaving Tiruvannama=
lai. Everybody was selling off their
properties, the ashram=E2=80=99s incom=
e dramatically fell and the Mauni, Srinivasa
Rao, was scheming to seize con=
trol of the ashram; even before Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
demise he was scheming.
=

After one year, I again returned to the ashram to attend Bhagavan=E2=80=99=
s aradhana
celebration. The ashram was struggling to stay afloat financiall=
y. I
remember Chinnaswami informing me that the ashram would be unable to s=
erve
me breakfast and I should go to town and eat.

=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan knew that social service could temporarily r=
elieve suffering to some extent. He also knew that the same person who was =
helped, would some day come to grief again, not only later in this life but=
 in life after life. To remove all suffering, to completely extinguish the =
cause of all suffering, the Maharshi was born. He wanted to liberate us fro=
m the mistaken belief that we are this frail body, mind and ego.</span>=C2=
=A0To do this he gave the method of Self-Enquiry, showed us how to practice=
 it and effectively aided seekers by his powerful presence and grace.<br>

=
<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">But even with all that he taught us, t=
here were many who came to him, stayed for some time and then went astray.<=
/span>=C2=A0Such was the case with the pious attendant of Bhagavan,=C2=A0<s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">Madhava</span>.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font=
-style:italic">He worked in the ashram for about ten years, mostly serving =
Bhagavan as a personal attendant. At one point he seemed to have become res=
tless, or perhaps he felt that he required rest somewhere away from the ash=
ram. At this juncture, he came to me one day and asked if I could help him =
with the travel fare to Yogi Ramaih's ashram in Andhra Pradesh.<br>

<b=
r>Up to this point Madhava was considered a model devotee. Everyone praised=
 his virtues of steadiness, devotion and service to Bhagavan. So I was a li=
ttle surprised when he told me he desired to leave the ashram. I asked him =
what Bhagavan and Chinnaswami said about his plans. He told me that they bo=
th approved of them. Later I discovered it was not so. Bhagavan had recomme=
nded that he simply cease working for some time, take his meals in the ashr=
am and rest, free from all responsibilities. Apparently he did not heed Bha=
gavan's advice and as a result had to suffer.<br>

<br>Madhava left the=
 ashram as planned, but returned after a short time. His job as one of Bhag=
avan's attendants had already been given to someone else. Consequently,=
 he had nothing to do when he returned and I would often see him sitting in=
 Bhagavan's hall. His restlessness persisted and it wasn't long bef=
ore he left the ashram again. When he returned a second time he was wearing=
 ochre robes, which means he must have been initiated into sannyas by some =
swami during his travels. Yet he was still unsettled and he went away again=
. Then, all of a sudden, we heard he had died in Kumbhakonam under strange =
circumstances.</span><br>

<br>It is not altogether uncommon for aspirants =
to deviate from the prescribed path after coming to Bhagavan. It is only th=
ose who persist to the end with their spiritual practice, devotion and fait=
h that succeed. Of course, Bhagavan's helping hand is always there for =
those sincere sadhakas who strive and reach out for it.<br>

<br><span styl=
e=3D"font-weight:bold">Once the Sarvadhikari asked me to set my alarm so I =
could wake up at 2 A.M. It was discovered that Bhagavan was rising at this =
time every night and walking to the latrine near the goshala.=C2=A0</span>T=
he attendants were sleeping right through this and, of course, Bhagavan pro=
bably took special care not to disturb their sleep when he rose.=C2=A0<span=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">When the Sarvadhikari discovered what was happe=
ning he became concerned that if Bhagavan should fall, or some other mishap=
 should occur, there would be no one to help him.</span><br>

<br><span sty=
le=3D"font-weight:bold">So at 2. A.M. I awoke and walked over and stood nea=
r Bhagavan, who was then reclining on the couch outside on the verandah. Wh=
en Bhagavan saw me standing there he quietly slipped off the couch and walk=
ed to the latrine with the aid of a flashlight. I followed. No words passed=
 between us. There is no doubt that Bhagavan understood why I was there and=
 who requested me to come at this hour of night, yet everything transpired =
in silence.</span><br>

<br>On such occasions, when silence prevailed, we w=
ould assume that Bhagavan approved or was pleased. When he was displeased, =
we could easily know, for he did not hesitate to correct us. In this way, w=
e were always on our guard and alert to his will.<br>

<br>One day I receiv=
ed a letter from my family informing me that they were traveling to Thirupa=
ti. They requested me to leave the ashram and meet them there. When Bhagava=
n was returning from his walk and was near the well, I mentioned the detail=
s of this letter to him. He made no reply. Now, how could I just leave?<spa=
n style=3D"font-weight:bold">=C2=A0Normally he would indicate his approval =
of the plan by asking questions or commenting, and in some manner make it c=
lear to me that it was all right to go ahead.</span>=C2=A0In this instance =
he said nothing and just kept walking.<br>

<br>The very next day I receive=
d another letter from my family informing me that the trip was cancelled. H=
ow can we explain this? Is it a siddhi, a miracle, or what? Everything happ=
ened naturally in Bhagavan's presence, and he was always so unassuming.=
<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">IT WAS IN FEBRUARY of 1949 that =
a small growth was noticed just below the elbow on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s left =
arm. When it was first noticed it looked similar to the size, color and sha=
pe of a black gram (pigeon pea).</span><br>

<br>The Maharshi was vigilantl=
y watched and attended to twenty-four hours a day. Therefore, any irregular=
ity in his health was closely scrutinized by his cadre of devoted attendant=
s. But how and why the tumor began where it did cannot be established with =
any certainty.<br>

<br>When it was first noticed by the attendants, Dr. Sh=
ankar Rao, a retired district surgeon who was then serving as the ashram do=
ctor, was summoned to examine it. Dr. Srinivasa Rao, another devotee living=
 near the ashram, was also called. After consultation these two doctors dec=
ided that surgical removal of the small growth should be performed. Without=
 much fanfare, and without the use of an anesthetic, the growth was removed=
. Perhaps everyone thought that this minor nuisance was now eliminated. The=
 doctors did not realize then that they were tampering with a fatal type of=
 cancer called sarcoma.<br>

<br>In March of 1949, the wound from the surge=
ry seemed to be healing satisfactorily when another growth, a little higher=
 up the arm, appeared. Dr. Raghavachari, an eminent surgeon from Madras, ca=
me to the ashram with all his instruments and removed the new growth on Mar=
ch 27. A local anesthetic was used. About a month after this surgery, when =
the doctors realized that the tumor was sarcoma cancer, radium treatments b=
egan. Also, in May, herbs prescribed by an ayurvedic physician were applied=
 to the wound. During all these treatments Bhagavan=E2=80=99s health was sl=
owly deteriorating.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Bhagavan mov=
ed into the New Hall, which is connected to the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple. Wh=
at is now called the Nirvana Room had been built near the New Hall for Bhag=
avan to rest between darshan periods. A bathroom was also built onto the Ni=
rvana Room, alleviating the strain he experienced by walking all the way to=
 the latrine near the goshala. After his final surgery in December of 1949,=
 the Nirvana Room became his full-time residence.</span><br>

<br><span sty=
le=3D"font-weight:bold">As time passed, Bhagavan was becoming increasingly =
weaker. Sometimes after getting up from the couch he would shake violently =
and everyone feared he would fall. At such alarming times, Bhagavan would m=
ake a light comment, such as, "Oh! Look at me. I am dancing."</sp=
an>=C2=A0In this manner, he would soothe the anguish of his devotees. Never=
 would he take his illness or weakness seriously, even though most of us di=
d.<br>

<br>Once the doctors were about to cut some tissues from the tumor =
so that testing could be done on them.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold=
">When they were about to inject a local anesthetic to dull the pain, Bhaga=
van refused it</span>and told the doctors to simply cut and take what they =
wanted. The doctors protested, explaining to Bhagavan that the pain would b=
e severe without the use of the injection. But Bhagavan again refused and t=
old them just to do it. They cut into the tumor and Bhagavan winced in pain=
. The doctors said, Bhagavan, we told you it would be painful.<br>

<br><sp=
an style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan replied, "Yes, the body experie=
nced pain. But am I the body?"</span><br><br>There was a large team of=
 physicians attending to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s needs during this surgery and t=
hroughout his illness. When so many specialists came to certain conclusions=
 about his illness and took up procedures, surgical or otherwise, to cure h=
im, Bhagavan normally went along with the treatment. But when the tumor app=
eared again after the third surgery, and the doctors concluded that only by=
 amputating the entire arm would there be any hope of a cure, Bhagavan flat=
ly rejected the option.<br>

<br>On the evening of December 19th, I was one=
 among a group of devotees standing north of the Nirvana Room waiting to he=
ar news about Bhagavan=E2=80=99s condition. The fourth and final operation =
had been executed on that day, once again in the dispensary.<br>

<br>Dorai=
swamy Iyer, who had been influential in bringing together prominent physici=
ans for the two major surgeries on Bhagavan, came to where we were standing=
 and informed us about his condition. "Whether or not the surgery was =
successful, can be determined only after three months," he said. Bhaga=
van remained in the dispensary for eighteen days recovering from the operat=
ion. Then around midnight, he shifted to the Nirvana Room.<br>

<br><span s=
tyle=3D"font-weight:bold">When Bhagavan was in the last stages of his illne=
ss he insisted on giving darshan twice a day.</span>=C2=A0A reclining chair=
 was placed in the small passage in front of the Nirvana Room. He would rep=
ose there facing west towards the verandah of the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple, =
and the devotees would sit or stand on the verandah silently looking at him=
, or sit meditating with closed eyes. Those devotees who were permitted to =
have a bedside meeting with him would come around from east of the Nirvana =
Room and enter.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">At this time, because=
 of the severity of his illness, the Sarvadhikari rarely gave permission fo=
r separate meetings with Bhagavan.</span><br>

<br>In February of 1950, a n=
ew cancerous growth appeared. Many devotees began to lose all hope that his=
 life would be spared. On the other hand, there were others that resolutely=
 declared that Bhagavan would never die from this disease, as if it was ina=
dmissible that a sage like Bhagavan could succumb to a common mortal afflic=
tion.<br>

<br>One day I received a message from the office that I should a=
ccompany the doctors to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s room when they go again to clean=
 his wound and change his bandages. I do not know why I was asked to do thi=
s. Perhaps Bhagavan didn=E2=80=99t see me at darshan time and inquired abou=
t me, or possibly for some other reason the Sarvadhikari felt I should go t=
o Bhagavan in his room.<br>

<br>When I walked into the Nirvana Room Bhagav=
an simply rested his benevolent gaze on me and said nothing. Then he slowly=
 stretched out his left arm and the doctors began their work. The bandage w=
as drenched with blood; the wound was large and pitiful to look at; the pai=
n must have been extreme.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan ca=
lmly turned his head to the side and the doctors went about their business.=
 I was amazed to observe his total detachment.</span>=C2=A0<span style=3D"f=
ont-weight:bold">It seemed to me that he looked on this painful affair as i=
f it was happening to a body other than his own. I can never forget that si=
ght. Bhagavan always told us that he was not the body.</span>=C2=A0During h=
is last days, in the midst of tremendous suffering, he demonstrated it.<br>=


<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan=E2=80=99s tumor had grown t=
o the size of a cauliflower, blood was oozing between the buds and his whol=
e arm was blackened. A doctor friend, who was experienced in all aspects re=
lating to this type of cancer, told me that the pain associated with it at =
this stage of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s illness would be similar to the suffering =
experienced if a fully-loaded lorry ran over your arm.</span><br>

<br><spa=
n style=3D"font-weight:bold">Doctors also decided that Bhagavan should be a=
llowed to eat whatever food he desired.</span>=C2=A0Throughout the course o=
f his treatments, each discipline of medicine he was under had certain diet=
ary restrictions. Often Bhagavan was required to consume items he would not=
 ordinarily eat, or prefer to eat.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bu=
t in spite of the doctors=E2=80=99 decision about his diet, Bhagavan was no=
t allowed to eat the iddlies and chilly powder he requested during the last=
 month of his life.</span><br>

<br>Out of all the doctors attending on Bha=
gavan, it was only the allopathic doctors that didn=E2=80=99t boast they co=
uld cure Bhagavan. The doctors from other disciplines would confidently ann=
ounce that Bhagavan could be cured. Of course, during the final stages of h=
is illness, when all hope was lost, there was little boasting. All the diff=
erent systems of medicine, all the best doctors and surgeons and all of the=
 latest medical treatments and technologies failed.<span style=3D"font-weig=
ht:bold">Throughout it all, Bhagavan remained what he always was: a spectat=
or in this world drama, ever reveling in the Self.</span><br>

<br><span st=
yle=3D"font-weight:bold">On April 14th, a bulletin was released to the news=
 service from the office, stating that Bhagavan was no longer giving darsha=
n.</span>By broadcasting this information the management thought the pressi=
ng throng of devotees would disperse.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold"=
>When this news reached Bhagavan, he immediately ordered the Sarvadhikari t=
o withdraw the bulletin.</span>=C2=A0In no way would he discontinue giving =
darshan. Even on this last day, when Bhagavan was in the throes of death, h=
e insisted on giving darshan as usual between the hours of 5 and 6 p.m. He =
demanded that the devotees should not be prevented from seeing him.<br>

<b=
r><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">After the Mahasamadhi</span><br><br>ON A=
PRIL 16, the day after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body was buried, I gathered all m=
y belongings and left on the noon train for Madras. At that time, I didn=E2=
=80=99t know when, or if, I would be returning to the ashram.=C2=A0<span st=
yle=3D"font-weight:bold">Many prominent devotees also began leaving Tiruvan=

<br>After one year, I again returned to the ashram to =
