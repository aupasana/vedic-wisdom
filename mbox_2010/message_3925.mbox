Namasthe Narasimha garu

"When one's husband or wife says something one doe=
s not appreciate and one
becomes angry and feels like fighting, it is god t=
esting one (using the
husband or wife as the instrument)."
This is exactly =
what is going on in my life currently. And I had reconciled
the same.
Is it=
 a coincidence that you wrote this email now, I think not. I think god
is c=
onveying it thru you.
