 Q: Sankara says we are all free, not bound, and that we shall all go back
=
to God from whom we have come as sparks from a fire. Then why should we not=

commit all sorts of sins?

A: It is true we are not bound and that the rea=
l Self has no bondage. It is
true that you will eventually go back to your =
source. But meanwhile, if you
commit sins, as you call them, you will have =
to face the consequences of
such sins. You cannot escape them. If a man bea=
ts you, then, can you say, `I
am free, I am not bound by these beatings and=
 I don't feel any pain. Let him
beat on'? If you can feel like that, you ca=
n go on doing what you like. What
is the use of merely saying with your lip=
s 'I am free'?

Q: It is said that the whole universe is God's play of cons=
ciousness and
that everything is full of Brahman. Then why should we say th=
at bad habits
and bad practices should be discarded?

A: Suppose there is s=
ome wound inside the human body. If you neglect it, on
the assumption that =
it is only a small part of the body, it causes pain to
the whole body. If i=
t is not cured by ordinary treatment, the doctor must
come, cut off the aff=
ected portion with a knife and remove the impurities.
If the diseased part =
is not cut off it will fester. If you do not bandage it
after operating, pu=
s will form. It is the same thing with regard to
conduct. Bad habits and ba=
d conduct are like a wound in the body. Every
disease must be given appropr=
iate treatment.
