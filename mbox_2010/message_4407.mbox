Dear Biswajit,

I had been doing Narasimha homam for quite some time now an=
d Narasimha had hand written the changes to the manual. I have typed the cr=
ux of the manual and uploaded into files sections as homam_procedure_shortm=
edium.pdf. The full path is as follows:

Vd9u8UlcK3H-mSI/homam_procedure_shortmedium.pdf

Hope it helps you get star=
ted.

How ever, Narasimha normally advises one to start with Ganapathi homa=
m and then shift to other lords.

Best regards,
Vijay
