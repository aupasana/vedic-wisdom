Namaste Satya Prakash ji,

It was very nice to see your email and especiall=
y point No.10.

Is it possible to clarify point no.8? If it can be revealed=
 in this open forum, please enligten us as to what are those "potential dan=
gers" which has forced traditions to strongly recommend "Initiation" for De=
viMahatmyam.

Warm Regards,

Utpal

ilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes=
 a distinction between them.
>      
> 4.	As per the traditional view one d=
oesn't need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not t=
he same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, =
mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Ma=
ntras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that ne=
ed initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. W=
hatever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are in=
tegral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initia=
tion, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.
>  
> 5.	Vishnusaha=
sranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they=
 fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are =
traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a=
 larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them with=
out initiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the n=
avarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.
>      =
      
> 6.	I know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to bot=
h Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the s=
adhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSH=
ARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) =
of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be=
 initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.
>  
> 7.=
	Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an in=
dependent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a M=
ahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upa=
nishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Ch=
andi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant =
it. However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth a=
spects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular h=
as been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the=
 navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case=
 it is recommended to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas =
properly under guidance.
>  
> 8.	Arguably if an uninitiated person reads t=
he Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approa=
ch and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our times.  The pr=
oblem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (=
without initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting=
 the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too =
contain the bijaksharas.
>  
> 9.	I you carefully peruse my write-up on the=
 Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mant=
ra even in writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commentary on it. T=
ranslations of mantras do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabd=
a or Vak. However it is recommended to know the essence or import (artha) o=
f the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha' is the impor=
t, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! 
> 
> 10.	For those who are alr=
eady doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no need to worr=
y or be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be attract=
ed to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be=
 doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are=
 doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has ri=
ghtly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for an=
y favours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potenti=
al problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Lea=
ve the rest to the compassionate Goddess.
