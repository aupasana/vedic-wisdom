Namaste,
<<Probably, Ravana is rakshasa and all rakshas are devotees of shi=
va (including 
myself)>>
Ravana was a rakshasa. If we understand that all g=
ood and bad qualities are 
within a person, there is rakshasa tendencies in=
side all of us, in varying 
degrees.=C2=A0Rakshasas are beings of a differe=
nt plane and suffer from problems of 
extreme passion and vital energy clou=
ding discrimination (an explaination 
beautifully provided by Sri Aurobindo=
). 

There are no rakshasas or ashuras in this world today except for the n=
egative 
traits inside everyone of us. =C2=A0They exist in different realms=
 (apart from our 
material world).=C2=A0 Krishna in the Mahabharata made su=
re that they do not take 
birth in human form since people in the Kali yuga=
 do not have the necessary 
spiritual power to fight a real rakshasa or an =
ashura.=C2=A0 

Therefore this=C2=A0is a=C2=A0mere fanciful imagination to =
think of oneself as some sort 
of ashura or rakshasa.
