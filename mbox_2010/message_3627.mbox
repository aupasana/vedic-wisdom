Namaste,

I am sorry to know your loss and thank you for an account of your=
 experiment and experience.

As Manish keeps saying, death=
 is not a terminal thing. It is not a full stop or period, but just a comma=
. Let me tell a parable.

A person loved one dress and wore it always. He n=
ever removed the dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never con=
sidered the possibility of changing into a different dress. The idea of rem=
oving that dress was unbearable to that person. He thought he should wear t=
hat dress forever.

The dress became so dirty and torn that it was time to =
change it. A person looking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to=
 remove the dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated with him =
and tore it apart violently if one fought back. After this scary person rem=
oved the old dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some people b=
ecame so afraid and ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away a=
nd roamed around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they woul=
d've soon gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.

The=
 clothes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The perso=
n looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator=
 is the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is the =
new clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clothese are =
given are like different kinds of spirits.

Regarding your =
visualization of your father using reiki, please note that all visualizatio=
ns of the mind are imagery created by one's conscious and sub-conscious con=
ditionining. One's beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shape the imag=

 is no reliable way to know if your prayers made any difference to the path=
 taken by your father after the cremation. The curiosity and the tendency t=

u cannot really do much more than speculate.

Regarding th=
e hen/cock, it is associated with Koumaari, among the forms of Divine Mothe=
r. In the 8th chapter of Chandipath, the Maatrikas (Mothers) are described =
(Braahmi, Maaheswari, Koumari, Vaishnavi etc). Koumari is accompanied by pe=
acock and cock. In the Kaashi descriptions given by Rajarshi, a sadhaka of =
Kaala Bhairava was worshipping in funeral pyre at a sacred place with Kaala=
 Bhairava as the guardian deity (Kaashi). Dogs are associated with Kaala Bh=
airava. Perhaps the place you went to and you yourself have some blessing o=
f Koumaari.

      Dear Membe=
rs,

After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an =
experience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elic=
it some feedback in the form of further guidance.  



I am a student of Vi=
passana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently start=
ed a simple version of Durga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And =
I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. 


=

On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling wit=
h renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we =
were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my min=
d was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3=
) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on =
a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would=
 get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonder=
ful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - so tha=
t he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, =
I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly=
 reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a =
feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experienci=
ng intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially
 in/around the=
 abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as eq=
uanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon =
after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, =
and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental ima=
gery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a fri=
end, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I th=
ink of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went aw=
ay saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 thi=
ngs and in addition he bought some ghee. 



It was my first time at a smas=
haan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at=
 such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon a=
fter the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), =
I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friends/=
relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I a=
sked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would =
like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' happens.=
 I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descriptio=
n in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think,=
 I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). 


=

I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the =
Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very firs=
t attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to=
 focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued=
 watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remem=
bered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest in=
tention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the=
 truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some=
 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee' . I=
 inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my=
 mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-=
up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa, I am =
not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done
 homam in =
the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and s=
till believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/ nullification o=
f my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Toda=
y as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have,=
 has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey=
 ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please ac=
cept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon=
 this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". 



After this mental d=
ialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thou=
ght about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantr=
a that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said=
, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really ma=
tter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Dur=
ga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupy=
ing my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate=
 that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the =
purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associati=
ng that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery'=
 (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa=
 which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally =
the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of
 my ignorance. I sought p=
ermission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I =
also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be=
 kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but t=
o definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.



I had a small ment=
al dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to=
 do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. 



And then I=
 started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was=
 offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerin=
gs taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the ma=
ntra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at =
the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi s=
tanding on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her f=
eet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I=
 felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little di=
stance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten =
minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had c=
ome and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find th=
e dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to thi=
nk I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I
 continued. Few =
minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to=
 see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but =
bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smas=
haan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending =
from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started =
jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to ju=
mp inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was =
acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked =
like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire h=
itting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few =
minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but=
 nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I a=
sked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I
 continued the mental chan=
ting. 



And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to =
leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the b=
lack sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walke=
d towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and ask=
ed her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was s=
ooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did M=
anish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin o=
f mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them=
, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was h=
appening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that =
I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of =
the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence=
 and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funera=
l
 pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simp=
ly do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and =
Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. 



When I w=
as washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now t=
here was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could be beca=
use of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). 



On the way back home and for t=
he entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would'nt say that =
I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not=
 strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about 'it'.=
 There was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched =
my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of '=
wonder'. The visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination=
 - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the most be=
autiful thing. 



The next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he h=
ad witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat =
special. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of 'perception' or love =
for our father.



Now that it is few days since that incident, I have ques=
tions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping '=
madly' around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact =
that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti=
 really grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise m=
y dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-construct=
ed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? 



I am =
not sure if these questions can be answered or if they should be answered a=
t all, but based on the above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ =
guidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.



Thank you PVR/Manish =
and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. 



Also, apologies for the len=
gth of the note.



Regards

Sharad

at I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and h=
is journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so=
 please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Ple=

Aft=
er this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (ev=
en though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the=
 ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In=
 my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it shou=
ld not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just v=
isualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, =
and fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was try=
ing to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in hi=
s feet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in m=
y mind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'ske=
letal jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is=
 the form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, re=
peated mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of
 my ignor=
ance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning=
 the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and =
I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me =
to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.<br>
<=
br>
I had a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him abo=
ut what I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and ble=
ssings. <br>
<br>
And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and =
tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not ac=
tually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with th=
e swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra=
-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the v=
isualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would=
 visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing somet=
hing. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log -=
 and threw it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to m=
ine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wa=
nted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened =
my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told mysel=
f, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but nev=
ertheless I
 continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings flut=
tering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a roos=
ter, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the pi=
ece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am=
 not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the =
burning funeral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seeme=
d as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second i=
t felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the f=
ire particles (which looked like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a =
result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform.=
 I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black he=
n came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it =
is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So =
I
 continued the mental chanting. <br>
<br>
And then my cousin signalled me=
 that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start wal=
king towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in th=
e plastic packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess=
 from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offe=
red only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer a=
nd started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samag=
ri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and =
asked me to hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he woul=
d not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I=
 did not want anyone to know that I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly step=
ped back, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised =
to the Devi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final o=
ffering and threw it at the funeral
 pyre from a distance. I thanked her on=
ce again and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyo=
ne (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked =
and joined the group. <br>
<br>
When I was washing my hands and feet at the=
 well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, w=
hich was not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds or jagger=
y??). <br>
<br>
On the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt ver=
y very very quiet within. I would'nt say that I felt a sense of achievement=
, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had nei=
ther forgotten, nor was I thinking about 'it'. There was a certian stillnes=
s within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could.=
 No judgement, no questions, just a sense of 'wonder'. The visualisations c=
ould have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence was real. =
And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. <br>
<br>
The =
next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires=
, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if =
my brother was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.<br>
<br=
>
Now that it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is t=
he hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping 'madly' around the=
 fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, peop=
le perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant som=
e 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and c=
limb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the n=
ext day when I was channeling some reiki to him? <br>
<br>
I am not sure if=
 these questions can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but =
based on the above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ t=
eachings, I would be most appreciative.<br>
<br>
Thank you PVR/Manish and R=
ajarshi for the continued inspiration. <br>
<br>
Also, apologies for the le=
ngth of the note.<br>
<br>
