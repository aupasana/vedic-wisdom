Namaste,
 
Let me try to put it in simple words. I hope members know basic physics to understand this analogy.
 
Purusha (also known as Narayana or SadaShiva) is essentially the *potential* energy of this entire universe, while Prakriti (also known as Narayani or AadiShakti) is essentially the *kinetic* energy of this entire universe.
 
That way, Purusha and Prakriti are not essentially different and are interchangable, but they do play different roles.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
