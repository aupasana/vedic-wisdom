Dear Sri,
I know exactly what you mean. I have problems that put me in the =
same (very) weak situation right now and feel quite hopeless at times. I kn=
ow to some extent the way out of it, and to some extent I would like to see=
 some answers by the knowledgeable on this group especially PVRji.

First l=
et me tell you this - stop wasting your time in trying to find verbal logic=
 to "prove" the existence of the concept of "God". People will present you =
with lots of different logical and illogical arguments. Logical arguments, =
even scriptural ones, dont give permanent relief. Both your fears, and your=
 real problems, will certainly overwhelm any logical arguments eventually. =
There must be real growth (real internal change) for real relief.

Now, let=
 me give you some basic logic. I am not contradicting myself, just the logi=
c will not help you. It simply opens a path, you must follow it to some min=
or extent at least to see the light. Otherwise, simply as logic, it will ce=
rtainly fail. So here it is..

In my very simple and totally honest observa=
tion, I notice that thinking of other people's problems DOES NOT give me ev=
en one-tenth as much pain as thinking of my own problems. Do you agree that=
 it is the same for you? So, clearly, the concept of "I" and "ownership" is=
 the key pathway for the pain. Now, there are 2 possibilities here - either=
 there is nothing more than the I (the atheistic view), or there is somethi=
ng more than the I (the theistic view). The first path for you and me leads=
 to continuous pain (at least right now), because it means either there is =
pain or there is nothing, because at least I can't think of any easy materi=
al solution to my problems - they must be lived through. So the first path =
is not very useful. So, you will agree that it is worthwhile to at least tr=
y out the second path. Now, if the second path is real, there is something =
more than the I, so there must be a way to at least temporarily disassociat=
e your deeper consciousness from the "I" and "ownership" that is the key pa=
thway to the pain? For me, I have found that concentration meditation (even=
 with mantras) wasn't doing the trick. I switched to complete surrender bas=
ed meditation in which I actually gave myself to whatever it is that is out=
 there (for me this was a long path, eventually I found through dreams and =
hints that it had to be a mother based form that I had to give myself up to=
). Now this is easier said than done. You cant form the words "I give up my=
self to you" in your mind. That is totally, thoroughly, useless, because th=
e moment you form the words, the "I" proudly takes control and starts tryin=
g to give up everything but itself. Somewhere within your meditating mind "=
you" must catch yourself and let it to go. This is the very subjective part=
 - I cant help anymore  with this part since it is a very personal thing - =
but nevertheless is key to any success.

It is at this point that I get the=
 proof, and I expect you will too. Rather than disappearing into nothingnes=
s or sleep, which is what you might expect, at least sometimes (and sometim=
es not on very bad days), I feel a rush of expansive, blissful relief. Pure=
, blessed, much needed relief from the troubles of the mind. It is very exp=
ansive, you might suddenly get a thought of you falling into a huge ocean, =
or an endless green field in warm sunlight.

So that's the good part. The p=
oint is, when I come out of it, I am the same old angry, bitter, stressed o=
ut person (trust me, I make the same old mistakes all over again). But with=
 one difference - I have a memory of something pure - and that makes me kee=
p on going.

Now the question to PVRji - I understand that the relief corre=
sponds in some sense to a small patch of nirvikalpa samadhi. But exactly as=
 outlined in Tripura Rahasya, it does not correlate with real life. So is i=
t correct to say that if you want to have any kind of real life enlightenme=
nt or improvement in your actions, you must necessarily do some Shakti type=
 worship?

Best regards,

Sundeep
