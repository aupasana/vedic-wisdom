Dear Narasimha,

Today is the start of Pitrupaksha. You mention that the co=
mbination of a
Friday and Nanda tithi should be avoided. Today happens to b=
e such a
combination and so I was a bit doubtful. But doing something is be=
tter than
not doing anything at all so I went ahead and performed the pitru=
tarpana on
the basis that this Mahalaya Pitrupaksha overrides all these con=
siderations.
Please clarify.

best regards
Hari
