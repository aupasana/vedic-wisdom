Namaste,
 
No, Durga is not gentle either. Both Durga and Chandi put you on a fast track to spiritual progress. But it can be tough.
 
This is why I mentioned a few weeks back that not everyone needs to do Chandi homam. World needs seekers doing homam to various deities - Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi, Hanuman, Rama etc.
 
In the last 2 months, a lot of people started Chandi homam. Many of them are meant to do it - they were worshippers of Chandi previously too. But some may be better off with another homam.
 
Ganapathi homam is suitable for everyone. Vishnu sahasra naama homam is one homam that is very powerful in this age and capable of giving fast or slow progress depending on one's background, without overwhelming one. My feeling is that not many are doing it and we need some people doing Vishnu sahasra naama homam on a regular basis. That will be good for the world. Also, Mahalaskhmi homam is less intense and results in slow and balanced spiritual progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

In all your manuals you have explained nature of various gods. Can you please tell me about Goddess durga in a similar fashion? Kindly correct me if I am wrong anywhere in my understanding. Thanks for your kind guidance always,
