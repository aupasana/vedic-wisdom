Dear All,
=A0
I had a question regarding the spiritual significance of Dikp=
alas. In all Hindu religious rites, we offer obeisance to the Dikpalas befo=
re proceeding with the main ritual. As their name suggests, they are the lo=
rds of the 10 cardinal directions.=A0 However, a direction is not a permane=
nt fixture and as such=A0is=A0based on the position of the observer with re=
spect to the apparent motion of the sun. If, some day, people were to perfo=
rm some ritual in outerspace, the concept of directions will break down and=
 dikpalas will have no significance. In the light of this, what is the spir=
itual meaning of dikpalas? Where exactly do they stand in the hierarchy of =
deities and cosmic beings? 
=A0
-Regards
