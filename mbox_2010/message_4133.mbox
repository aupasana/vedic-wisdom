Namaste:

I thought New Moon day is suppose to be good for meditation/sadha=
na, as new
moon phenomenon is taken as the symbol of the merger of the mind=
 (moon) with
the soul (sun). This state of existence is called amohavasam (=
a life bereft
of all desires), and hence the name Amavasi.

On the other ha=
nd during Pournami, moon has power to to excite (e.g., tides)
and make peop=
le run berserk !

But I do know Guru Pournami is considered as very auspici=
ous. May be other
members can shed more light on this.

Regards,
Hemanth
