Namaste,
=C2=A0
My emails are usually ignored as p=
ointless blabber but if I could add some words here. Cessation of Ahamkara =
and purity seems to be only required in the initial stages when you are sti=
ll struggling to acquire a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. O=
nce you have achieved some level of success, discipline that may have been =
required in the initial stages is no longer necessary.
=C2=A0
I have read a=
 few of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for=
 free downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady =
mind, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual act=
ivity as would be=C2=A0in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you m=
ind, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he=
 did a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana tha=
t people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once =
he had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana=
 alone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across R=
ishi's who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be ev=
er ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of the=
m seemed to have big egos.
=C2=A0
I do not know if you have read the Aghora=
 books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 but if you read that, even when Vimalananda ta=
lks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being challenged on any =
matter and this is time and again=C2=A0seen in his books.
=C2=A0
Ofcourse a=
bove all, you need to keep your ego in control before the Lord even though =
you may be reckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I do not kn=
ow him personally but only through message exchanges over groups like this.=
 He seems to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana's and has practiced quite a=
 lot of them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him, when he=
 does sadhana for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he does this=
 for himself. And he was once=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help him=
 out with the situation. I really do not know much about the various sadhan=
as for achieving specific needs. So I suggested that instead of of asking f=
or suggestions of different sadhana from everybody, why does he not just te=
ll the lord in his prayer one day that the effects of his bad karmas are ge=
tting too much to bear and if the Lord could provide him the success he is =
looking for in his life. He retorted and shot back at me that
 he did not s=
pend time and energy in learning these various tantric sadhanas just to beg=
 before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I reminded him that all=
 this while, he was not having any problems begging for help and suggestion=
 from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg from god when r=
eally god is the one and only who can really do anything the problems he is=
 facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude that this person did,=
=C2=A0when he would sit down for his sadhana.
=C2=A0
Cheers,
Bhupendra

 Re: Success with Mantras

=C2=A0 

Namaskar,
How did Ravana got success wi=
th Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and pur=
ity of mind ?
Where is the liberation without shakti, even the slaves were =
humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their masters, what results =
did they ever get ?
There is a saying in sanskrit, "Kshama shobhti us bhuja=
ng ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral ho"=
. Meaning, the shakti-heen (powerless) person needn't worry about forgiving=
, because his anger can do no harm to another. 

Regards,
Aryama

d. I am a strong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate ans=
wers to things not in our control. Thank you for sharing this simple mantra=

 their solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on internal strengths=

 to control, can the fire element inside us be considered to be pure? And s=
o on.<BR>> <BR>> If we are vulnerable to the six internal enemies - l=
ust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy - then aren't there sti=
ll impurities?<BR>> <BR>> Complete surrender and humility that I ment=

t; <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Whatever mantra you are given by your gu=
ru, whatever mantra you picked out of attraction, or whatever mantra you ot=
herwise do, please do not think too much whether it is the right mantra. Th=
at is secondary. IF there is a
 mantra you use, use it sincerely and with d=
evotion. Use it as a tool to increase your surrender and devotion. At that =
end, THAT is what matters and brings results.<BR>> <BR>> A person wit=
h a broken leg needs to use a walking stick until the leg cures and becomes=
 fit. How big or heavy the stick is, what wood it is made of, what is the c=
arving on it, etc, is not that important. The main purpose of the stick to =
give complete rest to the leg and help it cure fast. If one worries too muc=
h about the beauty and technical details of the stick and ends up putting s=
tress on the leg, the stick does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpfu=
l only if you consciously spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, yo=
u can then not only walk but also run. Similarly, a lot of technical detail=
s of the mantra do not matter much. Use mantra to focus the mind and cure i=
t of its conditioning (i.e. impurity!).<BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>&=

 Almighty are the ultimate answers to things not in our control. Thank you =
for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literally hundreds would =

 continue to use it for
 guidance for the future, but do not expect predict=
ions would come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! factorial permutations=
 and combinations to deal with, virtually making it impossible to predict c=
orrectly. But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, and for those who ha=
