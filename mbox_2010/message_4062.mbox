Namaste,

I am wondering whether there is any tradition of prayer for the d=
ead, or even for specific other persons, in Hinduism.  I mean, I understand=
 each atman is just a piece of the ultimate, and that ideally we should be =
praying for all of mankind.  Yet, have the rishis or anyone in our legacy e=
ver beseeched the gods on behalf of any individual?  And if the individual =
is 'dead' would that really matter as the atman is everlasting?

I am not q=
uite sure how to phrase what I want to ask.  My beloved mother passed away =
several months ago and I feel that I should do something to wish her well i=
n her journey toward the ultimate.  Is that wrong of me?  Is there anything=
 in Hinduism which speaks to that?
