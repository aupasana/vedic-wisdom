Subject: Personal and Impersonal Kaarmik debts (Re: Aghora books..)
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=77848939; y=h8XTJwZRvCL0SbVsfzkDooy50wkkhunB9bloI-6roqZq

Namaste,
 
Some karmik interactions are personal and some are impersonal.
 =

Suppose someone gives me some knowledge, thinking of me specifically as th=
e receiver and suppose I am happy to receive that knowledge from that perso=
n. The kaarmik interaction is personal. In order to pay it back, I (in this=
 or a future birth) will have to give something similar to the same person =
(in this or a future birth). 

On the other hand, suppose someone gives som=
e knowledge to everyone as one wants to spread that knowledge and suppose I=
 am happy to receive that knowledge from that person. The kaarmik interacti=
on is impersonal. In order to pay it back, I (in this or a future birth) wi=
ll have to give something similar to the universe (i.e. to someone or the o=
ther).
 
If you benefited from my astrology classes or my astrology softwar=
e or my homam manuals or from Svoboda's book or Vivekananda's writings, it =
is not necessary to give back to the same person. Share your wisdom with ot=
hers freely and put it to use to benefit others.
 
*        *        *
 
Bo=
ttomline: Take what you are able to and what you find really useful, but do=
 make sure you give more than what you take. Try to minimize what you take =
from materialistic people. Be indebted to a spiritual person rather than a =
materialistic person, as it will be better to deal with the former in a fut=
ure life if need be. But, when it comes to giving, give to all as freely as=
 you can. With knowledge like astrology, spirituality etc, try to share you=
r knowledge with others and create benefit for others. If nothing, it will =
atleast create a safety net for you if you were to come back to earth again=
.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

. Rina is all about giving and not taking. Most sense gratification people =
engage in involves more taking than giving. When you "give" something (to o=
thers or to universe), you are paying back your debt. When you "take" somet=
hing (from others or from universe), you are creating a new debt that will =
need to be paid back later. A simple formula is "give all you can and do no=
t get worked up if you are not receiving enough in return". Of course, when=
 you have an opportunity to give different things to different people and h=
ave to pick some, you have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to =
pay off a more important rina with the little you have!!
> >

lem is that it is so difficult to give without getting something back (i.e.=
 pay back old debt and create a new debt)! This is true with anything and n=
ot just the example of sex you mentioned. Of course, when it comes to sex, =
it may be even more difficult. One may tend to think more about one's own p=
leasure than partner's. Even when one thinks about partner's pleasure, it m=
ay be with an egoistic focus ("am *I* able to give pleasure"). Who forgets =
own pleasure and thinks "I will submit to the god in my partner and give as=
 much pleasure as I can to god in this form. My own pleasure does not matte=
r at all and I will not think about it"? If one indeed does that successful=
ly, then hardly new rina is created and old rina is paid back.

the golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowled=

 Aghora means "not terrible". One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A t=
rue  Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and=
 sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the think=

anifestations of god.

A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama naam satya hai" always. His mind rejects=
 all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by=
 classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about t=
hem with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is perma=

 But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure result=

 verse that says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus =
and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self w=
hile eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-=
nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other ha=
nd, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, i=
t will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad =
dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.

Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? A=
ghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one's t=
hought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certai=
nly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some=
 people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the t=
hrill such an understanding brings.  Aghora stands for neither thrills nor =
perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or per=
version. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, bu=
t Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking=
 by making failure very unpleasant.
