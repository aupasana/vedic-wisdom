Namaskar,

Also please add this question to the list.

1. Whats the FIRST a=
ccount of karma of a jeeva(in any form)?
2. Considering the scheme of etern=
ity in the background, what circumstances would have led a jeeva to take a =
right or wrong turn, which decided its future journey of eternity?
3. Assum=
ing that two jeevas started of their journey at some point, what triggered =
one to take a right and another to take a wrong turn? (Assuming that one wh=
ich too right at the first instance realized the supreme sooner than the ot=
her which is far way from the goal of realization becauase of multiplicatio=
n of wrong turns as a result of previous wrong - on the net balance basis)
=

Any thoughts on the above would help me strengthen my basics.

Thanks & Re=
gards

Sridhar
