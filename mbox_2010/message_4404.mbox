 Annamalai Swami, a lifelong devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi, was absorbed i=
n
his Master on November 9, 1995. He was 89-years-old. The Swami's remarkab=
le
story was edited by David Godman and published in 1994 by the Sri Annama=
lai
Swami Ashram Trust.

Annamalai Swami came to the Maharshi in 1928 and, =
at the Sage's behest,
undertook the supervision in the construction of the =
Goshala (cow shed),
Dining Hall, Dispensary and various other projects. In =
the mid-1940s,
Bhagavan instructed him to leave the ashram and engage in in=
tense sadhana. He
would then occasionally meet the Maharshi on his walks, b=
ut never again in
the fifty years that followed did he reenter Sri Ramanasr=
amam, preferring to
live a quiet, austere life in Palakottu. His small ashr=
am borders the
western boundary of Sri Ramanasramam and he was well known t=
o many devotees
and visitors to Tiruvannamalai.

In the passage below, exce=
rpted from Living By the Words Of Bhagavan,
Annamalai Swami relates the inc=
idents preceding his departure from Sri
Ramanasramam.

* * *
I came from To=
ndanguruchi where I had a stall to distribute water to the
needy. One day s=
omebody showed me the book Nan Yar (Who Am I?). I saw
Bhagavan's picture an=
d was instantly captivated.

I hastened to Tiruvannamalai the very same day=
, which happened to be a full
moon day. When I arrived at Tiruvannamalai, I=
 chanced to meet Seshadri Swami
near the Rettai Pillaiyar Koil, close to th=
e big temple, and received his
blessings. I then went to Sri Bhagavan.

MY =
days as an ashram worker were coming to a close, although I didn't
realize =
it at the time. In retrospect I can remember only one small incident
which =
indicated that Bhagavan knew that my time in the ashram was coming to
an en=
d.

I was doing some digging with a crowbar when Bhagavan came and asked me=
,
"Did you decide to do this work yourself or did Chinnaswami ask you to do=
 it
?"

I told him that Chinnaswami had asked me to do it. Bhagavan was not=
 very
pleased.

"So, he has given you work. So, he has given you work. Why =
is he giving you
work like this?"

A little later Yogi Ramiah remarked to B=
hagavan, "Annamalai Swami is working
very hard. His body has become very we=
ak. You should give him some rest."

Bhagavan agreed with him. "Yes, we hav=
e to give him some rest. We have to
give freedom to him."

A few days later=
 I went to Bhagavan's bathroom to help him with his morning
bath. Madhava S=
wami and I gave him the usual oil bath and massage.

When the bath was over=
 Madhava Swami asked a question: "Bhagavan, the people
who take ganja lehiy=
am [an ayurvedic preparation whose principal ingredient
is cannabis] experi=
ence some kind of ananda [bliss]. What is the nature of
this ananda ? Is it=
 the same ananda that the scriptures speak of?"

"Eating this ganja is a ve=
ry bad habit," replied Bhagavan. Then, laughing
loudly, he came over to me,=
 hugged me and called out, "Ananda! Ananda! This
is how these ganja-taking =
people behave!"

It was not a brief hug. Madhava Swami told me later that h=
e held me tightly
for about two minutes. After the first few seconds I comp=
letely lost
awareness of my body and the world. Initially, there was a feel=
ing of
happiness and bliss, but this soon gave way to a state in which ther=
e were
no feelings and no experiences. I did not lose consciousness, I just=
 ceased
to be aware of anything that was going on around me. I remained in =
this
state for about fifteen minutes. When I recovered my usual
world-consc=
iousness I was standing alone in the bathroom. Madhava Swami and
Bhagavan h=
ad long since departed for breakfast. I had not seen them open the
door and=
 leave, nor had I heard the breakfast bell.

This experience completely cha=
nged my life. As soon as I recovered normal
consciousness I knew that my wo=
rking life at Sri Ramanasramam had come to an
end. I knew that henceforth I=
 would be living outside the ashram and
spending most of my time in meditat=
ion. There was a rule that only those who
worked for the ashram could live =
there full-time. Those who wanted to spend
their time in meditation had to =
live somewhere else. I thus knew that I
would have to leave the ashram and =
fend for myself, but the thought of
losing my regular meals and my room nev=
er troubled me.

I made a belated appearance in the dining room to eat my l=
ast breakfast. As
soon as I had finished eating I went up onto the hill to =
look for Bhagavan.
I found him sitting on a big rock.

"I have decided to l=
eave the ashram," I said. "I want to go to Palakottu to
live alone and medi=
tate."

"Ah! Very good! Very good! Very good!" exclaimed Bhagavan.

The dec=
ision clearly had his approval. How could it be otherwise since it
was Bhag=
avan himself who gave me the experience which precipitated the
decision?

A=
fter getting Bhagavan's permission I packed my possessions and locked my
ro=
om. I also locked all the other places that were in my charge.

I took the =
bunch of keys to Chinnaswami and told him, "I have decided to go
and live i=
n Palakottu. Please take these keys and keep them."

Chinnaswami was, quite=
 naturally, very surprised. "Why are you leaving?" he
asked. "You have cons=
tructed all these buildings. You have done so much
here. How can you go aft=
er doing all this work? Where will you sleep? How
will you eat? You will ha=
ve many troubles because you have no way of
supporting yourself. Don't go, =
stay here."

I told him that I would not change my mind. I also tried to gi=
ve him the
keys but he refused to accept them. I didn't want another argume=
nt with him
so I just handed over the keys to Subramaniam, who was also in =
the office,
and left.

It was an abrupt change in my life. Within a few hou=
rs of having the
experience I was walking to Palakottu, knowing full well t=
hat I had left all
of my old working life behind me.
