 Chapter V - ACTION

1. All action is God's. His power has fixed each thing=
 into its own
individual function. By His agency the insentient objects and=
 the sentient
beings do their work. All actions are His.

2. All are doing =
their respective work. So what has God to do with it? We
will first conside=
r the sentient beings and, later on, the insentient
objects. We are sentien=
t beings. Let us first see whose actions are ours. We
all desire a higher s=
tate and work for it. But our achievements are not
uniform. Sometimes the g=
oal is the same and so is the work, but why is there
a difference in the re=
sults? Here God makes us understand that the action is
His. Otherwise all m=
ust be alike. The difference in the conditions cannot be
accounted for. Can=
 there be anyone who does not wish to improve his
position? Whatever their =
intention towards others, their intention towards
themselves is surely hone=
st. The conditions of people of the same intention
are yet different. This =
is because all actions are of God.

3. All beings have the same intention; =
yet their efforts are of different
degrees, so also their states. After say=
ing this, the question arises: What
is effort? Is it not simply a mental im=
age? All these images have the same
origin, namely, the common intention of=
 all. Why then should the image of
effort differ in each? Here too God make=
s us see that all actions are His.

4. If it is said that notwithstanding t=
he same intention, the effort can
vary according to individual capacity, th=
e question arises: What is the
source of this capacity? It is of the body a=
nd mind. The environment may
also affect it. One must take account of all t=
he factors before one makes an
effort. However, these factors are not under=
 one's control so that the
effort may not be equal to the task. Therefore a=
ll actions are God's.

5. Again, if it is said that the body, the mind and =
the environment will
gradually be made equal to the task, it implies a pres=
ent incapacity. This
is to admit that all actions are God's.

6. Now, is it=
 for good or bad that people do not gain their objectives? It
is certainly =
good. Why? Most of them are selfish. Judge for yourself if
their success is=
 for the good of the world or otherwise. You may ask: Should
not the attemp=
ts of the unselfish be entirely successful? Though to all
appearances they =
may look unselfish, yet they are not free from blemishes.
These depend on t=
he ego. If the imagined unselfishness has given rise to a
sense of superior=
ity over others, God frustrates their purpose and teaches
them that "You ar=
e also like others and I govern you". On the other hand,
free from selfishn=
ess and free from ego is the representative of God, within
whom the cloud o=
f ego that conceals God does not exist and from whom God is
ever shining fo=
rth. To such a one of true purpose (Sattva Sankalpa) all his
intentions com=
e out true. God shines forth directly in him. There is no
darkness in him. =
Only he knows the Divine purpose as it is. Through him God
fulfills the pur=
pose of His creation. All actions are God's.

7. If it is asked: Is there n=
ot a single person of true intent? And why
should not the world have all bl=
essings in full? The answer, which is a
secret, is that the sages who are a=
ware that all actions are God's, wish to
make it known to others as well. T=
here is no greater good than to know that
all actions are God's and not our=
 own. This knowledge contains all the
blessings in itself. Therefore the in=
tention of the sages is to clearly
instruct others in the knowledge of God =
and His actions. Even so, they do
not say "Know God this very instant," but=
 they teach the ways and means to
knowledge and encourage us in right condu=
ct-this much only. They do not say,
"Be emancipated at once." Why? Because =
this is not possible for the common
people. Nor do the sages say to God, "L=
iberate the people at once." Because
the sages are free from the ego and th=
ink, "God knows what He should do and
when to do it. What is there for me t=
o say to Him?" Thus they wish only to
do their work, without any interest i=
n the fruits this work may produce.
They have known that God alone dispense=
s the fruits of actions. Simply they
watch the course of events in the worl=
d and do their work, never thinking of
creating a world of their own. Why? =
To do so is a form of egoism. The
creation is as it should be. Everything i=
s in order. All actions are God's.

8. Knowing their actions are subservien=
t to the Higher Power, how could they
hope to achieve something dear to the=
ir hearts? No, they cannot. They will
do their work simply as a duty. The s=
criptures say, "Do work, but do not
think of its fruits." Just as anger unc=
onsciously overpowers a man even
though he is determined not to get angry, =
so also the sages of true intent
(Sattva Sankalpa) may be shocked by the in=
iquities of the world and
unwittingly think, "God, let that be made good!" =
If so, then it will
certainly happen and good will prevail. This is the cau=
se of some
extraordinary events in the world. These extraordinary events ar=
e the
results of a wish stealing into the mind of a sage. This is the law o=
f
nature. Who can change it? All actions are God's.

9. Whatever takes plac=
e, it is in the natural order of things. Also, it is
right. Everything happ=
ens by His will alone. In truth, it is not wrong to
think "He makes the thi=
ef steal." Why? Because at the time of punishment He
also makes the thief s=
uffer for the robbery. Thus, there should be no
ill-will directed towards t=
he thief. Such is the fruit of the knowledge that
all actions are God's.Alt=
hough there is no ill-will towards the thief, there
is a dislike of theft. =
This is also the result of our knowledge that all
actions are God's. How is=
 this? Because the thief himself dislikes theft:
Would he keep quiet if his=
 own belongings were stolen by another? He would
not. Who can be unaware th=
at good is right and evil is wrong? Therefore the
knowledge that all action=
s are God's will bring into the world an era of
orderly conduct. Our knowle=
dge does not extend further. We can repeat only
what we know. We need not w=
orry about what lies beyond our knowledge. This
too is God's will.

10. One=
 of the fruits of knowledge granted to us by God is the knowledge
that all =
actions are God's. We are powerless to ask God, "Why do you act
thus?" Beca=
use the fruits of our actions are not always according to our
desire, all r=
eligions admit similar states of our powerlessness. In other
words, because=
 our powers are limited, we cannot but say that all actions
are God's. The =
law which applies to us, applies to insentient objects also.
Our law is no =
better than theirs. All is one. Even though some do not admit
that all acti=
ons are God's, yet they admit their own incapacity. This itself
is the act =
of God.

Chapter VI - EGO

1. Oh ego, all the evils of the world are from y=
ou. To crush you, the kings
make laws and the wise give lessons. In spite o=
f their efforts from time
immemorial, alas! you are yet alive; you simply g=
o into hiding and reappear
again and again. Can there be no end to you? Yea=
, it is surely approaching.
Another Ego has started to kill you. It is the =
Universal Ego called "I am
Brahman".

2. Eh! ego, think not that your enemy=
 is of your kind. You are perishable
whereas He is not. You are conceited a=
s "I" because you always differentiate
as "I", "you" and "he," but your ene=
my is free from this conceit. How? He
harmonizes all differences, resolves =
all into Himself. Moreover, you feel
enmity towards Him because he has aris=
en to kill you. But He has no
ill-feelings towards you. How is this? Becaus=
e you are not to be found in
His presence. He regards you as a part of His =
limbs. Your loss in his
proximity is the working of your own falsity; He wo=
uld not think of killing
you because you are of no consequence in His sight=
. Therefore, ego, you are
His enemy, but He is not yours. More briefly put,=
 you are your own enemy.
Why? Owing to your greed you flaunted yourself bef=
ore the Great One as you
would elsewhere. Instantly, you were lost; therefo=
re, the Universal Self
obscures you by devouring you and then shines forth =
as All-light.

3. Eh! ego, the evils of your works have no limits. You are =
not content
unless you are exalted above others and others are lowered befo=
re you.
Endless are your desires, such as "By what title shall I gain honor=
?" "In
what form shall I appear elegant?" "Do others bow to me? Do others o=
bey me
in silence?" "Do others say that no one excels me?". Alas! How short=
 is your
life! And yet to how much do you aspire! And how much evil you do!=
 You have
deluded yourself that there is happiness in such ideas and in
dif=
ferentiating yourself from all others. This is not to your good. Why not?
A=
re not others also entitled to all these? What is your share in things
whic=
h are common to millions and millions of others? Such being the case, do
no=
t desire in vain to rule over all. By your vain desire you bring about
evil=
 to yourself and to others. Listen to my friendly advice. Truly
speaking, H=
e whom you regard as your mortal enemy is your friend. He knows
how to make=
 you worthy of true greatness and blessings. Surrender to Him.
This Univers=
al Ego does not treat you as an enemy but is your greatest
benefactor.

4. =
By no means can you discover what He will make of you unless you
surrender =
yourself to Him. However much I may speak of it, you cannot
understand. It =
is a matter of experience. Doubtless He will do nothing less
than exalt you=
 to His state. Therefore, be not perplexed about your future;
directly surr=
ender yourself. You can always turn away if joy does not
overtake you from =
the very instant of surrender.Just as the drinking of milk
starts with an a=
greeable taste and ends with the satisfaction of hunger, so
also surrender =
starts with delight and ends with Perfect Bliss, which lies
beyond evenplea=
sure and pain. Therefore your goal, without doubt, is this
Universal Ego (I=
-am-Brahman).

5. What will be your new name after surrender? There is no n=
ame besides
yours. The Vedas laud you; the world praises you; the essence o=
f religious
teachings is yourself. Then what is your form? All forms are yo=
urs. There is
no form which is not yours. What is installed in the temples =
of worship is
you; what is described in the Vedas is you; festivities and c=
elebrations are
all for you. Now what can be your power? In your presence t=
he world is
active; each is what it is, because of you. Briefly said, all t=
hings glorify
you and bear witness to your being. They are duty bound to do=
 so. You would
not have even dreamt that this will be your state. Start at =
once, be not
self-conceited. The Universal Ego awaits you.

6. Do you wish =
to wake up from your dream or continue in it? How long will
the dream image=
s last? Be not idle, shake off your sleep, wake up! You are
witnessing your=
 own mental images and imagining more and more. It is all in
vain. Just fin=
d out who it is that sees the visions. Do not delude yourself
that you are =
these that rise and sink in you. Wake up. The instant you wake
up you will =
know that waking is better than this dream. Get up!The Universal
Ego waits =
to rejoice at seeing you awake.

7. Fear not the cessation of the present e=
go dream. Once you are awake you
will enjoy the same all the more. You will=
 no longer be deluded and will
observe it with cheerful detachment, unconfu=
sed. The folly of all
appearances will be understood and you will have no b=
urdens. In dream your
mental imagery assumes shapes. On waking you know the=
 dream as just a
dream. Do not mistake dream for the waking state. Know the=
 dream as dream.
For doing so, you must reach the state of "I-am-Brahman" (=
Universal Ego) and
wake from the illusion of the ego.

8. I have instructed=
 you for your good and not in my own interest. If you
believe me, you shoul=
d act upon what I have taught you. On the other hand,
if you see no good in=
 what I have said, then turn away from this ideal. How
can I help you if my=
 advice and all the advice of the saints do not make any
impression on you?=
 No state is higher than this. Believe me, it is for your
good that you rea=
lize this truth; and through you others may realize the
same. Be free from =
self-conceit. Start at once. Realize that the Universal
Ego is your own.

9=
 Oh ego, see how you are a slave to all and therefore suffer. How pitiable
=
is your state! All are hostile to you! When you say "for me only," all
othe=
rs will also contend "for me only, for me only". When you say "I am
great,"=
 they protest, "Why? We are also." All are hostile to you. Owing to
the tro=
ubles caused by others, your mental images increase a million fold.
Should =
you not rise above them and profit by surrendering to a Master? Then
all yo=
ur enemies will befriend you. If you say to others, "All these are
yours," =
everyone becomes your friend. There is only One who can make you
that magna=
nimous and that is "I-am-Brahman" (Universal Ego).

10. I shall say one wor=
d only and this is not owing to my egoism. It is
simply my duty. I do not s=
ay this word just for your or my good alone. It is
for the good of all. The=
 truth is "I-am-Brahman" (Universal Ego).

d.<br>

<br>3. All beings have the same intention; yet their efforts are of=

rises: What is effort? Is it not simply a mental image? All these images ha=
ve the same origin, namely, the common intention of all. Why then should th=

it that all actions are God's.<br><br>6. Now, is it for good or bad tha=

t God alone dispenses the fruits of actions. Simply they watch the course o=
f events in the world and do their work, never thinking of creating a world=
 of their own. Why? To do so is a form of egoism. The creation is as it sho=
uld be. Everything is in order. All actions are God's.<br>

<br>8. Know=

o your good. Why not? Are not others also entitled to all these? What is yo=
ur share in things which are common to millions and millions of others? Suc=
h being the case, do not desire in vain to rule over all. By your vain desi=
re you bring about evil to yourself and to others.</span>=C2=A0Listen to my=
 friendly advice. Truly speaking, He whom you regard as your mortal enemy i=
s your friend. He knows how to make you worthy of true greatness and blessi=
ngs. Surrender to Him. This Universal Ego does not treat you as an enemy bu=
t is your greatest benefactor.<br>

<br>4. By no means can you discover wha=
t He will make of you unless you surrender yourself to Him. However much I =
may speak of it, you cannot understand. It is a matter of experience. Doubt=
less He will do nothing less than exalt you to His state. Therefore, be not=
 perplexed about your future; directly surrender yourself. You can always t=
urn away if joy does not overtake you from the very instant of surrender.<s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">Just as the drinking of milk starts with an =
agreeable taste and ends with the satisfaction of hunger, so also surrender=
 starts with delight and ends with Perfect Bliss, which lies beyond evenple=
asure and pain. Therefore your goal, without doubt, is this Universal Ego (=
I-am-Brahman).</span><br>

<br>5. What will be your new name after surrende=
r? There is no name besides yours. The Vedas laud you; the world praises yo=
u; the essence of religious teachings is yourself. Then what is your form? =
All forms are yours. There is no form which is not yours. What is installed=
 in the temples of worship is you; what is described in the Vedas is you; f=
estivities and celebrations are all for you. Now what can be your power? In=
 your presence the world is active; each is what it is, because of you. Bri=
efly said, all things glorify you and bear witness to your being. They are =
duty bound to do so. You would not have even dreamt that this will be your =
state. Start at once, be not self-conceited. The Universal Ego awaits you.<=
br>

<br>6.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Do you wish to wake up fr=
om your dream or continue in it? How long will the dream images last? Be no=
t idle, shake off your sleep, wake up! You are witnessing your own mental i=
mages and imagining more and more. It is all in vain. Just find out who it =
is that sees the visions. Do not delude yourself that you are these that ri=
se and sink in you. Wake up. The instant you wake up you will know that wak=
ing is better than this dream. Get up!</span>The Universal Ego waits to rej=
oice at seeing you awake.<br>

<br>7. Fear not the cessation of the present=
 ego dream. Once you are awake you will enjoy the same all the more. You wi=
ll no longer be deluded and will observe it with cheerful detachment, uncon=
fused. The folly of all appearances will be understood and you will have no=
 burdens. In dream your mental imagery assumes shapes. On waking you know t=
he dream as just a dream.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Do not mist=
ake dream for the waking state. Know the dream as dream. For doing so, you =
must reach the state of "I-am-Brahman" (Universal Ego) and wake f=
rom the illusion of the ego.</span><br>

<br>8. I have instructed you for y=
our good and not in my own interest. If you believe me, you should act upon=
 what I have taught you. On the other hand, if you see no good in what I ha=
ve said, then turn away from this ideal. How can I help you if my advice an=
d all the advice of the saints do not make any impression on you? No state =
is higher than this. Believe me, it is for your good that you realize this =
truth; and through you others may realize the same. Be free from self-conce=
it. Start at once. Realize that the Universal Ego is your own.<br>

<br>9 O=
h ego, see how you are a slave to all and therefore suffer. How pitiable is=
 your state! All are hostile to you! When you say "for me only," =
all others will also contend "for me only, for me only". When you=
 say "I am great," they protest, "Why? We are also." Al=
l are hostile to you. Owing to the troubles caused by others, your mental i=
mages increase a million fold. Should you not rise above them and profit by=
 surrendering to a Master? Then all your enemies will befriend you. If you =
say to others, "All these are yours," everyone becomes your frien=
d. There is only One who can make you that magnanimous and that is "I-=
am-Brahman" (Universal Ego).<br>

<br>10. I shall say one word only an=
d this is not owing to my egoism. It is simply my duty. I do not say this w=
ord just for your or my good alone. It is for the good of all. The truth is=
 "I-am-Brahman" (Universal Ego).<br>
