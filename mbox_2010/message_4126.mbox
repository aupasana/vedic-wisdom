 5-1-46 Afternoon

Our real nature is mukti. But we are imagining we are bo=
und and are making
various strenuous attempts to become free, while we are =
all the while
free. This
will be understood only when we reach that stage. =
We will be surprised that
we were frantically trying to attain something wh=
ich we have always been and
are.

An illustration will make this clear.

A =
man goes to sleep in this hall. He dreams he has gone on a world tour, is
r=
oaming over hill and dale, forest and country,desert and sea, across
variou=
s continents and after many years of weary and strenuous travel,
returns to=
 this country, reaches Tiruvannamalai, enters the Asramam and
walks into th=
e hall.Just at that moment he wakes up and finds he has not
moved an inch b=
ut was sleeping where he lay down. He has not returned after
great effort t=
o this hall, but is and always has been in the hall. It is
exactly like tha=
t.

If it is asked, why being free we imagine we are bound, I answer, =E2=
=80=9CWhy being
in the hall did you imagine you were on a world adventure, =
crossing hill and
dale, desert and sea? It is all mind or maya.=E2=80=9D
