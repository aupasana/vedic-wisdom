1) When the fictitious ego, who has accumulated tendencies from the
beginni=
ngless past,is burnt by the Fire of Jnana, that Reality which alone
remains=
 within is the Sacred Vibhuti.This you should know.

Sadhu Om: Vibhuti repr=
esents Self, which alone shines after the ego=E2=80=99s
destruction.

2)The=
 Supreme Lord having taken the form of the Guru,lights the Fire of
Jnana th=
rough His Supreme Speech [Para Vak], proclaiming without words the
One Syll=
able,and thus burns the ego within the pure heart of His disciple.
The Vibh=
uti He gives is the restoration of Self.

Sadhu Om:Vibhuti is prepared by b=
urning cowdung in an airtight oven. In
Saiva Siddhanta the jiva is generall=
y known as the =E2=80=98cow=E2=80=99,so the cow-dung
used here symbolises t=
he jiva=E2=80=99s vasanas, which when burnt to ashes, leave
only Self.

3) =
Those who wear such Vibhuti are unequalled in all respects in this world.
S=
uch Vibhuti, which is Reality,the thought-free and wonderful Jnana, is
eter=
nal divine wealth.

4) When the insentient ego turns inwards through Self-a=
ttention and dies,
the Fire of Jnana burns in the Heart and consumes all th=
e three worlds in
its blazing red flame, which is the significance of the r=
ed kumkum.

Michael James: The three worlds are heaven, earth and the nethe=
r regions.
