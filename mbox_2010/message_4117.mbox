>From whatever little I have=C2=A0understood -=C2=A0my unde=
rstanding=C2=A0maybe completely off the mark -=C2=A0about vairagya, it can =
be of two types. One is the detachment of a smahsan. When=C2=A0someone goes=
 to a smashan=C2=A0for whatever purpose, he/she feels a sense=C2=A0of detac=
hment=C2=A0regarding most material purposes. This is a sort of smashan=C2=
=A0vairagya, which is good but may not be good enough. Once you come out of=
 the smashan, the desires starts coming back in full force with more energy=
. It is like forcing one self to cut off all things. But this kind of force=
 is only temporary.After a point the spring will jump back with greater for=
ce than before.
=C2=A0
The other maybe a detachment resulting out of a high=
er attachement. Which means that your love and surrenderance to your chosen=
 deity becomes so intense that you slowly lose interest in things of the wo=
rld. That maybe a more long lasting detachment.

He wasn't saying t=
o indulge in anything, but to realize that one shouldn't get hung up in the=
 other direction either. The objective is to have neither aversion nor atta=
chment. For most of us, we have to practice not having attachment, because =
we indulge excessively, but this is a pointer to not go too much the other =
way, because that creates its own unhealthy attachment/aversion . So even w=
hile we practice renunciation we should keep in mind that this is a practic=
e, and the objective is balance not just avoidance of pleasures for the sak=
e of avoidance. Excessive wearing of hair shirts or self-flagellation (lite=
ral or figurative) leads to a perverse enlargement of the ego and a reverse=
 attachment, so one has to be balanced. I think that's the point of the art=
icle.

 (at=C2=A0a stage where one is not in the state / capable of witnessing the=

Please correct me if i'm tot=

SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA =
BY SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA (MESSAGE 4)

Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.=


------------ --------- ---

Unnecessary torture of the body in the name o=
f Tapas is highly deprecable. This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. Thi=
s is condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of th=
e Lord. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana=
 if the body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as m=
uch an evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. Th=
is Abhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than =
the Abhimana of worldly persons.

Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It =
is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the b=
ody-idea. The feeling, "I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhiman=
a. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanit=
y, is a public property. He has no claim on it because he denies the existe=
nce of body and tries to feel always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public wil=
l take care of his body.

Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe austeri=
ties, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He heard the=
 song:

"Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar's tuned, 

Tune us the Sitar =
neither low nor high. 

And we will dance away the hearts of men 

The stri=
ng o'erstretched breaks and the music flies,

The string o'erslack is dumb =
and music dies, 

Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high."

Then he ate foo=
d, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asce=
ticism is not at all necessary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is =
strong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fi=
t for the practice of severe austerities. The body will drop down if you ta=
x it too much by way of rigid Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in t=
he name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for t=
he body. Be prepared to give it up at any time for a noble cause.

The care=
-taker of the horse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, =
when it is ailing. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, this bo=
dy should be injected with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out goo=
d work. Then only it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overw=
ork or ailment. Work will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When =
the body grows old it must be well-protected against cold and well-looked a=
fter. If hard Titiksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequentl=
y, the other shore of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.

O Ra=
m, neglect not this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continu=
e to extract as much work as possible from those selfless workers who have =
dedicated their lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service=
 till the last breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, =
"My dear Prahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from =
your Samadhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide." Yoga Vasi=
shtha speaks of one as a "Maha Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced t=
he idea of "I am a Tyagi" and "I am a Vairagi", who neither accepts nor rej=
ects things that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent =
witness, the Immortal Atma, who feels always "I am Akarta (non-doer)", "I a=
m Abhokta (non-enjoyer) " even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, =
"But the disciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free fro=
m attraction and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to
Peace." Chapter I=
I-64.

Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" =
or "Maha Bhogins" and quote scriptures also: "We eat without tongues; we se=
e without eyes". The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They ar=
e just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pa=
lates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pav=
akah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=E2=80=94"Weapons clea=
ve him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him a=
way". Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellec=
ts! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines=
 under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trish=
nas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocri=
te without difficulty.

A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accep=
t some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he will n=
ot crave for them. He will not say, "I have enjoyed today good mangoes or g=
ood milk." If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not able to eat sol=
id food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he has no=
 money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of his own=
 accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He take=
s care of his devotees by working through the minds of various persons.

Th=
e child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If the mother as=
ks the child in the morning. "Baby, you took food last night," he replies, =
"I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and joking with me."=
 Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He =
eats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells without a =
nose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he=
 comes to waking consciousness, "O Prema! Do you know that you talked last =
night when you were dreaming?" He replies "I do not remember anything." Suc=
h is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.

Durvasa at=
e a sumptuous meal and yet he said, "I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat any=
thing. I take grass juice only", because he identified himself with the Atm=
a who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regarded a=
s a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sag=
e Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, "My beloved! Say unto the river that my hu=
sband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give path of way. She will=
 at once yield and you can cross it without a boat." She repeated the words=
 of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She was quite amazed at =
the words of her husband and asked him, "My Lord! You are living with me an=
d yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I =
am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy." Tiruvalluvar replied, "I am im=
mortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do=
 not do anything. I am the silent witness. The senses,
body, mind and intel=
lect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct from them." Tiruvalluvai' s=
 wife understood the nature of the soul and then she became silent.

Ordina=
ry aspirants with delicate health should not take recourse to the practice =
of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of =
Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an aspirant with delicate health g=
ives up food and tries to live on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is =
that he will get various sorts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away =
soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.

If=
 you have mastery over the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you c=
an bear intense heat and intense cold, if you can remain without clothing i=
n the icy Gangotri, this is highly creditable indeed. But if your frame is =
delicate, if you attempt to stand before the sun in summer for some hours, =
if you throw off your clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you will die im=
mediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to take recours=
e to these hard practices. What little you will gain by Japa and meditation=
 in this birth will be lost, and you have lost one chance given by the Lord=
 in this birth to reach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.

An=
 aspirant gave up his clothing all at once. He developed rheumatism, malari=
a, enlarged spleen and died within a short time. During the period of sickn=
ess all cravings that were temporarily suppressed asserted themselves with =
re-doubled force. He became a slave of the tongue. He craved for many varie=
ties of food. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscriminately and died =
of acute diarrhoea.

An aspirant said, "I have not realised the Self though=
 I did meditation for some years. I am going to commit suicide with the Bha=
va, "I am immortal Atma". I have got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me=
, because my motive is pure. I will attain self-realisation. " He actually =
committed the abominable act. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the =
scriptures? Certainly not. This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who =
have no idea of the nature of true Vairagya, who have not lived under the g=
uidance of their masters for some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can =
never get salvation by taking to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) ma=
y be pure. They cannot entertain the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of =
committing the act. Horrible thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. =
They will have to share obviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).

The mind sh=
ould gradually be weaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off al=
l at once its pleasure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why=
 young aspirants who take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of co=
mmitting suicide. You should train the mind in meditation gradually and mak=
e it taste the inner bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and =
old cravings and you can get yourself established in true Vairagya.

The mo=
re the Viveka, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually=
 grows in the garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world i=
s a mere appearance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only=
 reality full of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of med=
itation and association with the realised souls for a protracted period. Ev=
entually, all objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as =
trifling or worthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life ev=
en if the wealth of the whole world is offered to him.

Aspirants should gi=
ve up those articles of food which they like best for some time. They shoul=
d discipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead =
a simple life. They should always eat simple food. But they should not beco=
me slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses=
 this in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual object=
s.

May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free fr=
om the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!

May you all possess true lasting Para =
Vairagya!!

May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !

Real Vairagya

T=
here was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat=
 and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for some hours. In winter =
he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of=
 grass. He shunned wooden cots.

On one occasion one of his admirers, Sri R=
am, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyas=
i refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to provide a bed of grass. Ther=
e was much rain on that day. It was extremely difficult for him to get gras=
s. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swami a bed of grass with great d=
ifficulty.

Sri Ram said: "Swamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here.=
 It is raining now in torrents. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bin=
d you in any way. You are an advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether =
the body lies on a bed of grass or on a cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, =
no. I must have my usual bed of grass only. You must bring it anyhow."

Att=
achment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a =
means for attaining wisdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevan=
mukta or realised sage has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a lit=
tle dry bread alone, he is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you giv=
e him best sweetmeats, milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not=
 be elated by good food. He always takes delight in his own Self only, but =
not in external objects. This is the test to find out whether a man has att=
ained realisation or not. A worldly man is much troubled when he cannot get=
 the right kind of food which he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains pa=
latable dishes. A realised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes a=
nd dislikes.

Suka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food=
 at the gate for some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the=
 harem. Ranees served him and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. T=
his is wisdom.

Obviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie=
 had not attained equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached =
to Vairagya even after several years of spiritual practice. He was not comp=
letely free from all sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairag=
ya. He did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is q=
uite indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on t=
he bed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same f=
eeling.

He who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is calle=
d a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vair=
agya, but it is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.

Some San=
nyasins who are working for the public good make resolves: "We will not tra=
vel in trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We wi=
ll not use fountain pens or watch." These are not desirable resolves. This =
is not the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. Thi=
s is another kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars =
or trains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more servi=
ce in a short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out mu=
ch work if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This=
 is one kind. It does not leave even educated persons or cultured Sannyasin=
s.

Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and=
 respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner=
 Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.

Where is the strength of Vairagya when one=
 lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the strength of=
 Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to renou=
nce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is no att=
raction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he shows exter=
nally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny=
 bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?

Raja Janaka was amid=
st regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila was burst and=
 yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be cal=
led a real great Virakta.

Young aspirants should be very careful and cauti=
ous. They should not take advantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Ma=
ha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal =
vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their resolves of Truth, =
Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and spirit.

May you a=
ll transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. May you al=
l understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.

Vairagya is the rei=
n by which the uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense =
attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything other than Atm=
a.

If one considers the position and happiness of Brahma even as the dung =
of a cow, then only he has developed a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fle=
eting dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help the aspirant in the atta=
inment of Self-realisation.

It is common to have dispassion for some parti=
cular objects by some cause or other. But by having dispassion for all obje=
cts at all times, one will get knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnan=
a soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion to him, and by practice of wha=
t he instructs.

Do not fall a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in=
 towns with young and well-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised soci=
eties. Resolve to attain Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its =
own accord.

Devotion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means=
 of salvation. Dispassion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in t=
he chambers of the heart and so everybody has this Atma.

Light on Vairagya=


Vairagya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eter=
nal and non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. =
Viveka comes through disinterested selfless service done in several births =
and through Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Vive=
ka is born Vairagya. It gives spiritual strength.

A man of Vairagya has no=
 attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, in=
exhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, =
Samadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberatio=
n or Emancipation, or Release.

Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever the=
re is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is di=
slike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important a=
fflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avid=
ya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinive=
sha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. Fro=
m this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and fro=
m Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.

Vairagya is of diff=
erent types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate a=
nd intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to stick to this =
path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, th=
e mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that were renounced p=
reviously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not be able to cli=
mb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants should be careful=
. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try to make it mo=
derate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into the defects of=
 sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is illusory, tran=
sient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again by looking in=
to the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened t=
hrough study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.

Simply liv=
ing in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow's urine does not con=
stitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of discrimination, enquiry a=
nd Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoyments and render=
ed thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and then only the Vairag=
ya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudi=
ty and these external things will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairag=
ya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us last=
ing happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again =
and again, persisted in for a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It=
 is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It ma=
kes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tende=
ncy of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects, at once it will poi=
nt out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause
for re=
birth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually =
through intense practice, it is established in real, lasting, sustained, in=
tense Vairagya.

Vairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vai=
ragya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation. The whole wo=
rld then looks like a straw. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Pa=
ra Vairagya.

Without Vairagya there cannot be any real spiritual progress.=
 In Vedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya=
, all other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says "Abhya=
asa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=E2=80=94"The mind is controlled by medit=
ation or Sadhana and Vairagya." They are the two wings of the aspirant to s=
oar high into the realm of Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Krishna also=
 says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihyate"=E2=80=94"The mind i=
s controlled by practice and Vairagya, dispassion, intense detachment." By =
Vairagya, the mind is detached. He who works in a detached way is not bound=
 by Karma. So it is aspirants' duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhan=
a-anka, Vairagya.

Vairagya is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind do=
es not run into sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen =
Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amid=
st the temptations of the world, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and=
 wisdom. So she was not affected in the least by the attractive objects of =
the world, even though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaj=
a, went to the forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in=
 Vairagya. He was attached to the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A=
 man may be attached to any one object.

You see a Vairagi. His whole body =
is smeared with ash, but he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a=
 rupee to another Vairagi. This is his mental state. So by external appeara=
nce you cannot tell that one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri =
Ramanuja does not belong to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing o=
nly a rope around the waist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind w=
as not polluted. He had that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indiffer=
ence, born of Viveka.

Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extrem=
e asceticism. "Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaiva=
ntassareerast ham tan vidhyasuranischayan ."=E2=80=94"They torture all the =
elements in the body and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha also =
tortured his body, and later on he found out that there was not much spirit=
ual progress; and then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we=
 should go by the middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaini=
ng Self-realisation. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones=
. So you should not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you s=
hould have. You should not expose the body to chill. God has given common s=
ense. So you should practise "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm in ta=
king good, healthy food. Every man has got a different physical constitutio=
n. You should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you =
cannot sit for a long
time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash=
 or some fruits. You should have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya internally an=
d at the same time follow the middle path externally.

Generally, aspirants=
 say: "I have given up umbrella."=E2=80=A6 "I take only one meal." Their wh=
ole Sadhana is: "I have given up shirt."=E2=80=A6 "I have given up sweater.=
"=E2=80=A6 "I have given up shoes."=E2=80=A6 "I live only on bread and dhal=
." Their Sadhana consists in "giving up"=E2=80=94give up this, give up that=
. Real spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no=
 giving up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to th=
e mind. If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and=
 a small cup of milk. Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency =
to the mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigila=
nt.

At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =
a great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=
n the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=
e a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=
 wonderful man and made him his Guru.

Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vair=
agi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He al=
ways slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sl=
eep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to=
 sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this =
cult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, and the=
y wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This is Va=
iragya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni =
Tapas. They have got a physical body.

There is another great Vairagi, our =
Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take=
 food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after meals. "Avadho=
otas" are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is on=
e who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, y=
ou will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere life. He was P=
oornabodha' s Guru and Swami Krishnananda' s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they=
 prepared very good food, and Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given=
 to cows. He used to make severe tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. =
He had a very strong body and lived an austere life.

<DIV>F=
rom whatever little I have understood - my understanding may=
be completely off the mark - about vairagya, it can be of two types. O=
ne is the detachment of a smahsan. When someone goes to a smashan =
;for whatever purpose, he/she feels a sense of detachment regardi=
ng most material purposes. This is a sort of smashan vairagya, which i=
s good but may not be good enough. Once you come out of the smashan, the de=
sires starts coming back in full force with more energy. It is like forcing=
 one self to cut off all things. But this kind of force is only temporary.A=
fter a point the spring will jump back with greater force than before.</DIV=
>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The other maybe a detachment resulting out of a hi=
gher attachement. Which means that your love and surrenderance to your chos=
en deity becomes so intense that you slowly lose interest in things of the =
world. That maybe a more long lasting detachment.</DIV>

<DIV>He wasn't saying to indulge in anything, but to realize that =
one shouldn't get hung up in the other direction either. The objective is t=

 not having attachment, because we indulge excessively, but this is a point=

<DIV>This is a very nice read. To be h=

<DIV>Yes, i agree to many fact=

ized  soul than an ignorant like me. The reference point seems to be f=
rom a different plane although good to know such. What i mean by this is:</=

<DIV>As the article describes coupel of examples lik=
e the Sage insisting on bed of grass denying the cot is attached to vairagy=
a ...also..point on accepting fruits, mil,sumptuous meal etc ..</DIV>
<DIV>=
.i think practically speaking unless one practices attachment to vairagya h=
e may not acheive the real vairagya..just by accepting the cot whichever co=
mes his way and keep indulging in the activities (at a stage where one=
 is not in the state / capable of witnessing the likes and dislikes alike) =
is a path to doom.</DIV>

<DIV>SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA=
 (MESSAGE 4)<BR><BR>Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.<BR><BR>--------=
---- --------- ---<BR><BR>Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of Ta=
pas is highly deprecable. This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is=
 condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lo=
rd. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if =
the body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much =
an evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This A=
bhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the =
Abhimana of worldly persons.<BR><BR>Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. I=
t is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the=
 body-idea. The feeling, "I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi" is Vairagya Abhim=
ana. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of human=
ity, is a public
 property. He has no claim on it because he denies the exi=
stence of body and tries to feel always: "I am Siva (Sivoham)". The public =
will take care of his body.<BR><BR>Lord Buddha tortured the body, did sever=
e austerities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He =
heard the song:<BR><BR>"Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar's tuned, <BR><=
BR>Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. <BR><BR>And we will dance away t=
he hearts of men <BR><BR>The string o'erstretched breaks and the music flie=
s,<BR><BR>The string o'erslack is dumb and music dies, <BR><BR>Tune us the =
Sitar neither low nor high."<BR><BR>Then he ate food, adopted the middle pa=
th and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all nec=
essary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya b=
orn of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of se=
vere austerities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of =
rigid
 Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have =
a strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to=
 give it up at any time for a noble cause.<BR><BR>The care-taker of the hor=
se feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing=
. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be inje=
cted with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only=
 it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. W=
ork will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows ol=
d it must be well-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Tit=
iksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shor=
e of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.<BR><BR>O Ram, neglect =
not this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continue to extrac=
t as much work as possible from those selfless workers who have dedicated
 =
their lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service till the =
last breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, "My dear P=
rahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samad=
hi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide." Yoga Vasishtha spea=
ks of one as a "Maha Tyagi" and "Maha Bhogi", who has renounced the idea of=
 "I am a Tyagi" and "I am a Vairagi", who neither accepts nor rejects thing=
s that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, t=
he Immortal Atma, who feels always "I am Akarta (non-doer)", "I am Abhokta =
(non-enjoyer) " even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, "But the d=
isciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free from attracti=
on and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to<BR>Peace." Chapter II-64.<B=
R><BR>Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for "Maha Tyagins" o=
r "Maha Bhogins" and quote scriptures also: "We eat without
 tongues; we se=
e without eyes". The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They ar=
e just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pa=
lates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94"Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pav=
akah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah"=E2=80=94"Weapons clea=
ve him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him a=
way". Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellec=
ts! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines=
 under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trish=
nas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocri=
te without difficulty.<BR><BR>A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to=
 accept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he =
will not crave for them. He will not say, "I have enjoyed today good mangoe=
s or good milk." If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not
 able to =
eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he=
 has no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of =
his own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. =
He takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of various perso=
ns.<BR><BR>The child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If =
the mother asks the child in the morning. "Baby, you took food last night,"=
 he replies, "I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and jok=
ing with me." Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Ma=
ha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smel=
ls without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you as=
k him when he comes to waking consciousness, "O Prema! Do you know that you=
 talked last night when you were dreaming?" He replies "I do not remember a=
nything." Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha
 Tyagi and Maha Bhog=
i.<BR><BR>Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, "I am a Nitya Upava=
si. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only", because he identified =
himself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord K=
rishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini=
 and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, "My beloved! Say unto =
the river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give p=
ath of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat." Sh=
e repeated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She =
was quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, "My Lord! You a=
re living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am st=
ruck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy." Tiruvalluv=
ar replied, "I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognit=
ion (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the
 silent witness. The senses,=
<BR>body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct fro=
m them." Tiruvalluvai' s wife understood the nature of the soul and then sh=
e became silent.<BR><BR>Ordinary aspirants with delicate health should not =
take recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who has attained K=
aya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an a=
spirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves=
 alone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts of gastro-inte=
stinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons w=
ho practise Tamasic Tapas.<BR><BR>If you have mastery over the pair of oppo=
sites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, =
if you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly cred=
itable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to stand befor=
e the sun in summer for some hours, if
 you throw off your clothing in the =
Gangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. Y=
ou should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. What little=
 you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, and you h=
ave lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by your fo=
olish practices or Tamasic Tapas.<BR><BR>An aspirant gave up his clothing a=
ll at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died with=
in a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tempo=
rarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a sl=
ave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not suppr=
ess them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.<BR><BR>An as=
pirant said, "I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some=
 years. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, "I am immortal Atma". =
I have got full Vairagya. No sin
 will cling to me, because my motive is pu=
re. I will attain self-realisation. " He actually committed the abominable =
act. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not=
. This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the natur=
e of true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters =
for some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by ta=
king to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot en=
tertain the Bhava "I am Atma" just at the time of committing the act. Horri=
ble thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share o=
bviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).<BR><BR>The mind should gradually be w=
eaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleas=
ure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants wh=
o take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. Y=
ou should train the mind
 in meditation gradually and make it taste the inn=
er bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and y=
ou can get yourself established in true Vairagya.<BR><BR>The more the Vivek=
a, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in th=
e garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a mere app=
earance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality ful=
l of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and =
association with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, al=
l objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or =
worthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even if the we=
alth of the whole world is offered to him.<BR><BR>Aspirants should give up =
those articles of food which they like best for some time. They should disc=
ipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simp=
le life. They
 should always eat simple food. But they should not become sl=
aves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this=
 in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.<BR=
><BR>May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free f=
rom the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!<BR><BR>May you all possess true lastin=
g Para Vairagya!!<BR><BR>May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !<BR><=
BR>Real Vairagya<BR><BR>There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Tit=
ikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun f=
or some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He =
used to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.<BR><BR>On one occa=
sion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided =
him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him =
to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremel=
y
 difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the S=
wami a bed of grass with great difficulty.<BR><BR>Sri Ram said: "Swamiji, i=
t is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindl=
y use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced=
 Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on=
 a cot?" The Swamiji replied "No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of grass=
 only. You must bring it anyhow."<BR><BR>Attachment to Vairagya is as much =
an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of t=
he Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neit=
her Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is quit=
e satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk and=
 fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He alw=
ays takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects.
 This =
is the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A wo=
rldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which =
he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised sou=
l has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.<BR><BR>Suka Deva =
was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some da=
ys. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served hi=
m and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.<BR><BR>Ob=
viously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained =
equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even a=
fter several years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from a=
ll sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not att=
ain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent t=
o all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the
 bed of grass o=
r a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.<BR><BR>He=
 who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Ty=
agi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but i=
t is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.<BR><BR>Some Sannyasi=
ns who are working for the public good make resolves: "We will not travel i=
n trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will no=
t use fountain pens or watch." These are not desirable resolves. This is no=
t the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is =
another kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars or tr=
ains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more service in=
 a short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out much wo=
rk if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is o=
ne kind. It does not leave even educated persons or
 cultured Sannyasins.<B=
R><BR>Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame a=
nd respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inn=
er Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.<BR><BR>Where is the strength of Vairagya =
when one lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the str=
ength of Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing =
to renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there i=
s no attraction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he sho=
ws externally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on=
 a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?<BR><BR>Raja J=
anaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila=
 was burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He al=
one can be called a real great Virakta.<BR><BR>Young aspirants should be ve=
ry careful and cautious. They should not take
 advantage of the liberty of =
a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yo=
gi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to thei=
r resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter a=
nd spirit.<BR><BR>May you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowle=
dge of the Self. May you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vai=
ragya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is rest=
rained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispa=
ssion for anything other than Atma.<BR><BR>If one considers the position an=
d happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed=
 a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It=
 will not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.<BR><BR>I=
t is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or=
 other. But by having dispassion for
 all objects at all times, one will ge=
t knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Gu=
ru, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.<BR><BR>Do not=
 fall a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and w=
ell-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attai=
n Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.<BR><BR>Devo=
tion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Di=
spassion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of th=
e heart and so everybody has this Atma.<BR><BR>Light on Vairagya<BR><BR>Vai=
ragya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal a=
nd non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Vivek=
a comes through disinterested selfless service done in several births and t=
hrough Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is=
 born Vairagya. It gives
 spiritual strength.<BR><BR>A man of Vairagya has =
no attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, =
inexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind=
, Samadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberat=
ion or Emancipation, or Release.<BR><BR>Raga is attachment to objects. Wher=
ever there is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, the=
re is dislike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the imp=
ortant afflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions a=
re: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and =
Abhinivesha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avi=
dya. From this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha,=
 and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.<BR><BR>Vaira=
gya is of different types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mi=
ld, moderate and
 intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to=
 stick to this path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasa=
va Vairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that w=
ere renounced previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not=
 be able to climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants sh=
ould be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should tr=
y to make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into=
 the defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is=
 illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and agai=
n by looking into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be=
 strengthened through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enqui=
ry.<BR><BR>Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow=
's urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of
 dis=
crimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual=
 enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 an=
d then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make =
enquiry. Physical nudity and these external things will not constitute real=
 Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objec=
ts do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Suc=
h deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, produce=
s lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to =
do real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break =
to the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards object=
s, at once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyme=
nt is the cause<BR>for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terrib=
ly afraid, and gradually through intense practice, it is established in
 re=
al, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is of two kinds a=
lso: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attain=
s Self-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intens=
e spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.<BR><BR>Without Vairagya there =
cannot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, fun=
damental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by them=
selves. Patanjali Maharshi says "Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah"=E2=
=80=94"The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya." They =
are the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal A=
bode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. "Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairag=
yena cha grihyate"=E2=80=94"The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya=
, dispassion, intense detachment." By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He wh=
o works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants' duty t=
o
 cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.<BR><BR>Vairagya is=
 doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual groove=
s. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and =
yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the worl=
d, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affect=
ed in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she rul=
ed a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renounci=
ng his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to =
the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any on=
e object.<BR><BR>You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but=
 he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairag=
i. This is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that=
 one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not
 belon=
g to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the w=
aist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had=
 that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.<B=
R><BR>Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. "Ka=
rshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham=
 tan vidhyasuranischayan ."=E2=80=94"They torture all the elements in the b=
ody and Me also who dwells in the body." Lord Buddha also tortured his body=
, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and=
 then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the=
 middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisati=
on. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should n=
ot torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You s=
hould not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you
 sho=
uld practise "common sense Sadhana". There is no harm in taking good, healt=
hy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. You should us=
e common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a=
 long<BR>time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some frui=
ts. You should have extreme or "Teevra" Vairagya internally and at the same=
 time follow the middle path externally.<BR><BR>Generally, aspirants say: "=
I have given up umbrella."=E2=80=A6 "I take only one meal." Their whole Sad=
hana is: "I have given up shirt."=E2=80=A6 "I have given up sweater."=E2=80=
=A6 "I have given up shoes."=E2=80=A6 "I live only on bread and dhal." Thei=
r Sadhana consists in "giving up"=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real =
spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving=
 up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind.=
 If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a smal=
l cup of milk.
 Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the=
 mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.<BR=
><BR>At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =
a great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=
n the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=
e a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=
 wonderful man and made him his Guru.<BR><BR>Avadhoot Kesavananda is anothe=
r Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji.=
 He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused=
 to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for =
him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to=
 this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, a=

 is
 Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Pan=
chagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.<BR><BR>There is another great =
Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He=
 used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after m=
