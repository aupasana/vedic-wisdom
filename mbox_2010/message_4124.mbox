"Sivananda Gita" - short autobiography of Swami Sivananda


I was born of P=
.S. Vengu Iyer and Parvati Ammal on the 8th September 1887 at Pattamadai, T=
innevelly District, Tamil Nadu in the line of Appayya Dikshit. My star is B=
harani. I was extremely mischievous in my boyhood. I studied in the S.P.G. =
College, Trichinopoly. I was a Doctor in the Malaya States for 10 years. I =
took sannyasa in 1924 in Rishikesh. I did tapas and meditation for 15 years=
. I went on teaching tours for 10 years. I founded the Divine Life Society =
in 1936 and the All-World Religious Federation in 1945.

I am childlike in =
my Svabhava. So I mix with all. I become one with all. I am ever happy and =
joyful and make others also happy and joyful. I am full of educative humour=
. I radiate joy through humour. I respect all. I do salutations to all firs=
t. I always speak sweetly. I walk quickly. I do japa and meditation while w=
alking and while at work also.

I am ever hard-working. I have intense appl=
ication to work. I never procrastinate any work. I finish it then and there=
. I am very quick in doing things. I cannot suppress the spirit of service =
in me. I cannot live without service. I take immense delight in service. Se=
rvice has elevated me. Service has purified me. I know well how to extract =
work from others. I extract work through kindness, service, respect and lov=
e.

I am very regular in doing Asana and exercises. I do Pranayama also reg=
ularly. These give me wonderful health and energy. I run round the Bhajan H=
all daily. I cannot deliver fiery lectures sitting on a special seat. Speci=
al seat pricks me. I stand up or throw the seat away and then begin to spea=
k. I never sat on a special seat when I presided over spiritual conferences=
. I rejoice in giving. I always give.

I am 73 now. I ever feel I am quite =
young. I am full of vigour, vim and vitality. I am ever cheerful. I sing, d=
ance, run, jump in joy. I am robust and strong. I can digest any kind of fo=
od. I continuously work, read and write. I never go to hill-stations or sea=
side for holiday. Change of work gives rest. Meditation gives abundant rest=
. Work gives me delight. Service gives me happiness. Writing bestows joy. M=
editation energises and invigorates me. Kirtan vivifies me.

"Aham Brahma A=
smi", "Sivoham", "Soham Sat-Chit-Ananda Svarupoham". This is my favourite f=
ormula for Vedantic meditation. Song of "Chidananda" is my favourite song f=
or singing.

"Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare,
Hare Krishna Hare Kr=
ishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare."

This Mahamantra Kirtan is my favourite K=
irtan.

At the present moment I am the richest man in the whole world. My h=
eart is full. Further, all the wealth of the Lord belongs to me now. Hence,=
 I am King of Kings, Emperor of Emperors, Shah of Shahs, Maharaja of Mahara=
jas. I take pity on the mundane kings. My dominion is limitless. My wealth =
is inexhaustible. My joy is inexpressible. My treasure is immeasurable. I a=
ttained this through sannyasa, renunciation, untiring selfless service, jap=
a, and meditation.

I am tall. My height is 6 ft. I have a sinewy frame. I =
have symmetrical limbs. I am a first-class gymnast. I fast on ekadasi. I do=
 not take even a drop of water on that day. I take milk and fruits on Sunda=
ys. I lead a simple natural life. There is a fountain of youth in me. I bea=
m with joy. I observe fasting, resting, airing, bathing, breathing, exercis=
ing, sun-bathing and enjoy freedom, beauty, courage, poise and health.

I l=
ove nature, music, art, poetry, philosophy, beauty, goodness, solitude, med=
itation, yoga and Vedanta. I am humble and simple. I am frank and straightf=
orward. I am perfectly tolerant and catholic. I am merciful and sympathetic=
. I have spontaneous and unrestrained generosity. I am bold and cheerful. I=
 am patient. I can bear insult and injury. I am forgiving. I am free from v=
indictive nature. I return good for evil. I serve that man who has injured =
me, with joy.

I love Ganga and the Himalayas. Ganga is my Mother Divine. H=
imalayas is my Father Divine. They inspire and guide me. I take bath in Gan=
ga. I adore Ganga. I feed the fishes of Ganga. I wave light to Mother Ganga=
. I pray to Ganga. I do salutations to Ganga. I sing the glory of Ganga. I =
write about the grandeur and glory of Ganga. Ganga has nourished me. Ganga =
has comforted me. Ganga has taught me the Truths of the Upanishads. Glory t=
o Mother Ganga!

My daily routine is like that of Lord Buddha. I always rem=
ain in the room. I do japa, kirtan and meditation. I study sacred books. I =
write. I come out of the room for a short time for work, service and interv=
iew. I talk a little. I think much. I meditate much. I try to do much and s=
erve much. I do not waste even a single minute. I ever keep myself fully oc=
cupied. I lead a well-regulated life. I perform worship of Atman at all tim=
es. I work for the good of others.

Gita, Upanishads, Bhagavata, Yoga Vasis=
htha, Avadhoota Gita, Vivekachudamani are my constant companions. I am a st=
range mixture of service, devotion, yoga and wisdom. I am a follower of Sri=
 Sankara. I am a Kevala-Advaita Vedantin. I am not at all a dry lip Vedanti=
n. I am a practical Vedantin. I practice and advocate the Yoga of Synthesis=
. I practice ahimsa, satyam and brahmacharya. Glory to Sri Sankara!

I resp=
ect all saints and prophets of all religions. I respect all religions, all =
cults, all faiths and all creeds. I serve all, love all, mix with all and s=
ee the Lord in all. I stick to my promises. I serve the poor. This gives me=
 delight. I do mental prostrations to asses, dogs, trees, bricks, stones an=
d all creatures. I respect elders and sadhus. I obey. I please all through =
sincere selfless service. I attend on guests very carefully. I run hither a=
nd thither to serve them. I massage the legs of sick persons and sadhus.

I=
 give very prompt reply to all letters. I do several things at a time. I wr=
ite with electric speed. I spend everything. I do a lot of charity. I do no=
t keep anything. I take immense pleasure in feeding the poor and my student=
s. I try to be a mother to them. I talk to others on things which I have my=
self practiced. I look within always, introspect, analyse and examine. I ho=
ld the Trisul=96spiritual diary, daily routine and resolve.

I served my ma=
sters with great sincerity and intense faith and devotion. I learnt many us=
eful lessons for life. I developed many virtues. I wandered without food du=
ring my parivrajaka life. I slept on the roadside at night without clothing=
 during winter. I ate dried bread with water. I stick tenaciously with my p=
rinciples and ideals. I do not argue much. I live in silence.

I pray and d=
o kirtan for the whole world, for the health and peace of sick people and f=
or the peace of the departed souls and the earth-bound spirits also. I take=
 a dip in the Ganges in the name of all those who are longing for a bath in=
 the Ganges. I sing the names of all saints of all religions in the bhajan =
hall. I observe All-Saints' Day and All-Souls' Day.

I constantly meditate =
on the following:-

Prajnanam Brahma [Consciousness is Brahman], Aham Brahm=
a Asmi [I am Brahman], Tat Tvam Asi [Thou art That], Ayam Atma Brahma [This=
 Self (Atman) is Brahman (the previous four phrases are call mahavakyas, "g=
reat sayings," from the Upanishads)], Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahma. Santam =
Sivam Advaitam. Aham Atma Gudakesa, Aham Atma Nirakarah, Sarvavyapee Svabha=
vatah. Brahma Satyam Jaganmithya Jivo Brahmaiva Naparah. Akarta, Abhokta, A=
sanga Sakshee. Ajo Nityah Sasvatoyam Purano. Jyotishamapi Tat Jyotih.

To r=
aise the fallen, to lead the blind, to share what I have with others, to br=
ing solace to the afflicted and to cheer the afflicted and suffering are my=
 ideals. To have perfect faith in God, to love my neighbour as my own Self,=
 to love God with all my heart and soul, to protect cows, animals, women an=
d children are my aims. My watchword is love. My goal is Sahaja samadhi ava=
stha, or the natural, continuous superconscious state.
