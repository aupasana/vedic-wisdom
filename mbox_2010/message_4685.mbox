Dear Kishore          - Namaste





Namaste Satish ji,

The main point y=
ou differ
from Narasimha=E2=80=99s mail, if I observed correctly, is that y=
ou point out there are
two relationships with God: spiritual (love relation=
ship) and materialistic
(give and take/mantrashastra) . The materialistic r=
elationship solves worldly problems,
while spiritual relationship leads tow=
ards self-realization. This is one way of
leading life.

To my understandin=
g,
Narasimha spreads the message to live with only one relationship which i=
s
spirituality or love/surrender to God. Yes, Narasimha certainly believes =
homam
as the vehicle for this relationship and teaches the same since he ha=
s first hand
great experiences through homam. In spirituality, there is no =
problem of
counting gives and takes from Yajamana. A saadhaka accepts whate=
ver he gets due
to his karmic baggage and leads his life. If he still has d=
esires, he uses the
same relationship not with a staunch give or take attit=
ude, but with a
surrender attitude. Surrender is a tough path. Belief is th=
at homam creates
exactly such an attitude over time and all

the material n=
eeds are
taken care without paying much attention to them. Once in spiritua=
lity path,
one may learn shastras based on his conditioning, but I don=E2=
=80=99t see it being
discouraged here. In fact, learning homam ritual is in=
creasing awareness of shastras.

=C2=A0

I very sorry to say that
you under=
standing is totally incorrect. Please read the very first sentence of
Narsi=
mha like 

Astrologers routinely recommend remedial measures
involving mant=
ras and poojas and people spend a lot of money on them. Do they
work? I wil=
l give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I
will be h=
onest, straight-forward and blunt. The topic has nothing to do with
spiritu=
ality as per my understanding. Narsimha only show his own way of solving
ve=
xed problem of so called unqualified priests with subtopic of spiritual pow=
er
of priests. From
my side this is due to mixing of religion and spiritual=
ity. Religion as a whole
is for all four purusharthas i.e. dharma, artha, k=
ama
and moksha while spirituality is for moksha only. In other words you ma=
y think
this as pathway to desire fulfillment and pathway to god. Desire fu=
lfillment
has nothing to do with moksha and for moksha vasanakshaya, desire=
 eliination is
needed. In this perspective you can understand me better.

V=
ery few sadhaka would
like to visit to astrologers as they might be having =
guidance by superiors,
traditions etc. Masses visiting astrologers mainly i=
nclude illiterate folk
w.r.t. to these topics who only want solutions for t=
here problems. So they have
nothing alike as sadhakas and are totally ignor=
ant w.r.t. all these things. I
think Narsimha=E2=80=99s explanation was for=
 this group only which from my side is not
correct. And this group is conce=
rned about all three purusharthas other than
moksha.

Surrender is a tough
=
path. Belief is that homam creates exactly such an attitude over time and a=
ll
the material needs are taken care without paying much attention to them.=
 Once
in spirituality path, one may learn shastras. If this is your attitud=
e you
are great but common people including me don=E2=80=99t have such atti=
tude as we are
still at lower ladder of evolution and that=E2=80=99s why we=
 need remedies. =C2=A0

Coming to priest as a
mediator or technician, I bel=
ieve, his message is to find a capable technician
or priest for the job. Do=
n=E2=80=99t we want a plumber who fixes the plumbing problem
rather than to=
 see that the problem comes back after he leaves with money? We
want to hir=
e capable plumber and also need to do some maintenance ourselves. If
one th=
inks it is an important desire to be fulfilled, the message is to attain
it=
 through spirituality or the next best is to hire a spiritually inclined
pr=
iest while still maintaining love relationship with God. In fact, I have se=
en
Narasimha encourages such capable priests. So, he has nothing against pr=
iests
who perform their job.

I request you to read
other posts from where =
I copy some contents. If we say priest must have shakti
how can we count hi=
s nature of shakti in terms of quality, quantity, depth and
need? Should we=
 consider shakti to beget baby, remove diseases, give immense
wealth is sam=
e?, how to differentiate priest with and without shakthi, most imp
who will=
 differentiate this, what are the parameters to define this, what are
the t=
ools to understand all these subtle points, etc will be the complex issues
=
before us or yajamana when we/ he thinks of doing any remedy. Do we have an=
y
universal system for this? If you think over these issues you will come t=
o know
the truth. If a priest perform a puja every third day he must have a=
t least
tons of shakti to give results. Only person who is in unmani/trans =
avashta can
have such a huge shakti and I think such person will not use hi=
s power to wash
sins of so many people unless asked by his superiors to do =
this. 

This mail on remedies and
priests is inline with spreading spiritua=
lity. This will help some people who
are confused with many solutions and p=
oint them towards spirituality. To me,
the message delivered is consistent =
with earlier messages.

Yes, I fully understand
and whole heartedly appreci=
ate Narsimha=E2=80=99s guidelines for doing sadhana on own
but that does no=
t mean to propagate wrong ideas or to interpret scriptures in
this way. And=
 why I am saying this is clear from my comments regarding generic
mantra an=
d focus of mind.

frank al=
l this brain exercise is having very little spiritual value and doing
sadha=
na for self realization is the key and that is the sole aim of all shruti,
=
smriti. But I posted an objection only to request all members to have real
=
understanding of true nature of above mentioned imp points as for me
materi=
alistic world is a part and parcel of our existence; so materialistic
desir=
es also.

=C2=A0























               Yours sincerely
