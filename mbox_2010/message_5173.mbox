Hari om.

Blessed self,

Can some one point me to any manual on how to do S=
ri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy homa? I would like to do as fequently as possibl=
e to express devotion to the lord.

I found http://www.vedicastrologer.org/=
homam/index.htm has lot of homas and not sure if this is going to be an add=
ition to the list. Also, I tried to serach the mail list. I might have miss=
ed any earlier thread on this topic.

Your help and guidance is greatly app=
reciated.

Regards
Chandrahasa
