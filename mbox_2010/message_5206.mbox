Dear Sri Narasimha,
=C2=A0
When you say Srimad Bhagavatam Chapter 11.17, ar=
e you refering to Veda Vyasa's? I have a copy of Telugu Bhagavatam by Bamme=
ra Potana and the details are not given there, in my understanding. If you =
read the telugu version, can you please clarify if those points are covered=
 in telugu also somewhere? The language is quite complex by today's standar=
ds (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading it enough =
and interpreting right? But I keep trying to read as I love that poetry by =
the great poet Potana.

Namaste,

The t=
wo mails below on priests doing remedies and astrologers have a common thre=
ad. I will reply to them together.

* * *

Regarding mail 1 below on priest=
s:

Doing rituals for one's own upliftment is one thing and doing it for ot=
hers is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one i=
s forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else's dirty pl=
ace and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is=
 not protected, one may be affected.

As I keep saying, results of one's pr=
evious karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit af=
ter another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rott=
en. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw aw=
ay some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier th=
an otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown awa=
y. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage=
.

In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity=
 to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. The=
y are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people's karmas.

S=
econdly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas.=
 Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for on=
e to become a brahmana oneself. One's aptitude, attitude and actions have t=
o be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over =
others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge =
and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very=
 few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be p=
erformed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous o=
f power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for othe=
rs.

> is there any remedy for this?

Well, stop doing rituals for others. =
Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others.=
 Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavata=
m chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the ten=
dencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.

* * *

Regarding ma=
il 2 below on astrologers:

This is not an immature comment and there is an=
 element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.

Ever=
y action performed with ego (a sense of "I am doing this") produces an equa=
l reaction. If an astrologer's action of giving advice to someone resulted =
in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing =
Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the ast=
rologer has some sense of "I am doing this", then one is bound to experienc=
e the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come to=
o.

Messing with someone else's karmas is always a risky business.

What is=
 the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahman=
a lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to trul=
y become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatri=
yas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one wil=
l become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to pl=
ay with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conductin=
g rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, b=
ut about brahmanas by conduct.

The above will become clear, if you look at=
 the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught=
 Jyotish!

Best regards,
Narasimha
