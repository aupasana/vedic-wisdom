Dear Vishal,

please don't afraid abou=
t the details procedure seen in the video, its hard to follow all the detai=
ls with perfection in first attempt, go through the manual where you can fi=
nd the shortest/simplest version of the Ganapati Homam "Super-Short Homam P=
rocedure".. .start with that simplest version and eventually incorporate pa=
rt-by-part from the main homam procedure, writeup of mantras in your own la=
nguage sometimes makes things simpler...

best of luck
Biswaji
