JAI MAA,

November 4 - Naraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas to the worship o=
f Maha-Kali on this day MAHAKALI demolished devil Raktavija. Special recipe=
 called Pova or Poha is finished as excellent as offering as naivedya to a =
Goddess. This day celebrates the victory of the God Krishna over the demon =
of filth, Narakasura son of Bhudevi,and he freed 16,000 queens. Unable to b=
ear the tyranny of the demon, the celestial beings pleaded with Lord Krishn=
a to save them from his torture. But Naraka had a boon that he would face d=
eath only at the hands of his mother Bhudevi. So, Krishna asks his wife Sat=
hyabhama, the reincarnation of Bhudevi, to be his charioteer in the battle =
with Naraka. When Krishna fell unconscious after being hit by an arrow of N=
araka, Sathyabhama takes the bow and aims the arrow at Naraka, killing him =
instantly. Later Lord Krishna reminds her of the boon she had sought as Bhu=
devi. The Narakasura Vadh by Sathyabhama could also be taken to interpret t=
hat parents should not hesitate to punish their children when they step in =
to the wrong path. Lord Krishan was covered in blood od Narkasur so his que=
ens game his scented bath and put scented oil on him. On this day Hindus ge=
t up earlier than take scented bath and put scented oil on them to symboliz=
e the victory over Narkasur. Many families wake up before sunrise prepare a=
 paste by mixing Kumkum in oil, symbolizing blood and after breaking a bitt=
er fruit that represents the head of the demon King that was smashed by Kri=
shna, apply that mixture on their foreheads. Then they have an oil bath usi=
ng sandalwood paste or  traditional early baths with oil and "Uptan" (paste=
) of gram flour and fragrant powders are a `must'. Afterward steamed vermic=
elli with milk and sugar or puffed rice with curd is served. Kali Chaudous =
is a day to pray to Lord Hanuman. Hanumanji as a baby was really hungry. Wh=
ilst fibbing down he saw a object in a sky as excellent as suspicion it was=
 a ripened offspring as excellent as went to collect it. He flew in to a sk=
y as excellent as place a total object in his mouth causing dark via a comp=
lete universe. Lord Indra requested that Hanumanji lapse a sun. When Hanuma=
nji refused, Lord Indra unleashed his vajra as excellent as knocked Hanuman=
ji down to earth releasing a Sun. Recite Hanuman Chalisa 11 times and offer=
 ladoo to Lord Hanumanji. Pray to Hanumanji and offer prashad of Sesame see=
d, ldoo, rice with ghee and sugar. Some families offer food to their forefa=
thers on this day. Hanumanji as a Kuldev to strengthen us from Evil. The po=
ojan is achieved with oil, flowers, chandan or sindur. Coconuts have been a=
dditionally offering to Hanumanji as excellent as prashad of Sesame seed, l=
adoos as excellent as rice with ghee as excellent as sugar. Before sunrise,=
 oil is applied on the head and apamarga prokshana is performed. It means r=
ubbing the stem or flowers or leaves of Calotropis gigantean on the head wh=
ile reciting the following mantra: Sithaloshta samayoktham sakantaka dalaan=
vithamHara papa mapaamaarga bhramyamanah punah punah  After Narak Chaturdas=
hi snan, following mantra is chanted: Bhramayeth snanamadhyethu narakasya k=
shayayahiSheetaloshta samayuktha sakantaka dalanvithaHara papa mapaamaargaB=
hramyamaanah punah punah After performing ritual bath, Jala Tharpana is obs=
erved for three times. It is known as Yama Tharpan. Deep Daan (donating diy=
as) is performed after Yama Tharpanam and Devata puja. While lighting deepa=
 or diya and remembering dead ancestors, the below given mantra is chanted =
in the evening:Chaturdashyam thu Yedeepaan narakaya dadanthi chaThesham pit=
