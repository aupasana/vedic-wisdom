Namaste Shri Utpal,

This is just wonderful !!! How awesome, just get goose=
bumps thinking about it :)

I hope people realize this and stop thinking th=
at after doing homam they will start getting all kinds of material benefits=
. It may or may not depending on the rna & karma.

Vimalananda, is/was I gu=
ess, just one of those unique personalities we are fortunate to read about,=
 and guide us in an indirect way.

Warm Regards
Narayan
