Man: Hey sculptor! How do you carve such beautiful idols from ugly and shap=

stones. I just remove the unwanted!

 The reason being I will be honest in this God's place. Unlike you all who =
are determined to give yourselves to the Lord I am not ready for extreme le=

 I don't want any riches,any happiness etc.

r something in an extreme level and later face the wrath of God. So my ques=
tion is I believe purnahuti is the part where one surrenders completely and=
 gives this commitment. I want to call god in fire pray, meditate keep it s=
imple. As fire is the most auspicious form I am tempted to pray God in that=
 medium. So can I skip the purnahuti section. Do I need to make any changes=
 in sankalpam?
