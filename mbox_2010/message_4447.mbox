 IT was 1903. Bhagavan was seated at Adimudi shrine surrounded by disciples=
.
A scholar from Andhra came and interpreted the famous invocatory sloka

=
=E2=80=9CSuklambaradharam Vishnum sasivarnam catur bhujam prasanna vadanam =
dhyayeth
sarva vighnopasantaye=E2=80=9D

as if it applied to Bhagavan in th=
is manner:=E2=80=9CHe also wears a white cloth
(Kaupina); as he abides in t=
he Self he is Vishnu (all pervading), he has
devoured (destroyed) Manas, Bu=
ddhi, Chitta and Ahamkara. He has a peaceful
countenance, he removes all ob=
stacles in the way of those who meditate.=E2=80=99=E2=80=99

The following =
year the same scholar visited Arunachala during Kritikkai and
recited the o=
ne thousand slokas,entitled Sivasahasri, extolling the Deity.
The listeners=
 were very pleased with the scholarship and beautiful style of
the composit=
ion.

Everyone wondered who that person of simple appearance but with profo=
und
scholarship was. They came to know that he was from Andhra and belonged=
 to
Kaluvarayi agraharam near Bobbili. His name was Kavya Kantha Ganapati
S=
astry. They expressed their appreciation of the gifted and blessed being of=

rare talents.

Truly Ganapati was a blessed child. In 1878 his father Nara=
simha Sastry was
performing japa at Kasi in front of Vinayaka=E2=80=99s ima=
ge. He suddenly felt that
a small boy was advancing towards him fromVinayak=
a. That was also the time
when his baby son was born back home. The father =
named the child Ganapati.

Till he reached the age of five all kinds of ail=
ments including dumbness
troubled Ganapati. In his sixth year he was brande=
d with a hot iron rod upon
which all ailments left him. He was also able to=
 speak thereafter.

He then began his studies. Thereafter his life was mira=
culous with
unexcelled intellectual skills of great comprehension, phenomen=
al memory and
amazing intuition.

There was nothing he could not understand=
, nothing he could not commit to
memory after hearing once, no sastra that =
was not grist to his intellectual
mill. By the time he was ten, he had memo=
rized several kavyas. In Astrology
he was capable of drawing up a panchanga=
m.He also had the capacity to
compose Sanskrit verses extempore. As he stud=
ied epics like the Ramayana and
Mahabharata two great ambitions arose in hi=
m.

One was to become a great poet like Vyasa and Valmiki - and why not, he=

thought, was he not already capable of composing poetry? The other ambitio=
n
was this: in the puranas rishis like Viswamitra, and devotees like Dhruva=

had by the power of their japa become capable of creating a fresh world or=

obtaining an abiding place in the firmament.Why not he also become one lik=
e
them? With such great ambitions the lad continued his studies.

By the ti=
me he was twelve, Ganapati composed a Sanskrit Kavya,
Bhringasandesa in the=
 mandakranta metre imitating the poet, Kalidasa. Within
a couple of years h=
e was proficient in Chandas, Vyakarana, Kavyas, and
Puranas. He was an exte=
mpore poet, an ashtavadhani and an orator.

In 1900, while he was at Kasi h=
is friends encouraged him to visit Nawadweepa
to participate in the scholar=
s=E2=80=99 meet held there. At that meet of great and
reputed scholars, he =
demonstrated his unmatched literary gifts and talents.
Thus he earned the t=
itle =E2=80=9CKavya Kantha,=E2=80=9D At that time, he was barely twenty
two=
.

For the fulfilment of his second ambition, Ganapati got initiated in sev=
eral
mantras. Among these, his favourite was the Siva panchakshari. In orde=
r to
perform japa in the
prescibed manner, he studied a number of agama sas=
tras.He mastered all the
spiritual literature in Sanskrit.

He got married =
at the age of eighteen but with the permission of his father
and wife he le=
ft on a pilgrimage to the banks of Ganga, Narmada and Godavari
to perform j=
apa. He visited almost all the holy places of India twelve
times, for perfo=
rming japa. Though there were occasional spiritual
experiences he did not o=
btain the darshan of Siva, which he desired
ardently.

At Varanasi, the ple=
ased goddess gave him honey in a dream. At Nasik the
temple priest mistook =
him for a thief and the people of the place beat him
up. In anger,he cursed=
 that the people of Nasik should also be hurt like
himself physically. With=
in one month, an unprecedented cyclone struck the
town and hurt the people.=
 He had divine powers but they were of no avail to
himself!

As Ganapati Sa=
stry was studying Vedic literature there arose before his
mental eye the gl=
orious Aryan civilisation where people lived in harmony and
discipline and =
were generally happy and peaceful. He compared it with the
conditions obtai=
ning in the country in his own time where people were rigid
and lifeless. T=
he people made themselves inflexible and bound themselves to
various custom=
s and above all, occupied the first place among the enslaved
nations of the=
 world!

He then resolved that he should reform society and restore ancient=
 values.
For this, he decided to bring together and lead young men dedicate=
d to
eradicating all the divisive forces in society and to performing mantr=
a japa
as the rishis of ancient times did so that a new Aryan society could=
 be
built. In this endeavour, Ganapati thought, mantra japa was the key.

G=
anapati chanted the Sivapanchakshari a billion times; so also he wrote down=

the name of the Deity a billion times all of which had gone waste. In 1904=

Ganapati was appointed as a Telugu pandit at Vellore. He began taking
prac=
tical steps to realise his ideal and gathered a band of disciples round
him=
. He spent his time in teaching than in imparting mantra japa to the
studen=
ts. He felt even that was not fruitful and decided to resume mantra
japa at=
 Arunachala and reached that place in 1907.

Even that was useless in that =
in spite of all his learning he could not
grasp the implication of mantra j=
apa. He was sorry that years of japa did
not secure for him the darshan of =
his ishta devata.

He resolved to seek the Brahmanaswami=E2=80=99s refuge. =
He was not sure whether the
Swami would still remember his interpretation o=
f the sloka Suklambaradharam
but thought he would still seek the Swami=E2=
=80=99s guidance. The Swami was his only
saviour, he concluded. Ganapati Sa=
stry immediately set out for the hill in
the hot midday sun.

By the time t=
he emotion-charged Ganapati reached Virupaksha cave, the Swami
was sitting =
alone on a rock.Ganapati prostrated before him and clasped his
feet with bo=
th hands and in a choked voice said,

I have studied all that has to be stu=
died. I have learnt Vedanta sastra
completely. I have performed mantra-japa=
 to my heart=E2=80=99s content. But till now
I have not been able to grasp =
what tapas really means. I have now approached
you to know what it is. Plea=
se enlighten me on the nature of tapas.

The Swami fixed his gaze on Ganapa=
ti for fifteen minutes. Ganapati was
awaiting the reply anxiously. No one e=
lse intruded and disturbed them. The
Swami spoke in Tamil- =E2=80=9CIf you =
enquire and observe where this I-thought
arises from, the mind gets absorbe=
d in it. That is tapas.While performing
mantra japa if you enquire and obse=
rve where the sound of the mantra arises
from, the mind gets absorbed in it=
. That is tapas.=E2=80=9D


Ganapati Sastry stayed for some hours there and=
 after ascertaining the name
of the Brahmama Swami he composed extempore fi=
ve slokas in praise of
=E2=80=9CRamana=E2=80=9D.At that time Sastry was not=
 aware that Lakshmana Ayyar had referred
to the boy Venkataraman as Ramana.=
 Ganapati was instrumental in reviving the
name which had fallen into disus=
e. The next day, Ganapati gave the upadesa
to his disciples and told them t=
hat it was given by Ramana.

He also enjoined on them to refer to the Swami=
 as Bhagavan Sri Ramana
Maharshi. This name became world famous.

In the fi=
rst three months of 1908 the Maharshi,Ganapati, and other disciples
stayed =
at the Pachaiamman Kovil at the foothill of Arunachala. Most of the
expense=
s relating to the stay were borne by Ramaswamy Ayyangar,a devotee.
During t=
hat period, Ganapati, took to meditation as taught by Bhagavan. One
dawn, a=
 brilliant light arose and touched the forehead of the Maharshi six
times,G=
anapati noticed this and also observed that the light got absorbed in
the a=
ura around the Maharshi=E2=80=99s head as six starlike formations.

Though =
he practised the Maharshi=E2=80=99s way Ganapati=E2=80=99s original ideals =
did not
leave him. Towards the end of March (1908) he wanted to leave Aruna=
chala and
asked the Maharshi whether the enquiry into the source of the =E2=
=80=98Ithought=E2=80=99
would result in the fulfilment of his ideals or whe=
ther he had to do mantra
japa also. The Maharshi replied that the former wa=
s enough. Ganapati also
asked the Maharshi whether his intention was good, =
to which the latter
replied =E2=80=9CLeave everything to God, your burden w=
ill cease and He will take on
your burden. He knows what to do.=E2=80=9D

M=
uch later Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CWhile God sustains the burden of the worl=
d, the
spurious ego assumes its burden grimacing like an image on a tower s=
eeming
to support it.=E2=80=9D

Reality in forty verses - Supplement verse =
17
=E2=80=93 Tr. K. Swaminathan

Kavya Kantha would visit Arunachala occasi=
onally to have the darshan of
Bhagavan. Between 1922 and 1929 he stayed at =
Arunachala with his family.
Once, while at the mango tree cave the bones of=
 his skull loosened and he
experienced a softening of the area where the Br=
ahmarandhra exists.

Ganapati himself confessed that however much he tried =
to follow the jnana
marga he had not been able to achieve abidance in the S=
elf. In the first
years possibly the latent tendencies proved to be insurmo=
untable
obstacles.Also, the activities of the sakti in the body were intens=
e which
it could not bear. On such occasions he would seek Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s help and get
over that.

Ganapati Sastry used to say that sakti was of=
 two types- mahas and sahas of
which the former was divine and that only wh=
en sahas got transformed as
mahas the bones of the skull loosend. Because o=
f this sakti he could not
bear to touch any metallic object and he always h=
ad to wear sandals made of
wood. A number of his disciples also had experie=
nced that sakti. Any copper
coin held in the palm became golden.

Bhagavan =
addressed Ganapati as =E2=80=9CNayana=E2=80=9D as did the latter=E2=80=99s =
disciples.
Ganapati was a great man with extraordinary foresight, and power=
 of speech.

One may go to the extent of saying that he was a Vidyadhara in=
 human form.
His glory can be fully appreciated by going through Kapali Sas=
try=E2=80=99s Vasishta
Vaibhavam. But for his ideals and love of the countr=
y which bound him,
Ganapati would have attained Self realisation.

He wrote=
 a lot of poetry in praise of Bhagavan, one of these poems, Sri
Ramana Chat=
varimsat was recited in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence every morning. It is
st=
ill recited at Bhagavan=E2=80=99s shrine.

In order to realise his ambition=
s Ganapati participated in politics and
social reform activities till 1930.=
 Thereafter he gave them up and devoted
himself to tapas. He left his morta=
l body on 25 July 1936 at Nimpura near
Kharagpur in his ashram.

More than =
the service he did for Bhagavan, Ganapati=E2=80=99s service to the nation
i=
n propagating Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message is greater. The answers Bhagavan g=
ave to
the questions of the disciples were incorporated as slokas in Sri Ra=
mana
Gita composed by Ganapati Sastry. This book is an invaluable guide to =
all.
Simirarly, he translated into Sanskrit Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Ulladu Narpa=
du under the
title Sat-darsanam.

As early as 1903 Ganapati Muni, through h=
is foresight, recognised the
greatness of Bhagavan and spread the word. Und=
er his guidance, his disciples
Pranavananda and Kapali Sastry wrote comment=
aries on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Upadesasaram
and Sat-darsanam respectively. Kap=
ali Sastry also wrote an excellent
commentary on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Arunach=
ala Pancharatna. Ganapati=E2=80=99s disciples were
all Bhagavan=E2=80=99s d=
isciples too. They were spread all over the country and they
carried forwar=
d Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message.

Maharshi six times,Ganapati noticed this and also observed that the light g=
ot absorbed in the aura around the Maharshi=E2=80=99s head as six starlike =
formations.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Though he practised t=
he Maharshi=E2=80=99s way Ganapati=E2=80=99s original ideals did not leave =
him. Towards the end of March (1908) he wanted to leave Arunachala and aske=
d the Maharshi whether the enquiry into the source of the =E2=80=98Ithought=
=E2=80=99 would result in the fulfilment of his ideals or whether he had to=
 do mantra japa also.</span>=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-style:italic">The Mah=
arshi replied that the former was enough. Ganapati also asked the Maharshi =
whether his intention was good, to which the latter replied =E2=80=9CLeave =
everything to God, your burden will cease and He will take on your burden. =
He knows what to do.=E2=80=9D<br>

<br>Much later Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CW=
hile God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego assumes its bur=
den grimacing like an image on a tower seeming to support it.=E2=80=9D<br><=

=E2=80=93 Tr. K=
. Swaminathan</span><br><br>Kavya Kantha would visit Arunachala occasionall=
y to have the darshan of Bhagavan. Between 1922 and 1929 he stayed at Aruna=
chala with his family. Once, while at the mango tree cave the bones of his =
skull loosened and he experienced a softening of the area where the Brahmar=
andhra exists.<br>

<br>Ganapati himself confessed that however much he tri=
ed to follow the jnana marga he had not been able to achieve abidance in th=
e Self. In the first years possibly the=C2=A0latent tendencies proved to be=
 insurmountable obstacles.Also, the activities of the sakti in the body wer=
e intense which it could not bear. On such occasions he would seek Bhagavan=
=E2=80=99s help and get over that.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold=
">Ganapati Sastry used to say that sakti was of two types- mahas and sahas =
of which the former was divine and that only when sahas got transformed as =
mahas the bones of the skull loosend. Because of this sakti he could not be=
ar to touch any metallic object and he always had to wear sandals made of w=
ood. A number of his disciples also had experienced that sakti. Any copper =
coin held in the palm became golden.</span><br>

<br>Bhagavan addressed Gan=
apati as =E2=80=9C<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Nayana</span>=E2=80=9D a=
s did the latter=E2=80=99s disciples. Ganapati was a great man with extraor=
dinary foresight, and power of speech.<br><br>One may go to the extent of s=
aying that he was a Vidyadhara in human form. His glory can be fully apprec=
iated by going through Kapali Sastry=E2=80=99s Vasishta Vaibhavam.=C2=A0<sp=
an style=3D"font-weight:bold">But for his ideals and love of the country wh=
ich bound him, Ganapati would have attained Self realisation.</span><br>

<=
br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">He wrote a lot of poetry in praise of =
Bhagavan, one of these poems, Sri Ramana Chatvarimsat was recited in Bhagav=
an=E2=80=99s presence every morning. It is still recited at Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s shrine.</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">In order to r=
ealise his ambitions Ganapati participated in politics and social reform ac=
tivities till 1930. Thereafter he gave them up and devoted himself to tapas=
. He left his mortal body on 25 July 1936 at Nimpura near Kharagpur in his =
ashram.<br>

<br>More than the service he did for Bhagavan, Ganapati=E2=80=
=99s service to the nation in propagating Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message is gre=
ater. The answers Bhagavan gave to the questions of the disciples were inco=
rporated as slokas in Sri Ramana Gita composed by Ganapati Sastry. This boo=
k is an invaluable guide to all. Simirarly, he translated into Sanskrit Bha=
gavan=E2=80=99s Ulladu Narpadu under the title Sat-darsanam.=C2=A0</span><b=

<br>As early as 1903 Ganapati Muni, through his foresight, recognised t=
he greatness of Bhagavan and spread the word. Under his guidance, his disci=
ples Pranavananda and Kapali Sastry wrote commentaries on Bhagavan=E2=80=99=
s Upadesasaram and Sat-darsanam respectively. Kapali Sastry also wrote an e=
xcellent commentary on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Arunachala Pancharatna. Ganapati=
=E2=80=99s disciples were all Bhagavan=E2=80=99s disciples too. They were s=
pread all over the country and they carried forward Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mess=
