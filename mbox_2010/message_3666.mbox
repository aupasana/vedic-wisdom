 Not a great deal is known about this period of Ramana=E2=80=99s life, but =
what is
known makes it clear that he was a lively boy who liked to play pra=
nks.

One day, when he was about six years old, he climbed up to the loft o=
f his
house along with some friends. The place was full of bundles of old p=
apers
and documents, which his father had decided to store there and which =
related
to lawsuits long-since settled. The children took one of the bundle=
s down
and made a fleet of paper boats out of it, which they then sailed in=
 the
temple tank.When Ramana=E2=80=99s father came home, he was furious, so=
 Ramana
quickly made himself scarce. When he did not return for the midday =
meal, a
search was organized. He was found sitting in the temple in the shr=
ine of
goddess Sahayambal (one of Shiva=E2=80=99s consorts),from whom he ha=
d sought solace.

On another occasion Ramana went even further, he climbed =
into the house of a
neighbouring lawyer and carried away some papers he fou=
nd in a cupboard,
unaware that they were important documents relating to a =
court case. He
invented a game for himself,distributing the documents to pa=
ssers-by on the
street, as if they
were advertising leaflets. When the lawy=
er returned home and saw what had
happened, he demanded the papers back, bu=
t it proved impossible to recover
many of them. Of course when he told Rama=
na=E2=80=99s father what had happened, the
latter became very angry
and sho=
uted, =E2=80=9CUndress the boy! Shave his head completely and give him only=
 a
loincloth to wear! Don=E2=80=99t give him any food!=E2=80=9D How far the=
 punishment was
carried out is, unfortunately, not reported.

Ramana, howev=
er, in addition to his predilection for playing pranks, also
had a compassi=
onate heart, as is illustrated by the following story, which
he later recou=
nted himself, =E2=80=9COne day he [referring to a neighbouring boy
three ye=
ars his younger] got a sugarcane and a knife, and as he could not
cut it hi=
mself, he requested his brothers to help him, but they went away
without he=
eding his request.
He began weeping. I felt sorry for him. I took the sugar=
cane and tried to
cut it. My finger got cut and began to bleed. Even so, I =
felt sorry for him
because he was weeping and was a little fellow,so someho=
w I managed to cut
the cane into pieces. I tied my finger with a wet cloth;=
 the bleeding,
however did not stop.=E2=80=9D

The rite of Upanayama (putti=
ng on the sacred Brahmin thread) was performed
when Ramana was around the a=
ge of eight, and he thus became a full member of
the Brahmin caste, but sti=
ll he showed no special spiritual inclination.

Although this fortunate fam=
ily was no more religious than any other, there
was one peculiar feature in=
 its history. An old family legend tells how, one
day, an ascetic came to t=
he house begging for food, but, against all
tradition, he was not treated w=
ith the proper respect and was not given a
meal. The ascetic promptly issue=
d a curse, stating that henceforth one
member of each generation of the fam=
ily would wander about begging as an
ascetic like himself.This =E2=80=98cur=
se=E2=80=99 had its effect, because in each generation
one member renounced=
 worldly life to become a wandering ascetic. One of
Sundaram Iyer=E2=80=99s=
 uncles on his father=E2=80=99s side had taken the ochre robe, the
staff an=
d the water jug of a sannyasin and had left to live life as a
wandering ren=
unciant and beggar. His elder brother Venkatesa also
disappeared from the v=
illage one day, no doubt to embark upon the same path.
He was never heard o=
f again and since that time Sundaram had been the head
of the family.

Ther=
e are no indications that Sundaram Iyer ever thought that one of his
sons w=
ould one day also leave home. And no doubt the thought never crossed
the mi=
nd of the young Ramana either.
