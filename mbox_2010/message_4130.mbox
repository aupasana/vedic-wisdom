I have read the advice of many spiritual masters and other se=
ers say that an full moon meditation is very beneficial . Also related to t=
his is the question of how do planets really affect us , Vimalananda in the=
 aghora books says it is through the rasa or food that is ingested by us.

I know science does not yet possess the right tools to measure this phenom=
ena and einstein's grand search for a unified filed theory and the universa=
l particle is still ongoing and might take ages for modern science to under=
stand the workings of even a commonplace phenomena like gravitation.

Howev=
er a simple test like admission rates in a mental aslyum should hold up to =
proof if the moon is truly having a effect on humans.

camerican.com/article.cfm?id=3Dlunacy-and-the-full-moon

This article in th=
e scientific american finds no such correlation...also there have been many=
 studies in the past some for and some against this correlation effect but =
none of them found a strong evidence....And always there is the risk of mis=
taking correlation as causation in any experiment.


It is just out of curi=
osity that am asking this question...Does astrology matter at all for a ser=
ious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour be picked for worship. If the r=
elationship with the deity is truly personal why should one even consider t=
he nava grahas in the ritual worship. I increasingly find that astrology is=
 only serving to discourage the masses rather than pointing them in the dir=
ection of worship of divinity. 


Hope you could throw some light on this.
