Namaste Sir,
 
Good questions. I am cc'ing this response to vedic-wisdom ya=
hoogroup, which is dedicated to this kind of spiritual discussions.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
1. I have not read all "religious books" and I do not know=
 if there isn't a book that mentions these things as you claim.
 
In any ca=
se, the purpose of scriptures is to teach lessons relevant to the inner dev=
elopment and spiritual progress. Sometimes, metaphorical representations of=
 those inner lessons can take the form of stories. Stories may use characte=
rs and situations prevalent in those times, but the essence of the story ma=
y cover a timeless truth.
 
2. The supreme cosmic being who created this un=
iverse is formless, but is the basis of all. No being can be, desire, know =
or act independent of Him. He may be called by different names by different=
 people. What some seekers may have realized as Allah and what some seekers=
 may have realized as Holy Spirit, was called Narayana or Parama Purusha by=
 Vedic seers.
 
Some may call the same liquid as "water", some as "paani", =
some as "neellu", some as "tanni", some "jalam" and so on. Yet, they mean t=
he same thing by it.
 
Of course, there may be different flavors of it, lik=
e plain water, flavored water, mineral water, soft drink, lemonade etc. But=
, someone may say that only plain water is good and ban all other kinds of =
water. Similarly, god may be worshipped as Supreme Cosmic Being as well as =
deities with various qualities (e.g. Hinduism), while some may worship only=
 the supreme cosmic being and ban other worships.
 
If you ignore names and=
 dwell into the essence, there are many similarities between religions. Obv=
iously, all beings have access to the same inner realization. Religions est=
ablished by one (or a handful of) prophets may have been limited by the abi=
lity of those persons in accessing the highest truths and limited by the ab=
ility of later people to understand and pass on the original teachings. Hen=
ce they may only be partially correct. Religions established and refined by=
 a living stream of seekers (like Hinduism) are give the most complete pict=
ure.
 
3. If there are no weaknesses, everybody will be in bliss sooner or =
later and be established in Supreme Cosmic Being. Weaknesses ensure that th=
ere are people at different stages of spiritual evolution and the drama on =
this universal stage is interesting. The mix changes with time. In Kali yug=
a, there are more souls with little spiritual development and there are man=
y more in Satya yuga.
 
4. Animals have charts too. There are some rules to=
 see from the chart whether the being born at that time is a human being or=
 a specific animal. But that knowledge is corrupt today. A human being can =
be born as an animal in an immediate life and vice versa.
 
5. Various deit=
ies are personifications of various great qualities within us. A normal min=
d thinks of thousands of things and at any time has very little or no spiri=
tual energy. When a mind focuses on one thing and forgets all other thought=
s, mind is filled with that thing. If a saint focuses mind on a deity, deit=
y fills one's mind. In other words, that mind vibrates with the spiritual e=
nergy of that deity. Such a mind generates those vibrations in the subtle s=
pace and that can affect the subtle bodies of people around them. They help=
 other spiritual seekers. Secondly, if several saints are generating the vi=
brations of a specific deity in the world today, those vibrations get thing=
s done in the world. It is almost like that deity is "formed" in the world =
and does things.
 
6. Ethereal beings are not like us. Moreover, they perso=
nify various qualities within us, as microcosm (inner cosmos) is a mapping =
of the macrocosm. Certain inner qualities are useful and we try to enhance =
them by resonance, by worshipping their personifications in the outer cosmo=
s. Other qualities that come due to them (children of those deities) may no=
t be interesting or useful to worship.
 
7. Gods are not egoistic people li=
ke us and they do not get offended. If one is really committed to one deity=
 like you say and makes progress, one will eventually realize that other de=
ities are different manifestations of the same supreme being. The biases wi=
ll eventually go away when one has the highest realization.
 
I will repeat=
 an old metaphor from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. A mountain may have many pat=
hs around it that reach the top. When you stand at the bottom of different =
paths, the top may look different. One may start climbing the mountain alon=
g one path and disregard other paths. As long as one does not get stuck wit=
h criticizing other paths and actually climbs one path, one may eventually =
reach the top. As one gets closer to the top, one will see that all paths a=
re reaching there.
 
Supreme cosmic being is like the top of a mountain. Sa=
dhana with different deities is like different paths. The description of ho=
w top looks like from the base (or middle) of different paths is like the d=
escription of various deities in scriptures. If one keeps arguing that this=
 deity is superior or that deity, one is stuck. If one dedicates oneself to=
 a deity and strives to fill the mind with that deity through sadhana, one =
will reach that deity. Once one reaches the supreme cosmic being with that =
deity (if one does), one will realize that all gods are different manifesta=
tions of the same supreme being.

You are thinking w=
ell and that is a good sign. Think of subscribing to vedic-wisdom yahoogrou=
p (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom). It has some nice discussion=
s sometimes, which you may enjoy.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: Qu=
estions for the curiosity about the universal-drama and human
Respected Gur=
uji,
 
Sorry to take your valuable time. Could you please through light on =
below questions and help me to judge the answers? I think, only pure soul c=
an give reasonable answers. My intension is not to test your knowledge, I j=
ust asking to known that what do you think about them.
 
1. Why there is no=
 reference about Dinosaurs in any religious book?
2. If the lord Narayana h=
as created this all universe then, why the other religions persons do not f=
ollow to Lord, even most of the Hindus also don=E2=80=99t have the knowledg=
e about the Creator and Dharma etc?
3. As we consider that Kaam, Krodha, Mo=
ha, Lobha and Matsar are the enemies, of human but if lord created this all=
 world then why Lord created this kind of bad things? Why today=E2=80=99s m=
an is blindly running behind the money, fame and sex ?
4. In one chart, we =
can see the past birth, but as per Puranas, it is not sure that our next bi=
rth will be of human. Our Soul can come in animal or birds format too. Then=
 the question is, when we talk about the past birth why we always consider =
that in past birth, we were the human and we had this wish or we did this t=
his etc=E2=80=A6
5. What is the use of a saint to world who is worshiping L=
ord in the mountain from the hundreds of years?
6. As per Hindu mythology, =
Lord Shiva is the father of Lord Ganesha then what about the other generati=
ons of the lord, why do we not have the information about the current gener=
ation of lord=E2=80=99s family?
7. A great Saadu who is blindly worshiping =
to Lord Rama or Shiva or any religion's lord but who is not giving a 1% res=
pect to the lord of other religion, do you think this is kind of person is =
a real Saadu and really worshiping the supreme Lord ?
 
Thank you Sir to re=
ad this all, I am very simple person living in Nagpur and searching the tru=
th of this all-universal drama, my most of the time has been gone in this r=
esearch. I am not much educated but still having the curiosity about the de=
ath and birth. If you have time then you can see, whatever I talk about mys=
elf is true or false from my chart. My birth details are <deleted>
 
Sir, I=
 hope you understand my questions. Please forgive me if I did any mistake.

Thank you,
<deleted>
