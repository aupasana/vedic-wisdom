Narasimha Ji

I have been following your advice to do Pitri tarpana during =
this fortnight and overall it has been a very pleasant experience. While re=
ading the tarpana manual notice that in the portion of the divine beings ta=
rpana, Aryama is being praised.

I was reminded of this passage from the Gi=
ta.Translation from Srila Prabhupada's Gita.

Bhagavad Gita Chapter 8 Verse=
 26


śukla-kṛṣṇe gatī hy ete

jagataḥ &#=
347;āśvate mate

ekayā yāty anāvṛttim

anyay=
āvartate punaḥ

SYNONYMS

śukla =97 light; kṛṣn=
̣e =97 and darkness; gatī =97 ways of passing; hi =97 certainly; =
ete =97 these two; jagataḥ =97 of the material world; śā=
47;vate =97 of the Vedas; mate =97 in the opinion; ekayā =97 by one; y=
āti =97 goes; anāvṛttim =97 to no return; anyayā =97 b=
y the other; āvartate =97 comes back; punaḥ =97 again.

TRANSLAT=
ION

According to Vedic opinion, there are two ways of passing from this wo=
rld =97 one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does=
 not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.



Bhagavad Gi=
ta Chapter 10 Verse 29

anantaś cāsmi nāgānāḿ=
;

varuṇo yādasām aham

pitṝṇām arya=
mā cāsmi

yamaḥ saḿyamatām aham

SYNONYMS

anant=
aḥ =97 Ananta; ca =97 also; asmi =97 I am; nāgānām =97=
 of the many-hooded serpents; varuṇaḥ =97 the demigod controlli=
ng the water; yādasām =97 of all aquatics; aham =97 I am; pitr=
72;̣ṇām =97 of the ancestors; aryamā =97 Aryamā; =
ca =97 also; asmi =97 I am; yamaḥ =97 the controller of death; sam=
69;yamatām =97 of all regulators; aham =97 I am.

TRANSLATION

Of the =
many-hooded Nāgas I am Ananta, and among the aquatics I am the demigod=
 Varuṇa. Of departed ancestors I am Aryamā, and among the dispen=
sers of law I am Yama, the lord of death.


Also in the section for Lord Ya=
ma , noticed the name Audambaraya. I also find this name used for Lord Datt=
atreya .


I was wondering if the meaning of the above Gita verses says tha=
t one who passes away in Dakshinayana will be forced to take rebirth . Also=
 any metaphysical significance of the names  Aryama and Audambaraya.

Also =
in general I am noticing that my suppressed emotions are expressing a lot m=
ore after the tarpana ritual, usually am calm but am noticing the tendency =
for expressing anger more.

Should I curb this tendency or just let the emo=
tion express itself .


Regards
Ram Kishore
