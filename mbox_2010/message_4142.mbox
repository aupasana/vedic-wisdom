 look at anything like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahea=
d. I mentioned it to Manish and he said, "excellent, go ahead". I meditated=
 with Gayatri mantra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times fo=
r 2-minute breaks and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the mi=
ddle of the day. When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.
>

 Next morning, I realized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisak=
ha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga st=
arted). It is said that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 =
times more effective than a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked=
 at random happened to be an auspicious day.
>  
> I mentioned it to Manish=
. He said, "I knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the inten=
tion to me". I asked him why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly rem=
arked, "knowing you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not ha=
ve helped and would have instead distracted you."
>  
> He was right. As su=
ch, I was a little "proud" of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japam=
. There was a bit of excitement and expectancy that was present as an under=
current and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I =
was doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effec=
tive, that undercurrent of useless excitement would've been higher and dist=
racted me even more!
>  
> Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But w=
hat really matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on=
 an auspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distract one. D=
oing the same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to succeed oned=
ay is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy. My 2 cents..
