Respected Sir,

I am just illiterate in this subject. Although I will like =
to express my thoughts. Please forgive me for my mistakes.

Besides the Law=
 of Karma, another fact associated with Meat eating is that meat is a "tams=
ik" food. People who follow Satvik path for spiritual evolution should avoi=
d eating rajsik and tamsik food.

Another thing told in Shrimad Bhagwat Gee=
ta is that the aim and state of mind behind the karma decides that the Karm=
a will be counted as Satvik, Rajsik or tamsik and hence will decide the out=
come of karma.  If a homam/karma/ritual/work is done without selfishness/gr=
eed/want then that will be counted as satvik. If same homam/karma/ritual/wo=
rk is done with greed/want/ahamkar then it will be counted as rajsik. and i=
f same homam/karma/ritual/work is done due to ignorance and agyana then it =
is counted as tamsik.

Same karma done with same procedure but different mi=
ndset will give different results.

please forgive me if I sound rude

Kind=
 Regards
Atul
