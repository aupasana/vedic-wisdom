Referring to Sri Krishna's telling Arjuna: "D=
eluded by Maya you refuse to
fight, but your own nature will force you to f=
ight;" a devotee asked
Bhagavan whether we have no free will at all. Bhagav=
an replied: "You always
have freedom not to identify yourself with the body=
 and the pleasures and
pains that come to it as its prarabdha."

One summer=
 afternoon I was sitting opposite Sri Bhagavan in the Old Hall
with a fan i=
n my hand and said to him: "I can understand that the
outstanding events in=
 a man's life, such as his country, nationality,
family, career or professi=
on, marriage, death, etc., are all predestined by
his karma, but can it be =
that all the details of his life, down to the
minutest, have already been d=
etermined? Now, for instance, I put this fan
that is in my hand down on the=
 floor here. Can it be that it was already
decided that on such and such a =
day, at such and such an hour, I would move
the fan like this and put it do=
wn here?"

Bhagavan replied: "Certainly." He continued: "Whatever this body=
 is to do
and whatever experiences it is to pass through was already decide=
d when it
came into existence."

Thereupon I naturally exclaimed: "What bec=
omes then of man's freedom and
responsibility for his actions?"

Bhagavan e=
xplained: "The only freedom one has is to strive for and acquire
the Jnana =
which will enable him not to identify himself with the body. The
body will =
go through the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha (destiny)
based on =
the balance sheet of past lives, and a man is free either to
identify himse=
lf with the body and be attached to the fruits of its actions
or to be deta=
ched from it and be a mere witness of its activities."

>From various other =
talks that I had with him, I am convinced that this was
Bhagavan's teaching=
. I will only refer here to the classic reply he gave to
his mother when, a=
s a young Sage, he rejected her tearful request to go back
home with her. "=
The Ordainer controls the fate of man according to his
prarabdha. What is d=
estined not to happen will not happen, try as you may.
What is destined to =
happen will happen, try as one may to prevent it. This
is certain. So the b=
est course is to remain silent."

However, if the law of karma as pure caus=
e and effect is so supreme as to be
absolutely inviolable and inexorable, o=
ne may ask of what use is religion,
God or prayer. There seems to have been=
 no time when man did not turn to an
all-powerful and all-loving God who co=
uld save him from his sins and
suffering and give him peace and bliss. Star=
ting from the Vedic times and
passing through the period of the great bhakt=
as, both Saivite and
Vaishnavite, and down to comparatively recent times, t=
here is a great mass
of religious literature which states quite clearly tha=
t whatever sins a man
may have committed, God in His mercy can save him. Th=
ey have also stated
that all karma, including prarabdha, can be destroyed b=
y the Grace of God,
like cotton by fire. Western saints and mystics have sa=
id the same thing and
have ridiculed the idea that because God is just, imp=
artial and righteous He
cannot save the sinner but must punish him first fo=
r his transgressions. For
if that were so, what would become of the other a=
ttributes of God such as
Mercy, Love, Fatherhood and Motherhood? The Vaishn=
avites stress the quality
of Vatsalya or loving-kindness in God and illustr=
ate it by the vatsalya of a
cow which, as soon as its calf is born, begins =
to lick it all over,
oblivious to the fact that it is unclean. They say God=
 does not wait for the
sinner to become pure before He can save him, but sa=
ves him just as He finds
him if only the man desires, cries out for and sup=
plicates salvation. If a
man who is suffering turns to God for help and rel=
ief in full faith that God
can save him he is sure to be saved. That is wha=
t the scriptures say and
what countless saints have declared. Christ said: =
"Come unto me all ye that
are weary and heavy laden and I will give you res=
t. Fear not." Lord Krishna
said almost the same thing. When Arjuna, after h=
earing what Krishna had to
say about all the different kinds of yoga which =
could secure Liberation,
complained that he was confused by all these instr=
uctions and felt that he
could not follow them, Krishna said: "Then give up=
 all dharmas and take
refuge only in Me. Grieve not. I will save you from a=
ll your sins.

What is demanded here is total surrender to God by throwing =
oneself
completely on God's Mercy and not desiring anything for oneself. Le=
aving
everything to God the all-loving and all-knowing is not so easy as it=
 may
sound. However, the point I want to make here is that Grace is all-pow=
erful
and that even the law of karma by which, they say, a man must reap wh=
at he
has sown, with no exception whatsoever, can be overcome. I am strongl=
y
inclined by temperament to believe this, and I believe that Bhagavan has
=
confirmed it for me. I will quote here what I wrote on the subject on pages=

100 and 101 of my little book My Recollections of Bhagavan Sri Ramana

"An=
other point on which I more than once argued with Bhagavan is the extent
to=
 which Grace can override prarabdha or destiny. My main line of argument
th=
roughout was (and my conviction now as ever is) that God is all-powerful
an=
d that nothing is impossible for Him, and that if one got and could get
onl=
y what one had worked for and merited, there would be no place at all for
G=
race. Most often Bhagavan remained silent when I indulged in such arguments=

either by myself or with others, some of whom took my side and others the
=
opposite side; but from various remarks and observations that he made on
di=
fferent occasions I have come to the conclusion that the following is his
a=
ttitude in the matter: 'Of course, nothing is impossible to God, but
everyt=
hing happens according to the order established by God's will or plan
and e=
xceptions are very few. How many Markandeyas, are there in our
Puranas?'

"=
On the other hand, many authoritative books have clearly said (and Bhagavan=

has quoted them with approval) that one look from a Jnani can save us from=

the effects of all our karmas, past or present, prarabdha included. And Sr=
i
Janaki Matha has published in her Tamil journal that when she discussed t=
his
question once with Bhagavan, maintaining that His Grace can help one ev=
en to
overcome prarabdha, he told her: 'If you have such faith it will be s=
o.' "

I find that I cannot usefully add anything to this quotation, but I =
should
perhaps explain the reference to Markandeya. It is said in the Puran=
as that
Markandeya was destined to live for only sixteen years and that he =
prayed to
Siva and received the boon that he would be perpetually sixteen. =
Bhagavan
mentioned it to stress his point that the obvious and spectacular
=
intervention of Divine Grace is very exceptional.

It is said in the Upanis=
hads that one cannot say when or why or to whom
Grace will come. It is said=
 that it will fall only on him whom it chooses. A
hundred might make the ef=
fort and yet only one or two of them might be
chosen. No one can predict an=
ything about Grace except that it is
unpredictable.

It will be interesting=
 here to turn to the following quotations from Paul
Brunton given in my boo=
k Day by Day with Bhagavan.

"Divine Grace is a manifestation of the cosmic=
 free will in operation. It
can alter the course of events in a mysterious =
manner through its own
unknown laws, which are superior to all natural laws=
, and can modify the
latter by interaction. It is the most powerful force i=
n the universe.

"It descends and acts only when it is invoked by total sel=
f-surrender. It
acts from within, because God resides in the heart of all b=
eings. Its
whisper can be heard only in a mind purified by self-surrender a=
nd prayer."

The above two quotations were contained in a book called Divin=
e Grace
Through Total Self-Surrender by one D. C. Desai, and Bhagavan himse=
lf, on
going through the book, read them out to us.

My saying that God's G=
race is unpredictable and has power to remit sins and
erase karma should no=
t be taken to mean that this Grace can be obtained
without effort. On the c=
ontrary, great effort is necessary. A man,
recognising that he cannot raise=
 himself by himself, must fall at the feet
of God and cry: "Lord, I am weak=
 and powerless. You alone can save me. I
take refuge in You. Do what You wi=
ll with me." This is the effort that must
be made: an effort towards attain=
ment of effortlessness after realizing the
uselessness of our own puny effo=
rts.

Bhagavan has strongly commended the path of total self-surrender as a=
 sure
way to salvation and has called devotion the 'Mother of Jnana'. That
=
well-known early devotee of Bhagavan, Sivaprakasam Pillai, for whom Who am
=
I? was written, says in one of his poems: "To everyone you give only this
i=
nstruction: 'Find out who you are.' If, after that, they humbly ask for
mor=
e guidance, you tell them as your final word: 'There is a power which
moves=
 you and me and all others. Lay your ego at the feet of that Mother.' "

Fr=
om various actions and remarks of Bhagavan I have not the slightest doubt
t=
hat he regards the path of surrender as the best way for me. It is true
tha=
t he maintained quite definitely that final Liberation is only possible
thr=
ough Knowledge of the Self, which is being the Self, because Knowing is
Bei=
ng; but that comes inevitably to one who has completely surrendered.
