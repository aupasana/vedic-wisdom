 Letter 41

15th April, 1946

Devotee: It is said that the Advaita attitude=
 should not be shown towards
the Guru, even if it is shown towards all the =
three worlds.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CYes, it is so. The Advaita attit=
ude does not mean that you should
not do namaskar and the like. Only it sho=
uld not be overdone. Advaita should
be in bhava, in the disposition of the =
mind; it will not do for outside,
worldly affairs. You are asked to look at=
 everything with equality (sama
drishti) but can we eat the same food that =
a dog eats? A handful of grain
will do for a bird but will that do for us? =
We eat a certain quantity of
food but will that be enough for an elephant? =
So you should have the
attitude of Advaita only in bhava, in the mind, but =
you should follow the
world in other matters. Though there are no pains and=
 pleasures for a Jnani,
for the sake of others, he does everything. He is l=
ike those who beat their
chests, and weep loudly, if ordered to, for an agr=
eed wage. That is all. He
is not affected by it,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.

S=
omeone asked, =E2=80=9CWhat is that about beating chests and weeping for wa=
ges?=E2=80=9D
Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=9CIn olden times, there used to be s=
uch a practice.
Supposing some elderly person dies and no one in the house =
bothers to weep
for him, what is to be done? Someone must weep for the pers=
on who is dead.
That was required by custom. There used to be some professi=
onal people whose
vocation was to weep for afee. If called, they used to we=
ep better than the
deceased=E2=80=99s kith and kin, methodically, like bhaj=
an and with great variety,
by beating their chests and shedding tears, whic=
h flowed either by long
practice or by squeezing onion juice into their eye=
s, and they used to
finish this programme to schedule. In the same manner, =
the Jnani conducts
himself according to the wishes of others. He keeps time=
 to whatever tune is
sung.

As he is well-experienced, nothing is new to hi=
m. He goes to whoever calls
him. He puts on whatever garb he is asked to we=
ar. It is all for the sake of
others, as he does not desire anything for hi=
mself. His action will be
according to the desire of the person who asks. O=
ne must therefore find out
for oneself sufficiently well what is really goo=
d and what is really bad,=E2=80=9D
said Bhagavan.
