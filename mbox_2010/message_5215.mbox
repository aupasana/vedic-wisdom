What is purity anyway? How can we purify the five elements?
=

If there is attachment to something which we think of as our possession, c=
an the earth element inside us be considered to be pure? If there is attach=
ment to something which we want to control, can the fire element inside us =
be considered to be pure? And so on.

If we are vulnerable to the six inter=
nal enemies - lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy - then a=
ren't there still impurities?

Complete surrender and humility that I menti=
oned are not some hollow virtues. They are the real signs of purity.

* * *=


Whatever mantra you are given by your guru, whatever mantra you picked ou=
t of attraction, or whatever mantra you otherwise do, please do not think t=
oo much whether it is the right mantra. That is secondary. IF there is a ma=
ntra you use, use it sincerely and with devotion. Use it as a tool to incre=
ase your surrender and devotion. At that end, THAT is what matters and brin=
gs results.

A person with a broken leg needs to use a walking stick until =
the leg cures and becomes fit. How big or heavy the stick is, what wood it =
is made of, what is the carving on it, etc, is not that important. The main=
 purpose of the stick to give complete rest to the leg and help it cure fas=
t. If one worries too much about the beauty and technical details of the st=
ick and ends up putting stress on the leg, the stick does not serve its pur=
pose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously spare the leg from effor=
t. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk but also run. Similarly, =
a lot of technical details of the mantra do not matter much. Use mantra to =
focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.e. impurity!).
