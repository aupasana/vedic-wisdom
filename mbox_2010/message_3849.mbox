The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable fait=
h
in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows.
Bh=
akti alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are
the=
 agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all
pl=
aces. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our
gratitu=
de to God.

That which is within all, which is seen as "This" is the source=
. He who is
within and sees as "This" is God. It is the reality. It is in y=
ourself. What
is limited is Sadhana; what is unlimited is the end.

He alon=
e is an Acharya, who, after clearly understanding the conclusive
teachings =
of the Sastras, makes the people of the world gain their welfare
by making =
them stick to the path shown in the Sastras and also himself does
everythin=
g according to Sastras and remains in that experience.

Many acts relating =
to God, like building temples, digging tanks are
performed. While executing=
 them, there would be many difficulties. There
would come also several kind=
s of dishonour. Not minding any of these, they
would complete their tasks w=
ith mental one-pointedness removing impurities
from their minds and letting=
 the mind wander. By straightening their mind,
they acquire mind control an=
d at the end, they realise the Reality that is
to be known. Digging tanks, =
building temples and such other acts are called
poorttam. The performance o=
f sacrifices, etc., is known as ishtam. Combining
these two, we have the wo=
rd Ishtapoortam.
 In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need=
 must be with
reference to another. Let action be out of love. Passions suc=
h as desire and
hatred , anger and malice must be totally eschewed. If love=
 becomes the
grounding principle of all deeds . then most of the ills of th=
e world will
vanish.

We know many faults we commit, even if others do not =
know them. Sometimes we
realise we are doing so many evil things and repent=
 bitterly and feel why we
should be born . Our duty is to pray to God -"I h=
ave committed so many
faults. Will you not, 0 God, give me the will power n=
ot do like that in
future and will you not purify my mind?" We must note do=
wn in a diary every
night before we go to bed the faults committed by us an=
d pray to God to give
us courage and intelligence not to do so. This must b=
e propagated widely.

Parameswara and Sriman Narayana are one and the same =
in reality. They are
not two. This is the conclusive view of all the sastra=
s. Names differ, forms
are different, occupations vary, but the reality whi=
ch is within Them is one
and the same.
 What is the purpose of human birth?=
 To earn, to eat, to undergo misery
everyday and finally to die? Instead of=
 earning and suffering, can we not
die now? The purpose of birth is to avoi=
d re-birth. Except man, all animals
grow horizontally. Only man grows verti=
cally. Instead of growing
horizontally, it is God's will that he should gro=
w vertically in order to
look up. God has given to animals devices for self=
-protection; to man alone
He has given intelligence. By doing nothing, we a=
void re-birth; By giving up
attachment, we avoid sins.

When any object is =
consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black
residue is burnt again,=
 it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain
white even when burnt =
again. This shows that white is the ultimate and black
is proximate to it. =
Science tells us that diamond and coal are basically
one. White and black a=
re not colours. The primary colours get separated from
the objects to which=
 they are attached when subjected to the test of fire
and ultimately white.=
 Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the
Ultimate Reality is Siva=
, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who
is dark. When we test e=
verything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge,
the residue is Siva. Ash=
 in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the
spiritual plane. We smear=
 our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves
of Siva and the fact th=
at the ultimate goal of life is Siva.

Much is said about the personal God =
and the impersonal absolute God with
attributes and without attributes. It =
is only when all the colours in the
light mix together that we get the colo=
urless rays of the sun. Similarly by
the very virtue of being the abode of =
attributes, God becomes Nirguna,
attribute-less.

By education we realise T=
ruth. There are many truths, History is one truth.
Geography is one truth, =
Mathematics is one truth. The content of truth is
the greatest in Mathemati=
cs. In others, there is an element of imagination.
In Geography, we come ac=
ross names Asia, Africa, Madras, Calcutta, etc.
These names were given by u=
s. By imagination, we have given names "plateau"
"valley", etc. By a proces=
s of gradual elimination of all that is imaginary,
when we arrive at truth,=
 that Truth is found to be God. To think of Him with
real devotion is the f=
ruit of education.

What is the use of education? Its first use is to devel=
op humility (vinaya).
In olden days, the disciple who went to a guru was ca=
lled "vineyan" meaning
a person of humility which is the hall-mark of Instr=
uction he had from his
guru, the fruit of education. Education without humi=
lity is no education.
Education is the same today as it was before, but met=
hods have changed. The
medicine is the same but if the diet is changed, the=
 medicine becomes
poison. Education has today become merely the means of li=
velihood. For true
education, the student should go to a guru and follow th=
e guru-kula system.

Right education should make us know that God is the Tr=
uth. Knowledge must
fill one with good qualities, through which one can rea=
lise the Truth, that
is God. Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the unders=
tanding of the
Ultimate Truth. The first fruit of education must be humilit=
y and self
control.

The total surrender to the Lord is a means of learning=
 our insignificance
and the transcendent grace of the Lord.

If we engage a=
n inquiry into the Atman, at the end of it, it will be clear
that God is in=
 us as our very self. When that stage is reached, we have no
use for the de=
vas. Then all karmas will fall away from us. But, until then,
we must oblig=
atorily do the karmas directing them to the Gods.

Those who are the leader=
s of a group, society, or state should not neglect
the established religiou=
s customs and usages. For themselves the may mot be
in need of Church cerem=
onies, for instance, their advance in spirituality
may not require them. Bu=
t if they begin to neglect them, the people for whom
the rituals are really=
 helpful, will also start neglecting them. This would
be setting a bad exam=
ple. In the words of the Bhagavad Gita, the wise one
should not unsettle th=
e minds of those who are ignorant, and are attached to
action: on the contr=
ary, he should encourage them to perform what they
should perform, by himse=
lf doing the appropriate actions well and with
diligence. It is duty cast u=
pon the leaders and those that are at the top to
lead the people from where=
 they are, and not to refrain from participation
in the traditional ways of=
 worship.

Of all scriptures, the Gita has acquired a specialty of its own.=
 Like this,
there are many other books of wisdom. In the Mahabharata, there=
 are many
chapters teaching wisdom. Besides, in the Sivapurana, Vishnupuran=
a,
Skandham, etc., there is Jnanopadesa.

So also in agamas. But what is th=
e special importance of Gita due to? Not
only in our country but in countri=
es like Java, people follow the Gita. My
inference is that because it was b=
orn in an atmosphere utterly free from
attachment - attachment to life, att=
achment to body, attachment to kith and
kin, but out of attachment only to =
Reality, it has become so famous.

On deep consideration, ahimsa appears to=
 be good as an ideal or for
preaching. But practically speaking, it is diff=
icult to follow fully. First
of all, we must love others. But if we love an=
yone too much, the end is
sorrow. Therefore we should love God who always g=
ives happiness and not
sorrow. I ask myself if we love God, should we not l=
ove anyone else in this
world? So long as there is false knowledge which di=
stinguishes God from the
rest of the world, there will be differences. If w=
e attain Jnana that God is
all, we will develop the same love for all that =
we have for God; This is the
sign of Ahimsa.

For the sake of food, clothin=
g and shelter, everyone is toiling and
sorrow-stricken. If sorrow is to be =
banished and if we are to be ever happy,
we must dedicate all our actions t=
o God. If we get His grace, then we need
not do anything and can be happy. =
God is a good master. By praising Him
always, we cannot please Him. He is i=
ndifferent to our praise or dispraise,
action or inaction. But all our acti=
ons are ordained by Him and are meant
only to purify our minds.

Why so man=
y Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak
of one God=
 only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to
satisfy hunge=
r, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger.
Then why can't =
we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side
dishes? So, if we=
 eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food
tasty to the pal=
ate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a
particular God he w=
orships that.
