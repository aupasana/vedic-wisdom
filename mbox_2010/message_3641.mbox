I was=C2=A0reading a b=
ook on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote th=
at he survived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also=
 relished it. He seem to have no problems with meat eating ..why this diffe=
rence of opinions from the spiritual giants??
=C2=A0

mpact on the Spiritual path? looks like Vivekananda also enjoyed smoking.
