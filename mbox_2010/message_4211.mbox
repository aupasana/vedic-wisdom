Namaste to all Brothers & Sisters

I consulted one of my learned friend on =
this, please see his reply below:

It is widely accepted and historically p=
roven Arabia had never been conquered before the 6th century CE. At the tim=
e of the prophet, there were two super powers in the world: the Romans and =
the Persians with the Ethiopians a distant 3rd. Even they never conquered A=
rabia and the others thought there was nothing there to conquer - not worth=
 the effort. If Hindustan was to reach Arabia, it would have had to cross t=
he Persian empire, something the Persian empire wouldn't have allowed, and =
they would have fight their way across and there's no reports of war betwee=
n the two: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire

A simple check wou=
ld be to look at the Arabic language. Any people that have been conquered, =
taken on / adopt at least some words of the conquering language, just look =
at Hindi or english. Arabic is unique in that it is unlike any other - it i=
s not a 'pidgin' language where words have been adopted from other cultures=
.

To find scripture refering to a King Vikramaditya, does not 'prove beyon=
d doubt' that that land belonged to his empire - it could simply be saying =
that there was a king once named Vikramaditya.

Even if the Kabaa was a Hin=
du temple, it has been rebuilt many times (though always on the same locati=
on and for the same purpose) - both before and after the prophet, so to ref=
er to it as a Hindu temple is inaccurate.

Howver does it really matter if =
Kaaba was a Hindu Temple or not?
Why don't we establish a realtionship betw=
een Hindu and Muslim within a view to prosper India altogether rather than =
getting into such topic which could raise conflict between two brothers of =
same family.

Best Wishes

Kaaba a Hindu Temple? 
[Note: A recent archeologica=
l find in Kuwait unearthed a gold-plated statue of the Hindu deity Ganesh. =
A Muslim resident of Kuwait requested historical research material that can=
 help explain the connection between Hindu civilisation and Arabia.] 
Was t=
he Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple?
By P.N. Oak (Historian) 
Glancing throu=
gh some research material recently, I was pleasantly surprised to come acro=
ss a reference to a king Vikramaditya inscription found in the Kaaba in Mec=
ca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed a part of his Ind=
ian Empire. 
The text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found inscri=
bed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found recorded=
 on page 315 of a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured=
 in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free En=
glish the inscription says: 
"Fortunate are those who were born (and lived)=
 during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. He was a noble, generous dutiful ruler=
, devoted to the welfare of his subjects. But at that time we Arabs, oblivi=
ous of God, were lost in sensual pleasures. Plotting and torture were rampa=
nt. The darkness of ignorance had enveloped our country. Like the lamb stru=
ggling for her life in the cruel paws of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in =
ignorance. The entire country was enveloped in a darkness so intense as on =
a new moon night. But the present dawn and pleasant sunshine of education i=
s the result of the favour of the noble king Vikramaditya whose benevolent =
supervision did not lose sight of us- foreigners as we were. He spread his =
sacred religion amongst us and sent scholars whose brilliance shone like th=
at of the sun from his country to ours. These scholars and preceptors throu=
gh whose benevolence we were once again made cognisant of the presence of G=
od, introduced to His sacred
 existence and put on the road of Truth, had c=
ome to our country to preach their religion and impart education at king Vi=
kramaditya=E2=80=99s behest." 
For those who would like to read the Arabic =
wording I reproduce it hereunder in Roman script: 
"Itrashaphai Santu Ibikr=
amatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru Bihillahaya Samaini Ela =
Motakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara phajjal asari nahone o=
sirom bayjayhalem. Yundan blabin Kajan blnaya khtoryaha sadunya kanateph ne=
tephi bejehalin Atadari bilamasa- rateen phakef tasabuhu kaunnieja majekara=
lhada walador. As hmiman burukankad toluho watastaru hihila Yakajibaymana b=
alay kulk amarena phaneya jaunabilamary Bikramatum". 
(Page 315 Sayar-ul-ok=
ul) . 
[Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-okul=E2=80=99 signifies memorable =
words.] 
A careful analysis of the above inscription enables us to draw the=
 following conclusions: 
1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the ancient =
Indian empires may have extended up to the eastern boundaries of Arabia unt=
il Vikramaditya and that it was he who for the first time conquered Arabia.=
 Because the inscription says that king Vikram who dispelled the darkness o=
f ignorance from Arabia. 
2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatever t=
heir earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=99s preachers had succeeded in sprea=
ding the Vedic (based on the Vedas, the Hindu sacred scriptures)) way of li=
fe in Arabia. 
3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of India=
n arts and sciences was imparted by Indians to the Arabs directly by foundi=
ng schools, academies and cultural centres. The belief, therefore, that vis=
iting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to their own lands through their own in=
defatigable efforts and scholarship is unfounded. 
An ancillary conclusion =
could be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi, India) could well be kin=
g Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest of Arabia. This co=
nclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the inscription on the i=
ron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of the vic=
torious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. This Balhika is none =
other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be that Arabia was wrest=
led by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who concluded a treaty by =
giving his daughter in marriage to the victor. Secondly, the township adjoi=
ning the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after Mihira who was the r=
enowned astronomer-mathemat ician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s court. Mehrauli =
is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 signifying a=
 row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants working on =
astronomical observations made from the tower. 
Having seen the far reachin=
g and history shaking implications of the Arabic inscription concerning kin=
g Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story of its find. How it came t=
o be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What are the other proofs rei=
nforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers of the Indian Vedic way =
of life and that tranquillity and education were ushered into Arabia by kin=
g Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an uneasy period of "=
ignorance and turmoil" mentioned in the inscription. 
In Istanbul, Turkey, =
there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania , which is reputed to =
have the largest collection of ancient West Asian literature. In the Arabic=
 section of that library is an anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. That ant=
hology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742 under the orders of t=
he Turkish ruler Sultan Salim. 
The pages of that volume are of Hareer =E2=
=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on. Each page has a decorative gilde=
d border. That anthology is known as Sayar-ul-Okul. It is divided into thre=
e parts. The first part contains biographic details and the poetic composit=
ions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The second part embodies accounts and ve=
rses of poets of the period beginning just after prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s=
 times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The third part deals w=
ith later poets up to the end of Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s times. 
A=
bu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate of Harun-al-Rashi=
d=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology. 
The first modern=
 edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed and published in Be=
rlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in Beirut in 1932. =

The collection is regarded as the most important and authoritative antholo=
gy of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light on the social lif=
e, customs, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Arabia. The book als=
o contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine of Mecca, the tow=
n and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held every year around=
 the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers that the annual ha=
j of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic congregation. 
But =
the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a forum for the elite an=
d the learned to discuss the social, religious, political, literary and oth=
er aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Ok=
ul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reached at those discussions were w=
idely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, followed the Varanasi =
tradition (of India) of providing a venue for important discussions among t=
he learned while the masses congregated there for spiritual bliss. The prin=
cipal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arvasthan (Arabia) =
were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva) emblems can be s=
een. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims reverently touch =
and kiss in the Kaaba. 
Arabic tradition has lost trace of the founding of =
the Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramaditya inscription affords a c=
lue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great devotion to Lord Mahadev (Siv=
a). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramaditya, exists the famous shrin=
e of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) associated with Vikramaditya. =
Since according to the Vikramaditya inscription he spread the Vedic religio=
n, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba temple in Mecca? 
A few mil=
es away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars the entry of any non-Musli=
m into the area. This is a reminder of the days when the Kaaba was stormed =
and captured solely for the newly established faith of Islam. The object in=
 barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prevent its recapture. 
As t=
he pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to shave his head and beard a=
nd to don special sacred attire that consists of two seamless sheets of whi=
te cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and the other over the shoulder=
s. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic practice of entering Hind=
u temples clean- and with holy seamless white sheets. 
The main shrine in M=
ecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as the Kaaba. It is clothed in=
 a black shroud. That custom also originates from the days when it was thou=
ght necessary to discourage its recapture by camouflaging it. 
According to=
 the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 images. Traditional accoun=
ts mention that one of the deities among the 360 destroyed when the place w=
as stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the Moon and yet another was=
 one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs worshipped the ni=
ne planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of =E2=80=98Navagraha=
=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is still in vogue. Two=
 of these nine are Saturn and Moon. 
In India the crescent moon is always p=
ainted across the forehead of the Siva symbol. Since that symbol was associ=
ated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came to be grafted on the flag of Isl=
am. 
Another Hindu tradition associated with the Kaaba is that of the sacre=
d stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). According to the Hindu =
tradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva emblem as the crescent m=
oon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-exist. True to that ass=
ociation a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its water is held sacred bec=
ause it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pre-Islamic times (Z=
am-Zam water). 
[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who go to the Kaaba for =
Haj regard this Zam-Zam water with reverence and take some bottled water wi=
th them as sacred water.] 
Muslim pilgrims visiting the Kaaba temple go aro=
und it seven times. In no other mosque does the circumambulation prevail. H=
indus invariably circumambulate around their deities. This is yet another p=
roof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiva temple where the H=
indu practice of circumambulation is still meticulously observed. 
The prac=
tice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskrit- is associated w=
ith Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culminating rite in a Hin=
du marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round the sacred fire fo=
ur times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Since "Makha" means fi=
re, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca was the seat of India=
n fire-worship in the West Asia. 
It might come as a stunning revelation to=
 many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit=
 language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify a goddess or moth=
er. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskrit chants invoking=
 goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini. The Is=
lamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but the ancient Sanskr=
it appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah means mother or godde=
ss and mother goddess. 
One Koranic verse is an exact translation of a stan=
za in the Yajurveda. This was pointed out by the great research scholar Pan=
dit Satavlekar of Pardi in one of his articles. 
[Note: Another scholar poi=
nts out that the following teaching from the Koran is exactly similar to th=
e teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7). 
The Koran: 
"Sight perceives Him n=
ot. But He perceives men's sights; for He is the knower of secrets, the Awa=
re." 
Kena Upanishad: 
"That which cannot be seen by the eye but through wh=
ich the eye itself sees, know That to be Brahman (God) and not what people =
worship here (in the manifested world)." 
A simplified meaning of both the =
above verses reads: 
God is one and that He is beyond man's sensory experie=
nce. 
The identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani is just =
the Arabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them and admi=
nistered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire. 
It will n=
ow be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing in West=
 Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during the last 1300 yea=
rs. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of Islamic =
practice. 
The Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too =
worshipped 33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar was intro=
duced in West Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=
=E2=80=99 signifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the =
Hindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning t=
he sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=
=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language). The Mus=
lim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah =
=3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning. 
The Islamic practic=
e of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifice=
s of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Eed for f=
estive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit word.=
 The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancient times=
 the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occasion wa=
s celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari Eed fes=
tival. 
[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.] 
Sin=
ce Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Islamic w=
ord Idgah signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the exact=
 Sanskrit connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=E2=80=
=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Yaj=
na=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping. 
Vedic description=
s about the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creation of =
the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 chapter =
2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapter 10,=
 stanzas 4 to 7. 
Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin to =
the Vedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-Yagn=
a) which is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individuals. =

Muslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before commenci=
ng prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydhyar=
tham Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99. 
Four months of the year are regarded as ve=
ry sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plunde=
r and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturmas=
a i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu trad=
ition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Since =
the Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times i=
mmemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great g=
usto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibarat=
. 
Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the Ka=
aba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to t=
he correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according t=
o hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some of =
them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita. 
According to extant Islamic recor=
ds, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and thei=
r life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them. At =
Ubla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that Indian=
s were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding position t=
o be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unless =
they belonged to the ruling class. 
It is mentioned in the Abadis i.e., the=
 authentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari that the=
 Indian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=
=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken ill, he=
r nephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that India=
ns enjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could not be=
 theirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an Indian R=
aja (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows that the=
 Indian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to send s=
uch an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said to have=
 so highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake of it=
. These references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times I=
ndians retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindling leg=
acy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times. 
The Islamic term =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fi=
tr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that is worshi=
p of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorate their =
ancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for their r=
emembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=
=99 (worship of forefathers) . 
The Islamic practice of observing the moon =
rise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the Hindu cus=
tom of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only after sightin=
g the moon. 
Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating those dead =
in battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradition because =
in Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99. Hindus o=
bserve Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in battle. 
The =
word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The original wor=
d is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 is San=
skrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the land is =E2=80=
=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means a horse. Ar=
vasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arabia is famous=
 for its horses. 
This discovery changes the entire complexion of the histo=
ry of ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts about the k=
ing who had the largest empire in history. It could be that the expanse of =
king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all others. Sec=
ondly, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the east and not in t=
he west beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thirdly the effe=
minate and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country in the worl=
d could by some age spread her benign and beatific cultural influence, lang=
uage, customs, manners and education over distant lands without militarily =
conquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countries physical=
ly wherever traces of its culture and language are still extant and the reg=
ion extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Baltic in Norther=
n Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that while Indian=
 rulers
 identified themselves with the local population and established we=
lfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands perpetuated unto=
ld atrocities over the vanquished. 
=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 tells u=
s that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held in Mecca at the annual=
 Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets used to participate in i=
t. 
Poems considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved on gold pl=
ate were hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goatskin were hu=
ng outside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasure house of=
 the best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tradition. 
T=
hat tradition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic compositions were e=
ngraved and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. But most of =
the poems got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaaba by Prophe=
t Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, Hassan-bin-S=
awik, who was among the invaders, captured some of the treasured poems and =
dumped the gold plate on which they were inscribed in his own home. Sawik=
=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried those gold plates to K=
halif=E2=80=99s court where he met the well-known Arab scholar Abu Amir Asa=
mai. The latter received from the bearer five gold plates and 16 leather sh=
eets with the prize-winning poems engraved on them. The bearer was sent awa=
y happy bestowed with a good reward. 
On the five gold plates were inscribe=
d verses by ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, Akhatab-bin- Turfa and Jar=
rham Bintoi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to compile =
a collection of all earlier compositions. One of the compositions in the co=
llection is a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned Arab poet=
, to king Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet Mohammad =
had received the highest award for the best poetic compositions for three y=
ears in succession in the pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every year. A=
ll those three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the Kaaba tem=
ple, inscribed on gold plates. One of these constituted an unreserved tribu=
te to King Vikramaditya for his paternal and filial rule over Arabia. That =
has already been quoted above. 
Pre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s t=
ribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive evidence that it was king Vikrama=
ditya who first conquered the Arabian Peninsula and made it a part of the I=
ndian Empire. This explains why starting from India towards the west we hav=
e all Sanskrit names like Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan) , Baluchisthan, Ku=
rdisthan, Tajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan,=
 Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan) etc. 
Historians have blundered in not giving d=
ue weight to the evidence provided by Sanskrit names pervading over the ent=
ire west Asian region. Let us take a contemporary instance. Why did a part =
of India get named Nagaland even after the end of British rule over India? =
After all historical traces are wiped out of human memory, will a future ag=
e historian be wrong if he concludes from the name Nagaland that the Britis=
h or some English speaking power must have ruled over India? Why is Portugu=
ese spoken in Goa (part of India), and French in Pondichery (part of India)=
, and both French and English in Canada? Is it not because those people rul=
ed over the territories where their languages are spoken? Can we not then j=
ustly conclude that wherever traces of Sanskrit names and traditions exist =
Indians once held sway? It is unfortunate that this important piece of deci=
sive evidence has been ignored all these centuries. 
Another question which=
 should have presented itself to historians for consideration is how could =
it be that Indian empires could extend in the east as far as Korea and Japa=
n, while not being able to make headway beyond Afghanisthan? In fact land c=
ampaigns are much easier to conduct than by sea. It was the Indians who rul=
ed the entire West Asian region from Karachi to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskri=
t names to those lands and the towns therein, introduce their pantheon of t=
he fire-worship, imparted education and established law and order. 
It may =
be that Arabia itself was not part of the Indian empire until king Vikrama =
, since Bintoi says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time brought=
 about a radical change in the social, cultural and political life of Arabi=
a. It may be that the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian rul=
e before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or as a=
 remote possibility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted a =
series of brilliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region betwee=
n Afghanisthan and Hedjaz. 
Incidentally this also explains why king Vikram=
aditya is so famous in history. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness of=
 heart and his impartial filial affection for all his subjects, whether Ind=
ian or Arab, as testified by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanently=
 enshrined in the pages of history because he was the world=E2=80=99s great=
est ruler having the largest empire. It should be remembered that only a mo=
narch with a vast empire gets famous in world history. Vikram Samvat (calen=
dar still widely in use in India today) which he initiated over 2000 years =
ago may well mark his victory over Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar (K=
utub Tower in Delhi), a pillar commemorating that victory and the consequen=
tial marriage with the Vaihika (Balkh) princess as testified by the nearby =
iron pillar inscription. 
A great many puzzles of ancient world history get=
 automatically solved by a proper understanding of these great conquests of=
 king Vikramaditya. As recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, p=
reachers and social workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached the =
Vedic way of life, manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trai=
ned the local people in irrigation and agriculture and established in those=
 regions a democratic, orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way of =
life. That was of course, a Vedic Hindu way of life. 
It is from such ancie=
nt times that Indian Kshtriya royal families, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks=
, have held sway over Iran and Iraq. It is those conquests, which made the =
Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshippers. It is therefore that we find the=
 Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sanskritised dialect, fire temples existing=
 thousands of miles away from India, and scores of sites of ancient Indian =
cultural centres like Navbahar in West Asia and the numerous viharas in Sov=
iet Russia spread throughout the world. Ever since so many viharas are ofte=
n dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient Indian sculptures are also found in exca=
vations in Central Asia. The same goes for West Asia. 
[Note: Ancient India=
n sculptures include metal statues of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant =
headed god); the most recent find being in Kuwait]. 
Unfortunately these ch=
apters of world history have been almost obliterated from public memory. Th=
ey need to be carefully deciphered and rewritten. When these chapters are r=
ewritten they might change the entire concept and orientation of ancient hi=
story. 
In view of the overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scholar=
s, students of history and lay men alike should take note that they had bet=
ter revise their text books of ancient world history. The existence of Hind=
u customs, shrines, Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns an=
d the Vikramaditya inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumping =
proof that Indian Kshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali to B=
altic and Korea to Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.

<DIV><BR><FONT color=3D#ff40ff></FONT>It is widely accept=

hey never conquered Arabia and the others thought there was nothing there t=

't have allowed, and they would have fight their way across and there's no =
reports of war between the two: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empir=
e<BR><BR>A simple check would be to look at the Arabic language. Any people=
 that have been conquered, taken on / adopt at least some words of the conq=
uering language, just look at Hindi or english. Arabic is unique in that it=
 is unlike any other - it is not a 'pidgin' language where words have been =

 other cultures.<BR><BR>To find scripture refering to a King V=
ikramaditya, does not 'prove beyond doubt' that that land belonged to his e=

itya.<BR><BR>Even if the Kabaa was a Hindu temple, it has been rebuilt many=
 times (though always on the same location and for the same purpose) - both=
 before and after the prophet, so to refer to it as a Hindu temple is inacc=
urate.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Howver does it really matter if Kaaba was a Hindu Tem=

. The discovery of the Vikramaditya inscription affords a clue. King Vikram=
aditya is known for his great devotion to Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (I=
ndia), the capital of Vikramaditya, exists the famous shrine of Mahankal, i=
.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) associated with Vikramaditya. Since according =
to the Vikramaditya inscription he spread the Vedic religion, who else but =
he could have founded the Kaaba temple in Mecca?</SPAN>

from Mecca is a big signboard which bars the entry of any non-Muslim into t=
he area. This is a reminder of the days when the Kaaba was stormed and capt=
ured solely for the newly established faith of Islam. The object in barring=
 entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prevent its recapture.</SPAN> 
<P cl=

he pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to shave his head and beard a=

ine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as the Kaaba. It is cl=

was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by camouflaging it.</SPAN=

aditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 destroyed =
when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the Moon and=
 yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs w=
orshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of =
=E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is s=
till in vogue. Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon.</SPAN> 
<P class=3DMs=

 crescent moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva symbol. Si=

ith the Kaaba is that of the sacred stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Gang=

the Shiva emblem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Gan=
ga must co-exist. True to that association a sacred fount exists near the K=
aaba. Its water is held sacred because it has been traditionally regarded a=
s Ganga since pre-Islamic times (Zam-Zam water).</SPAN>

ns upon the bride and groom to go round the sacred fire four times (but mis=
understood by many as seven times). Since "Makha" means fire, the seven cir=
cumambulations also prove that Mecca was the seat of Indian fire-worship in=
 the West Asia.</SPAN>

t the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit language=
 Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify a goddess or mother. The t=

Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini. The Islamic wor=

<P class=3DMsoNormal><=
SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; COLOR: rgb(79,98,40)">The Hindus have a pan=
theon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too worshipped 33 gods before the sp=
read of Islam. The lunar calendar was introduced in West Asia during the In=
dian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 signifying the =E2=80=
=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the Hindu calendar. The Muslim mont=
h Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning the sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=
=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the p=
opular version of Sanskrit language). The Muslim sanctity for Gyrahwi Shari=
f is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah =3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are=
 identical in meaning.</SPAN> 
<P class=3DMsoNormal><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZ=
E: 9.5pt; COLOR: rgb(79,98,40)">The Islamic practice of Bakari Eed derives =
from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifices of Vedic times. Eed in=
 Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Eed for festive days, signifying =
days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit word. The word MESH in the Hi=
ndu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancient times the year used to begin =
with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occasion was celebrated with mutton=
 feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari Eed festival.</SPAN>
