Namaste,  I'm planning to perform Lakshmi and Vishnu sahasranama homam on S=
unday May 16, 2010 and I'm inviting just couple of our friends over who I k=
now are interested and inclined toward homa.  My question to the group is, =
can I provide the guests as well with some Ghee and Dry nuts to offer in th=
e homa kundam during the pradhaana homam?  Are there any implications in do=
ing so?  Thanks,
-Sunitha
