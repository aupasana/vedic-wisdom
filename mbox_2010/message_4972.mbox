Namaste,

I had done homam mentally few times, and I would not hesitate to =
do so in future. Here is my experiance.

My first attempt was similar to Ra=
jarhi. I was in a zoo. Why family was having lunch and I was waiting and th=
ought, instead of sitting idle, I can perform a homam mentally as i could n=
ot do so in the morning. I lost my way in middle and I did not complete the=
 procedure. I told mentally kshamaswa (please tolerate). How ever, I was no=
t really bogged down. 

My second attempt was when I had to travel to anoth=
er town and I did not carry my homam materials. I had plenty of time in the=
 morning, and I sat down to do homam mentally. It was very pleasant. Ofcour=
se there are many advantages of doing homam mentally:
1. I did not need to =
bother about the fire going off and I could imagine sitting in front of a r=
eal big fire. If you can sit so that you face Sun, the imagination can be r=
eally easy!
2. Normally, at times, when I offer akshatas as flowers, I feel=
 uncomfortable. With mental homam, I could imagine I am actually using all =
the flowers in the world
3. Normally, naivedyam is more of routine. It is d=
ifficult to imagine the God eating it really. How ever, when it is done men=
tally, I could imagine the God actually eating.

I was tempted to continue =
mental homam even after coming back to home. How ever, the presence of fire=
 does have some real impact. The sound of the dry coconut/small wood cracki=
ng, the smell and heat are missed when I did the homam mentally. So, I pref=
er an external homam, but, when you can't do resort to doing the same menta=
lly.

Afterwards, I did mental homam few times while I am in airplane.

Som=
e thing is better than nothing. I remember Narasimha mentioning that he did=
 homam mentally in Korea. Do not hesitate to do so.

Don't worry about not =
completing homam. The objective of the homam is to loose your self. If you =
lost your way in middle and get immersed in meditation, it only indicates g=
ood. However, when you realise you have not completed homam, you actually h=
ave a chance to complete it ;-)

Best regards,
Vijay
