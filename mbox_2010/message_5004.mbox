Namaste,

I had the same exact question in my mind. In-fact something VERY =
strage happened the first time I did my proper Tarpana (at the begining of =
this Pitri Paksha).

As I threw the remaining water in the pot (containing =
left over seasame seeds), I heard a strange voice at that exact moment I tu=
rned the vessel upside down. For a few moments I got scared becasue the voi=
ce clearly came from the vessel. I strongly felt that there were some Jiva-=
Atmas of my departed ancestors in the vessel (which to be honest I did not =
expect!!).

While on one hand, this incident strengthened my faith, on the =
other hand I can't help but feel that I may have dis-comforted my ancestors=
 by suddenly turnning the vessel up-side down.

Since then, I had this exac=
t same question in my mind.
@Mitest: Thanks for bringing it up.

Will reque=
st the learned ones to guide/share their thoughts.

Reverntly,
Mahesh
