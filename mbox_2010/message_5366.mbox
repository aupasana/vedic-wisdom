Dear Rajarshi,

y motivated

>...that without animal proteint diet assimilation b=
ecomes weak and >unbalanced,

I already clarified that my arguments are nev=
er based on scientific data because average meat eaters does not eat meat b=
ecause of the scientific data provided by various sources. It is because of=
 the habit of generations and not to talk about affordability because very =
well to do people have no problems of the affordability issue. The hard fac=
t is that people love eating meat and then to defend that love of eating me=
at, all arguments come up.

BTW there are vegetarians, in India for Generat=
ions and they never lacked any problems of diet assimilation as you quoted.=

 
The question is not to ignore science but the question is of that of fol=
lowing scientific data even to the extent of cruelty to the lives on which =
we have no rights and moreover, some nutrition data, however authentic they=
 are, does not provide us with the right to follow "Jungle law" where in th=
e more powerful kills the less powerful one.

>Obviously, Nature had a good=
 reason for making humans turn >omnivorous.

Yes Nature had a good reason f=
or making humans turn omnivorous so that humans does not escape from the cy=
cle so easily.

***
>there is too much 
> sentimentalism. 

Well, it is onl=
y because we and our near & dear ones are not slaughtered for food, we can =
talk of the word sentimentalism so lightly.

Imagine a more powerful and mo=
re intelligent species attacks humans and takes the complete control of who=
le earth and their scientific research suggest that Humans flash is extreme=
ly nutritious for their development and then they Start Slaughter houses to=
 slaughter Humans where in we along with our fellow humans are slaughtered =
and then they also set up the factories to produce Humans for endless butch=
ering. Then probably will we know of sentimentalism.

What we are doing at =
the moment on earth is exactly the same!
   

Best Regards,

Utpal
