Dear All Members,

Many of members perhaps  may be knowing the above Mantr=
a contained

in Shree Durga Saptashati. This goes as "Shree
Durgaashttottar=
shatnamstrotam

( As narrated by lord Shankarji to Paravatiji) ,which begin=
s as :-

"SHATNAAM PRAVAKHAMI SHRINUSHVA KAMALANANE ,

YASYA PRSADMATRENNA =
DURGA PREETA BHAVET SATI !

AND in the last 2 Shlokas Lord Shankar sums up:=
-

"GOROCHAN ALAKTA KAKUMKUMEN, SINDOOR KARPOOR MADHU TRAYENA

VILIKHYAH YA=
NTRA VIDHINAVIDHIGYOH

BHAVET SADADHAARYET PURARIH ,

BHAUMAVASYENISHAAGR E=
 CHANDRE SHATBHISHAN GATE ,

(The above means that a Vidhigya person who collects
Gorochan,Lask=
hhya, Kumkum,Sindoor, Kapoor,Ghee (or milk),Sugar and
Madhu,
and on the Bha=
uma Amavasya ,when Chandrma is in Shatbhisha Nakshatra in
the midnight, wri=
tes this Mantra as per the vidhi, and if he prepares
a yantra and wears it =
or writes down the mantra and recites it, get
benifited.

This yog of Amava=
sya in the night of Mangalwar (Tuesday) when Chandrama

(Moon)is transiting=
 in the Shatbhisha Nakhatra, happens very rarely, may
be
after 70-80 years.=
 The last such yoga happened on 24th February,2009.
On this night ten membe=
rs of my family and Shisya, performed the pooja
collectively in a Temple, a=
nd wrote the mantra individually. The whole
process took us about 4 hours. =
I have got my copy of the Mantra scanned,
and I share it with all those who=
 are  needy and have full belief in
powers of MA, so that they can get it f=
ramed and keep in their Pooja
room, for regular recital. Quite a few people=
 have acknowledged to me
that it has really helped them in a number of ways=
 , during past one
year ! That is how it has been working and helping , whi=
ch makes me
grateful to MA -SHAKTI ! Hence this little effort on my part fo=
r sharing
this

with all.

Therefore, I would request any one who have full=
 belief in Mantras, and
need this mantra, to please send me a private mail =
at :-



rkbastrologer@ yahoo.com

e?to=3Drkbastrologer%40yahoo.com>



I do not charge for this service. Howe=
ver, I will really appreciate, if
those who contact me for the scanned copy=
 of the Mantra, may write down
their problem, and also give me a feed back,=
 whatever they feel after
reciting this mantra for sometime. All can also g=
ive the mantra to needy
people.

This will also help me to keep a sort of d=
ata for future use in the
groups, where

  I am member and also for teachin=
g to my very few shishyas, whom I teach

whenever I have time, by the metho=
ds of friendly discussions on Jyotish
, sans

class room, teacher, books an=
d note books.and fees.
With my sincere regards and affection to all !
