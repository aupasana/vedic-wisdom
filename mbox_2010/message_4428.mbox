 When I was on the Hill, Nayana (Kavyakantha Ganapathi Muni) once argued
th=
at the brain was the seat of the vasanas, because it consisted of
innumerab=
le cells in which the vasanas were contained and illuminated by the
light o=
f the Self which projected from the heart. Only this set a person
working o=
r thinking. But I said, "How can it be so? The vasanas must be with
one's S=
elf and can never remain away from the Self. If, as you say, the
vasanas be=
 contained in the brain and the Heart is the seat of the Self, a
person who=
 is decapitated must be rid of his vasanas and should not be
reborn. You ag=
ree that it is absurd. Now can you say that the Self is in the
brain with t=
he vasanas? If so, why should the head bend down when one falls
asleep? Mor=
eover a person does not touch his head and say `I'. Therefore it
follows th=
at the Self is in the Heart and the vasanas are also there in an
exceedingl=
y subtle (Difficult to detect or grasp by the mind or analyse)
form.


"Whe=
n the vasanas are projected from the Heart they are associated with the
Lig=
ht of the Self and the person is said to think. The vasanas which lie
imbed=
ded in an atomic condition grow in size in their passage from the heart
to =
the brain. The brain is the screen on which the images of the vasanas are
t=
hrown and it is also the place of their functional distribution. The brain
=
is the seat of the mind, and the mind works through it." So then this is
wh=
at happens.


When a vasana is released and it comes into play, it is assoc=
iated with the
light of the Self. It passes from the heart to the brain and=
 on its way it
grows more and more until it holds the field all alone and a=
ll the vasanas
are thus kept in abeyance for the time being. When the thoug=
ht is reflected
in the brain it appears as an image on a screen. The person=
 is then said to
have a clear perception of things. He is a great thinker o=
r discoverer.
Neither the thought that is extolled as being original, nor t=
he thing, nor
the country which is claimed to be a new discovery, is really=
 original or
new. It could not manifest unless it was already in the mind. =
It was of
course very subtle and remained imperceptible, because it lay rep=
ressed by
the more urgent or insistent thoughts or vasanas. When they have =
spent
themselves this thought arises and by concentration the Light of the =
Self
makes it clear, so that it appears magnificent, original and revolutio=
nary.
In fact it was only within all along. This concentration is called sa=
myamana
in the Yoga Sastras. One's desires can be fulfilled by this process=
 and it
is said to be a siddhi . It is how the so-called new discoveries ar=
e made. Even
worlds can be created in this manner. Samyamana leads to all s=
iddhis. But
they do not manifest so long as the ego lasts. Concentration ac=
cording to
yoga ends in the destruction of the experiencer (ego), experienc=
e and the
world, and then the quondam desires get fulfilled in due course. =
This
concentration bestows on individuals even the powers of creating new
w=
orlds.

It is illustrated in the Aindava Upakhyana in the Yoga Vasishta and=
 in the
Ganda Saila Loka in the Tripura Rahasya. Although the powers appear=
 to be
wonderful to those who do not possess them, yet they are only transi=
ent. It
is useless to aspire for that which is transient. All these wonders=
 are
contained in the one changeless Self. The world is thus within and not=

without. This meaning is contained in verses 11 and 12 - Chapter V of Sri
=
Ramana Gita "The entire Universe is condensed in the body, and the entire
b=
ody in the Heart. Thus the Heart is the nucleus of the whole Universe."
The=
refore Samyamana relates to concentration on different parts of the body
fo=
r the different siddhis. Also the Visva or the Virat is said to contain
the=
 cosmos within the limits of the body. Again, "The world is not other
than =
the mind, the mind is not other than the Heart; that is the whole
truth." S=
o the Heart comprises all. This is what is taught to Svetaketu by
the illus=
tration of the seed of a fig tree. The source is a point without
any dimens=
ions. It expands as the cosmos on the one hand and as Infinite
Bliss on the=
 other. That point is the pivot. From it a single vasana starts,
multiplies=
 as the experiencer `I', experience, and the world. The
experiencer and the=
 source are referred to in the mantra . Two birds,
exactly alike, arise sim=
ultaneously.

When I was staying in the Skandasramam I sometimes used to go=
 out and sit on
a rock. On one such occasion there were two or three others=
 with me
including Rangaswami Iyengar. Suddenly we noticed some small moth-=
like
insect shooting up like a rocket into the air from a crevice in the ro=
ck.
Within the twinkling of an eye it had multiplied itself into millions o=
f
moths which formed a cloud and hid the sky from view. We wondered at it a=
nd
examined the place from which it shot up. We found that it was only a
pi=
nhole and knew that so many insects could not have issued from it in such
a=
 short time. That is how ahankara (ego) shoots up like a rocket and
instant=
aneously spreads out as the Universe. The Heart is therefore the
centre.

A=
 person can never be away from it. If he is he is already dead. Although
th=
e Upanishads say that the jiva functions through other centres on
different=
 occasions, yet he does not relinquish the Heart. The centres are
simply pl=
aces of business (vide Vedanta Chudamani). The Self is bound to the
Heart, =
like a cow tethered to a peg. The movements are controlled by the
length of=
 the rope. All its wanderings centre around the peg. A caterpillar
crawls o=
n a blade of grass and when it has come to the end, it seeks another
suppor=
t. While doing so it holds on with its hind-legs to the blade of
grass, lif=
ts the body and sways to and fro before it can hold another.
Similarly it i=
s with the Self. It stays in the Heart and holds other centres
also accordi=
ng to circumstances. But its activities always centre round the
Heart.
