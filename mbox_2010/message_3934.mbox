Namaste Narasimha,
                  I have to 'disagree' with you here. T=
he fact is that the uttama Guru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In=
 the present times, there is a shortage of such people. There are fewer utt=
ama sishya and hence there is a shortage of uttama Gurus. 

Again it is not=
hing new to say that God must be the Guru. This is how it has been and will=
 be. Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there shou=
ld be no difference seen between them. In the same way, the sastra say that=
 the one who considers the physical being his Guru is not destined to succe=
ed. 

Even today if a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only =
the uttama sishya and not an adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one =
will always see a million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha=
. The fault is in the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in De=
vatha as well. The problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewe=
r/sadhaka who is still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumula=
ted results of sins acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are =
eternal and our own limited personalities are not. The 'dress' the Guru wea=
rs ( His/Her own limited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is a=
lso not permanent. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often mor=
e powerful than the Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of th=
e Guru. 

The very fact that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru =
lakshanam and sishya lakshanam is very revealing about how things have been=
 for the past few 1000 years at least.

The Guru as well as the devatha are=
 never external.                Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of t=
his fact. 

People are led by their own karma to false Gurus. There is litt=
le need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as many peop=
le are wont to). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating wife and=
 believing that all husbands or wives are like that.

There were very clear=
 indications about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the par=
ticular aspect of having been unable to over come his human weakness) being=
 not a fit Guru. 

IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or p=
eople could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter curre=
nt even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.

My apologies if I =
have spoken any nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obviou=
s in  many different ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I d=
o not say 'dont do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever'; but=
 I do not agree with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a g=
ood Guru will understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and a=
ll nonsense that of my limited ago.


Regards,


S

in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru =

as Rajarshi wisely said.
