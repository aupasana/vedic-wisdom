      Namaste,

Well, our shastras do not define a religio=
n called "Hinduism". Our shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial pa=
th of righteous duty. Sanatana dharma is not an exclusive property of peopl=
e born to "Hindu" parents. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and =
encompasses every human being whether or not one realizes it!

Some people =
who consider themselves Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.

Th=
ere may not be much difference between somebody from another religion with =
a strong interest in "Hinduism" and somebody born to Hindu parents but havi=
ng either passive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings =
of rishis. In fact, the former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma =
than the latter in some cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to=
 "Hinduism", there is no need to convert the former
 either!

Several cerem=
onies like naamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dhar=
mik matters.

In my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mant=
ra (any) by a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of t=
ime, and if he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc)=
 and asked to read it, understand it and let it affect one's thinking, I th=
ink one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanata=
na dharma. There is no need for any ceremonies.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In fact, =
now there are some "foreigners" who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganap=
athi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they are not "Hindus", one is not thin=
king straight. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India who have forg=
otten their dharma.

A braahmana's dharma is to pursue spiritual progress a=
nd engage the
 mind in the god for the benefit of the world. One who does n=
ot spend time in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a braah=
mana. If a foreigner is passionately interested in spiritual progress and d=
oes japam or homam every day or week for the benefit of the world and one's=
 own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also a=
 braahmana.

Best regards,
Narasimha
