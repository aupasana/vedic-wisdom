 WHEN I was in Tiruchendur in 1932 it came to my mind that I should regard
=
all women as my mother or Valli if I was intent on leading a spiritual
life=
. One
evening, I went to the Shrine of Sri Subramanya and stood for half an=
 hour
before the Moolavar (main deity) and the following words flashed into=
 my
consciousness: "Here I am a God who does not talk. Go to Tiruvannamalai=
;
Maharshi is a God who talks." This was how Maharshi's Grace manifested
it=
self to me. I had not even seen Maharshi then.

In December 1932, I wrote t=
o Ramanasramam and got the reply conveying
Bhagavan's upadesa that the body=
 is the result of prarabdha (accumulated
karma) and the joys and sorrows re=
lating to it are inevitable and they can
be borne easily if we put the burd=
en on God.

In 1933, one day, Vakil Sri Vaikuntam Venkatarama Iyer suddenly=
 spoke to me
about Maharshi and gave me a copy of Ramana Vijayam in Tamil. =
I read it and
when I came to the part when his mother was crying before him=
 to urge him to
return home I was choked with tears.

Then my mother made t=
he following inspired utterance."Malaiappan calls you;
go to him. This path=
 will result in the salvation of twenty-seven
generations of your family. T=
his is the upadesa (teaching) of Mother Truth.
Go along this path. Any obst=
acle you meet, regard as maya (illusion). You
will soon be liberated." So s=
aying, I was given upadesa of Mahavakyam and
Karana-Panchaksharam (Vedic tr=
uth of Brahman).

In February 1933, I wrote to the Ashram again and got a p=
rompt reply.
Bhagavan's upadesa given in it was as follows: "Sattvic food w=
ill keep the
mind clear and help meditation. This is the experience of sadh=
akas. Eat to
appease hunger and not to satisfy taste or craving; this will =
in due course
lead to the control of the senses. Then continued and concent=
rated
meditation will result in annihilation of desires." It is the Atman t=
hat
activates the mind and breath. Watching the breath will result in keval=
a
kumbakam (stopping of breath). Control of breath will lead to temporary
c=
ontrol of the mind and vice versa. Intense and constant japa (repetition of=

a sacred syllable) will lead to ajapa (non-repetition). Sound being subtle=
r
than form, japa is preferable to murti (image or form) or worship. Aham
B=
rahmasmi (I am Brahman ) is the best. To those who seek the source of the
`=
I' no other mantra or upasana (meditation) is needed."

Within a month afte=
r the receipt of this, I proceeded to Ramanasramam to
stay there permanentl=
y. One day I decided to spend the nights for one
mandala (cycle of 48 days)=
 in the presence of Bhagavan. On the 15th day I
had a dream: The attendant =
Madhavan had an epileptic attack and suddenly
grasped my hand. I cried for =
help to Bhagavan who pulled away Madhavan's
hand, and gave me milk to drink=
. When I woke up I still had the taste of the
milk in my mouth; I felt I ha=
d drunk the milk of wisdom. From then onward my
mind turned inwards.

One m=
orning while cutting vegetables, I wanted to do giri pradakshinam
(circumam=
bulation of the Hill) and asked Bhagavan's permission. Devotees
nearby made=
 signs pleading to Bhagavan not to let me go. Bhagavan said, "Is
pradakshin=
a a sankalpa (intention)? Let him go." I said, "No. I decided last
night to=
 go with somebody. That is all." Bhagavan, "Oh! You already made the
sankal=
pa. Sankalpa leads to samsara. Fulfil the sankalpa . You need not cut
veget=
ables." I took it as an upadesa (teaching) not to make sankalpas
thereafter=
.

Another morning when I was cutting vegetables with Bhagavan, he said:
"S=
undaram! Take this hurricane light and pick up the mangoes that have
fallen=
 from the tree." I said "Yes", but continued cutting up the
vegetables. Bha=
gavan said, "Sundaram! Attend to what `I' said first. It is
from me that ev=
erything rises. Attend to it first." I took this as an adesh
and upadesa (a=
dvice and instruction) to make the enquiry "Who am I?" My
friends also felt=
 so.

One day the attendant Madhavan was binding a book. A devotee wanted a=
 book
from the library. Bhagavan asked Madhavan to get it saying, "You do m=
y work;
I will do your work." And Bhagavan took the book and went on with t=
he
binding while Madhavan got the library book. A devotee interpreted this =
as
follows: "My work means looking after the needs which arise in the minds=
 of
devotees for anything from Bhagavan. Your work is to get liberation whi=
ch is
not possible without Bhagavan's Grace and help." Bhagavan heard this =
comment
and said "Hum Hum! That is what it is !"

Once when meditating in t=
he presence of Bhagavan, the mind persisted in
wandering. I couldn't contro=
l it. So I gave up meditation and opened my
eyes. Bhagavan at once sat up a=
nd said, "Oh! You abandon it thinking it is
the swabhava (nature) of the mi=
nd to wander. Whatever we practise becomes
the swabhava. If control is prac=
tised persistently that will become the
swabhava." Yet another upadesa for =
me.
