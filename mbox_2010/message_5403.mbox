20 Spiritual Instructions
by Sri Swami Sivananda

  [Swami Sivananda] These=
 twenty instructions contain the very essence of
all Yoga Sadhana. Karma, B=
hakti,         Jnana, and Raja Yoga will all
come to one who follows them w=
hole-heartedly. They         are the
unfailing keys to quick and effective =
development and culture of the
physical,         mental, moral and spiritua=
l self of man.

    1.            Brahmamuhurta
Get up at 4 a.m. daily. Thi=
s is Brahmamuhurta which is extremely
favourable for Sadhana. Do all       =
      your morning spiritual
Sadhana during this period from 4 a.m. to 6:30=
 or 7 a.m.            
Such Sadhana gives quick and maximum progress.

    =
2.            Asana
Sit on Padmasana (lotus pose), Siddhasana (adept's pose=
) or Sukhasana
(any pose you like) for             your Japa and meditation=
 for half an
hour, facing east or north. Increase the             period gr=
adually to
three hours. Practice Sirshasana (headstand) and Sarvangasana
(s=
houlderstand) for maintenance of health and Brahmacharya. Take light
physic=
al             exercises as walking, etc., regularly. Do twenty
rounds of e=
asy, comfortable             Pranayama (breathing exercises).
Do not strain=
 yourself while doing Pranayama.

    3.            Japa
You can repeat any=
 Mantra (sacred syllable), such as pure Om or Om Namo
Narayanaya, Sri      =
       Ram, Sita Ram, Sri Ram Jaya Ram Jaya Jaya
Ram, Om Namah Sivaya, Om N=
amo Bhagavate             Vasudevaya, Om
Saravanabhavaya Namah, Hari Om, or=
  Gayatri (a sacred             Vedic
Mantra), according to your taste or i=
nclination, from 108 times to
21,600             times daily. Devotees of C=
hrist may repeat the name
Jesus or Hail             Mary, Mother of Jesus. =
Parsis, Sikhs and
Muslims may select a name or Mantra             from the =
Zend Avesta,
Granth Sahib or Koran respectively.

    4.            DIETETI=
C DISCIPLINE
Take Sattvic food. Give up chillies, tamarind, garlic, onion, =
sour
articles, oil, mustard, asafoetida.             Observe moderation in
=
diet (Mitahara). Do not overload the stomach. Give up             those
thi=
ngs which the mind likes best for a fortnight once or twice in a
year.     =
        Eat simple food. Milk and fruits help concentration.
Take food as m=
edicine to             keep the life going. Eating for
enjoyment is a sin. =
Give up salt and sugar for             a week or a
fortnight. You must be a=
ble to live on rice, dhal and bread without
any pickle. Do not ask for extr=
a salt for dhal, and sugar for tea,
coffee and             milk. People tak=
ing a non-vegetaraian diet should
try their best to gradually             g=
ive up flesh-eating as
completely as possible. They will be immensely benef=
ited.

    5.            MEDITATION
Have a separate meditation room under l=
ock and key. If this is not
possible then a corner of             the room =
should be set apart with
a small cloth screen or curtain drawn across.     =
        Keep the room
spotlessly clean.

    6.            SVADHYAYA
  [Swa=
mi Sivananda at his desk] Study systematically the Gita, Ramayana,
Bhagavat=
am, Vishnu-Sahasranama, Lalita-Sahasranama, Adityahridaya,
Upanishads, Yoga=
 Vasishta, Bible, Imitation of Christ, Zend Quran, the
Tripitakas,         =
    the Granth Sahib and other religious books from
half an hour to one hou=
r             daily, and have Suddha Vichara
(pure thoughts).

    7.      =
      ELEVATE THE MIND
Learn by heart some prayer - Slokas (prayer verses),=
 Stotras (hymns) and
repeat them as soon as             you sit in the Asan=
a before starting
Japa or meditation. This will elevate the             min=
d quickly.

    8.            BRAHMACHARYA
Preserve the vital force (Veerya=
 (seminal energy)) very, very carefully.
Veerya is God in motion           =
  or manifestation (Vibhuti). Veerya
is all power. Veerya is all money. Vee=
rya             is the essence of
life, thought and intelligence. This inst=
ruction is not for            
bachelors only. Householders also must follo=
w it as far as possible.
They must             be extremely moderate in the=
ir marital connections
with their spouse. This is             very importan=
t.

    9.            CHARITY
Do charity regularly, every month, or even da=
ily according to your
means. Never fail in this item.             If necess=
ary forego some
personal wants but keep up this charity regularly.

   10. =
           HAVE SATSANG
Give up bad company, smoking, meat and alcoholic li=
quors entirely. Have
constant Satsang (association             with holy pe=
ople). Do not
develop any evil habits. Deliberately exert to develop       =
     
positive virtuous qualities.

   11.            FAST
Fast on Ekadasi =
(11th day of the Hindu lunar fortnight) or live on milk
and fruits only. Ch=
ristians             must fast on alternate Sundays,
Muslims on alternate F=
ridays, and Parsis on             a suitable day
every fortnight.

   12.  =
          JAPA MALA
Have a Japa Mala (rosary) around your neck or in your p=
ocket or
underneath your pillow at night.             This will remind you =
of
God. Twirl the beads during your leisure. You should             repeat
=
the Name at all times, whatever task you may be engaged in.

   13.        =
    OBSERVE MOUNA
Observe Mouna (vow of silence) for a couple of hours dail=
y. Do not make
gestures and inarticulate             noises during the peri=
od of
silence.

   14.            DISCIPLINE OF SPEECH
Speak the truth at a=
ll cost. Speak a little. Speak sweetly. Always utter
encouraging words.    =
         Never condemn, criticize or discourage.
Do not raise your voice an=
d shout at             little children or
subordinates.

   15.            =
BE CONTENT
Reduce your wants. If you have four shirts, reduce the number to=
 three
or two. Lead a happy, contented             life. Avoid unnecessary
=
worry. Be mentally detached. Have plain living and high            
thinkin=
g. Think of those who do not possess even one-tenth of what you
have.      =
       Share with others.

   16.            PRACTICE LOVE
Never hurt anybo=
dy. Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah (Non-injury is the highest
virtue). Control anger=
             by love, Kshama (forgiveness) and
Daya (compassion). Serve the=
 sick and the             poor with love and
affection. This is service of =
God.

   17.            BE SELF RELIANT
Do not depend upon servants. Self-r=
eliance is the highest of all
virtues.

   18.            HAVE SELF-ANALYSI=
S
Think of the mistakes you have committed during the course of the day,
ju=
st before retiring to bed             (self-analysis). Keep a daily
spiritu=
al diary and self-correction register as             Benjamin
Franklin did.=
 Maintain a daily routine and resolve-form. Do not brood
over past mistakes=
.

   19.            DO YOUR DUTY
Remember that death is awaiting you at ev=
ery moment. Never fail to
fulfil your duties. Have pure             conduct=
 (Sadachara).

   20.            REMEMBER GOD
Think of God as soon as you w=
ake up and just before you go to sleep, and
at all other times             =
whether engaged in any work or not.
Repeat His Name always. Surrender yours=
elf             completely to God
(Saranagati).


This is the essence of al=
l spiritual Sadhana. It will lead you to
liberation. All         these spir=
itual canons must be rigidly observed.
You must not give any leniency      =
   to the mind.
