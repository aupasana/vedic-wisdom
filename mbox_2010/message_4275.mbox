 to us, because we are a part of it, within
it. But the "fabric" itself, as=
 it were, is just quantum foam soup,
completely chaotic (well, technically =
stochastic) in apparent patterns,
fractals are an excellent way to understa=
nd what I'm getting at. They are
drawn from specific calculations in which =
pure randomness is introduced. And
yet each one "fits itself" into a patter=
n and repeats that pattern again and
again.

ot denouncing anything. Science has proven it's unreal. Yes, it
*may* lead =
to Tamas. However, to me it has lead to to Sattva (not that I'm
Sattvic, bu=
t I'm magnetically geared in that direction). To say "it is god's
will" mak=
es no sense to me, but that is the makeup of the karmas I am
working with. =
But to just adopt the scientific viewpoint "it's just quantum
soup, nothing=
 is real" and that's it, leads to Tamas and nihilism, IMO. It's
why I becam=
e drawn to Vedic thought, from atheism and before that a
conservative Catho=
lic upbringing. Long way to go, no?

Anyway, if Gita is where you find your Heart, the=
