Namaste,
=C2=A0
Karma is a cycle.
=C2=A0
If X was mad at Y and hit Y in las=
t life, that is a karma committed by X. In this birth, reborn Y will encoun=
ter a situation where he can be mad at reborn X and hit reborn X. If reborn=
 Y does it, it will be a payback for X's previous karma, FROM the perspecti=
ve of reborn X.
=C2=A0
However, it is a fresh karma from the perspective of=
 reborn Y, if reborn Y *identified* with that action, i.e. if the limited I=
-ness of reborn Y felt the emotions associated with that action and "engage=
d" in the action. If Y is a liberated being with no limited I-ness engaging=
 in actions non-volitionally, then no new karma is generated for Y.
=C2=A0
=
Until one overcomes attachment to a limited I-ness, all of one's actions ge=
nerate new karmas.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

      Narasimha Ji



I have just finished reading =
the third book " the law of karma " by Aghori Vimalananda . It is no doubt =
as you said written by a great being . Vimalananda in his book mentions thr=
ee karmas which cannot be easily gotten rid of and are very terrible by nat=
ure and might take an immense amount of lifetimes to even clear.



The two=
 I remember are Killing of one's guru and rape . 



Now the doubt that has=
 arisen in my mind is this



1.How do we know whether a thing that is happ=
ening now is an reaction to an past action or a fresh action being set fort=
h in this lifetime...



The learned gurujan's on the board might question =
..Is there really a use by knowing that since either way the action is taki=
ng place and cannot be stopped.



The reason I ask this is  ...the mother =
goddess is described as



" Ati Soumyati Roudrayai Nathastasyai namo namah=
 "



She is the most pleasing among beautiful things and the most ferociou=
s among terrible things ...There is no relative scale of good or bad for na=
ture ( Ramarkrishna' s parable of Devi Kali bringing up a child and killing=
 it ) ....I fully understand good or bad exists only in the human mind.



=
But if a certain act right now is not happening as a reaction to a past act=
... What on earth can possibly cause a person to do such a severe act.  


=

:( And how should one console a person who has undergone such a punishment=
.. ..



One more reason for me asking this is ...A lot of great gurus have=
 always said " Whatever happening in the world right now is Mangala and the=
 very form of Shiva himself "



How can I reconcile such acts of violence =
happening in this kali yuga as Mangala especially some of the henious acts =
....which brings back my original question...Are these happening more in nu=
mber in kali yuga as a reaction of the souls who needed this punishment bei=
ng born in greater numbers now...or are these a fresh set of acts.



I do =
not know whether my questions would make sense. If you could answer them wo=
uld help me in clearing some confusion.



Pranams
