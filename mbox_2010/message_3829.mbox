 Give thousands of lectures, you cannot do anything with worldly men. Can
you drive a nail into a stone wall? The head will be broken without making
any impression on the wall. Strike the back of an alligator with a sword, it
will receive no impression.

A calf cannot stand on its legs all at once. It falls down, gets up, falls
again, and then it learns to stand and run. You do not know who is a Bhakta
(godly) and who is worldly; but that is not your fault. When a heavy storm
blows, one cannot distinguish Tamarind from Mangotree. It is true, however,
that no one can absolutely renounce all works without realizing God.

The question is, how long should Sandhya (rituals) and other ceremonial
works be practised? So long as the Holy Name of the Lord does not bring
tears of love to the eyes and produce horripilation in the body.
