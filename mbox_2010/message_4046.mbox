Reposting to get some attention... Excuse me please..

Dear Narasimhagaru a=
nd others,

1. Are there any invocatory Mantras (like prana pratishtapana m=
antra and the
beejakasharas that we do for Ganapathi and specific other Dev=
ata forms in those
specific homas) for Gayatri Devi? Or can we take it from=
 the Sandhyavandanam
procedure, like Gayatri Avahana, karanyasa and anganya=
sa, dhyana sloka etc. and
complete the process? ) If the there is a specifi=
c procedure, would it possible
for you to upload a manual for the same?

2.=
 Similary for Lord Subrahmanya swamy, I would like to know if there is a
sp=
ecific homam that we could do!

Thank you,

Nagraj
