 B. V. NARASIMHA SWAMI wrote the first detailed English biography of the
Ma=
harshi in 1931, and Suddhananda Bharati wrote the Tamil biography. Ramana
L=
eela. The Telugu Biography written by Oruganti Krishnayya has the
distincti=
on of being corrected twice by the Maharshi prior to it being
reprinted. It=
 is not only the most objectively-correct biography, it is also
the most ex=
tensive.

Dr. Lingeswara Rao of Andhra Pradesh, carefully read through Rama=
na Leela
and noted down passages not found in English publications. Below, =
we
reproduce some of his English translations.

The Maharshi's Father's eld=
er brother, Venkateswaram Ayyar, renounced at the
age of eighteen. He lived=
 at the Chidambaram Temple and worked clearing the
premises of thorns, etc.=


At birth, Bhagavan was given the name Venkateswaram Ayyar, which
correspo=
nded with the name of their family deity, Sri Venkateswara of
Tirumala. Lat=
er, when he registered for school, the name was changed to
Venkataraman.

B=
hagavan was called Ramana, or sometimes even Ramani by an elderly relative
=
named Lakshaman Ayyar, who was well-versed in Telugu. Bhagavan, as a boy,
l=
earned some Telugu and would converse with this relative in that language.
=
Consequently, he began to call his father Nayana, the Telugu equivalent for=

'Daddy'.

The young Venkataraman and his brother Nagaswami were sent to th=
eir Uncle's
home in Dindigul so they could receive an education in English.=
 When their
Uncle was transferred to Madurai the two boys followed.

When B=
hagavan first arrived at the Arunachala Temple in Tiruvannamalai in
1896 it=
 was 6 a.m. The Temple was then being renovated and was not open to
visitor=
s until 8 a.m. But when Bhagavan arrived all the doors were open and
he wal=
ked straight to the inner sanctum without seeing anyone.

Bhagavan was init=
ially called Brahmana Paradesi. Mendicant sadhus were then
normally called =
Paradesis. When he was carried from the Patala Lingam to the
Subrahmanya Te=
mple and was under the care of Mouna Swami, his greatness was
then realized=
. Then his name was changed to Brahmana Swami.

Nelliapa Ayyar (Bhagavan's =
Uncle) failed to persuade Bhagavan to return to
Madurai. One Narayana Swami=
 Ayyar [Sri P. V. Somasundaram's Father], who
accompanied Nelliapa Ayyar, b=
ecame annoyed and approached the young Swami
with the intention of taking h=
im by force. Suddenly he felt a burning
sensation all over his body and, be=
cause of it, gave up the idea.

One night in the year 1934 someone asked Bh=
agavan: "Do you have dreams?"

Bhagavan: "Doesn't one dream in sleep?"

Que=
stioner: "Did you ever have seminal discharges during sleep, or in
dreams."=


Everyone present felt disgusted at the question, but Bhagavan without the=

slightest sign of annoyance, calmly replied: "Yes. What of that ? It may
h=
appen even if one eats hot foods. How does it matter? You are thinking I am=

this body. Hence the wrong understanding that if one loses the essential
f=
luid of the body, one shall fall from brahmacharya and tapas. It occurs to
=
me that I am living simultaneously in twenty different worlds with diverse
=
bodies. How can I worry over such losses or biological changes in all these=

body parts. The essence is not the body and its various metamorphosis but
=
Atma Gnana Nishta, the abidance in Self-Knowledge. We are the
Ever-Changele=
ss.
