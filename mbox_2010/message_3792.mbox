Namaste,
 
Utpal is correct. Extinguishing fire by puring water or milk or =
yogurt is a very bad idea. Let fire go off by itself.
 
It is possible to d=
o it in such a way that all the materials (including wood) burn completely =
just in time for poornaahuti and poornaahuti coconut burns for 15-20 min an=
d then fire goes off by itself. With practice, one can know how much fuel i=
s needed for that. Whether and how frequently you turn over the wood logs a=
nd how much ghee you put decides how long wood burns. With practice, one ca=
n pace things such that all the wood burns by the time one finishes and fir=
e goes off by itself.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Namaste Shreya,

  Narasimha says that it's not proper to extinguish the =
Agni forcefully once the Homa is over but one should let the Agni get extin=
