PRANAM GURUJAN

Recently I got noticed about "Dimethylt=
ryptamine " drug as well as the topics of near-death-experien ce, though I =
personally believe the life after death through some incidents of telepathy=
. Some of my family members (gurujans) absolutely dedicated to sadhana, and=
 hear some stories from them, but I don't have any personal experience.. .
=

Those Gurujis, who have some experience atleast, please guide for somethin=
g spiritual experience, I know having this experience is not the goal, but =
somethimes mind seeks atleast one...

I can remember two experience of mine=
, but not entirely sure about that...

1. there is a dream like vision duri=
ng meditation when performing daily-ganapati- homam, but it could be the se=
cration of "Dimethyltryptamine " too...

2. normally I give money frequentl=
y to street beggars, but one day when I was busy at drinking from a street =
side food stall, a young(30 around! but i am not sure, its hard to guess) w=
oman ask for something to give, but just look and find she is young enough =
to earn, so I refused to give. After that I suddenly remember the stories o=
f Rajarshi, P.V.R Ji during their tours with Manish, and then try to find h=
er again, but she just vanished within merely 30 seconds...I haven't see he=
r before or after that incident...but I am sure too with this incident...

=
Gurujis, please guide, help.

Pranam again,
Biswajit
