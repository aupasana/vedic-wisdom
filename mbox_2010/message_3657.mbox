 "Where could I go? I am here."

The following string of reminiscences were=
 collected from devotees who had
the rare good fortune of coming under the =
benign glance of the Master.

The unique manifestation of Divine Grace on e=
arth known and loved by us as
Bhagavan Sri Ramana receded into its Reality =
as night set in on Friday,
April 14th, 1950.The very moment that Bhagavan e=
ntered into Maha-Nirvana, at
8:47 that night, the skies announced the great=
 event with a long, slow trail
of light.

Bhagavan Ramana moved with us, as=
 one of us, though he had, even as a lad of
17, found his Unity with the Re=
ality underlying all appearance and had
remained ever since as that resplen=
dent Pure Consciousness, the Self. Though
he never left Arunachala after hi=
s first arrival there, the power of his
Light spread silently through the w=
orld during the half century and more of
his stay there. Many earnest seeke=
rs approached him and some found spiritual
illumination in his presence. Hi=
s mode of life was natural, his ways were
gracious, his smile brought peace=
 to the heart. His look was an initiation
into Divine Mystery; his teaching=
 was simple, direct and profound, based on
man's natural experience of I-ne=
ss. He directed all to seek and find for
themselves the Source of the ego, =
the Reality behind their individuality,
from which all thoughts and actions=
 proceed.His luminous abidance in the
Self was itself a teaching conveyed f=
rom heart to heart in silence. As all
his actions were waves from the Light=
 within, the grace of which attracted
and uplifted all who came in contact =
with him.

Rajapalayam Ramani Ammal

I was at Rajapalayam at the time of Bh=
agavan's Mahanirvana. That night, I
saw a beautiful blue light going up in =
the sky and I knew Bhagavan had left
the body. I did not want to live after=
 that and so I started fasting, hoping
to drop the body that way. For five =
or six days, I did not touch food. But
during that time, I had several visi=
ons, and in one of them, I was taken
inside a cave on the Hill and saw Rish=
is performing Yagnas. Sri Bhagavan was
seated there. Bhagavan said, "Why ar=
e you crying? You say that I have gone
away, but where have I gone? I am he=
re." Some Rishis brought some Prasad to
Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan took some an=
d gave it to me. I could not remember in
the dream that I was fasting. For =
five days afterwards, the smell of that
Prasad was with me. Now was that a =
dream or reality? I consider it to be
Bhagavan's Grace.

The aroma of that =
Prasad even spread around my house. My brother wondered
what I had eaten. T=
hat aroma was simply out-of-the-world. The morning after
the dream, I start=
ed taking food and coffee. My brother and sister were also
fasting with me,=
 deciding to give up their bodies if I were to give up mine.
In the dream, =
Bhagavan was seated near a tank and Kamadhenu (the celestial
cow) was near =
him. Rishis and Munis were serving him. Bhagavan was looking
splendid, like=
 Lord Siva. It was a divine sight indeed. The smell of the
Prasad remained =
for five days. How can I take it to be a dream? From that
day onwards I had=
 no thought at all that Bhagavan had left us. He is all
pervading. I felt n=
o more sorrow in my heart. He is here too. See how we all
are gathered here=
. What have we done to deserve this?2

Major Chadwick

On the last night, B=
hagavan was lying in the small room which had originally
been built as a st=
oreroom when he had moved into the big hall. We were all
seated along the v=
erandah of the temple opposite. Our only view of the room
was through a sma=
ll ventilator window about six feet from the ground.
Naturally, seated as w=
e were on the ground, we had no view of the interior
of the room where he l=
ay; all we could see was the constant movement of a
fan backwards and forwa=
rds. This fan was anxiously watched by everybody, for
when it stopped we wo=
uld know that the end had come.

The Ashram authorities were afraid that th=
ere might be some trouble from the
waiting crowds, as a certain clique had =
arranged, if possible, to remove the
body and bury it outside the Ashram. I=
t would have been quite impossible to
do this. There were lots of police ab=
out and the majority of opinion was
naturally against such a scandal. Howev=
er the powers were scared. For this
reason about an hour before the end the=
 D.M.O., who was present, was
prompted by the Manager to come out and annou=
nce that there was no immediate
danger of anything happening that night. It=
 was a scandalous thing to do.
Naturally many of the people went home for t=
heir evening meal and so missed
the last moments.

There were some American=
 reporters and photographers, who were there just
out for a scoop. They wer=
e living less than half a mile away. One of them
standing outside the house=
 suddenly looked up and saw very bright star or
meteor move slowly across t=
he sky towards the North over the top of the
Hill. He called out to the res=
t of the party, who ran out and saw the same
phenomenon. One and all agreed=
 that something had happened to Bhagavan. Even
though they were without spe=
cial faith in him, by some intuition they were
certain that this must have =
been the case. It happened exactly at the time
of the passing (8:47 p. m. o=
n April l4th, 1950) and was seen by many people,
all of whom strangely enou=
gh, associated it with the same thing. People in
Madras also saw it and som=
e got into their cars immediately and made their
way to the Ashram. This is=
 a fact which I will not attempt to explain, but
must accept it as it happe=
ned.

"Go! Where can I go? I shall always be here."

The power of Sri Raman=
a, who gave up his physical form has not diminished.
He is everywhere, like=
 the light in a room shed by an electric bulb. But the
light is found to be=
 far stronger near the bulb, the source of light, than
in any other part of=
 the room, though no spot is in darkness. What wonder,
then, if the power o=
f our Guru is found near the place where his body is
interred?

Attendant K=
rishnaswami

Bhagavan gave several indications that he wanted no treatment.=
One day he
threatened to drop his body by not eating anything. I pleaded wi=
th Bhagavan
that I would take care of all his bodily needs, and that he sho=
uld eat and
stay put inside that room. One day Bhagavan refused to drink wa=
ter, but the
next day he demanded huge amounts of water. I pleaded with him=
 to moderate
his intake of food and water. So many things like this happene=
d in those
last days.

Two days after he drank lots of water, the end was t=
o come. I was with him
on that day, too. In the afternoon, I gave him the e=
ssence of pomegranate,
which Bhagavan could swallow. At 5 o'clock in the ev=
ening Satyananda Swami
gave him orange juice, which was advised by the doct=
ors, but Bhagavan had
some difficulty swallowing it.

On the day of the Mah=
asamadhi, O.P. Ramaswami Reddiyar, the retired Chief
Minister, was attendin=
g to the affairs of the Ashram. A police officer came
to inquire about Bhag=
avan's condition on behalf of the District Police
Superintendent, who wante=
d to have Bhagavan's darshan. I told him to ask the
Sarvadhikari. They said=
 that only I would be able to give them the correct
picture. So I told them=
 that as far as I was concerned, I did not think
Bhagavan's body would last=
 beyond 10 O'clock in the night. So they sent word
to the District Police S=
uperintendent to come and see Bhagavan.

There was another problem. Devotee=
s wanted to have the darshan of their
Guru. I did not want to incur their a=
nger by denying them one last darshan
of their Guru. I requested them to co=
me in a queue and not put any questions
or expect any words of wisdom from =
Bhagavan. Darshan continued till 5
p.m.devotees came in large numbers, and =
although police kept the line moving
fast, they went back and stood in line=
 again, weeping and crying. It was a
sight that moved me very deeply.

Seei=
ng the difficulty that Bhagavan was experiencing, I drew a screen across
an=
d didn't allow any more darshan. O. P. Ramaswani Reddiyar came, and I told
=
him that he could come in, but he declined. Seeing how much Bhagavan's body=

was suffering, O. P. Reddiyar requested the devotees to sing
"Aksharamanam=
alai." He did this because Bhagavan's body was suffering and he
didn't want=
 anybody to notice it.

Bhagavan had told me that a Jnani does not mind how=
 his body is dropped, for
the body idea has already died. It was only for t=
he naked eye that Bhagavan
was suffering. In reality there was no suffering=
 since Bhagavan had no
dehatma buddhi (I-am-the-body idea). Lots of pillows=
 were placed to prop up
his head and He was sitting with his legs stretched=
. Suddenly, Bhagavan
asked me to seat him in padmasana pose, and in that po=
se the last breath
went out of him, and he became still.

When Bhagavan dro=
pped the body, I was holding the head, and Subramanian was
standing next to=
 me. I was looking at Bhagavan's face, and when the lower
jaw dropped, I kn=
ew that he had left the body. The women outside sensed it
somehow and, beat=
ing their breasts, tried to come inside and have one last
darshan. But the =
police prevented it. I helped carry the body to the
Mandapam of the mother'=
s temple. My service to Bhagavan ended there.

S.S.Cohen

5th April: Yester=
day, Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the expert French
photographer, took a photo=
graph of Sri Bhagavan, which may prove to be the
last one of him.

Maharshi=
's health has remained more or less stationary since about a week.
His naus=
ea and scanty urination have not been persistent, yet there has been
no imp=
rovement in his general condition, which continues to prevent his
coming ou=
t for darshan.

Yesterday morning, His Excellency the Governor of Madras, t=
he Maharaja of
Bhavanagar, and his wife had Sri Bhagavan's darshan in the s=
mall room, then
worshipped in the Ashram's temple, inquired after the two w=
hite peacocks
they had presented some weeks back and left.

6th April, 1950=
: Symptoms of definite toxaemia have set in Maharshi's body.
For the whole =
day his urinary secretion did not exceed one ounce.... Doctors
gently argue=
 with him that scanty urination can be relieved only by an
increased intake=
 of fruit juice and water. 'And if I can't take?' he would
answer, and ther=
e the matter must end. He leaves his body to manage its
health or diseases =
as best it can, without the slightest effort of
cooperation on his part. Hi=
s mind is ever sunk in bliss. It is true that his
body is suffering, but th=
at is no reason why he should disturb his mind to
oblige it. If it dies, we=
ll and good; if it remains, so much the worse for
it: it is the business of=
 Him who made it to keep or take it away and do all
the worrying-it is none=
 of his own business to interfere and inconvenience
himself on its behalf.
=

13th April, 1950: Tamil New Year, 2 p.m., Morning observations : Maharshi'=
s
diastole climbed up to 46, but the systole remained stationary at 68, pul=
se
94, temperature 98.4 (normal! what an irony!), breathing 22 per minute.
=

Morning darshan ran for half an hour, during which Maharshi's eyes remaine=
d
closed and when he occasionally opened them, they looked in front rather
=
than to the left where the devotees were filing past him. His diet consists=

now of only buttermilk.

10 p.m.: Owing to the very heavy attendance of vi=
sitors from all over the
South, nearly 1500, the evening darshan had to be =
lengthened to 45 minutes.

Many devotees remained till late in the evening =
to receive the final medical
oral report for the day. At 9:30, Dr. Krishnam=
urti, a local physician and a
great devotee, walked up to me and said: 'My =
own impression is that there is
no immediate danger. Bhagavan has just told=
 the attendants to go to sleep as
he himself was going to do. His breathing=
 is not laboured, and there is no
gasping in evidence.'

Friday, 14th April=
: Maharshi is in a very precarious condition. The whole
morning has been sp=
ent by devotees in hushed gloom and with bated breath.
After evening darsha=
n, the unanimous verdict is that it is positively the
last. The Master is n=
ow propped on large pillows, almost in a sitting
posture, the head resting =
backward with open mouth, and two attendants
briskly fanning him, to enable=
 him to breathe freely-the battle for air, has
thus started. At 7 p.m., oxy=
gen is administered to him for about five
minutes, but seeing that it gave =
him no relief, he feebly asked that it
should be stopped.

The situation wa=
s tense: about five-hundred devotees were outside in sad
expectation of the=
 solemn last moment. Blood relations, Ashram workers, a
few old disciples, =
and some new aspirants went in by turn to have a last
sight of him. When th=
e end was known to be approaching, the whole
congregation with one voice st=
arted chanting the Tamil hymns he had many
years ago composed in praise of =
Lord Arunachala: "Arunachala Shiva,
Arunachala Shiva, Arunachala!" till it =
came at about 8:47. Many devotees,
grief-stricken and beating their breasts=
, lost control of their feelings and
rushed en masse to the small room wher=
e the sacred body lay, but police
officers immediately cordoned off the are=
a till it was brought out and
placed in the centre of the big darshan hall =
in yoga asana for all the
people to pay their last respects to it. The news=
 spread like wildfire to
the town and the neighboring villages and drew hug=
e crowds. By 9:15, the
crowd grew so thick, that it became necessary to giv=
e a chance to all to pay
their homage and pass the body in an orderly manne=
r. A queue was thus
formed- seven to ten broad-at a quick-march pace. It is=
 still (11:55 p.m.)
continuing unabatingly.

Around the sofa sat dozens of =
disciples, some chanting Maharshi's verses and
other devotional hymns, but =
others remained in silent contemplation.
Sandalwood paste and jasmine flowe=
rs now cover the body and incense burns by
its side.

At about 9 p.m.,Monsi=
eur Cartier-Brassen, the French photographer, who has
been here for about a=
 fortnight with his wife, related an experience of his
to me. "It is a most=
 astonishing experience," he said. "I was in the open
space in front of my =
house, when my friends drew my attention to the sky,
where I saw a vividly-=
luminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike
any shooting star I had=
 before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly
across the sky and, reac=
hing the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it.
Because of its singulari=
ty we all guessed its import and immediately looked
at our watches - it was=
 8:47 - and then raced to the Ashram only to find
that our premonition had =
been only too sadly true: the Master had passed
into Mahanirvana at that ve=
ry minute." Several other devotees in the Ashram
and in the town later told=
 me that they too had seen the tell-tale meteor.

Chief Minister, was attending to the affairs of the Ashram. A police office=
r came to inquire about Bhagavan's condition on behalf of the District =
Police Superintendent, who wanted to have Bhagavan's darshan. I told hi=
m to ask the Sarvadhikari. They said that only I would be able to give them=
 the correct picture. So I told them that as far as I was concerned, I did =
not think Bhagavan's body would last beyond 10 O'clock in the night=
. So they sent word to the District Police Superintendent to come and see B=
hagavan.<br>

<br>There was another problem. Devotees wanted to have the da=
rshan of their Guru. I did not want to incur their anger by denying them on=
e last darshan of their Guru. I requested them to come in a queue and not p=
ut any questions or expect any words of wisdom from Bhagavan. Darshan conti=
nued till 5 p.m.devotees came in large numbers, and although police kept th=
e line moving fast, they went back and stood in line again, weeping and cry=
ing. It was a sight that moved me very deeply.<br>

<br>Seeing the difficul=
ty that Bhagavan was experiencing, I drew a screen across and didn't al=
low any more darshan. O. P. Ramaswani Reddiyar came, and I told him that he=
 could come in, but he declined. Seeing how much Bhagavan's body was su=
ffering, O. P. Reddiyar requested the devotees to sing "Aksharamanamal=
ai." He did this because Bhagavan's body was suffering and he didn=
't want anybody to notice it.<br>

<br>Bhagavan had told me that a Jnan=
i does not mind how his body is dropped, for the body idea has already died=
. It was only for the naked eye that Bhagavan was suffering. In reality the=
re was no suffering since Bhagavan had no dehatma buddhi (I-am-the-body ide=
a). Lots of pillows were placed to prop up his head and He was sitting with=
 his legs stretched. Suddenly, Bhagavan asked me to seat him in padmasana p=
ose, and in that pose the last breath went out of him, and he became still.=
<br>

<br>When Bhagavan dropped the body, I was holding the head, and Subra=
manian was standing next to me. I was looking at Bhagavan's face, and w=
hen the lower jaw dropped, I knew that he had left the body. The women outs=
ide sensed it somehow and, beating their breasts, tried to come inside and =
have one last darshan. But the police prevented it. I helped carry the body=
 to the Mandapam of the mother's temple. My service to Bhagavan ended t=
here.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">S.S.Cohen</span><br><br>5th=
 April: Yesterday, Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the expert French photographer=
, took a photograph of Sri Bhagavan, which may prove to be the last one of =
him.<br>

<br>Maharshi's health has remained more or less stationary si=
nce about a week. His nausea and scanty urination have not been persistent,=
 yet there has been no improvement in his general condition, which continue=
s to prevent his coming out for darshan.<br>

<br>Yesterday morning, His Ex=
cellency the Governor of Madras, the Maharaja of Bhavanagar, and his wife h=
ad Sri Bhagavan's darshan in the small room, then worshipped in the Ash=
ram's temple, inquired after the two white peacocks they had presented =
some weeks back and left.<br>

<br>6th April, 1950:=C2=A0<span style=3D"fon=
t-weight:bold">Symptoms of definite toxaemia have set in Maharshi's bod=
y. For the whole day his urinary secretion did not exceed one ounce.... Doc=
tors gently argue with him that scanty urination can be relieved only by an=
 increased intake of fruit juice and water. 'And if I can't take?&#=
39; he would answer, and there the matter must end. He leaves his body to m=
anage its health or diseases as best it can, without the slightest effort o=
f cooperation on his part. His mind is ever sunk in bliss.</span>=C2=A0It i=
s true that his body is suffering, but that is no reason why he should dist=
urb his mind to oblige it. If it dies, well and good; if it remains, so muc=
h the worse for it: it is the business of Him who made it to keep or take i=
t away and do all the worrying-it is none of his own business to interfere =
and inconvenience himself on its behalf.<br>

<br>13th April, 1950: Tamil N=
ew Year, 2 p.m., Morning observations : Maharshi's diastole climbed up =
to 46, but the systole remained stationary at 68, pulse 94, temperature 98.=
4 (normal! what an irony!), breathing 22 per minute.<br>

<br>Morning darsh=
an ran for half an hour, during which Maharshi's eyes remained closed a=
nd when he occasionally opened them, they looked in front rather than to th=
e left where the devotees were filing past him.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-we=
ight:bold">His diet consists now of only buttermilk.</span><br>

<br>10 p.m=
.: Owing to the very heavy attendance of visitors from all over the South, =
nearly 1500, the evening darshan had to be lengthened to 45 minutes.<br><br=
>Many devotees remained till late in the evening to receive the final medic=
al oral report for the day. At 9:30, Dr. Krishnamurti, a local physician an=
d a great devotee, walked up to me and said: 'My own impression is that=
 there is no immediate danger. Bhagavan has just told the attendants to go =
to sleep as he himself was going to do. His breathing is not laboured, and =
there is no gasping in evidence.'<br>

<br>Friday, 14th April: Maharshi=
 is in a very precarious condition. The whole morning has been spent by dev=
otees in hushed gloom and with bated breath. After evening darshan, the una=
nimous verdict is that it is positively the last. The Master is now propped=
 on large pillows, almost in a sitting posture, the head resting backward w=
ith open mouth, and two attendants briskly fanning him, to enable him to br=
eathe freely-the battle for air, has thus started.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font=
-weight:bold">At 7 p.m., oxygen is administered to him for about five minut=
es, but seeing that it gave him no relief, he feebly asked that it should b=
e stopped.</span><br>

<br>The situation was tense: about five-hundred devo=
tees were outside in sad expectation of the solemn last moment. Blood relat=
ions, Ashram workers, a few old disciples, and some new aspirants went in b=
y turn to have a last sight of him. When the end was known to be approachin=
g, the whole congregation with one voice started chanting the Tamil hymns h=
e had many years ago composed in praise of Lord Arunachala: "Arunachal=
a Shiva, Arunachala Shiva, Arunachala!" till it came at about 8:47. Ma=
ny devotees, grief-stricken and beating their breasts, lost control of thei=
r feelings and rushed en masse to the small room where the sacred body lay,=
 but police officers immediately cordoned off the area till it was brought =
out and placed in the centre of the big darshan hall in yoga asana for all =
the people to pay their last respects to it. The news spread like wildfire =
to the town and the neighboring villages and drew huge crowds. By 9:15, the=
 crowd grew so thick, that it became necessary to give a chance to all to p=
ay their homage and pass the body in an orderly manner. A queue was thus fo=
rmed- seven to ten broad-at a quick-march pace. It is still (11:55 p.m.) co=
ntinuing unabatingly.<br>

<br>Around the sofa sat dozens of disciples, som=
e chanting Maharshi's verses and other devotional hymns, but others rem=
ained in silent contemplation. Sandalwood paste and jasmine flowers now cov=
er the body and incense burns by its side.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-wei=
ght:bold">At about 9 p.m.,Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the French photographer=
, who has been here for about a fortnight with his wife, related an experie=
nce of his to me. "It is a most astonishing experience," he said.=
 "I was in the open space in front of my house, when my friends drew m=
y attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a=
 luminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from the=
 South, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, d=
isappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its import =
and immediately looked at our watches - it was 8:47 - and then raced to the=
 Ashram only to find that our premonition had been only too sadly true: the=
 Master had passed into Mahanirvana at that very minute." Several othe=
r devotees in the Ashram and in the town later told me that they too had se=
en the tell-tale meteor.</span><br>
