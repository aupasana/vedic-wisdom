Namaste All,
   Came across this interesting meeting elsewhere... With all =
the discussion going on fake gurus.. heres another view. 

"Once Sri Chandr=
asekhara Saraswati Swami of Kanchi Mutt (Sri Periyava) had camped in North =
India. The then Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, came to have His darsha=
n.

The Prime Minister of India placed a similar question in front of Sri P=
eriyava, "If you would pinpoint the persons who, in the name of spiritualit=
y, lead the people in a wrong way I will take action against them." Sri Per=
iyava laughed and said, "No! It should not be handled in this manner. Those=
 who approach such fake swamis will themselves, after a time, understand th=
eir standard of maturity."

Sri Periyava knew that this reply did not satis=
fy Smt. Indira Gandhi. Someone had offered a basket full of mangoes to Peri=
yava. It contained many unripe and a few ripe fruits. Many devotees waited =
outside for Sri Periyava's darshan. Sri Periyava instructed the attendants =
to bring a child from amongst these devotees. A child of about 5 years was =
brought to Him. Pointing to the basket Periyava smilingly said to the child=
, "Take whatever you want." After a search the child picked up a ripe fruit=
.

Sri Periyava pointed out to Smt.Indira Gandhi who was watching this, "Ju=
st as the way a child knows what is ripe and what is unripe, so too would t=
hose who go out in search of Truth recognize a true Mahan at some point of =
their life."

Thanks
Shashi

     I have to 'disagree' with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru a=
ppears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a sh=

hortage of uttama Gurus.

if a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya=

 the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. Th=

still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of si=

 indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting peopl=

a Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in comi=

 may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgur=
us of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the=
 hands of people.

Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to c=
ome, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God a=
