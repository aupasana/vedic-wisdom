How many times have you wished that there was a work at h=
ome opportunity
for an entry-level office job applicant? Do you daydream ab=
out the time
you would save each day if you didn't have to make that commut=
e to work?
Do you wish you didn't have to dress up to attend that lame morn=
ing
"pep talk" during your first cup of coffee?

 the times are changing. Many men and women
across the country have changed=
 career paths =96 and their lives, by
cashing in on the latest trend in the=
 travel and tourism industry =96
homeshoring. For reservation agents that w=
ork-at-home, the commute is
simply moving from one room to another to start=
 their day. It's
happening on a regular basis in the time (and sometimes ca=
sh) strapped
travel and tourism industry, and most of these companies provi=
de local
training before their employees take their virtual jobs home.
