Namaste,

What "Vedas" say is not really understood by most of us today. Ve=
das often do not really say what they people claim they do.

Not long ago, =
brahmin boys regularly performed fire rituals after their upanayanam. Tradi=
tion does not say that only married people should do fire rituals. It is ab=
solutely fine for a bachelor to worship god in fire.

But tradition does sa=
y that a married person who performs a fire ritual should do it accompanied=
 by wife. However, rishis have given exceptions. If wife is not interested,=
 one can do alone.

So I suggest continuing your fire rituals as a brahmach=
aari until marriage. After marriage, you can see whether you want to do it =
with your wife or do it alone.

Best regards,
Narasimha

      Shri Narasimha ji, and others wh=

I have read that the vedas say that only grihastas and up sho=
uld perform homams, yagnas, etc. Also I have read the same about agnihotra =
which I have been performing on and off for the past almost 2 years?



Sho=
uld I not do these practices if I desire to get married, should I wait unti=
l (if) I do to continue?



Please advise me on this as if I do get married=
 it may be soon enough to take a break if I must.



Thanks for your time
