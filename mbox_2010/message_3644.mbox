Sri Utpal (No Ji :) ),

I tend to agree with you that all the membe=

 what they are doing.
=C2=A0
In Bhagawadgita, Lord Sri Krishna tells that w=
hatever the noble says, ordinary mortals take them as gospel and whatever t=
he Noble does, the ordinary simply follow (i donot know the verse but just =
remember the translation done by sri ghantasala in telugu). Does that not b=

Dear KK,

Correction in my ear=
lier message =E2=80=93 It should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God'

A =
sincere suggestion from me- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. However=
, you are free to address me as you feel like and I'll happily accept it he=
nce forth.

I just came across Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He says (an=
d Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Bindin=
g to one) when one self-identifies with it.
Although, it may seem easy to u=
nderstand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve.=
 Nevertheless, it's an extremely important statement to answer our queries.=


Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterd=
ay is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day passed i=
n his life when he didn't do smoking except on the final day of his departu=
re from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occ=
asionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (an=
d I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts cro=
ssing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori u=
sed to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not t=
ry to do what he does.

Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answ=
er the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, th=
ese are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothi=
ng). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sain=
baba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget tha=
t they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual rea=
lization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. The=
ir individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In sh=
ort they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant =
to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke ciga=
r or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing=
. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of =
theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind their each a=
ction and
 moreover their self identification is missing from the action an=
d hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special pur=
pose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakrishna used to fr=
equently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from others.=
 He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anyth=
ing and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anythi=
ng without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food inta=
ke is extremely important.
If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west,=
 it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority o=
f us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be =
removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can=
 be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their =
habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possibl=
e at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with th=
e `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have shower=
ed his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's po=
ssible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inco=
nsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Natu=
re know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA =
while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the=
 boy, after some
 years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami=
 immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested swami t=
o accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that =
he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cu=
p as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and aft=
er 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which =
literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.

Swami V=
ivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.

So moral of my whole wr=
itings is that it's unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the =
unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, G=
ajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify=
 our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.

Best Regards,

Utpal
