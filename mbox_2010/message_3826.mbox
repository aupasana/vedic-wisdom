I live in US. Few months back I gave birth to a 8 month old stillborn baby.=
 I plan to take the ashes to India soon but meanwhile since its only 8 mont=
h old I was wondering if we can perform the last rites by ourselves? If yes=
 then how? 
The ashes is still in the crematorium. If we bring it home can =
you let me know the do's and don't as to how to keep it and where to keep i=
t and anything else I need to know with respect to ashes. 

Thanks and rega=
rds,
PRM
