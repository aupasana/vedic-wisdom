Dear Shri.Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
1."Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals ..=
........ "
=C2=A0
I was not referring to the article of Frits Staal, but th=
e book written by him called "Agni",Please go through it if you get a chanc=
e. It is a description in great detail how a yajna is conducted. 
=C2=A0
2.=
"Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During his last days, he once c=
alled one of his disciples and mentioned that the interpretation of Vedas d=
one by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his opinion, not upto the ma=
rk. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas really are."
=C2=A0
This=
 is found in The Complete Works Of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 8.
MAN MAKER O=
F HIS DESTINY
By Swami Vivekananda
There was a very powerful dynasty in Sou=
thern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent=
 men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In =
this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them af=
terwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, =
until they found certain agreements; these were generalized, recorded, and =
made into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers =
lived and had this book in their possession. It seems possible that this is=
 how astrology came into existence. Excessive attention to the minutiae of =
astrology is one of the superstitious which has hurt the HINDUS very much. =

=C2=A0
I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the =
Hindus the science of astronomy and carried it back with them to Europe. Be=
cause in India you will find old altars, made according to a certain geomet=
rical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in when c=
ertain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, a=
nd the Hindus gave them astronomy. 
=C2=A0
Do you also agree to this ?
=C2=

When assumes the role of scholar/guru he is under compulsion to pass ju=
dgement over every issue and answer every question asked, irresepective of =
whether he knows about them or not.

God bless you.

Namaste,
=C2=A0

Welcome to this forum. I would like to mak=
e a few brief points regarding some of your ideas as mentioned below.
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to =
get a insight into the importance of these steps.
=C2=A0
Pardon me for bein=
g rude, but Frits Staals understanding of the vedic=C2=A0ritual is naive at=
 best and criminally incorrect at worst. He had written a huge, lengthy art=
icle on why and how mantras are nothing but sounds of birds and bees which =
were aped by ancient people, and they are supposed to have neither meaning =
nor sense! A person with such a shallow understanding of the spiritual esse=
nce of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be expected to=C2=A0recognize=C2=A0the spiri=
tual essence=C2=A0and depth of "Agni". Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is no=
t a book of rituals/history/ or even dharma, but probably a testimony of th=
e various spiritual realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in=
 coded/allegorical verses. A
=C2=A0
Swami Vivekananda was self-realized sai=
nt. During his last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned=
 that the interpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others we=
re, in his opinion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what=
 the Vedas really are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the=
 verses and in future, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a more hol=
istic and deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coi=
ncidence that Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada =
instructed him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobin=
do came up with a=C2=A0new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns=
 of Agni.
=C2=A0
21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in=
 its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty he=
lp to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.
=C2=A0
There are different homam proc=
eudures followed by different paramparas in different parts of India. I am =
sure none of them is incorrect. The final=C2=A0judge of the success of any =
sustained sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer=
 himself. If the sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=A0etc=
 etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0It is n=
ot the number of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the int=
ernal transformations that you experience which are crucial. There are peop=
le who follow a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals a=
nd yet never experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no trans=
formations. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical=
 science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not =
is bad. In this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical=
, doable sadhanas, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to
 transform an in=
dividual. Many have experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0future=
. And all this has been possible only because the Divine Mother wants it so=
.

Dear Members,

At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guidi=
ng me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a for=
ward from Jyotishwritings on "efficacy of remedies". I humbly agree that jH=
ora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.

I have gone throug=
h the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam bei=
ng performed and have the following observations to make.

1. As per rules =
laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for var=
ious rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamas=
a (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).

2. All steps in darsapoornamasa s=
hould be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka =
form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential a=
nd which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborate=
d by acharyas.

3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutr=
as such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no o=
missions.

4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. b=
ecome worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right p=
rocedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "=
fire ritual" as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Fr=
its Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.

5. The proc=
edure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=
e deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=
ures. 

6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a =
particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under =
the bottom of the prceeding ones.

7. The direction for sprinkling water (m=
antra parishkekam) with the mantra "deva savita prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown t=
o be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for p=
itru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE cor=
ner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).

8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladle=
s used in the vessel above darbha is missing.

9.Prokshanee samskaram and p=
rokshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.

10. Patra samskaram=
 or purifying the utensils is missing.

11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avah=
anam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta wit=
h darbha) is missing.

12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is m=
issing.

13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam=
 of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.

14. Darvee samskaram or pur=
ification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to b=
e used (sruksruvou) .

15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing=
.

16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni =
iis missing.

17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the lad=
le in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity=
 of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.

=
and many more ............

18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure t=
he deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he ac=
ts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of d=
eity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular=
 deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary=
)

18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and th=
e agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is con=
verted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata ai=
kya ahutis.

19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the m=
antra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They =
don't involve veda mantras so that you don't have to struggle to get the ri=
ght pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadh=
akas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom =
homam for any devata.

20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fon=
da work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an =
able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.

21. I sugg=
est that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids ma=
y not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge un=
corrupted.
