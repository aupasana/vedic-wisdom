I understand how you feel about the anti-Shankara tirade. I wil=
l tolerate different views, as long as they are expressed in a scholarly fa=
shion and in a calm tone. But, do consider not leaving. You can just ignore=
 the person whose writings you find offensive. It is fine if you want to ar=
gue with him also. My only constraint is to engage in a scholarly way and a=
s impersonally and coolly as possible (e.g. see Ajit Krishnan's mails).

I have in fact not seen any "logic" - I have only see=
n "views" of a strongly opinionated person.
 
Even when Lord Krishna roamed=
 earth, there were people who took pleasure in condemning him. Then, what t=
o say of Shankara thousands of years after he left earth?

You are absolutely correct. He is the most prolifi=
c and significant scholar and spiritual writer of Kali yuga so far, though =
there may be some who disagree with his philosophy. He commented on a cruci=
al body of scriptures. He wrote many brilliantly composed prayers. He estab=
lished mutts which are still giving rise to great scholars and/or yogis. Th=
is is no ordinary man.
 
In fact, world badly needs somebody like him again=
. Just as a pholosophy that emphasized renunciation and de-emphasized actio=
n was about to take over the world at the time of Shankara, which Shankara =
put brakes on, similarly I see that a pholosophy that emphasizes action and=
 de-emphasizes renunciation is taking over the world now. Religious people =
see "enemies" in other religions or other sects in the same religion, but I=
 see materialism as a serious enemy for all religions at this point in hist=
ory. Placed on a high pedestal by rational thinking and vogue intellectuali=
sm, this materialism threatens to swallow all religions in the coming gener=
ations, unless we put brakes on it.

Computers, internet and connectivity=

I learnt Sanskrit when yo=
ung, when I was 9-11 years of age. By the age of 11, I had two BA degrees i=
n Sanskrit (Sanskrita Bhasha Kovida and Sanskrita Bhasha Visharada), one of=
 them with distinction (i.e. above 80% score). I could write intelligent co=
mmentary in Sanskrit on the works of Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bharavi etc. At 10, I=
 could compose poetry in classical Sanskrit metres like ancients did. When =
I saw new words, I could instinctively come up with the etymology and I was=
 always correct. I could understand various slokas and prayers fully the ve=
ry first time I read/heard them. Sanskrit was almost like a mother tongue t=
o me by the time I was 11. 
 
Now, I see children of this generation who ar=
e in 10-20 age group. I absolutely cannot see them amassing the kind of sch=
olarship I did when I was 9-11 years, though they are as smart as I was. Th=
ey are computer savvy, but they do not learn anything in depth. They are go=
od at context switching and multi-tasking, but they are bad at focusing on =
one thing and mastering it. They can work with ten windows on a computer or=
 five devices in front of them at the same time, but they have a problem fo=
cusing on one thing for a long time. Computers and technology are helpful, =
but they also distract them...
 
*        *        *
 
In any case, the key=
 to learning anything, especially Sanskrit, is discipline and focus. Comput=
ers can bring neither. All they can do is provide access to info. BTW, comp=
uters and internet today mix good knowledge with junk and present them toge=
ther. There is a lot of junk information out there!
 
Well-meaning but over=
zealous people, whose credentials can never be verified, can self-promote o=

Actually, lakSh does not mean objective. The w=
ord lakShya means objective. Without ya, lakSh only means "to notice, to ob=
serve, to perceive". Moreover, lakShmI comes from "lakShma[n]", which means=
 a mark or token or symbol, typically of excellence or something good. Laks=
hmi is the giver of tokens and symbols of excellence. Money, food, vehicles=
, kingdom, knowledge, bravery, children etc are all symbols/tokens/marks of=
 excellence and well-being. Lakshmi in her various forms (dhana lakShmI, dh=
aanya lakShmI, vaahana lakShmI, raajya lakShmI, vidyaa lakShmI, vikrama lak=
ShmI, santaana lakShmI etc) is the giver of these. THAT is the correct deri=
vation of the name lakShmI and not what you gave.
 
Because of your questio=
nable understanding that Lakshmi shows business and money and because of yo=
ur notions (conditioning) about the qualities a good businessman needs to h=
ave, you ended up coming up with a questionable etymology, where consonant =
"m" present in the word has been ignored and consonant "y" has been added.

> Why these rules are important - grammar is a boring subject - And if I =

It depends. I never found Sanskrit grammar boring and was alway=

 it.
 
However, I will not try to excite anybody here about grammar. Spirit=
ual sadhana is more exciting and far more useful.
 
*        *        *
 
I=
 am somehow reminded of a small story.
 
A couple of years back, we went to=
 New York city to drop off a senior Indian priest who visited us for a coup=
le of months, at the New York airport. As there was still time for the flig=
ht, we went to a small temple. A young priest was chanting Chandipath to an=
 audience of just one person in a nice voice. We were happy to hear it. The=
 senior priest who was with us was in a 3-year mouna vratam (vow of silence=
) then. BTW, he is about to finish the vratam and start talking again next =
month. Anyway, he wrote on a paper and asked us to tell him about our daily=
 Chandi homam. So we told him that I do a Chandi homam everyday. He asked i=
f I do the entire Saptashati. I said yes. He was surprised. To gauge my spe=
ed and judge how long it takes, he asked me to read a few verses. I was amu=
sed, but read a few verses. He complimented me saying my pronunciation was =
very good. The senior priest who was with us likes me very much and fondly =
calls me "guruji". He likes telling people good things about me, even in my=
 presence. He wrote on the paper asking other people with us to tell the yo=
ung priest about Guruji's (my) Sanskrit scholarship. So they told him I was=
 a Sanskrit scholar. That young priest asked me what I studied and kept get=
ting technical. I knew where it was going and kept answering tersely, tryin=
g to end it. Finally, he started discussing Sanskrit grammar. I was not rea=
lly interested. He was doing Chandipath before and then he got distracted i=
nto Sanskrit grammar! If he wanted to discuss (or just chant!) Chandipath o=
r discuss any spiritual matters, I would've loved to spend some time with h=
im. If he wanted to leave those and discuss grammar instead, I had no inter=
est. Moreover, it was clear to me that he did not have any questions per se=
 or any useful information for me and he simply wanted to show off his own =
scholarship and getting into my scholarship was a license for him to show o=
ff his scholarship! What happened later was exactly along those lines.
 
Un=
comfortable as I was, one small thought came to me when the senior priest w=
rote something critical about the attitude of that young priest on our way =
out. It takes just a split second for Her to change a person and remove a w=
eakness, if and when She decides to do it! After all, I had been exactly li=
ke that, wanting to show off my scholarship and various abilities, not so l=
ong ago. Theoretical understanding of scriptures does not bring true dispas=
sion. Only when the scriptural knowledge is internalized and one experience=
s the transientness of maayaa first-hand, does one start to develop true di=
spassion. Even then, passion about this and that may return now and then. W=
hy deplore an unhealthy fancy of someone else, when we ourselves had that f=
ancy before and when we ourselves have various other fancies even now? Inst=
ead of feeling unhappy or disappointed, my mind was filled with compassion =
for that young priest as we came out.
 
My 2 cents of advice to anyone inte=
rested in it is: Scholarship is good, but put it to a positive use. Do not =
show off to impress someone or for an ego trip. Use it to remove confusion,=
 use it to stop someone from creating confusion, and use it when you feel t=
here is a chance of serving a productive purpose. Otherwise, it is better t=
o keep quiet. However, when someone else is showing off or being arrogant/e=
goistic, ignore as much as you can. Engage only when you are clear about wh=
y and how you are engaging.

Narasimha
