 Sanskrit and Grammar - and read Shankara - else put up a golden image of P=
eter Schreine that entered and translated the Saundarya Lahiri.And try to b=
rowbeat elderly people - And try to tell them they cannot tell their 70 yea=
r old wife - that she is the most beautiful thing on earth and the greatest=
 thing that happended in their lives when on so called death bed. And to fo=
rget the veda mantra and vows taken  for 7 lives.
