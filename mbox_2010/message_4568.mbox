Respected Learned Freinds,
What is the meaning of "Yag"? as appearing in sh=
alok 15 and 16 of Adhyay 3 of Srimad Bhagwat Gita. What is the difference b=
etween "Yag" and "Homan".
How we have to perform it? In my humble opinion i=
t is clearly mentioned in the above shaloka that the Supreme Brahm (Puran P=
armatma) is alway present in Yag. 
Your guidence in the matter will help me=
 understand to achieve higher level of 'Sadhana' of the Puran Parmatma.
You=
rs faithfully
Ganesh Gulati
