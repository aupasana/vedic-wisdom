Yes, even I think one has to follow Dharma. But again Dharma is personal.
O=
ne's Dharma gets refined by following detachment in actions.

------
Here i=
s a repost of PVRji on Dharma and Attachment:


As Vimalananda says, dharma=
 is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your ow=
n dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone
else's dharma".

Following the =
path of dharma basically means engaging in the right
action/duty. Right act=
ion varies from person to person, from time to time
and from place to place=
. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,
which in turn is based o=
n who you have been in the past, what actions you
did in the past while ide=
ntifying with the action, who you affected in the
past (and how) with the a=
ctions that you identified with, what debts you
created in the process, and=
 what mental tendencies you accumulated until
now.

If, based on one's ment=
al tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person
to kill evil persons,=
 that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental
tendencies and karmic=
 debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of
uniformity of all re=
ligions, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's
mental tendencies an=
d karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the
ritual of homam in the =
world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's
mental tendencies and =
karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of
money and construct a =
temple, that becomes one's dharma.

* * *

The dharma of a being may change=
 from one life to another.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's=
 dharma to kill his gurus,
elders and relatives. The time then was such tha=
t there was too much weight
on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved=
 of some weight. Tremendous
destruction was to take place and civilization =
destroyed to a great extent,
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. =
Arjuna being a great warrior,
it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some pe=
ople he deeply loved and
respected were on the other side and it was his dh=
arma to kill them.

When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century=
 as one of
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arju=
na in a
previous life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different =
in this
new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite h=
is
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire
g=
enerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to
oth=
ers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna
said),=
 his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.

* * *

The =
tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?

Some people =
have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharma
and not som=
eone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept
of caste (v=
arna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of
caste mobi=
lity was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by
killing birds. =
He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a
kshatrita and =
a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi
later. Basically v=
arna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna
of father, because=
 that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one
develops in life, one =
gets one's own varna based on what one does.

Thus, the misinterpretation o=
f Krishna's words which tells you to know your
dharma from your caste is wr=
ong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in
the world. Each person has i=
ndividual dharma.

Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult=
. If one is pure
enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us h=
ave a part of our
mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surround=
ed by a lot of
noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things.=
 Thus, we get
confused.

We should make the best judgment combining discrim=
ination and intuition and
decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely=
. We may be err, but doing
the best we can is all that we can do!

More tha=
n following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in
actions wi=
thout identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not
accumulating new=
 karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build
too much attachm=
ent to what we are doing. We should engage in the best
possible actions (ba=
sed on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given
situation is), wit=
h as little attachment and self-identification with the
action as possible.=
 When the action is finished, we should leave the result
to god. We should =
not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it
work" etc. Such adhe=
rence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through
untached action) will simp=
lify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.
As we become purer, our m=
ind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.
There is a positive feed=
back here. This will slowly enable us to see our
dharma clearly and follow =
it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,
but not as difficult as =
people think.

The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma=
, one's sense of
"this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages =
in action with
little attachment.

* * *

In deciding one's dharma, one's i=
ntellect and intuition are the inputs.
Another external input is the words =
of scriptures and learned men. One can
derive one's dharma from them. A spe=
cial place is given to one's spiritual
master. If one surrenders to a spiri=
tual master, one can take the words of
the master to determine one's dharma=
 and follow it sincerely.

When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma w=
as and thought killing gurus
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in=
 Krishna who clarified his
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) wa=
s confused about his dharma
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a se=
cluded place to do sadhana,
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upo=
n him to stay in the material
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One=
 who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one's
de=
bts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what
on=
e's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into
=
one's inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.

* * *

Bottomline=
 is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and
declare that=
 as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from
time to time=
 and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find
out what on=
e's dharma is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's
dharma by i=
ncreasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual
sadhana (lik=
e homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much
attachment, one ca=
n slowly purify oneself and refine one's understanding of
one's individual =
dharma.

<div dir=3D"ltr"><div><br></div><div>Yes, even I think one has to follow Dh=
arma. But again Dharma is personal. One's Dharma gets refined by follow=

s a repost of PVRji on Dharma and Attachment:</div>

<div><br></div><div><b=
r></div><div>As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Krishna clearl=
y says in<br>Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous t=
o follow someone<br>else's dharma".<br>
<br>
Following the path of=
 dharma basically means engaging in the right<br>action/duty. Right action =
varies from person to person, from time to time<br>and from place to place.=
 It is dependent on what nature expects from you,<br>

which in turn is bas=
ed on who you have been in the past, what actions you<br>did in the past wh=
ile identifying with the action, who you affected in the<br>past (and how) =
with the actions that you identified with, what debts you<br>

created in t=
he process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until<br>now.<br><br=
>If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a =
person<br>to kill evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on=
 one's mental<br>

tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person t=
o spread the message of<br>uniformity of all religions, that becomes one=
9;s dharma. If, based on one's<br>mental tendencies and karmic debts, n=
ature wants a person to spread the<br>

ritual of homam in the world, that =
becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's<br>mental tendencies and k=
armic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of<br>money and construct =
a temple, that becomes one's dharma.<br>

<br>* * *<br><br>The dharma o=
f a being may change from one life to another.<br><br>At the time of Mahabh=
arata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus,<br>elders and rela=
tives. The time then was such that there was too much weight<br>

on earth =
and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous<br>destru=
ction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent,<br>to=
 welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior,<b=
r>

it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and<b=
r>respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.<br><=
br>When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of<br>Ram=
akrishna Paramahamsa's sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a<br=
>

previous life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different in th=
is<br>new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his=
<br>aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire<=
br>

generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service =
to<br>others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrish=
na<br>said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.<=
br>

<br>* * *<br><br>The tricky question is: How does one decide what is o=
ne's dharma?<br><br>Some people have interpreted Krishna's words sa=
ying "follow your own dharma<br>and not someone else's dharma"=
; in the light of castism. Though the concept<br>

of caste (varna) has bee=
n there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of<br>caste mobility was v=
ery much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by<br>killing birds. He beca=
me a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a<br>

kshatrita and a =
powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi<br>later. Basically =
varna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna<br>of father,=
 because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one<br>

develops =
in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one does.<br><br>Thus, =
the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your<b=
r>dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas i=
n<br>

the world. Each person has individual dharma.<br><br>Knowing what on=
e's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure<br>enough, on=
e will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our<br>mi=
nd that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of<br>

=
noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get<b=
r>confused.<br><br>We should make the best judgment combining discriminatio=
n and intuition and<br>decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=
e may be err, but doing<br>

the best we can is all that we can do!<br><br>=
More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in<br=
>actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not<br>ac=
cumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build<br=
>

too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best<b=
r>possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the gi=
ven<br>situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification wit=
h the<br>

action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave=
 the result<br>to god. We should not think "I did it", "what=
 will happen now", "will it<br>work" etc. Such adherence of =
nishkama karma yoga (unfication through<br>

untached action) will simplify=
 our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.<br>As we become purer, our mi=
nd will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.<br>There is a positive fe=
edback here. This will slowly enable us to see our<br>

dharma clearly and =
follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,<br>but not as dif=
ficult as people think.<br><br>The bottomline is: Even if one is not follow=
ing one's dharma, one's sense of<br>"this is my dharma" g=
ets refined with time if one engages in action with<br>

little attachment.=
<br><br>* * *<br><br>In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and =
intuition are the inputs.<br>Another external input is the words of scriptu=
res and learned men. One can<br>derive one's dharma from them. A specia=
l place is given to one's spiritual<br>

master. If one surrenders to a=
 spiritual master, one can take the words of<br>the master to determine one=
's dharma and follow it sincerely.<br><br>When Arjuna was confused abou=
t what his dharma was and thought killing gurus<br>

and relatives was not =
dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his<br>dharma. When Narendra=

 and does not know who one is, what one's<br>debts are and what nature =

      <p>I agree with Dinesh. Only very ad=
vanced sadhakas will be able to identify rnas / karmic debts=A0and know how=
/where/why they are to be paid off. The rest of us have to follow dharma, w=
hich includes standing up for what is right and righteous and not being def=
eatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could have written off the wrongs o=
f the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course, Krishna urged him to take u=
p the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without mercy. The webs of karma are=
 too intricate and complex and delicate to be comprehended unless one has r=
eached certain very very high levels of spiritual attainment, and even then=
, it will only be a partial vision. Only S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i)=
=A0knows and sees the entire web of karma and knows best how to dispatch rn=
us as necessary. =A0<div>
