Namaste Narasimha, 
=C2=A0
Prarabdha karma is considered as fate or destiny=
. It is a portion of sanchita karma that has become "ripe" for experience i=
n current life.
What decides "which portion" of sanchita karma that one has=
 to experience in this life? 
Since different combinations=C2=A0are possibl=
e, how is this priority of X combination over Y decided?
=C2=A0
>The role y=
ou are given is your destiny and how you play it is your free will.
In exce=
ption cases like suicide, do we say that it's a destiny or it's a=C2=A0free=
 will used by an individual to run away from suffering?
The reason for aski=
ng this question is, usually it's possible to see suicidal tendencies in Jy=
otisha. If the indication of prarabdha karma is suicide, then should we con=
sider it as his karma for this life?
=C2=A0
Thanks & Regards,

Namaste,=


Everyone plays their allotted role. But the roles are not static. They ar=
e dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or modification or evolution from tim=
e to time (and life to life) based on how we play our allotted roles. 

The=
 role you are given is your destiny and how you play it is your free will. =
How you play your role now (free will) influences what role you are given i=
n future (destiny).

If the role given to you (e.g. Arjuna) is to kill your=
 guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot escape it. But you can either do it=
 with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or you can do it with a calm mind. If=
 the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom, you cannot e=
scape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule the kingdom with=
 a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role given to you (e=
.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji) in resisting=
 the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it. But you can either do it =
with an attached and agitated mind or a calm mind.

People in the examples =
I mentioned above engaged in what may seem like material actions, but they =
did them after overcoming attachments and with an equanimous mind.

As I ke=
ep saying, what you do is a secondary factor and how you do it is primary. =
Even as we engage in actions that we believe to be our dharma, we should wo=
rk on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has surrendered to god =
and is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and censure in the same wa=
y, then one's dharma will be far clearer to one. One whose mind is densely =
conditioned by duality and desires will see one's dharma through the colori=
ng of that conditioning and may misjudge. On the other hand, one with a cle=
ar mind with very little conditioning will see one's dharma clearer.

In si=
mpler words, one who heavily identifies with the body and wants comforts an=
d pleasures of the body will see one's dharma from that motivation. One may=
 identify with body, with a group of people, with a deity etc. As is the id=
entification, so is the conditioning and so is one's vision of one's dharma=
.

Though everyone is playing their allotted role, some have densely condit=
ioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearly and pursuing adharma. As=
 a result, they may continue to be allotted roles where densely conditioned=
 minds restrict their actions, in future.

Some have very clear minds and a=
ble to see their dharma clearly and pursuing higher dharma. As a result, th=
ey may continue to allotted roles where lighter and lighter mental conditio=
ning restricts them and eventually they become free.

One can try to use fr=
ee will to move from the former case to the latter case.

Best regards,
Nar=
asimha
