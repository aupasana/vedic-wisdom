Dear Members on this forum,
=C2=A0
I want to understand what is veg food a=
nd non veg food in real sense? If killing fish and eating it,=C2=A0can be t=
ermed as non veg food. What about eating green vegetables by cutting it and=
 cooking it? Both are living things. Both are killed and used for food. I h=
ave also heard people saying that cows milk are=C2=A0non veg item and eggs =
are=C2=A0vegetarian food.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
We all are different in terms of ou=
r birth, community, intelligence, education, karma etc..but still we all ar=
e connected. This connectivity is due to nature.=C2=A0We ( humanbeing, anim=
als, plants all living things)=C2=A0all are part of this nature only.=C2=A0=
We all are dependent on each other for various reasons. This is=C2=A0how th=
e nature functions and This is perhaps the natures' law.
=C2=A0
Kindly put =
light on the question of veg and non veg food taking in to consideration th=
e nature's law.

Respected members,

Thanks for responding to my posts and thanks for h=
aving a healthy discussion so far.

Please let me do an effort to simplify =
the discussion and remove some confusion from the discussion. Please point =
out my mistakes I will make in this process.

We are trying to discuss thre=
e points here

1) Choosing a dietary habit
2) Dependence of Human populatio=
n on Non-veg sources of nutrition
3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Ve=
g food.

I commented on two points 

1) Choosing a dietary habit 
2) Depend=
ence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition

1) Choosing a Die=
tary habit

One should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitud=
e and attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or o=
ther factor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of hi=
s training. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to veget=
arian food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg=
. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this point.

In some diseases Non veg sou=
rces play an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Album=
in deficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per In=
j) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda a=
lso recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.

2) Dependence of Human popu=
lation on non veg sources of nutrition

I agree with the link provided in t=
his discussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing=
 for switching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book re=
ference which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every =
information on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like as=
trology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.

By=
 'Practically impossible' I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor.=
 In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% peo=
ple are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non=
 veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (incl=
uding gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (i=
nclude almonds cashew etc - Costs needn't mention), Dairy products (Milk be=
ing 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete sour=
ce), 

In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose=
 by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a comp=
lete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, =
50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, a=
long with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Dif=
ferent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family siz=
e of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not th=
e only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there

Eve=
n at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additi=
onal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% =
and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.

Sir, I am not adv=
ocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I p=
refer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no c=
ruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yours=
elf)

Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift=
 all the population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is =
decreasing day by day because of many reasons)

3) Bioavailability or BV of=
 different sources

It is always a questionable point. because again sectio=
ns supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which support veg =
food and vice versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think=
 scientifically we will find that for different sources different sources a=
re better. For example calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), fo=
r albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal =
sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we can not say tha=
t only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survi=
ve on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values =
given by Rajarshi ji.

Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. B=
ut so does the deep fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit=
 it will not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if m=
ore energy is used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. i=
t is a scietific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed=
 to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull i=
s increasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat wha=
t one want to become.

But still at last, I want to mention that I am not a=
dvocating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict veg=
etarian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realis=
e that it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.

Please poin=
t out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i menti=
oned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate=
 and not too much off the line.

Kind Regards
Atul

 If additional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise ano=

ir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, e=
ven for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can=
 not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not =
produce it yourself)<BR><BR>Again, I think and believe that practically it =
is impossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when th=

>3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources<BR><BR>It is always a questi=
onable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highli=
ght the results which support veg
 food and vice versa. There are lot of ha=
lfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for di=
fferent sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal so=
urces are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sou=
rces are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support =
this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the d=
iet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is=
 concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.<BR><BR>Yes, I agre=
e Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetari=
an food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from T=
amas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting fo=
od, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after f=
ood, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spi=
cy food, tea, coffee, coke
 and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what w=
e eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.<BR><BR>But =
still at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I a=
m just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should unde=
rstand that we may be right but we should realise that it does not necessar=
ily mean other person is not right.<BR><BR>Please point out my mistakes I h=
ad made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may not be =
exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too much off=
 the line.<BR><BR>Kind Regards<BR>Atul<BR><BR>--- In <A href=3D"http://in.m=

te:<BR>><BR>> Namaste Narasimha,<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> I disgr=
ee with two points you mentioned.
 Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with =
<BR>> the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained=
 right at the <BR>> beginning).<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> (3) I heard=
 an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several <BR>&=
gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of goril=
las was <BR>> fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc=
. After several <BR>> months, researchers found a gap in the intelligenc=
e of the two sets. The ones <BR>> fed with meat were duller.<BR>> <BR=
>> If=C3=82 you have any references for this, in terms of whether t=
hey published any <BR>> paper on the same, I am interested to know and a=
nalyse that in details. I am <BR>> open to learning and reviewing my pos=
ition, provided there is genuine evidence.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> The=
ir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed wit=
h <BR>> nuts and fruits may have
 diverted more energy towards the devel=
opment of brain. <BR>> Though they were not sure if the same thing appli=
es to human beings or not,=C3=82 =C3=82 a <BR>> balanced veget=
arian diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual development.<BR>> =C3=
=82 <BR>> This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C3=82&nb=
sp;is concerned, because human <BR>> stomach structure (gut morphology) =
is such that it finds certain animal products <BR>> far easier to digest=
 than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have <BR>> qoted f=
rom a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and <BR>>=
; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82 take =
a few days since I <BR>> have to get them from people who deal with thes=
e topics professionally, but time <BR>> is not a problem.=C3=82 All=
 the papers are=C3=82 from the most accepted and reputed <BR>> scie=
ntific=C3=82 journals. There is no confusion. Which is
 why I said, it=
 is myth <BR>> that=C3=82 vegeterian=C3=82 foods are=C3=82&nbs=
p;easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. <BR>> <BR>> =C3=
=82 <BR>> Further, in my experience, I never found traditional vege=
terians to be any more <BR>> dull or smarter than traditional omnivores.=
 <BR>> <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> (7) Regarding Priya's question: Ani=
mals have their own vaasanas and their needs. <BR>> If an animal can sur=
vive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor <BR>> fellow wha=
tever he/she needs.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> An animal has a specific p=
hysical=C3=82 structure and needs to maintain the same. But <BR>> i=
f trained they can 'adjust' to any kind of meals. I have seen people feedin=
g <BR>> vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whos=
e whole body <BR>> structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust t=
o any food for the sake of <BR>> survival, but will become internally we=
ak and
 susceptable to disease and <BR>> weaknesses. Who takes the karma=
 for the disease and weakness that may result <BR>> from an unnatural di=
et to an animal? <BR>> <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Not that all dogs w=
ho are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances <BR>> incr=
ease a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one=
 <BR>> susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my=
 personal <BR>> opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should tak=
en care of in the best <BR>> way possible, providing it with whatever ma=
ybe needed, including the right diet.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> =C3=82&n=
bsp;<BR>> _______________<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>&=
gt; A question for you.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Scientists studying ev=
olution and human body structures have concluded that meat <BR>> eating =
along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 <BR>>=
 million years. That,
 without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure o=
f the <BR>> human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82 caecum),=C3=82=
 and the threefold increase in=C3=82 brain <BR>> size (from ar=
cheological evidences)=C3=82 could never have been what it is today. <=
BR>> Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82 natural proce=
ss, so ingrained that it <BR>> has changed the very structure of the hum=
an body. This cannot be done <BR>> consciously, but only by the work of =
natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will <BR>> provide relevent resea=
rch=C3=82 papers to prove my claim).<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> What=
 is your take on this? <BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> -Regards<BR>> =C3=

:03 AM<BR>> Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat<BR>> <BR>> =C3=82&=
nbsp; <BR>> Namaste friends,<BR>> <BR>> There has been a lot of di=
scussion on food. A few quick comments.<BR>> <BR>> (1) We are we we e=
at. Production of various chemicals in our body and their <BR>> interact=
ions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound <BR>&=
gt; impact on us.<BR>> <BR>> (2) Much has been written on the materia=
l benefits from vegetarianism. But that <BR>> is not all. There are spir=
itual and subtle reasons as well.<BR>> <BR>> Eating the flesh or body=
 parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the <BR>> physical bod=
y entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their
 physical <BR>&=
gt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods=
 is much <BR>> smaller.<BR>> <BR>> Especially these days, very cru=
el methods are used for meat production by <BR>> corporations and animal=
s are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their <BR>> suffering =
goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.<BR>> <BR>> (3) I heard a=
n interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several <BR>>=
; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorilla=
s was <BR>> fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. =
After several <BR>> months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence =
of the two sets. The ones <BR>> fed with meat were duller.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas =
fed with <BR>> nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the=
 development of brain. <BR>> Though they were not
 sure if the same thin=
g applies to human beings or not, a <BR>> balanced vegetarian diet perha=
ps can maximize one's intellectual development.<BR>> <BR>> (4) After =
we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well <BR>&=
gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestiv=
e process <BR>> is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire)=
 and there isn't much <BR>> agni available for other activities such as =
digestion of intellectual ideas that <BR>> happens in the mind. Similarl=
y, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also <BR>> requires agni and=
 that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after <BR>> a =
heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before <=
BR>> eating.<BR>> <BR>> (5) If foods that light up a higher digest=
ive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food <BR>> with more oil, spicy foods t=
hat stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed
 more <BR>> frequently, a=
gni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni <BR>>=
; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experienc=
es. If <BR>> one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple =
grains, simple <BR>> lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked wi=
th mild spices, and fruits), <BR>> less agni is diverted towards digesti=
on and more agni is available for <BR>> assimilaring intellectual and sp=
iritual ideas and experiences.<BR>> <BR>> (6) Even a big fire cannot =
burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may <BR>> be burnt by =
just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough <BR>&g=
t; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent=
 <BR>> vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire=
 may be needed <BR>> in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstruction=
s (wet grass). Thus, it all <BR>>
 depends on vaasanas and impurities in=
 nadis and chakras.<BR>> <BR>> One person may eat meat and deep fried=
 foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting <BR>> them and yet make excelle=
nt spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik <BR>> food, maxim=
ize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle <BR>&g=
t; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is t=
o ignore <BR>> counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things be=
ing equal, that <BR>> maximizes the agni available for spiritual progres=
s.<BR>> <BR>> (7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own =
vaasanas and their needs. <BR>> If an animal can survive on vegetarian f=
ood, good. Otherwise, feed the poor <BR>> fellow whatever he/she needs.<=
BR>> <BR>> (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi sho=
uld consume enough <BR>> food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil =
one's dharma in the material
 <BR>> world using physical body and make s=
piritual progress. Eating too much food is <BR>> not good for spiritual =
sadhana.<BR>> <BR>> Instead of overeating most of the time and fastin=
g on specific days, it is <BR>> better to eat limited amount always. Reg=
ular practices are more important for <BR>> transformation and success, =
than occasional practices.<BR>> <BR>> (9) By merely thinking that god=
 is the doer of all actions or considering food <BR>> to be god's prasad=
, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how <BR>> deeply i=
ngrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally <BR=
>> feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (=
e.g. <BR>> eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.<BR>>=
