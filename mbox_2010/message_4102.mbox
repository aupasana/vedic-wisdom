namaste,
=A0
i have a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, a=
s the peerless maharshi alludes to, then what's the point in our debating t=
hese things? 
=A0
wouldn't the thesis apply to osama, nehru, gandhiji=A0equ=
ally -- that is, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was supposed =
to, right or wrong?
=A0
which begs the question, when does free will begin =
and fate end?
=A0
enlightenment, please..
=A0
regards,
