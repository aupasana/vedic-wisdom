If one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is associated with naked men=
/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex in a dif=

 If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the friend =
and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distractions caused=
 by the friend, then aghora's sadhana I mentioned is like getting the frien=

that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 =
hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that fea=
t with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavanda=
nam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minut=
es), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 m=
inutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes d=
o special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in =
all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different =
from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is=
 to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all=
 about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician =
