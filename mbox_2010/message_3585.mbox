Dear Narasimhagaru, 

I really appreciate your contribution on this forum. =
It is pretty much that I started looking forward for your posts which are f=
illed with so much conviction, knowledge of our scriptures and clarity. In =
the mean-while some more questions. Some of these questions were asked prev=
iously in different threads on this forum, but probably you didn't have a c=
hance to look at them, with all the activity that is happening over here. 
=

1. I understand from different messages that you do Chandi Homam everyday.=
 How do you manage to do that? It should be taking at least 2.5 to 3 hours =
to perform this, right? Do you do this in the evenings?

2. What exactly is=
 Gayatri Chandas? (I have asked this previously). I find that Savitru Gayat=
ri Mantra has 24 letters, Brihaspati Gayatri has 21 letters (Vrishabham Cha=
rshaneenam), Ganapati Moolamantram (aum Shreem hreem kleem gloum Gam Ganapa=
thim....) having 28 letters. 

3. With only 5000+ years into a length of 43=
2,000 years of Kaliyuga, are we at a point that we can say that Kali is dee=
pening? I shudder to think what would happen when kali really deepens fully=
, say a few thousand years more from now. 

4. I have really heard great pr=
aises on this forum on Yogi Vimalananda and read great reviews on the Aghor=
a Series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. I have also read the great narrative=
s by Mr. Rajarshi with a great interest. He is a fantastic narrator. I woul=
d like to know your opinion on those books. The subject is fascinating for =
me. 

Regards, 

Nagraj Kota
