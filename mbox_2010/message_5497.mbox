Namaste,
     Found this interesting snippet on almost extinct
Athirathra(A=
gnichayana) Homa/Yajna (based on Rigveda) produced by Havard
University in =
1975.    The recitation here passed over by generations by
word of mouth se=
ems entirely non musical, but based on some rules.
Probably it  is for a si=
milar reason why some people suggest avoid vedic
suktams in chandi path and=
 do other suktams.
