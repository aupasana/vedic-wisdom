 B. V. Narasimha Swami was the first English biographer of Sri Ramana
Mahar=
shi. He asked many devotees and disciples to write about their lives
and ex=
periences with the Master. Yogi Ramiah submitted a 2000 word essay,
from wh=
ich B.V.N. extracted a short edited account to print in his book,
titled Se=
lf-Realization.

The following is B. V. Narasimha Swami's edited account pu=
blished in Self
Realization, followed by the full autobiographical essay wr=
itten by the Yogi
himself. All this text has been printed in Arunachala's R=
amana, Boundless
Ocean of Grace, Book II, published by Sri Ramanasramam and=
 available at the
Ashram Bookstall in Tiruvannamalai.

Yogi Ramiah belongs =
to the community of Reddiars and was a wealthy land
proprietor of Annareddi=
palayam, near Buchi Reddipalayam, Nellore District. He
received hardly any =
education. Being the sole owner of his properties he had
every inducement t=
o pass his days merrily with his thoughtless companions,
boys of his own ag=
e. But at about the age of eighteen his thoughts took a
serious turn and he=
 gave up his former associates and took an interest in
religion.

A Brahmin=
 Guru imparted to him the Rama Taraka Mantram and asked him to
repeat it fi=
ve thousand times daily. "If the number is exceeded, what then?"
asked the =
ardent youth.

"So much the better," was the Guru's reply.

"If I repeat it=
 always?" was the next query. The Guru was delighted at the
keenness of the=
 disciple's enthusiasm and expressed warm approval.

Ramiah went on with hi=
s japam from morning till night, whatever he might be
doing. He also began =
to practice pranayanam, breath control. Consequently,
vairagya, or disgust =
with his worldly surroundings, grew so strong in his
breast that he suddenl=
y left home to go north to perform tapas in holy
places like Kasi, etc.

Fo=
r many years he still continued with his life of yoga, with mounam
(silence=
) and tapas, as its support. He ate little, controlled his breath
and staye=
d many hours at a stretch in blissful ecstasy, mostly in the
cottage of his=
 own garden. He would also stay for a few months each year
with Maharshi at=
 Ramanasramam. He loved and was loved by the Maharshi. As
Yogi Ramiah did n=
ot know Tamil, the Maharshi translated his Tamil poems
.Upadesa Saram. and =
.Ulladu Narpadu. into Telugu. In appreciation, Yogi
Ramiah helped in repair=
ing Palithirtam, in the construction of Asramam hall
and the Asramam well.
=

The original manuscript, wherein Yogi Ramiah tells in his own words about
=
his life and experiences:

>From my boyhood I had great devotion (bhakti) to=
wards Sri Rama Namam. Till I
was nineteen years old I was generally of a ra=
jasic temperament and was
fearless. I used to listen attentively whenever e=
lders recited stories of
God or taught dharma; and I used to make friendshi=
p with such elders.Though
I was not a bhakta from childhood like Kabir, I g=
ot vairagyam and wanted to
do penance (tapas) like Valmiki, until the body =
is covered with ant hills.
Subsequently love for the body (dehabhimanam) di=
sappeared.

Formerly I had many friends, but the feeling of friendship for =
them left me.
I couldn't leave the continuous dhyanam (meditation) even for=
 a minute. I
used to feel sorry that the nights were being wasted in sleep.=
 I used to
feel that I was meditating even in my sleep. I used to be in med=
itation when
I awoke. I used to get up at 3 o.clock in the morning, bathe a=
nd, sitting in
a secluded place, would meditate till 8 o.clock. From 8 a.m.=
 to 11 a.m. I
would read Bhagavatam. After meals I would listen to Bhagavat=
am read by a
Brahmin. In the evenings, I would go outside the town and medi=
tate sitting
alone. Even if such a place be the pathway used by men and cat=
tle, I would
neither know of or hear anything during meditation. I used to =
offer puja,
imagining the form of Vishnu in my heart.

Without telling anyb=
ody I wanted to go to Dandaka Forest and do penance like
Valmiki and the ri=
shis. Before traveling north, I got down from the train to
meet my Guru at =
Bapatla, in the Guntur District. As soon as he saw me he
asked whether I ha=
d left home after informing my people. I told him the
truth, that is, that =
I did not inform anyone. He then told me, "You cannot
stay there (Dandaka F=
orest) and do penance. There are many difficulties
there. Have an asramam i=
n your village and do penance there. I will come and
see you occasionally. =
Go back home to your village." Before leaving to
return to my home, he gave=
 me upadesam.

There was no desire to eat anything. In spite of bodily diff=
iculties the
mind was always happy. I was thinking of Rama in saguna aspect=
 and offering
puja to Hari in my heart.

As the external vision decreased, =
I wanted to go to experienced gurus with
Brahma Nishta and tell them about =
my experiences and to find out what their
experiences were. By enquiry I fo=
und out that there were many who had read
books only, without experiencing =
the Self and I could not find any with
Brahma Nishta. In my boyhood when I =
came on a pilgrimage to Arunagiri I saw
Bhagavan. Since then, at times, I u=
sed to think of him. Learning that
Bhagavan knows Telugu, I went to him, of=
fered my respects, sat in his
presence and was looking at him.

I asked him=
 some questions:

Q. What is Nirvikalpa Samadhi?
A. That which has no sanka=
lpam to Nirvikalpa.
Q. In Samadhi, will there not be even the Brahma Bhava?=

A. If there is Bhava, it will not be Nirvikalpa.
Q. What is meant by Rama?=

A. That in which everything takes its origin, exists and disappears, is
Ra=
ma.

I then determined that all practices are only means to attain this fin=
al
stage. I was giving up my former spiritual practices little by little. I=

felt immensely attracted to Bhagavan and felt quite at home in Ramanasrmam=
.
Bhagavan was all love. After meeting Bhagavan I did not go to any other
G=
uru.

I then read the life of Maharshi. By reading it one acquires vairagya=
m and
dispassion. Just to see him is upadesam; to sit in his presence gives=
 peace.
This is my firm belief.

After some time, with Bhagavan's permissio=
n, I went back to my native place.
I would come twice every year to see him=
.

He had composed "Upadesa Saram" in Tamil. I prayed that he might transla=
te
it into Telugu. He rendered it in dwipada (couplets) form in Telugu. I t=
hen
stayed in the Asramam for some days, went abroad for some time, and the=
n
returned to my Asramam. I then gave up everything. When I returned to
Tir=
uvannamalai I would sometimes stay in the Mango Tree Cave near Mulaipal
Thi=
rtham.

After Bhagavan had composed "Ulladu Narpadu" in Tamil (.Reality in =
Forty
Verses.), I prayed to him to teach it to me in Telegu. He rendered it=
 into
Telegu prose and taught it to me. Reflecting on what he taught me the=
 mind
was subdued and dissolved in the Self.Now nothing different from Self=
 is
seen.
