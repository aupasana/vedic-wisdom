 Major Chadwick

When Chadwick arrived in Tiruvannamalai he mistook me for =
Bhagavan and
prostrated before me. I then took him to Bhagavan. Also, I was=
 asked to
vacate the room I had been occupying at that time, in favor of Ch=
adwick.
Chadwick did not like this and said that if I vacated he would not =
stay at
the Ashram. It was then agreed that the two of us would share the r=
oom.

This is how I became very friendly with Chadwick. He appreciated my h=
ard
work and sincerity. I even used to learn a little bit of English from
C=
hadwick.

Chadwick gave me an umbrella, shaded eyeglasses and sandals to us=
e when I
was supervising or working in the hot sun. Once, when Bhagavan cam=
e by, I
tried to remove all three. Then Bhagavan came near me and chided me=
, saying,
"If you behave like this on seeing me, I will never come near you=
." The
irony is that some others in the Ashram used to scoff at me for wear=
ing
these in Bhagavan's presence. I was in a dilemma because it was Bhagava=
n who
insisted that I behave normally, or He would not come near me.

If yo=
u got up from your seat when Bhagavan passed by, He wouldn't be happy
and w=
ould say, "So you are showing off your bhakti. Why not behave normally
even=
 when I come."

Construction Work

I knew nothing about masonry work before=
 coming here. Although my father was
proficient in masonry, sculpture, astr=
ology and other fine arts, I knew none
of these when I came to Bhagavan. Bh=
agavan taught me everything.

One day, Thenamma Paati asked Bhagavan how I =
could apply my mind to
supervise all the construction work that was going o=
n and still be devoted
to Bhagavan. Bhagavan laughed and remarked that I sh=
ould have been an
engineer in my previous birth.

It was in very subtle way=
s that Bhagavan extracted work from the
devotees. During
my early days with=
 Bhagavan, he once told me, "Go and see what the mason is
doing." So I went=
 there, asked him what he was doing and conveyed the reply
to Bhagavan. Aft=
er sometime, Bhagavan again asked me to go and see what the
mason was doing=
. I complied. The mason was a little annoyed, but made the
same reply. When=
 Bhagavan asked me to go and see what the mason was doing
for the third tim=
e, the mason thought that Bhagavan was mad as he was just
asking him the sa=
me question again and again. I now asked Bhagavan why he
kept repeating the=
 same question. That is when he came out with his
intentions and said, .Som=
eone can attend to the work here. You go and
supervise that work." I reflec=
ted that Bhagavan could have told me this in
the first instance itself, or =
just ordered me to go and do it. But that
wasn't Bhagavan's way. He was ver=
y subtle, shy, and very gentle. Bhagavan
would indicate with only a few wor=
ds or signs.

When the storeroom was being built, Bhagavan wanted me to mak=
e an image of
Arunachala in cement. I honestly felt that I was overworked, =
not getting
enough rest. Also, I was feeling a little dejected. A little la=
ter, Bhagavan
came back and said, "I thought I could make that request, but=
 if that's
difficult for you, don't bother with it." I felt badly about the=
 thoughts I
had entertained and resolved that in the future I would definit=
ely undertake
and fulfill any of Bhagavan's requests, even if that should m=
ean sacrificing
my body. It was a solemn pledge I made to myself.

Bhagavan=
 was very particular about doing things meticulously and perfectly. On
all =
cupboards and other furniture, the name "Sri Ramanasramam,
Tiruvannamalai" =
had to be written very neatly, just like printed letters.

Bhagavan insiste=
d that I should draw the image of Arunachala on the wall of
the Ashram Stor=
e. When it did not come out properly, Bhagavan came and
instructed me. Howe=
ver, it did not come out the second time as well.
Bhagavan once again gave =
me a few hints and I managed to get it right the
third time, and it can be =
seen at the store entrance even today. The three
dimensional aspect is also=
 visible on account of the cement being plastered
accordingly. The same thi=
ng happened with the arch of the Ashram entrance.
Bhagavan would encourage =
me to take up such work, and whenever I had
difficulty, Bhagavan would come=
, give hints, and encourage me to do it
perfectly.

One day I was feeling t=
ired and was reclining against a wall. Bhagavan came
up to me and said, "I'=
m afraid to even look at you." I asked Him why that
should be so. He said, =
"If I would just look in one direction, you would
construct a structure the=
re." This was of course in jest but it also meant
that I could understand B=
hagavan's subtle instructions and follow them
meticulously. This was great =
appreciation showered upon me by Sri Bhagavan.

On another occasion, I was =
building some steps near the water tap. Bhagavan
was standing there and giv=
ing me instructions. As I got up, I banged my head
hard against the tap. Bh=
agavan asked Madhavaswami to bring zambak (medicinal
ointment), and persona=
lly massaged my head for a long time. Though I had
pain in my head, I kept =
reminding myself of Bhagavan's teaching, which was
to give up the 'I am-the=
-body' idea. I also thanked the tap for giving me
this opportunity to recei=
ve a massage from the golden this opportunity to
receive a massage from the=
 golden hands of Sri Bhagavan.

In the earlier days, Madhavaswami, Rangaswa=
mi and I used to massage the
soles of Bhagavan's feet with oil, and put our=
 heads against His feet to
receive His grace after completing the massage. =
Bhagavan used to pretend to
be asleep when we did this. However, when large=
 crowds started coming to the
Ashram regularly, we had to stop this practic=
e of ours.

When the Dining Hall was being built, Bhagavan used to dig the =
earth with a
huge gaddapare (crowbar) and Santhamma used to mix mortar with=
 water. I was
entrusted with the mason's work. While we worked on the const=
ruction
Thenamma and Subbu-lakshmiamma used to do the cooking nearby. As I =
was not a
brahmin, the women used a large white cloth as a partition betwee=
n them and
us. Bhagavan told them, "Why are you doing this? It's only our A=
nnamalai.
Why should you segregate him like this?" Chinnaswami, on hearing =
this said,
"Bhagavan says 'our Annamalai', so he has become an ichcha brahm=
in", i.e., a
brahmin by the wish of Sri Bhagavan.

Disturbing Ants

One day=
 after lunch we noticed lots of ants in the Old Hall disturbing the
devotee=
s. Bhagavan asked me to inspect the area and do the needful. When I
went an=
d lifted a stone, millions of ants rushed out. I was jumping all over
in or=
der to avoid crushing them.When Bhagavan asked me what I was doing, I
expla=
ined that it would be jivahimsa to kill hundreds and thousands of ants
by s=
tepping upon them or by closing the opening through which they came out.
He=
 said, "You are not doing it for yourself, it is for the sake of others."
H=
e then quoted from Chapter thirteen of Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says
tha=
t even killing is permitted if it is for the benefit of the world. Upon
hea=
ring this, I cleared the area of ants, sealed the entrance and cemented
it.=


In the days when I still used to live in the Ashram, I once told Bhagavan=

that I didn't even desire moksha, but just wanted to be saved from the
att=
ractions of women. I was wondering what reply Bhagavan would give. He
said =
that it was freedom from this desire that all great people had sought
and s=
uffered for.

Animals

Bhagavan was extraordinarily kind towards birds, squ=
irrels, cows, dogs and
peacocks. In fact, He showed visible partiality towa=
rds animals over humans.

Bhagavan was particularly interested in rituals f=
or the samadhis of the
birds and animals and wanted special pujas to be don=
e for such samadhis with
offerings of milk, etc. Many people used to witnes=
s this with awe and
wonder.

Once, as Bhagavan was descending the steps nea=
r the Valli deer's samadhi, he
saw a dog chasing a squirrel. Bhagavan tried=
 to prevent the dog from harming
the squirrel by interposing his stick in b=
etween them. In the process, He
stumbled and fell down the steps, suffering=
 bruises all over his body.
Tincture was applied all over, which causes a b=
urning sensation. Plaster was
applied on all the wounds, and there are even=
 photographs of Bhagavan with
plaster all over His body. Bhagavan underwent=
 such suffering even for
animals. We all have witnessed these phases in Bha=
gavan's life.

Shadow Bhagavan

Once, there were films being shown at the A=
shram, including one on Bhagavan.
I wanted to see the film. When I arrived =
and prostrated before Bhagavan, He
said in a stern voice. "So you have come=
 to see the shadow of Bhagavan. This
means that you no longer have the real=
 Bhagavan in you and have hence come
to see this shadow-Bhagavan." This tou=
ched me very deeply.

One day, after this incident, I went up the hill want=
ing to meet Bhagavan
when he returned from his walk. He again looked at me =
sternly and said, "Why
have you come to see me? You have happiness, you hav=
e happiness." I couldn't
understand his words then, but after a lot of refl=
ection I realized that
when one is away from society, one has peace, and th=
at Bhagavan wanted me to
avoid the entire society. This is how I interprete=
d His words.

Bhagavan also said, "Ananda is not what you get from somewher=
e else. If you
follow somebody else's path, it will only lead you to destru=
ction. You have
to follow your own self. Go within. That alone will lead yo=
u to Ananda." So
I interpreted it to mean that I should be alone.
