I=
n order to avoid mis-conceptions in some readers, I want to expand the pers=
pective here.
 
In some cases, intervention from a capable guru may indeed =
remove physical/material obstacles in one's life and sadhana. However, it d=
epends on the individual case. In some cases, some physical/material obstac=
les may have to be presented to the sadhaka, in order to make one progress!=

 
At the end of the day, we have to remember that the goal of sadhana is n=
ot physical and material well-being. It is to overcome ego and its various =
aspects, including attachment to physical and material well-being. However,=
 as we do sadhana using the physical body, which is sensitive to material c=
onditions around it, some level of physical and material well-being is nece=
ssary for smooth sadhana and progress. However, at some stage or the other,=
 one needs to overcome those attachments. Depending on one's readiness and =
the conditioning one has, one may traverse a different path.
 
As an exampl=
e, I will take the person whose first Kundalini awakening experience was de=
scribed in:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476
 
He =
was being guided by a capable guru, who had actually told him ahead that hi=
s time for Kundalini awakening had come. Yet, in the month or two after the=
 experience, the person's health was bad. He was getting fever frequently a=
nd feeling weak and weird. Now and then, he would experience flow of electr=
icity in the back, would lose awareness of the body and see sights and bein=
gs or hear sounds, including mantras and beejas, all internally. It would f=
eel very nice. Suddenly, that experience would end and his normal body awar=
eness would return. His attitude and internal reaction to what others said =
about him changed drastically. He could see that he was making progress and=
 was generally happy. But his physical health was quite unstable and he was=
 uncomfortable when he was aware of the physical body.
 
Though he was worr=
ied a little in the beginning about it, he later stopped bothering about ph=
ysical health. He told himself that this was just one layer of reality and =
not the most important one and not worth worrying much. His focus turned in=
wards.
 
After a few months of instability, his health became fine again. H=
is nervous system perhaps reached a new equilibrium. His lifestyle changed.=
 He would eat much less food than before and yet feel energetic enough.
 
I=
f one experiences physical problems after taking up a sadhana, one has thre=
e options: (1) stop the sadhana, (2) look for ways to improve the problem, =
(3) try to overcome physical concerns and rise above the body. Differebt pe=
rsons may approach differently, based on their readiness.

t. Here I will share something from my own experience to illustrate this. I=
nitially I was hesitant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it mi=
ght help put things in a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sa=
dhana single-mindedly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studi=
es. Those days I used to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and san=
yasis. Some of my co-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordaine=
d monks later. Swadhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the=
 mainstay of my sadhana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of =
this period I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any in=
itiation. Things were fine and I made some progress probably owing to a com=
bination of many factors. After spending three years in spiritual studies a=
nd sadhana, I decided to return home and pursue medical studies in accordan=
ce with my mother's wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursui=
ng my medical studies too.
> 
> Around early 95, I started doing Devi Mahat=
mya parayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having piercing h=
eadaches, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would s=
hoot up to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standard investi=
gations, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking =
to me, suspected that it *might* have something to do with my sadhanas too.=
 Things continued to be the same for some more months, till I got introduce=
d to Swami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the=
 course of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the next day aft=
er coming to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After in=
teracting everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Ch=
andi path.  After a week or so after the initiation all the symptoms subsid=
ed. The blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It has been ar=
ound 15 years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. What's mor=
e, I had some very powerful internal experiences in quick succession during=
 the following week itself after initiation. This is my experience.

h I was not consciously thinking of raising Kundalni or anything like that =
and was just focusing on sadhana, you are right about the raja yoga/hatha y=

 fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this time. However Devi Mahatm=
ya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yogabhyasa since early 91-92 =
during which time things were fine. It was only in 94 that I resumed Devi M=

 this time. I have already written about the rest.

> > > 
> > > 1.=
	There are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas=
 etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, st=
otras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahaman=
tras and mantras.  The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as m=
antras.

 in the original. Reading a translation is not even comparable to chanting =
the original chant. So far it is fine.
> > > 
> > > 3.	Whilst mantra, stotr=
a and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction bet=
ween them.
> > >      
> > > 4.	As per the traditional view one doesn't nee=
d to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same wi=
th most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of=
 Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from=
 the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initiat=
ion, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever yo=
u call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral par=
ts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as i=
n the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.
> > >  
> > > 5.	Vishnusahasr=
anama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they f=
all under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are tr=
aditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a l=
arger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them withou=
t initiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the nav=
arna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.

to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both=
 the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective N=
AVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (=
ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs=
 to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.
> =
> >  
> > > 7.	Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text =
that has an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simu=

rit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part=
 of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initi=

 Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in th=
e vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original =
along with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya=
. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the special=
ised sadhanas properly under guidance.
> > >  
> > > 8.	Arguably if an unin=
itiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of=
 the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem=
 in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatm=
yam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvertentl=
y end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunj=
ika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.

ully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere =
do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted =
to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power =
of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know t=
he essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting i=
t. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation!

all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiatio=
n). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sa=
kama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to jus=
t do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude i=
tself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on the=
