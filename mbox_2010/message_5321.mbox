Namaste,

I find a few contradition in your position. Let me explain. Befor=
e I start, let 
me also=C2=A0clarify that I am not a Vedantin, neither am I=
 an anti-Vedantin.=C2=A0 I 
belong to no specific path/sect. I take what I =
find=C2=A0reasonable, logic and 
acceptable, irrespective of where it comes=
=C2=A0from.=C2=A0

Technically=C2=A0the core philosophy of Vedanta is=C2=A0=
realization of the statement Aham 
Brahmasmi (personally I have a logical i=
ssue with this statement, but that is 
a=C2=A0different discussion).=C2=A0I=
gnoraning the body is=C2=A0merely=C2=A0of secondary consequence. 
So theori=
tically, if someday someone is able to attain perfect physical 
immortality=
, he/she too=C2=A0cannot be called a non-vedantin=C2=A0if he as=C2=A0realiz=
ed=C2=A0Aham 
Brahmasmi. 


Is the physical body important? My person take =
is that, sure it is. Without this 
vehicle nothing is achievable. Therefore=
 it is important.

The Bhagavad Gita, is a text, not from a Vedic Rishi, bu=
t a Vedantist Vishnu 
Avatara.
=C2=A0
A Vishnu Avatar is God for all practi=
cal purposes, including the description and 
status accorded to Krishna as =
the Purna Avatara - one who cannot be replicated 
by anyone else on this pl=
ane. This even Lahiri Mahasaya accepts, just as pretty 
much everbody who i=
s anybody, does.
Just as I mentioned that Mahavatara Babaji does not speak =
of physical 
immortality for anyone, same is the case for Krishna. Because =
that is not 
achieveable. 

=C2=A0
There is a need to bring the Vedas to th=
e mass consciousness, to uplift the 
Physical consciousness from where it i=
s now.
=C2=A0
If by=C2=A0this statement you mean Vedas are going to make pe=
ople immortal, I have to 
ask how. 

=C2=A0
The Vedas=C2=A0today is merely =
a mass of different translations by different parties. 
Aurobindo even says=
 that it is purely allegorical,=C2=A0he=C2=A0mostly 
interpreted=C2=A0some=
=C2=A0selective hymns. Never in any of the hyms does there exist=C2=A0any 
=
remote hint of any sort of physical immortality, merely describing differen=
t 
states of spiritual process internal to the sadhaka.=C2=A0The other tran=
slations=C2=A0by 
other commentators also=C2=A0do not=C2=A0mention any sort=
 of physical immortality at all.
=C2=A0
Therefore, for complete lack of any=
 evidence from any quarter=C2=A0I shall have to 
assumed that vedas=C2=A0do=
 not=C2=A0talk of any sort of=C2=A0physical immortality.
=C2=A0
Rishis woul=
dn't put the method for divinizing the Physical body in plaintext, to 
disa=
llow its misuse. It is for the persevering soul to find it out for himself =

or through the upliftment of mass consciousness through Vedas.

Why Vedic =
Rishis wouldn't do it themselves, or if they did it, nobody would 
know,
=
=C2=A0
There is no evidence that the Rishis become physically immortal in t=
he body. You 
are *assuming* that Rishis *might have* put some hidden hint,=
 but thats just an 
assumption. They may very well have not put any such hi=
nt about any physical 
immortality, specially since none of the Rishis them=
selves became physically 
immortal. For an assumption to be reasonable, it =
must have some 
basis/hint/example. We find no such conclusive=C2=A0example=
s in the history of 
Sanatana Dharma, except a few stray cases like Ashwath=
ama. 

=C2=A0
Neither does any of the translation of the Vedas by different=
 people=C2=A0speak of 
any such state achievable. Technically someone who i=
s physically immortal is one 
who stays in the body till end of the cycle o=
f creation. Even Babaji - who is 
supposedly physically immortal - does say=
 that others cannot remain till the end 
of creation. So the evidence, rath=
er overwhelmingly, is against the existence or 
even possiblity of such a s=
tate.
=C2=A0
> Because if one is immortal in the physical body, one must su=
rvive in it till 
>the end of creation.
OTOH, a soul liberated in Physical =
body, is no longer bound by the rules of 
creation as applicable to mortal =
beings, who have to die despite all the jnana 
they attain.
=C2=A0
But stra=
ngely that is a state no one has achieved. Neither the seers of the 
Vedas =
achieve it=C2=A0- there is no evidence anywhere that they did - nor did 
th=
ey=C2=A0recommend it to others. 

=C2=A0
Even Babaji says only he will exis=
t till the end.=C2=A0And if your assumptions are 
correct, then Babaji has =
to be wrong!
=C2=A0
I guess I just have to reject this notion for complete =
lack of any evidence of 
the same, and peacefully,=C2=A0agree to disagree w=
ith you.
=C2=A0
-Regards

is only me.

=C2=A0 
Namaskar=
,
The aim of my mails is only to free the minds of the reader from biases, =
caused 
by dominating propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see the Physica=
l body as 
something to be ignored for spiritual pursuit. Consequently, Ved=
antists 
themselves never found out the truth about the Physical body consc=
iousness as an 
expression of divine consciousness. The Bhagavad Gita, is a=
 text, not from a 
Vedic Rishi, but a Vedantist Vishnu Avatara.
There is a =
need to bring the Vedas to the mass consciousness, to uplift the 
Physical =
consciousness from where it is now.

Rishis wouldn't put the method for div=
inizing the Physical body in plaintext, to 
disallow its misuse. It is for =
the persevering soul to find it out for himself 
or through the upliftment =
of mass consciousness through Vedas.

Why Vedic Rishis wouldn't do it thems=
elves, or if they did it, nobody would 
know, but they didn't live in Kaliy=
uga when the Physical body consciousness is 
largely in focus, and therefor=
e the need to divinize it as well. Truth, however, 
is not limited to the Y=
uga when it is perceived, and is equally applicable to 
all Yugas and Veda =
is that Truth.

> Because if one is immortal in the physical body, one must=
 survive in it till 
>the end of creation.
OTOH, a soul liberated in Physic=
al body, is no longer bound by the rules of 
creation as applicable to mort=
al beings, who have to die despite all the jnana 
they attain.
