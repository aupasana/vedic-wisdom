 Turning to Bijoy, who had come in, the Bhagavan continued: Shivanath, the
leader of the Brahmo Samaj, has great cares, he has to edit a newspaper and
do various other works In attending to worldly affairs, one naturally loses
peace of mind and is overwhelmed with worries and anxieties. It is said in
the Bhagavat that Avadhuta  made twenty-four Gurus.

The kite was one of them. In a certain place some fishermen were catching
fish, a kite swooped down and snatched a fish. Seeing the kite with the fish
in its claw, hundreds of crows flew after him and began to caw, making a
great noise.

In whatever direction the kite flew, the crows followed. When he flew to the
south, they pursued him; when he flew to the north, they were after him, and
he found no peace in any direction. At last the kite dropped the fish. Then
the crows flew after the fish and the kite rested calmly on the branch of a
high tree.

He thought within himself: "That fish was the cause of all this trouble. Now
that I no longer have it, I am happy and in perfect peace." The Avadhuta
learned from this kite that as long as a man is attached to worldly objects,
so long he has toil, cares, anxiety, unrest and unhappiness. When attachment
is gone, all works end, and then comes peace. But work without attachment is
good; it does not bring unrest. [p. 67]
