Namaste friends,
 
I am forwarding the reply from Sri Vinay Jha, a monk in =
north India. Though he cc'ed his reply to vedic-wisdom, it was not delivere=
d because he is not a member. So I am forwarding it (see below).
 
To membe=
rs: In my limited interactions with him over the last few months, I have se=
en that he is a man with good understanding and clear thinking. I usually d=
o not have any significant disagreement with him in spiritual matters. Any =
difference between what we say is often because we may be using different w=
ords or looking at things from different angles, but not because of fundame=
ntal differences.
 
Vinay ji summarized it beautifully:
 
> Body is primari=
ly a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered
> desires are in no =
need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an
> irony ! Those who run a=
fter siddhis do not get anything.
> ... Striving after siddhis is the great=
est folly. Siddhis are
> actually distractions which test the power of a yo=
gi to concenrrate.
 
All kinds of siddhi are possible. They should neither =
be avoided nor pursued. Take what comes your way, but do not desire anythin=
g. There should be NOTHING that you hold as "I wish I had this" or "I wish =
I did NOT have this", for any attraction or aversion will block you! As Vin=
ay ji rightly says, the irony is that one running after siddhis is often de=
prived of any, while one without desires may be tempted with this siddhi or=
 that siddhi so that desire may be reborn! Only after one passes all tests =
and attraction and aversion are not born in any circumstances is one truly =
free. The above paragraph is a good summary of this discussion.
 
*        =
*        *
 
Vinay ji is wise in not wanting to talk about personal experie=
nces. I share a few of them as they are useful in highlighting some notions=
 and some lessons and in inspiring and cautioning sadhakas. I am quoting a =
portion from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:
 
---=
--------- Begin Quote ------------
I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of =
the night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my s=
hakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceive=
d a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split se=
cond, my perception of that electricity changed from "shakti inside me" to =
"I inside shakti". My changed perception was that there was a tremendous am=
ount of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing ever=
ything that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendou=
s wave. Moreover, I also "heard" a specific beejaakshara being chanted toge=
ther by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That =
wave reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that =
I too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled wit=
h that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny part=
icle filled with that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anyt=
hing else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet=
 fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thou=
ght that can be loosely expressed as "Amn't I on the bed in a room? How am =
I hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room" came to my mind. T=
hat thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In othe=
r words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again percei=
ved that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind=
 was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.
 
I mentioned this in=
cident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle of=
 the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and=
 said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in=
 which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also =
mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked "that is what you heard, righ=
t?" That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with that beej=
aakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to have a mysti=
cal experience with.

When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, M=
anish shed some light: "I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshar=
a. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nic=
e samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced that deity at =
that time. But we should realize that this is all Her play and we are just =
nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are j=
ust dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make anything happen n=
or should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attr=
acted or repelled by anything."
------------- End Quote -------------
 
Mak=
ing someone who is thousands of miles away (especially one who is leading a=
 normal mundane life and has many bad samskaras!) have a specific sublime e=
xperience is not an ordinary feat. Few can do such things today. However, l=
ook at the attitude of the person who did it. See what he said in the last =
paragraph quoted above about being just a nimitta! Rather than thinking of =
siddhis or striving for them, strive for cultivating such an attitude!
 
Th=
e important thing is not whether one gets siddhis or not. That is irrelevan=
t. The important thing is whether one is fully prepared and mature enough t=
o handle any siddhis! If one is prepared, one may get control over the enti=
re universe and yet remain detached and be liberated. If one is unprepared,=
 even a very very minor siddhi may make one fall and get stuck in the cycle=
 of birth, pursuit of desires and paybacks and death. Sadhakas should forge=
t about irrelevant things and strive for the correct attitude that can take=
 them far.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
