 Talk 357

Sri Bhagavan was recounting some of the incidents of His stay in=

Tiruvannamalai:

1. He was one day given a small speck of some substance o=
n a leaf,to be
licked off. It was said to be a good help for digestion.He l=
icked it. Later
He had His meal. After some time, the assembled persons app=
eared to be
surrounded by Light (tejomaya). The experience passed away afte=
r some time.

2. While He was living in Pavalakunru. He intended to have a =
bath in one of
the rills on the hillside. Palaniswami was informed of it.Th=
e news spread,
that Jada Padmanabhaswami, who was living on the Hill, had a=
rranged with
Palaniswami to take Sri Bhagavan to the hill near his cottage.=
 Palaniswami,
without informing Sri Bhagavan,managed to take Him there. A g=
reat reception
awaited Him. A seat was arranged for Him, milk and fruits we=
re offered and
J. P. waited on Him with great kindness.

3. J.P., though re=
presented in the book Self-Realisation as having sought to
injure Sri Bhaga=
van, was really kind to Him and his pranks were
misunderstood to be acts of=
 malice. His only weakness was that he wanted to
make capital out of Sri Bh=
agavan for raising funds; which, of course, the
Maharshi did not like. Ther=
e was nothing wrong with J.P.

4. Madhavaswami, the attendant, asked if Sri=
 Bhagavan remained without food
for months in the underground cellar in the=
 temple.

M.: Um! - Um! - food was forthcoming - Milk, fruits - but whoever=
 thought of
food.

5.While staying in the mango-tree cave Sri Bhagavan used=
 to string garlands
for the images in the temple, with lotuses, yellow flow=
ers (sarakonnai) and
green leaves.

6. After the completion of the Kalyanam=
antapam Sri Bhagavan had stayed there
one night in disguise.

7. When He wa=
s sitting under a tree in the temple compound He was covered
with dirt, for=
 He never used to bathe. In the cold nights of December He
used to fold up =
the legs, place his head between his legs and remain there
without moving. =
Early in the morning the layer of dirt on His body was
soaked with dew and =
mist and appeared white.After drying up in the sun it
appeared dark.

8. Wh=
en living on the Hill Sri Bhagavan used to help in the pooja of J. P.,
ring=
ing the bell, washing the vessels, etc.,all along remaining silent. He
also=
 used to read medical works, e.g., Ashtanga Hridayam in Malayalam and
point=
 out the treatment contained in the book for the patients who sought
the ot=
her sadhu=E2=80=99s help. That sadhu did not himself know how to read these=

works.
