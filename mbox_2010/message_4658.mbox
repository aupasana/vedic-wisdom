 IN 1911 when I was in the high school in Tiruvannamalai,Bhagavan Ramana
Ma=
harshi was living in Virupaksha Cave.At that time we boys would climb the
A=
runachala hill in small parties to visit Bhagavan. He was usually found
sit=
ting on the elevated place outside the cave. He would smile at us as a
sign=
 of recognition and would allow us to sit at his feet and sing
devotional s=
ongs to our hearts=E2=80=99 content. When the singing was over, we would
sh=
are with him the food we had brought and wash it down with the cool water
f=
rom a spring just above the cave. We would then return home in high
spirits=
.

Though I was married I was not interested in family life.My wife also pa=
ssed
away sometime after marriage and I was free to roam about and live as =
I
wished to.

I am not by nature a willing worker but for the sake of stayi=
ng at the
Ashram I was ready to work. Bhagavan had come down from the hill =
after his
mother=E2=80=99s samadhi and an Ashram grew around him. I did odd=
 jobs like
collecting flowers for worship, drawing water from the well, gri=
nding
sandalwood paste etc. For sometime I was performing the puja at Bhaga=
van=E2=80=99s
mother=E2=80=99s shrine.

One day Chinnaswami asked me to tak=
e up the preparation of the morning
iddlies, the steamed rice and pulse cak=
es common to South India. This gave
me a chance to become a permanent resid=
ent of the Ashram. In preparing
iddlies I achieved such excellence that vis=
itors commented that nowhere had
they tasted iddlies comparable to those of=
 the Ashram.

He was very particular about avoiding waste. He showed me how=
 to use a ladle
so that not even a drop of food would fall on the ground, h=
ow to avoid
spilling while pouring and how to start a fire with just a few =
drops of
kerosene. If all this were not a part of my spiritual discipline, =
why should
he have bothered?

When we prepared iddlies we would send him tw=
o, steaming hot. He would eat
one and give the other to the people present.=
 At breakfast everybody would
get two iddlies and a cup of coffee, But Bhag=
avan would take only one
iddlie, counting as his first, the one he took ear=
lier.

In 1937 a post office was opened in the Ashram and I was made the
Po=
stmaster. On the first two days Bhagavan came to the post office and did
al=
l the stamping. Prior to that I used to bring the mail from the town post
o=
ffice to the Ashram.

=E2=80=9COh, the postman has been made the Postmaster=
=E2=80=9D, remarked Bhagavan. I thus
had the opportunity of serving Bhagava=
n and the Ashram for several years.
