Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams,

With reference to the lines written by=
 you:

"...Beard is useful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many r=
eligions
and it is not without a reason..."

I would like to state my under=
standing on this issue: Ego has many forms and
one such form is in the atta=
chment to the body. Combing our hair, shaving,
grooming etc are habits form=
ed by us to make us "presentable" to society.
Growing a beard helps to make=
 us indifferent to our grooming needs and focus
the mind solely on the sadh=
ana. One who is in the highest state of mind will
not bother about the appe=
arance and even roam about carefree like an
avadhuta. I have also read else=
where that the beard helps to trap the shakti
accumulated as a result of th=
e sadhana.

Please correct my understanding if I am wrong.

best regards
Ha=
ri

<div>This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question =
on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it=
 for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do =
3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=A0300=
 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a professional corporat=
