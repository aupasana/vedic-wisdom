A visitor introduced by T.S.R. asked Bhagavan whether by doing a=
nnual
ceremonies, etc., to the dead, we can confer any benefit on them.

To=
 this Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=9CYes. It all depends on one=E2=80=99s belie=
f.=E2=80=9D

Mr. Somasundaram Pillai=E2=80=99s version of the above questio=
n and answer is given
below:

Question: If such rites as the annual ceremon=
y performed by descendants are
able to do away with the karma of the dead, =
it seems to strike at the root
of the theory of karma. For then a man may e=
scape the evil consequences of
his bad acts through the help of the rites p=
erformed by his sons, etc.

Answer: Such rites only help the deceased to a =
small extent.It is on the
same principle that prayaschittam and good deeds =
are said to mitigate the
evil consequences of one=E2=80=99s bad actions.

A=
fter the visitor went away Devaraja Mudaliar asked Bhagavan, =E2=80=9CTill =
three
years ago, I was under the impression that doing annual ceremonies to=
 the
dead would confer benefit on them so long as they are not reborn.=E2=
=80=9D

Bhagavan intervened with the remark,=E2=80=9CThey will receive bene=
fit though they
are reborn several times and there is an agency to look aft=
er all this. Of
course,Jnana marga does not say all this.=E2=80=9D

After a=
 while I said,=E2=80=9CBhagavan used to say that if one believes in the
exi=
stence
of this world, one should also believe in the existence of other wor=
lds.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan said that it was so.

Devaraja Mudaliar asked, =E2=
=80=9CThe jnani transcends all stages and he is not
bound by any karma (vid=
hi or nisheda). The ajnani should do his own dharma
prescribed by sastras t=
ill he gets jnana. But while he is attempting to
reach jnana, will he be he=
ld responsible for the consequences of not doing
the ordinary karma or will=
 he be presumed to have done all this karma, just
as a person reading in a =
higher class is presumed to have finished the lower
classes?=E2=80=9D

Bhag=
avan said, =E2=80=9CIt depends on the superiority of the path one pursues.
=
Unless a person has finished (in this or previous births) the other paths,
=
he will not pursue the jnana path; and he need not bother himself that he
h=
as not done the various karmas prescribed by sastras.

But he should not wi=
lfully(head-strongly) transgress the sastraic
injunctions by doing things p=
rohibited by them.=E2=80=9D
