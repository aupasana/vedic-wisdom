To Maharishi Ramana there came a seeker who said, =E2=80=9CI desire to live=
 in solitude where I can find what I want, with ease, so that I may devote =
all my time to meditation. Is such a desire good or bad?=E2=80=9D

The Maha=
rishi answered, =E2=80=9CWhat does it matter where and how you are placed? =
The essential point is that the mind must always remain in it=E2=80=99s sou=
rce. There is nothing external which is not also internal. The mind is all,=
 if the mind is active even the solitude becomes like a market place. There=
 is no use closing your eyes. Close your mental eye and all will be right.
