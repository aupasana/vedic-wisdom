CHAPTER III

Of the knowledge of truth

Happy is the man whom Truth by itse=
lf doth teach, not by figures
and transient words, but as it is in itself.(=
1)  Our own
judgment and feelings often deceive us, and we discern but
litt=
le of the truth.  What doth it profit to argue about hidden
and dark things=
, concerning which we shall not be even reproved
in the judgment, because w=
e knew them not?  Oh, grievous folly,
to neglect the things which are profi=
table and necessary, and to
give our minds to things which are curious and =
hurtful!  Having
eyes, we see not.

2. And what have we to do with talk abo=
ut genus and species!
He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from mul=
tiplied
questionings.  From this One Word are all things, and all things
sp=
eak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto
us.(2)  No m=
an without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth.  The
man to whom all thing=
s are one, who bringeth all things to one,
who seeth all things in one, he =
is able to remain steadfast of
spirit, and at rest in God.  O God, who art =
the Truth, make me
one with Thee in everlasting love.  It wearieth me often=
times to
read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for
and=
 desire.  Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all
creation keep silen=
ce before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.

3. The more a man hath unity and s=
implicity in himself, the more
things and the deeper things he understandet=
h; and that without
labour, because he receiveth the light of understanding=
 from
above.  The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not
dist=
racted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all
things to the h=
onour of God, and striveth to be free from all
thoughts of self-seeking.  W=
ho is so full of hindrance and
annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined=
 heart?  A man who is
good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own h=
eart the
works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the
=
desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the
judgment of righ=
t reason.  Who hath a harder battle to fight
than he who striveth for self-=
mastery?  And this should be our
endeavour, even to master self, and thus d=
aily to grow stronger
than self, and go on unto perfection.

4. All perfect=
ion hath some imperfection joined to it in this
life, and all our power of =
sight is not without some darkness.  A
lowly knowledge of thyself is a sure=
r way to God than the deep
searching of man's learning.  Not that learning =
is to be blamed,
nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a goo=
d
conscience and a holy life is better than all.  And because many
seek kno=
wledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray,
and bear little o=
r no fruit.

5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of v=
ice
and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain
questionings: ther=
e had not been so many evil doings and
stumbling-blocks among the laity, no=
r such ill living among
houses of religion.  Of a surety, at the Day of Jud=
gment it will
be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have do=
ne;
not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.  Tell
me, wh=
ere now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou
knewest well, whilst =
they were yet with you, and flourished in
learning?  Their stalls are now f=
illed by others, who perhaps
never have one thought concerning them.  Whils=
t they lived they
seemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.

6.=
 Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away!  Would
that their life=
 and knowledge had agreed together!  For then
would they have read and inqu=
ired unto good purpose.  How many
perish through empty learning in this wor=
ld, who care little for
serving God.  And because they love to be great mor=
e than to be
humble, therefore they "have become vain in their imaginations=
."
He only is truly great, who hath great charity.  He is truly
great who d=
eemeth himself small, and counteth all height of
honour as nothing.  He is =
the truly wise man, who counteth all
earthly things as dung that he may win=
 Christ.  And he is the
truly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and f=
orsaketh his
own will.

(1) Psalm xciv. 12; Numbers xii. 8.   (2) John viii=
. 25 (Vulg.).


CHAPTER IV

Of prudence in action

We must not trust every =
word of others or feeling within
ourselves, but cautiously and patiently tr=
y the matter, whether
it be of God.  Unhappily we are so weak that we find =
it easier to
believe and speak evil of others, rather than good.  But they
=
that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer,
for they kno=
w man's weakness that it is prone to evil and
unstable in words.

2. This i=
s great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn
in our own opinions.=
  A part of this wisdom also is not to
believe every word we hear, nor to t=
ell others all that we hear,
even though we believe it.  Take counsel with =
a man who is wise
and of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by on=
e better
than thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions.  A good
=
life maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in
many things=
.  The more humble a man is in himself, and the more
obedient towards God, =
the wiser will he be in all things, and the
more shall his soul be at peace=
.


CHAPTER V

Of the reading of Holy Scriptures

It is Truth which we must=
 look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of
words.  All Scripture ought to be re=
ad in the spirit in which it
was written.  We must rather seek for what is =
profitable in
Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse=
.
Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple,
as well=
 as those which are deep and difficult.  And let not the
weight of the writ=
er be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be
of little or much learning, =
but let the love of the pure Truth
draw thee to read.  Ask not, who hath sa=
id this or that, but look
to what he says.

2. Men pass away, but the truth=
 of the Lord endureth for ever.
Without respect of persons God speaketh to =
us in divers manners.
Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading o=
f holy
writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should
pa=
ss simply on.  If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read
humbly, simply, =
honestly, and not desiring to win a character for
learning.  Ask freely, an=
d hear in silence the words of holy men;
nor be displeased at the hard sayi=
ngs of older men than thou, for
they are not uttered without cause.
