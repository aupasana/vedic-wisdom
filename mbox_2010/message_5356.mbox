N=
amaste Narasimha,
=C2=A0
I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me cl=
arify. (I am only dealing with the science part of these discussions, as I =
had already maintained right at the beginning).
=C2=A0
(3) I heard an inter=
view with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. T=
hey conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with m=
eat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, res=
earchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with=
 meat were duller.

If=C2=A0you have any references for this, in terms of w=
hether they published any paper on the same, I am interested to know and an=
alyse that in details. I am open to learning and reviewing my position, pro=
vided there is genuine evidence.
=C2=A0
Their theory was that digestion of =

=C2=A0
T=

human stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain anim=
al products far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my oth=
er mail, I have qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinica=
l nutrition and dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C2=
=A0take a few days since I have to get them from people who deal with these=
 topics professionally, but time is not a problem.=C2=A0All the papers are=

 no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0fo=

=C2=A0
Fu=
rther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any mo=
re dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. 
=C2=A0
(7) Regarding Priya'=
s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an animal c=
an survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fellow whatev=
er he/she needs.
=C2=A0
An animal has a specific physical=C2=A0structure an=
d needs to maintain the same. But if trained they can 'adjust' to any kind =
of meals. I have seen people feeding vegeterian diets to dogs. Statisticall=
y speaking, an animal whose whole body structure is designed to be a carniv=
ore, may adjust to any food for the sake of survival, but will become inter=
nally weak and susceptable to disease and weaknesses. Who takes the karma f=
or the disease and weakness that may result from an unnatural diet to an an=
imal? 
=C2=A0
Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseas=
ed, but the chances increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cance=
r, but smoking makes one susceptible to cancer. It increases the probabilit=
y. Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it shou=
ld taken care of in the best way possible, providing it with whatever maybe=
 needed, including the right diet.
=C2=A0

=C2=

A question for you.
=C2=A0
Scientists studying evolution and human body=

has been prevelant since at least 4 million years. That, without a diet whi=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food w=
e eat

=C2=A0 

Namaste friends,

There has been a lot of discussion on foo=
d. A few quick comments.

(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemi=
cals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thu=
s, what we eat has a profound impact on us.

(2) Much has been written on t=
he material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. There are spi=
ritual and subtle reasons as well.

Eating the flesh or body parts of an an=
imal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a karma. Self-=
identification of plants with their physical body is much subtler and the k=
arma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.

Especially thes=
e days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by corporations and=
 animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their suffering go=
es to the ones benefiting from their meat.

(3) I heard an interview with a=
 scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. They conduct=
ed an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The ot=
her set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, researchers fo=
und a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were =
duller.

Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gori=
llas fed with nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the dev=
elopment of brain. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to h=
uman beings or not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one's i=
ntellectual development.

(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull o=
r sleepy and cannot focus well on work that requires alertness and skill. T=
hat is because the digestive process is using up a lot of energy (also know=
n as agni or fire) and there isn't much agni available for other activities=
 such as digestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarl=
y, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that can=
not happen well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fru=
itless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.

(5) If foo=
ds that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with =
more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more =
frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less=
 agni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and exper=
iences. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grain=
s, simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices=
, and fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is ava=
ilable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.

=
(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry gras=
s may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire ma=
y be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with =
excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire=
 may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gr=
ass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.=


One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on dige=
sting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may ea=
t saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation a=
nd yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action=
 for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other thing=
s being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.

(=
7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their ne=
eds. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the=
 poor fellow whatever he/she needs.

(8) One should eat to live and not liv=
e to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one =
can fulfil one's dharma in the material world using physical body and make =
spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.=


Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it i=
s better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important=
 for transformation and success, than occasional practices.

(9) By merely =
thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food to be god'=
s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how deeply in=
grained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally feel=
s 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. eatin=
g) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>There has been a lo=
t of discussion on food. A few quick comments.<BR><BR>(1) We are we we eat.=
 Production of various chemicals in our body and their interactions, are co=
ntrolled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.<BR>=
<BR>(2) Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. =
But that is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.<BR><BR=
>Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with =
the physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their=
 physical body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based=
 foods is much smaller.<BR><BR>Especially these days, very cruel methods ar=
e used for meat production by corporations and animals are treated very cru=
elly. Part of the karma for their suffering goes to the ones benefiting fro=
m their meat.<BR><BR>(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Nati=
onal Public Radio)
 several months back. They conducted an experiment on go=
rillas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The other set was fed with n=
uts, fruits etc. After several months, researchers found a gap in the intel=
ligence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were duller.<BR><BR>Their t=
heory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nu=
ts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brai=
n. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or n=
ot, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual deve=
lopment.<BR><BR>(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy a=
nd cannot focus well on work that requires alertness and skill. That is bec=
ause the digestive process is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni =
or fire) and there isn't much agni available for other activities such as d=
igestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digesti=
on of
 spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that cannot happe=
n well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless an=
d we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.<BR><BR>(5) If foods =
that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with mor=
e oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more fre=
quently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less ag=
ni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experien=
ces. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, =
simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, a=
nd fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is availa=
ble for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.<BR><=
BR>(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry g=
rass may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal
 fir=
e may be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person w=
ith excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal =
fire may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (we=
t grass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chak=
ras.<BR><BR>One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of ag=
ni on digesting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another per=
son may eat saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transf=
ormation and yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course=
 of action for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All o=
ther things being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual pr=
ogress.<BR><BR>(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasa=
nas and their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Oth=
erwise, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.<BR><BR>(8)
 One should =
eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to susta=
in oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharma in the material world using =
physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good=
 for spiritual sadhana.<BR><BR>Instead of overeating most of the time and f=
asting on specific days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular=
 practices are more important for transformation and success, than occasion=
al practices.<BR><BR>(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all act=
ions or considering food to be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma in=
volved. It depends on how deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply o=
ne feels so. If one internally feels 100% that god is acting through one an=
d whatever one is doing (e.g. eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one=
 is free.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>----------------------------=
