point 2 is ati sundar,

only Rama would have said such words. The leela of =
Bhagwan cannot be
understood with intellect and sadhana will only begin whe=
n questions end.

As rajneesh said, an intellect mind is always questioning=
, its basic nature
of existence lies in questions. If you answer one the ne=
xt question is ready
in the making. A fool is he happy and is in bliss, he =
has nothing to ask and
nothing to prove. Its difficult to shake his belief =
as he has surrendered on
the first step and then he sees his beloved standi=
ng there waiting for him.
The intellect mind will try to climb all the step=
s and analyze it one by one
and in doing so it cant see the beloved who was=
 standing there. For seekers
the journey is more important than the destina=
tion.
