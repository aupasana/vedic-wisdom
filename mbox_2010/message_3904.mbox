10 feet instead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find water'. But cont=
rary to that we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indee=

well. For instance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshippe=

oil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his disc=
iples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and d=
epth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja.=
 So were many great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they =
were all great advaitis and never saw any difference between any form of th=

the Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any form of God her=

Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in =
the first book of Aghora are as follows: 
> > 
> > 1. On the page 45 it say=
s that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with hi=
s own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this bizarre=
 behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, because in my opin=
ion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Since you have an e=
xcellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I hope to find an=
d answer here. 
> > 
> > 2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda equates chan=
ging the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitution, which I find =
as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so man=
y hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise of =
Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many gre=
at composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they w=
anted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of former and=
 krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form is the =
same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas that we=
 have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the love and =
awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subra=
manya, anjaneya and so on!
