Somehow this logic reminds me of the story of Maharshi Valmiki - his family=
 members would not partake sins coming from killing of innocent people as i=
t was his duty to provide for his family.
Maybe, not all believe in this st=
ory.
But maybe I'm biased strongly towards vegetarianism.

      Dear Hramali=
ngamji,

Regarding your statement "Ultimately you take any food Veg or Non =
veg But keep in mind that it is Bhagavans Prasad then it doesn't hurt"..

B=
ut as per Vimalananada in Aghora book, it is not safe to eat non veg unless=
 you know how to remove the curses of the animal who has died.

Question is=
 how many people know to remove that? By eating that animal won't the eater=
 become part of the team who killed that animal and share the curses too?

thanks
Manish

  Dear Dr Bhatla,

"Practically it is impossible to shift all the populatio=
n to vegetarian sources without triggering riots for food."

Nothing could =
be farther from the truth! This is about the most common argument used by p=
eople who want to justify eating animals.

For a very well researched and w=
ritten book on this subject, I would suggest reading Jonathan Safran Foer=
=E2=80=99s book, =E2=80=9CEating Animals=E2=80=9D 

Here is a link to it's =
website: http://www.eatinganimals.com/

BTW, this is not the first time thi=
s topic has come up for discussion on this listserv, so please feel free to=
 browse through the archives.

I do agree with your view about eating based=
 on your "goal in
 life".

sincerely,
Chandraprakash

      Hello,



I agree with Rajar=
shi Ji.



In total about 60% of world's total protein need is fulfilled by=
 non-vegetarian sources that too very cheap as compared to vegetarian sourc=
es. Practically it is impossible to shift all the population to vegetarian =
sources without triggering riots for food.



I believe that a person shoul=

more specifically, on his Goal in life.

      <p>Hello,<br>
<br>
I agree with Rajarshi Ji.<br>
<br>
I=
n total about 60% of world's total protein need is fulfilled by non-vegetar=
ian sources that too very cheap as compared to vegetarian sources. Practica=
lly it is impossible to shift all the population to vegetarian sources with=
out triggering riots for food.<br>
<br>
I believe that a person should choo=
se his dietary habits based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and more s=
pecifically, on his Goal in life.<br>
<br>
Regards<br>
Atul<br>
<br>
