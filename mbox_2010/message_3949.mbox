Dear Nagraj,
=C2=A0
Let me try to answer your queries.

1. While the storie=
s in these books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly b=
elieve that these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is eas=
y to reject them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it t=
hat these stories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should =
not be taken literally as real incidents?
=C2=A0
I definitely believe Vimal=
ananda existed and what is mentioned here are true. But it is a wrong point=
 of debate. Irrespective of whether Vimalananda existed or not, are the inf=
ormation mentioned in here related to sadhana, real or unreal? That you can=
 know, only, if you keep trying to do sadhana. Serious sadhana. I=C2=A0did =
my first homam after reading the first chapter of the second book in 2007. =
During that time I had no clue about this forum or the homam manuals. There=
 is a wealth of information in those books related to practical and serious=
 sadhana. To judge the reality of a book, one must attain a certain level. =
I have not attained any such level where I can pass any realistic comment o=
n a book like this, but I start with the presumption that this (the book)=
=C2=A0is true, and the more I do sadhana and cross check with the book, I f=
ind what it mentions is indeed true. 
=C2=A0
Manish, whom=C2=A0I consider a=
s my spiritual mentor, tells me that not only Vimalananda existed but he wa=
s a Rishi who lived his life incongnito. He neither wanted fame, not discip=
les nor anything else. He had a target audience in his mind when he asked S=
voboda to write that book. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0For instance, on the chapte=
r on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the real Gayatri Mantra=
 is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no one can really pronoun=
ce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the influence of Kali. =
At the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a mantra by doing jap=
am, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happens! How to reconcile=
 these two? 
=C2=A0
Not all mantras are Vedic mantras. There are lots of po=
uranik mantras as well. For vedic mantras, pronunciation, intonation etc ha=
ve to be perfect. That is not the case with non-vedic mantras. If you can c=
hant a vedic mantra perfectly and follow the rules of purushacharan, then I=
 am sure you will get the results.
=C2=A0
To be more specific, I have tried=
 in the past a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred thousan=
d times and was successful in finishing the ritual part (and I intend to do=
 a lot more with a lot more discipline), but with the real Gayatri Mantra b=
eing hidden and not in our knowledge, is any there any use in continuing in=
 this path? 

The savitur mantra is also very potent. Anything that comes f=
rom the Vedas are potent. There must be some reason why the real Gayatri is=
 hidden. Maybe most people of this age are unfit to chant and then digest t=
he effects of the real Gayatri. I feel, if you like the savitur mantra, kee=
p chanting it. It is also a great sadhana in itself.
=C2=A0
He warns that w=
ithout proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, bad things will happen, li=
ke the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaking his cel=
ibacy! 
=C2=A0
That is mainly when you do a sadhana with a sankalpa. If you=
 take a sankalpa, for example you say you will do X number of japas daily f=
or N number of days while maintaining celibacy=C2=A0etc etc, then=C2=A0make=
 sure you do not break it. In the specific example=C2=A0in the book, Vimala=
nda had himself given a special Ganesha mantra to the person and mentioned =
the restrictoins to be followed. If one feels, one cannot live upto a sanka=
lpa, then why even take one. Just keep doing japa/homam/puja with devotion =
and leave the rest to the deity. =C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Specially, I have been=
 told, if you are doing a sadhana of a Ugra devata, and you take a sankalpa=
=C2=A0for specific number of days=C2=A0and then do not honour it, you may f=
ace some very, very=C2=A0severe consequences. Instead, just do sadhana for =
the love of the deity.

Namaste everyone,

I am reading these books=
 with a lot of interest and almost completed the first two. They need a lot=
 more iterations though since I don't seem to grasp everything that they of=
fer. Anyway, some of the questions that I have at this point are as follows=
.

1. While the stories in these books are quite interesting, how many of u=
s in the group truly believe that these are real incidents that have actual=
ly happened? It is easy to reject them as a figment of imagination by Rober=
t Svobodha. Or is it that these stories are supposed have some inner/esoter=
ic meaning and should not be taken literally as real incidents?

2. While t=
here is a wealth of information in the second book, and co-incides a lot wi=
th Bhagavatham, there are quite a few places that left me quite confused to=
o. Maybe with the help of others from the group, I hope to get a better per=
spective. For instance, on the chapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vim=
alananda says the real Gayatri Mantra is hidden and no one knows. And accor=
ding to him no one can really pronounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these t=
imes owing to the influence of Kali. At the same time he goes on narrating =
how to practise a mantra by doing japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so =
that siddhi happens! How to reconcile these two? To be more specific, I hav=
e tried in the past a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred =
thousand times and was successful in finishing the ritual part (and I inten=
d to do a lot more with a lot more discipline), but with the real Gayatri M=
antra being hidden and not in our knowledge, is any there
 any use in conti=
nuing in this path? 

3. Since perfect pronounciation is impossible, he rec=
ommends that mantra sadhana should be done mentally, with not even tongue m=
oving. I find this very difficult to practise. At least for me, mind wander=
s in a crazy fashion if Mantra sadhana is practised silently. In fact, it w=
anders so much that I start with Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the=
 middle of japa, I realize that my mind is elsewhere and try to come back t=
o the japam. What is shocking to me is that at that time my mind is constan=
tly repeating Savitru Gayatri Mantra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. =
And the rosary keeps moving regardless, so the counts are lost........ .

4=
. He warns that without proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, bad thing=
s will happen, like the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of=
 breaking his celibacy! This kind of examples could potentially scare many =
people from taking to any sadhana at all, in the lack of a proper Guru! And=
 for a proper guru, one must keep doing sadhana.... how?
