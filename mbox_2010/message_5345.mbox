Dear Hramalingamji,

Regarding your statement "Ultimately you take any food=
 Veg or Non veg But keep 
in mind that it is Bhagavans Prasad then it doesn=
't hurt"..

But as per Vimalananada in Aghora book, it is not safe to eat n=
on veg unless you 
know how to remove the curses of the animal who has died=
.

Question is how many people know to remove that? By eating that animal w=
on't the 
eater become part of the team who killed that animal and share th=
e curses too?

thanks
Manish

Dear Dr Bhatla,

"Practically it is impossible to shift all the p=
opulation to vegetarian sources 
without triggering riots for food."

Nothi=
ng could be farther from the truth! This is about the most common argument =

used by people who want to justify eating animals.

For a very well resear=
ched and written book on this subject, I would suggest 
reading Jonathan Sa=
fran Foer=E2=80=99s book, =E2=80=9CEating Animals=E2=80=9D 


Here is a lin=
k to it's website: http://www.eatinganimals.com/

BTW, this is not the firs=
t time this topic has come up for discussion on this 
listserv, so please f=
eel free to browse through the archives.

I do agree with your view about e=
ating based on your "goal in  life".

sincerely,
Chandraprakash

Hello,

I agree with=
 Rajarshi Ji.

In total about 60% of world's total protein need is fulfille=
d by non-vegetarian 
sources that too very cheap as compared to vegetarian =
sources. Practically it is 
impossible to shift all the population to veget=
arian sources without triggering 
riots for food.

I believe that a person =
should choose his dietary habits based on his varna 
(aptitude and attitude=
) and more specifically, on his Goal in life.

Regards
Atul
