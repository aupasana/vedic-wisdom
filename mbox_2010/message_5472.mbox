Namaste Sriram:

I don't have many things to say to you. I am sure what you=
 going through is
just a phase. It will pass. Don't panic. Just try to acce=
pt what IS and
surrender to it totally. Most of the problem arises due to t=
he resistance to
what IS.

You will be in my prayers. Much love to you.

Re=
gards,

Hemanth
PS: I remember you previously emailed asking for your Ista =
Devata in this
forum. Why don't you approach PVRji with your questions and =
birth details
through vedic astrology Yahoo group, where currently he is an=
swering
questions using Sri Surya Siddantha calculations.

      <p>Respected Sri Ji,<br>
=
<br>
Respected Vemparla Ram Kishore has answered your queries well. I am no=
t as able enough to add anything new. But I will like to add my two cents h=
ere. Please ignore if you think they are not worth considering.<br>
<br>
Si=
r, All atheists are not prosperous and all spiritual persons do not lead mi=
serable life.<br>
<br>
It is all matter of our past Karma which are yieldin=
g fruits to us. Our Deities or Guru, no doubt, test us from time to time. T=
hese tests are very much needed to ensure that we are learning well and to =
mark an "achieved" point. These tests serve many purpose. failing=
 these tests tell us what our short comings are and what we need to improve=
 and passing these tests give us confidence and open up next step of challe=
nges for us. And many more purposes. More than we can actually think or ima=
gine.<br>


<br>
But, I believe, that these tests are not put to us like we=
 think. These tests can manifest in many many different forms. I think it i=
s not your problems which are your 'test paper'. But the thought &q=
uot;Is spirituality a correct path?" instilled in your mind. You are e=
xperiencing problems as per your Karma-Fruit account. But the thought in yo=
ur mind has been put as a test paper. To check what is the strength of your=
 faith. Nothing remains for ever. Neither good times nor bad times. We shou=
ld be balanced minded in all the times. These bad times will check your thi=
s aspect also.<br>


<br>
Deities usually do not give us new problems to fa=
ce. They just speed up the process of experiencing Karma. and sometimes re-=
arrange the order in which fruits are experienced.<br>
<br>
Just keep faith=
 and face the bad times with a deep faith on your deity. And Believe me tha=
t you will cross these bad times and will succeed.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I hurt=
<br>
regards<br>
Atul<br>
