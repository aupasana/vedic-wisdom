Narasimha,

 

Thank you for your explanation.  It was very clear.

om: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com [mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com] On B=
ehalf Of Narasimha PVR Rao

Prayer for the Dead

 

  

Namaste Davyd,

Rebirth is not necessarily inst=
antaneous. A variable amount of time may pass before rebirth.

Some people =
are so attached to the old body and old desires. Someone whose self-conscio=
usness simply cannot accept that the body is gone and is still attached to =
body and its mind may remain as a pitri that needs to be freed from the blo=
cking desires to be reborn. They may be stuck for a long time before being =
reborn.

Some people are attached to the desires, but they realize that the=
y need a new body and accept the loss of old body. They will be reborn to p=
ursue to desires. However, one needs to find the right place and right peop=
le (father, mother etc) with appropriate kaarmik debts, before being reborn=
. That may take a short time in some cases and a long time in some cases.

=
Some people with good karmas are not attached to the old body or its desire=
s, but they are reborn to fulfill the Will of Nature and enact god's lila. =
Such beings can afford to wait for the right time to be born again in a new=
 body. They may wait for tens or hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands=
 of years before being reborn.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a great saint and =
guru of Swami Vivekananda, said that he would be reborn on earth after abou=
t 100 years along with everybody else who came with him. Of course, one sho=
uld not think that he was in pitri loka as a pitri. Pitri loka is for being=
s with a strong self-identification with the sensory mind. Ramakrishna and =
his team probably ascended to one of the higher realm of consciousness afte=
r leaving those bodies and would be born again when the right opportunity p=
resents itself.

The exact gap before rebirth, in what realm of consciousne=
ss one's self-consciousness resides during the gap and what one's conscious=
ness does during that gap, is a function of one's own conditioning and karm=
as.

Best regards,
Narasimha
