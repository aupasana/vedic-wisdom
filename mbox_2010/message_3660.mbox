Dear All,
=C2=A0
I want to add=C2=A0some points=C2=A0from=C2=A0little=C2=A0=
=C2=A0experience that I have.
=C2=A0
1. Do not eat meat if you have dasa ru=
nning of a satvik planet. Your body will not accept it.
2. A person who kno=
ws ayurveda here checked my hand pulse and told me to become satvik and sto=
p eating meat if I was eating ( I=C2=A0stopped eating meat 2 years back bef=
ore this incident)
3. From the time I stopped eating meat, I feel light in =
my body and brain/mind and I am able to concentrate more.
=C2=A0
Hope this =
helps
=C2=A0
Manish

Respected Sir,

I am just illiterate in this =
subject. Although I will like to express my thoughts. Please forgive me for=
 my mistakes.

Besides the Law of Karma, another fact associated with Meat =
eating is that meat is a "tamsik" food. People who follow Satvik path for s=
piritual evolution should avoid eating rajsik and tamsik food.

Another thi=
ng told in Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta is that the aim and state of mind behind t=
he karma decides that the Karma will be counted as Satvik, Rajsik or tamsik=
 and hence will decide the outcome of karma. If a homam/karma/ ritual/work =
is done without selfishness/ greed/want then that will be counted as satvik=
. If same homam/karma/ ritual/work is done with greed/want/ahamkar then it =
will be counted as rajsik. and if same homam/karma/ ritual/work is done due=
 to ignorance and agyana then it is counted as tamsik.

Same karma done wit=
h same procedure but different mindset will give different results.

please=
 forgive me if I sound rude

Kind Regards
Atul

 are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realizati=
on. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their ind=
ividual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short th=
ey *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our=
 topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or c=
hew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. Ther=
e would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs=
 because as I said, they know complete background behind their each action =
and

to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from ot=
hers. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume =
anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat a=
nything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food=
 intake is extremely important.
> > > If Vivekananda ate meat during his st=
ay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for=
 majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. H=
e might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so =
that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradi=
cate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is a=
lso possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanuban=
dha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would =
have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by consuming its me=
at. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a n=
atural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and =
Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a l=
ake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to US=
A. When the boy, after
 some

first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he =

and not try to do what he does.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > Now wh=
atever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Le=
t me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unreali=
zed person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example case=
s of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowl=
edged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they
 are all realized souls=
 who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of =
everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectl=
y and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are=
 doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I=
 would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed a=
nimals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a spe=
cific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, the=
y know complete background behind their each action and<BR>> > > m=
oreover their self identification is missing from the action and hence it i=
s like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without=
 binding them in any cause-effect chain.<BR>> > > Ramakrishna used=
 to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from o=
thers. He has a blazing spiritual fire
 burning within him which can consum=
e anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat=
 anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of fo=
od intake is extremely important.<BR>> > > If Vivekananda ate meat=
 during his stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is no=
t possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of=
 that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst =
westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowl=
y try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable h=
abits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some bala=
nced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible =
that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by co=
nsuming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons for tha=
t but just a natural
 inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda=
, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from =
drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even plan=
ned to go to USA. When the boy, after some<BR>> > > years actually=
 met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay aw=
ay from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, sw=
ami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru =
will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later beca=
me disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually giv=
