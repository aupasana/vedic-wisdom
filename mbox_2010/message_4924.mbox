Namaste friends,
 
Thanks to Ravi Poruri, we now have the Sanskrit, English, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil or Malayalam versions of all homam manuals (Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Sri Krishna homam, Shiva homam, Vishnu homam, Sri Mahalakshmi homam, Hanuman homam, Kaala Bhairava homam, Shani homam and Kuja homam).
 
As Baraha software now supports Vedic intonation marks in Tamil too, we have Tamil versions of all the manuals available. Earlier some manuals were available only in Sanskrit and English, but now vernacular versions of all manuals are prepared.
 
Please note that only mantras are given in different scripts and the rest of the text and instructions are only in English in all language manuals. If any of you want to take initiative and translate any of the manuals into one of these languages completely, you are welcome to do so. If so, please share your work with us if you can!
 
The goal is to make it very easy for interested people of current and future generations to benefit from the sadhana of rishis, i.e. homam, make spiritual progress and increase dharma in the world.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
