Namaste,

> I notice this discussion has been mostly among men...

Because =
women may not feel comfortable participating in such discussions it seems. =
it needs to be understood that whatever is discussed on the topic of Brahma=
charya, equally applies to Female Saadhakas also IMHO.

offcourse, for marr=
ied people, its much more difficult and tricky becasue they have responsibi=
lities towards their wives/husbands and consent of legitimate partner is of=
 utmost important.

> forcible repression can have the opposite effet--flar=
ing up of strong sexual urges...

True! however Sex impulse is such a force=
 which needs vey very strong will as well as persistent efforts. Suspension=
 (which is not forcible repression) is one important key. if people do not =
start to think about it and start exercising the opposite will to that migh=
ty force, births after births will go wasted, especially for those who care=
 for higher purpose of life.

Regards,

Utpal
