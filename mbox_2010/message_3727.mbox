NAMASKAR

Dear Gurujis,

I have started MAHAGANAPATI HOMAM, though started =
with super-short procedure, now I am including more rituals and sanskrit ve=
rse from the short procedure eventually...

Now I am asking some bare minim=
um questions...

1. What is the sign that my Ganapati Homam are successful =
or not?

2. Is it possible to include more verse for prosperity and peace? =
(as my family life in trouble) if yes, please suggest.

best regards,
Biswa=
jit
