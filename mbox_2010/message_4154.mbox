 5-1-46 Afternoon

A visitor asked Bhagavan, =E2=80=9CPriests prescribe var=
ious rituals and pujas and
people are told that unless they properly observ=
e these with fasts, feasts,
etc., sin will accrue, and so on. Is there any =
necessity to observe such
rituals and ceremonial worship?=E2=80=9D

Bhagava=
n: Yes. All such worship is also necessary. It may not be necessary
for you=
. But that does not mean it is necessary for nobody and is no good at
all. =
What is necessary for the infant class pupil is not necessary for the
gradu=
ate. But even the graduate has to make use of the very alphabet he
learnt i=
n the infant class.He knows the full use and significance of the
alphabet n=
ow.

The same visitor asked, =E2=80=9CI do Omkara puja. I say =E2=80=98Om R=
am=E2=80=99. Is that good?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: Yes. Any puja is good. =E2=
=80=98Om Ram=E2=80=99 or any other name will do. The
point is to keep away =
all other thoughts except the one thought of Om or Ram
or God. All mantra o=
r japa helps that. He who does the japa of Ram, for
example,becomes Rama-ma=
ya.The worshipper becomes in course of time the
worshipped. It is only then=
 that he will know the full meaning of the Omkar
which he was repeating.
