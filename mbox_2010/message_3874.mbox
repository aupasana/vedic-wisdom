Dear Nagraj:

If you feel the need for alcohol to enhance your music, somet=
hing is wrong. 

Try "The Artists' Way" by Julia Cameron. You will give up =
alcohol and become more creative if you actually practice the principles of=
 the book. And in this way you will become more deeply spiritual, as a crea=
tor. 

Regards, 

Jacques

      Namaste Narasimharaogaru, 
=C2=A0
Again a brilliant reply t=
hat clarified many questions. Now coming to Sadhana on just one form of Alm=
ighty, I have a tough time choosing who. I love=C2=A0Mata Parvati=C2=A0as M=
other, Shiva as Father, Gananatha and Karthikeya as my own siblings. I have=
 such love for the family that I don't start my day without praying to all =
the four! Daily I do abhishekham for a small Spatika Lingam, in which I see=
 both Shiva and Parvathi, I do ganapathi mantra japam everyday and I recite=
 Subramanya Karavalamba stotram. When I don't do it, it is not=C2=A0a day f=
or me. ('Deva Devuni Chintinchu dinamu dinamu...... .' !) And I get tears w=
hen I listen to Bhagavatam or Thyagaraja/Dikshita r/Annamayya=C2=A0et al...=
=C2=A0Krithis. In spite of having won some recognition in my small communit=
y as a musician/vidwan, releasing a CD playing my chosen instrument Veena, =
I cannot even sing some compositons some times because of the overwhelming =
emotion. And those are some songs on
 Shiva, Parvati, Rama and Krishna. 
=
=C2=A0
But if I have to narrow down to one name, I don't know how and how t=
o leave any one form! Anyway, that apart, I did Gayatri Sadhana for sometim=
e now and want to continue someday in the method you/Manishji suggested, li=
ke the hundred day diksha! I don't know when the time will come for that! I=
 don't know if it is good to announce the mantra that I practise, contrary =
to Sri Vimalananda' s advice, but again.. oh well!...

In the meanwh=

y=C2=A0are=C2=A0continuing, by God's grace! But then they are eating into m=
y music practise time! Again, the=C2=A0positive side is, when I practise th=
ese days, the practise is so much more rewarding... .......! I cannot expre=
ss it well here........ .....

BTW, Since this group is such an under=

confess something here. I have a weakness for alcoholic drinks, that I take=
 almost every weekend, because of the kind of company I have here.=C2=A0Alt=
hough over-indulgence in that sometimes weakens my resolve to do any kind o=
f Sadhanas,=C2=A0my normal weekend poojas/daily poojas/music practise=C2=A0=

is is such a shame=C2=A0tand=C2=A0opposite to what all our philosophers/ gu=

I want an advice from the group=C2=

If one goes in the path of a tornado, =
aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it=
.

If the question is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthqu=
akes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natu=
ral order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an "order"=
. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of your a=
ctions, as determined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be doi=
ng what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him.=
 If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of which he is placed th=
ere at that time.

In the case of the priest in the story, his mistake is t=
hat he
 slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the=
 bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the worship, he should've =
given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather tha=
n assuming it was a fool.

See, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Triling=
a Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanat=
ha himself. However, others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body wi=
th some body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the =
benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of externa=
l parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.

Hitting a person who st=
ill has a limited self-identification is one thing and hitting a person who=
 has no limited self-identification and identifies with the entire universe=
 or with a deity is different.

* * *

In any case, do not worry about that=
 priest that much. For all you know, he may be an
 associate of Shiva who c=
ame along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may=
 have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important r=
ole in an interesting divine drama.

* * *

Jeevanmuktas may engage in acti=
ons that are difficult to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and a=
genda. They become instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The =
action of Trilinga Swami may help several people question, challenge and ov=
ercome their biases and learn some important lessons, centuries after he le=
ft earth.

* * *

Regarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and sai=
nts sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at =
a specific set of people.

There is nothing wrong in having many deities in=
 pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik live=
s. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachin=
gs may be
 addressed at some other people to come in the coming years who h=
e has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and d=
o some work. There is an intended audience for every work and no work can b=
e perfect for all audience.

If the goal is either liberation or a deity's =
darshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on o=
ne deity is the best thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten d=
eities and keep switching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are fil=
led with that deity's name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away fr=
om the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to striv=
e for vision/company of deities. He probably thought some people he has a r=
ina with would come to earth with such a potential.

* * *

Thyagaraja did =
compose songs on many deities. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spen=
t several years chanting Rama's name and had a darshan. Then
 he composed s=
ongs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as different emanations f=
rom Rama. He saw Rama in all.

Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deeksh=
itar, Bammera Pothana and others.

When one achieves perfection in surrende=
r to one deity, one's life is made. After that, one will see the same deity=
 in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If one is switching betwee=
n ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with t=
houghts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deities as different objec=
ts and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may le=
ad a fruitful dhaarmik life. That's fine.

But, if you really want to taste=
 the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill =
the mind with his/her thoughts.

Though I=
 had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not a realized person. I =
too am a normal person with an immature mind. But my guru blessed me that I=
 will be able to give excellent replies to spiritual questions if I think o=
f him and then write what comes to my mind. That is what I have been doing.=
 I am an instrument being used by my guru.

Where is the difference between any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was n=
