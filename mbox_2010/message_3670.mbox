Ravi,

In case you record the chandi homam, you can consider hosting on fil=
e hosting sites (like http://www.zshare.net/ - which is free).
zshare will =
allow files upto 2 GB to be uploaded. Two minor problems with zshare would =
be:
1. The URL for the file will not be readable, and hence we will have to=
 give a link in this group Links
2. If the file is not downloaded for 60 da=
ys, zshare will remove it. In that case, some of us who have downloaded wil=
l have to upload the same again.

Best regards,
Vijay

Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we=
 tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high lev=
el of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things i=
n the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to u=
niversal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal g=
nyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate=
 meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew =
what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each a=
nd every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background =
behind their each action and

ng from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to acc=

 Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very=
 different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him =
which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind=
 him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for othe=
rs, a kind of food intake is extremely important.
> If Vivekananda ate meat=
 during his stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which is no=
t possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of=
 that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amongst =
westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowl=
y try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable h=
abits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some bala=
nced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also possible =
that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul by co=
nsuming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons for tha=
t but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekananda,=
 His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from d=
rowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even plann=

and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of P=
