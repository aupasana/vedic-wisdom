 "As for myself, my body is weak
and shakes while walking; my mind
has grow=
n very dull; the Vedic Mantras
I have forgotten; old age has overtaken
me; =
and my eyes are dim. Though learned,
I remain ignorant. O Sad-Guru Ramana,
=
Save me!

Wantonly inflated by the pride of being
the lord of all the sense=
s, the mind does
not see its true Lord seated in the heart.
Till now, looki=
ng on life as the ultimate,
I have not achieved the Goal. Ah! when
Sad-Guru=
 Ramana, shall I realize the Self?

In the world what was pleasing always
p=
erished. But the miserable mind always
runs after sense-pleasures only.
O R=
amana Bhagavan, I have not yet
realized the Supreme Brahman adored
by the f=
ortunate. This life is lived in vain.
Alas! What greater misfortune can the=
re be?"

"The Saints are the sustainers of society.
Philo remarks: 'Househo=
lds, cities, countries
and nations have enjoyed great happiness,
when a sin=
gle individual has taken heed of
the good and the beautiful. Such men not
o=
nly liberate themselves; they fill those they
meet with a free mind.' "

"T=
he true sages possess the inner joy and
peace which are independent of oute=
r circumstances.
Their happiness is not dependent on outer things.
They hav=
e passed beyond the forms of social life.
They work for the fulfillment of =
the Divine in the
world, for the good of all beings, for the fulfillment
of=
 the Purpose. They are one in action and consciousness
with the Divine."

"=
Sri Ramana adopts the metaphysical
position of Advaita Vedanta. He speaks
t=
o us of the Divine.....
When one discovers the Divine within
oneself, one m=
ust discover it also in the
outer world of men and things. While the
height=
s within are revealed...the process
of seeing all in the fullness of the Di=
vine
is more arduous.
God is both eternal silence and perpetual
activity, t=
he unmoved witness and the
ground of all that is, the metaphysical
Absolute=
 and the personal Lord. The
Divine reveals itself anew in all life and
exis=
tence.....
Sri Ramana dwells not only in a world
of pure subjectivity but h=
as also a sense
of the Infinite that is within all.....
Like all saints, he=
 has the foundation in God."

"The Maharshi is above the spirit of the time=
.
Long after the spirit of the time will have been
succeeded by the spirit =
of another Age,
Sri Ramana will be remembered as an Immortal."

"After havi=
ng studied the lives and ways of
teaching of Saints and Sages of the world,=

belonging to various traditions and periods
of time;
It strikes one that S=
ri Ramana falls into a class of his own..."

"Sri Ramana declares that life=
 is full of latent
happiness.....because the Divine heritage is
ever there,=
 waiting to be received, God-Reality
is ever present within the heart of al=
l.....
the dawn of Self-realization is not a new creation,
but the remember=
ing of a lost state of consciousness.
It is an entering into the ancient he=
ritage."

"Sri Ramana is a true son of the Indian earth.
He is genuine and,=
 in addition to that, something
quite phenomenal. In India he is the whites=
t spot
in a white space.

What we find in the life and teachings of Sri Ram=
ana
is the purest of India; with its breath of world-liberated
and liberati=
ng humanity, it is a chant of milleniums.....

The identification of the Se=
lf with God will strike the
European as shocking. It is a specifically orie=
ntal
Realization, as expressed in Sri Ramana's utterances.
Psychology canno=
t contribute anything further to it,
except the remark that it lies far bey=
ond its scope to propose
such a thing. However, it is clear to the Indian t=
hat the
Self as spiritual Source is not different from God;
and in so far a=
s man abides in his Self, he is not
only contained in God but is God Himsel=
f.
Sri Ramana is quite clear in this respect."

"I bow to the Lotus-feet of=
 Sage Sri Ramana,
the great Teacher, Who revealed to me the Lord
Supreme in=
 His glory transcending darkness."
