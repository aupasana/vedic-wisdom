Respected Gurujan

A few questions on the Chandi - Paath

1) In the 5th cha=
pter of Chandi-Paath, what is the esoteric significance
of Ambika emerging =
out of Parvati and then Parvati turning black in skin
color afterwards?  Al=
so, the significance of the names Kaushiki and
Kalika

2) The significance =
of 5 salutations to the goddess during the Stuti in
the 5th chapter (namast=
asyai, namastasyai, namastasyai namo namah) - is
that related to the purifi=
cation of the 5 elements or senses ?

3) In the 11th chapter 2nd shloka, wh=
at is the esoteric significance of
the Devas worshipping the Goddess with A=
gni Deva in front?  Does that
elude to homam in a gross sense and the pavak=
a nature of the fire - ie
the Goddess can only be approached by the purest =
of all beings?

4) The esoteric significance of some of the additional demo=
ns listed in
Chapter 11th, namely

a) Vaiprachitta Demon to be countered by=
 Raktadantika
b) Goddess manifesting as Ayonija,  Shatakshi and Shakambhari=
 to counter
lack of rain for 100 years
c) Aruna Demon to be defeated by god=
dess as countless Bhrahmri
