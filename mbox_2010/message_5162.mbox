Dear Narasimha Garu, namaste & pranaams

If you permit me to share a few rambling thoughts on below lines:

"Some inquisitive and spirited young people who were thirsty for spiritual
knowledge and spiritual progress, but not knowing how to do any sadhana,
including how to even light a lamp, are now doing daily Chandi homam (or
some other homam) by themselves."
Manish Pandit in UK (Europe)
Narasimha Rao in USA (North America)
Satyaprakash Choudhary in Australia
Hundreds if not thousands of yogis in the cradle of Asia: India

It seems to me that the divine Mother is creating an army of sadhakas across
the world! Who can fathom her inscrutable mysteries?

One more coincidence: the gentleman who showed me how to do the Devi
Mahatmyam parayana was named Satya Prakash....

best regards
Hari
