Narasimha Ji

Thank you for responding with a succint and clear answer. How=
ever one last question lingers in my mind...

If a person truly does an act=
 without an sense of emotion attached or I ness as mentioned by you and doe=
s not create any fresh karma ..

This also explains to me the actions of th=
e Great Trailing Swami who performs a puja to Kashi Vishweswara with his ow=
n offal as mentioned in book1 and yet Shiva does not punish him. Also the g=
reat Gajanan maharaj's actions on similar lines which I read from Pandit ji=
's website.

In the case of an solider on the battlefield this above theory=
 clarifies a lot because the soldier is only performing his duty and there =
is a good chance in certain cases he will act emotionlessly...Eg: He sees a=
 wounded enemy ...if given an order he will still go for the kill and do hi=
s predetermined dharma.Seen from an outsiders moral tinted lens all the abo=
ve actions will seem wrong...

Now if the needle is flipped to the other ex=
treme...If an killer does an murder cold bloodedly without emotion....say a=
s an contract killing and years of killing has hardened his nerves and he n=
o longer feels emotions..he is simply doing it as an job...

Would this mea=
n he is also not incurring karma ...


Please forgive my repeated childish =
questions, just trying to clarify some things for my understanding thats al=
l.

Pranams
