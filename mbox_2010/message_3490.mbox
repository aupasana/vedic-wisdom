Many will judge differently but i am sure Manish is an incarnation of a div=
ine soul.If you ask me why i cant say anything it is that i just feel it an=
d its a strong feeling.i have looked at his picture in his site, just have =
a look at those eyes-spellbinding(it surely has some deep message hiding in=
 it)We would be at great loss if we dont take this oppurtunity.May Lord Shi=
va and divine mother give me just one chance in this life to see this divin=
e "man of god".
Manish bhai sata koti pranaam apka charan me.
