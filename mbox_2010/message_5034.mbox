Namaste PVRji and other Members:

I need your suggestion as to if one can lend the Havan Kund to a friend ?

One of my friend is in great stress as his family (wife and a one year old
kid) has been kept away from him by police after an unfortunate incident.
The astrologer we contacted, said that He is running Sani Mahadasa now and
suggested to do Sudarshana Homam among other remedies.

Since He knew that I do Ganpathi Homam, He has asked me to guide him through
the Homam and to do it at my place (He is staying in a guest house now). I
want to know, if I can lend all the havan materials to him, and just guide
him through the process.

I checked the Homam website, there is no Sudarshana Homam manual available.
 I was thinking to ask him to do Sani Homam instead ? is that ok?

Please suggest what should I do.

Regards,
Hemanth
